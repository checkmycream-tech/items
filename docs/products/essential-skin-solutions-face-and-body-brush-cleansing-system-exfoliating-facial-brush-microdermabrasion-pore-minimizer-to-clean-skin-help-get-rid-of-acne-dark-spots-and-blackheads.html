            <li>I found this one and it had good reviews and a good price.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product for the money.</li>
            <li>Lets just say that the product its good</li>

            <li>Good quality product and could see a difference after one day of use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the clarisonic brush and this does just as good of a job.</li>
            <li>The brushes for the face are wonderful and makes your face feel so clean and are not abrasive like others I used.</li>
            <li>The product itself is waterproof which is always a lovely bonus, but what I am most impressed with is the fact that this is not just for your face</li>

            <li>Nice buffing for your body.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>Love it, works great and has so many uses</li>
            <li>This is a nice cleaning system for your skin.</li>
            <li>This looked nice and well packaged</li>
            <li>Nice brushes.</li>
            <li>helped my son with his acne,his face cleared up nicely.</li>
            <li>I looked around Amazon, and this system gave the most options for the price and received good reviews.  </li>
            <li>My leg hairs sometimes try to grow length wise under the top of my skin</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>The body attachment is also nice.</li>
            <li>but I just didn&#x27;t want to spend that kind of money (around $100).  </li>
            <li>Sample purchased at a reduced rate in exchange for evaluation and my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li>but I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pay that kind of money.</li>
            <li>My skin is much softer and feel great after a week of using this!</li>
            <li>I refuse to pay $150 for the popular cleansing brush that doesn&#x27;t even rotate like this one.</li>
            <li>and it was really nice.  </li>
            <li>But it is nice to have in case I need to use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it is nice to have in case I need to use it.&lt;br</li>

            <li>and it would be nice if the brushes were labeled.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really nice cleansing brush set</li>
            <li>So excited!!</li>
            <li>It makes your body super smooth and flawless.</li>
            <li>My skin is bright and clean, very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>But still a great product certain for what you get for your money!!</li>
            <li>so most scrubs or anything abrasive does more damage than good.</li>
            <li>After reading all the good reviews on the Essential Skin Solutions Perfect Skin Bushing System, I decided to buy it and give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Love this gentle brush for my face and the body brush is perfect!</li>
            <li>one is great and having tremendous qualities.</li>
            <li>All in all, super happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Still, gets an easy 5 stars because how good it feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>After he used it the first time, he told me it was too good to keep to himself, so we&#x27;re sharing it now!</li>
            <li>I do wish it had more than one speed option, but otherwise i love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all items and I&#x27;m very happy thus far.</li>
            <li>I love this product the brushes feel amazing.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best brushing system that I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>The sensitive skin brush is wonderful around your eye area.</li>
            <li>I love the design and the handy box</li>
            <li>I found it to be more effective manually than with this system when using products with a grainy, drier consistency.</li>
            <li>I was honestly nervous about buying this brush because the price was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>I just moved and just now able to use my wonderful Skin Cleansing  WOW!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and works great, my face has never felt so clean!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the money, but if you are expecting clarisonic or a very popular quality of microdermabrasion, it may not be for you.</li>
            <li>I was so excited for it after reading all of the good reviews.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great, just wish the body brush was a bit more powerful.</li>
            <li>Exfoliation is the best way to healthy soft radiant skin.</li>
            <li>love the way it is presented in a nice box to be able to storte everything.</li>
            <li>My first use and I am very pleased already!</li>
            <li>love love love love love love love, my face felt amazing after one use!</li>
            <li>Great product,  fast delivery !</li>
            <li>it seemed too good to be true...</li>
            <li>I can say that it&#x27;s very easy to use, the most challenging part was getting the battery door opened.  </li>
            <li>Yet another very important thing: when exfoliating (as I mentioned already it is a damage for your skin) mind the weather.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for the price my face feels so fresh and clean after every use I would recommend this product to everyone !</li>
            <li>Super good quality-</li>
            <li>There is a nice variety of brushes and easy instructions for use.</li>
            <li>The company that sells this is so nice and easy to talk to.</li>
            <li>Best seller and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Very important to make sure you&#x27;re cleaning the brushes after every use to prevent acne causing bacteria from building up.</li>

            <li>and I love the attachments.</li>
            <li>I was so happy I was able to find this much, much cheaper dupe.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a lot more lighter, or they seem to be shrinking.</li>
            <li>An excellent exfoliator and overall skin cleansing device.</li>
            <li>but I want to use this daily and the softer brush is perfect for that.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I currently own a Clarisonic Mia and I enjoy using it</li>
            <li>but I have to say that the feel of the ESS is slightly better.</li>
            <li>pumice stone is one of my favorite features.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Those are one of my reasons of liking this soo much and it does a great job at prepping your skin for moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what the hype was about these skin cleansing systems, but I do now that I have this unit.</li>
            <li>It looks brighter, healthier and more radiant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the middle of winter here in ohio and my skin, face and body, looks incredible!</li>
            <li>I love it</li>

            <li>Overall, a great purchase!</li>
            <li>This works very well on all the attachments and power is great.</li>
            <li>I bought this face &amp;amp; body brush system because my more expesive one broke.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.</li>

            <li>I love the way they feel and the way they leave my skin feeling.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>The Neutrogena dermabrasion works better for me.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with this product especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid more than $200 for sets like this</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I would love to give this 5 giant stars because it was AWESOME!</li>
            <li>My favorite is the body brush</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fantastic!  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve been using the softer one with more bristles as my face cleanser brush in the shower.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just a matter of time before I get to</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s FANTASTIC!  </li>
            <li>found that my lotions and face creams seemed to feel better on my skin after using, &amp; the skin stayed hydrated for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li>My face is smoother, and makeup goes on better.</li>
            <li>I love this brush set</li>
            <li>This is what I wanted,  and I love it.</li>

            <li>I love all the attachments for body, face and feet.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love the way my skin looks after.</li>
            <li>Works much better than just using your hands to wash your face.</li>
            <li>I have it in my shower and love it.</li>
            <li>My skin feels much better now.</li>
            <li>I have used both face brushes for about a week and am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I was given a cheap one for Christmas that I really liked before it broke.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t believe how much &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; it did, lol.</li>
            <li>Buying a couple more for gifts throughout the year instead of the $90 ones.</li>
            <li>This was the best priced of all the similar items on Amazon, and I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>My skin already looks better after just two weeks of use.</li>
            <li>I wish it had more speeds</li>
            <li>only I bought in the store and is an excellent replacement.</li>

            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at what a great deal this set was.  </li>
            <li>But this did pretty darn good, and it didn&#x27;t have any problems with a light shower.  </li>

            <li>The face brush was the perfect texture and the brush rotated a an ideal speed, not to fast or slow.</li>

            <li>My set lasted 3 months and the reviews pertaining to great customer service aren&#x27;t accurate in my situation as I reached out to them over 2 weeks ago via email wanting a new set or a discount.</li>
            <li>I have a fringe, so keeping my forehead clean is very important.  </li>

            <li>Its sturdy, easy to keep everything in.  </li>
            <li>Great kit with quality brushes at a good price (1 brush for sensitive, 1 large body, and one regular) plus exfoliating pumice that is very effective on calluses.  </li>

            <li>This exfoliator makes my whole body feel nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t fit securely so any bit of pressure breaks the plastic.</li>
            <li>It needs to lock on securely</li>
            <li>but I find this much more useful.</li>
            <li>but overall I have been really happy with my purchase.</li>

            <li>Hello and Welcome to My Review of the Essential Skin Solution;</li>
            <li>Nice product and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I can use my own face wash which I really like.  </li>
            <li>Just received it and it works fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I use this everyday with great results!!!</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>Gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li>It is free of known chemicals harmful to our health.</li>
            <li>The pumice stone works great on feet, and the larger brush is great for the entire body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The facial brushes are great with cleaning out pores and helping with oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>My teen daughter&#x27;s skin looks great.</li>
            <li>The ESS brushes are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I use it primarily on my knees, elbows, and foot.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous service!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I enjoy it.</li>
            <li>One suggestion however for the sellers, would be to attach a band to the handle so it can be hung up, or have a stand for it to be placed comfortably after use.</li>
            <li>Cheap garbage.  </li>
            <li>I bought this with the LAVO exfoliating scrub and afterwards my face felt as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt, shiny, and</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and it works really good for my feet.</li>
            <li>Well, I am 54 years old and used this once, and loved how my face felt.</li>
            <li>Good so far.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it more than that, not really an everyday kind of thing.</li>
            <li>course I&#x27;m sure using the right face wash, paired with this device, is important.</li>
            <li>It is able to clean much deeper than if I just used my fingers!!</li>
            <li>The large brush is great for arms and legs and the small ones are great for face and neck.</li>
            <li>a real boost to exfoliation!!!  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this, makes my skin feel so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>My face is smooth and clean.</li>

            <li>Using and enjoying it very much.</li>
            <li>So fresh and clean!  </li>
            <li>Good brushes that&#x27;s easily replaceable is the key.  </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and I was impressed with the heavy duty packaging.  </li>
            <li>It has significantly helped with my acne.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>My daughters love it too, so I will likely be purchasing two more sets soon. :)</li>
            <li>When the brush arrived I was really excited to use it because I thought that it would be like a doupe for clarasonic.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to my family and frinds also my sister is so excited to give it try</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>,you get multiple use out of it (body/face/feet),waterproof, &amp; most of all because it really does a great job at cleaning/prepping your skin for moisturizing it</li>
            <li>,you get multiple use out of it (body/face/feet),waterproof, &amp; most of all because it really does a great job at cleaning/prepping your skin for moisturizing it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed significant improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>

            <li>After the first time you use it your skin feels so smooth!</li>
            <li>First off I love how this set is packaged and sealed keeping the set protected and clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very excited to see what it will do for my very oily skin!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this on shower many times so far and have had no issues, so it is for sure water proof.&lt;br</li>
            <li>All the brushes work as claimed and makes your skin feel really clean and exfoliated.</li>
            <li>I love this item and would recommend it to anyone who wants a clean smooth face.</li>
            <li>I suggest buying rechargeable batteries because once you use it you will not want to clean your face without it.</li>
            <li>My skin feels extremely clean.</li>
            <li>, I still give it five stars because I got it to clean my skin</li>
            <li>clean brush two days in a row.  </li>
            <li>My face is super smooth immediately afterwards.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick and stress free.</li>
            <li>Super smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>I thought I liked my last face brush, but this one is so much better.  </li>
            <li>really does a fantastic job of keeping my body blemish free!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and fun...</li>
            <li>My face feels super smooth after I use this.</li>
            <li>I love it so far I love the features.</li>
            <li>It helps get my face really clean.</li>
            <li>The body brush is great for dry brushing which helps with cellulite.</li>
            <li>My face feels so fresh after and its really easy to use.</li>
            <li>My face is amazingly clean every time I use it and</li>
            <li>When I was offered the chance to purchase this at a special price during a promotion period to test for quality, I was excited.  </li>
            <li>I think this is a good product, although I mostly wanted for facial area, it really helped my niece&#x27;s bumpy arms!</li>
            <li>So far I love it!</li>
            <li>For a Long time I am searching for a good and easy to pocket Exfoliation brush, and today my search has stopped.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Works very well, I have tried other cleansing brushes and this one seems to be the best!</li>
            <li>but these brushes have the right texture for the purpose they were designed for!</li>
            <li>I have found dry body brushing to be very effective, but a body brush cannot be used on the face.</li>
            <li>For the face: not bad, but again nothing special.</li>
            <li>I love how soft and clean my face feels after I use it!  </li>
            <li>Product worked great for about a month, then the motor began to drag.</li>
            <li>My only issue is that the exfoliating attachment doesn&#x27;t work good.</li>
            <li>Works very well &amp; better priced than others I viewed.</li>
            <li>My facial pores haven&#x27;t looked this good in years- after 2-3 days</li>
            <li>the big brush i thought would be good for the healing scar that runs from my hip to my knee</li>
            <li>I am not going to get a clarisonic, instead I am getting the full set of replacement brushes.</li>
            <li>Overall I think this is a good value and a quality product</li>
            <li>and i can see good changes!I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li>I liked the sensitive skin brush as well, but</li>
            <li>Overall, I good buy for the price.</li>
            <li>~ The customer service department has been phenomenal and that is greatly appreciated.  </li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s good enough strength for my face.</li>
            <li>After six months of regular use the spinner stopped working despite changing the batteries, keeping the apparatus in good shape and never dropping it.</li>
            <li>Really good value for similar items we&#x27;ve seen at stores for over $100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>did get an email from the company, which was a really nice unexpected thing.  </li>
            <li>but I love this thing so much</li>
            <li>I used this in the shower and after the very first use I noticed a noticed a significant difference in the way my face felt.</li>
            <li>I like how it has full circle motion.</li>
            <li>soft and effective.</li>
            <li>and I have been using good skincare systems for about the last 10 years.</li>
            <li>Not a bad value for the money.</li>
            <li>Not bad.  </li>
            <li>I liked how well this cleaned, but it&#x27;s not for super sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not as strong of a mechanism as I expected but for the price it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>It clipped right on and felt secure.</li>
            <li>The product comes exactly as pictured in the ad pictured and was delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>First one didn&#x27;t work, but Amazon sent out a replacement very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Works really well, good on sensitive skin also!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming this is due to the great exfoliation those areas received.</li>
            <li>The price is also great compared to other brush sets.</li>
            <li>I first tried the body brish and that worked fine.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin fresh, clean &amp; glowing.</li>
            <li>One of my best purchases everrrr, Let me know if your company sells extra brushes I use coconut oil and oatmeal mixed and my face is now glowing.</li>
            <li>In fact, I was so impressed with it that I bought a second one a week later for my girl friend as she was impressed with my results in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the pumice stone for the feet, as I already had a good foot care regimen, but the face and body brushes are working really well for my 55 year old skin.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend to a friend (actually, I did, to several).</li>
            <li>Especially pleased with more difficult areas around nose.</li>
            <li>I use Burt&#x27;s Bees Orange facial cleanser with it and it leaves my face nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Once I became pregnant, my skin went haywire.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super bummed.</li>
            <li>I am quite pleased overall. :)</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased with this system.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased with this system.</li>
            <li>I did notice, from that very first use, that my skin seemed stimulated.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft so using them on my face and other areas of my face is perfect and does not scratch my face.</li>
            <li>I havent used it enough to be able to say if it will help with the scarring and discoloration, but it helping with my acne is a plus enough for me to say I love it!!</li>
            <li>Not sure what I was thinking, but I went and bought Neutrogena oil free acne wash (cream wash) and it has been working great with it.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>I turned it on and was pretty quiet and had good spin to it.</li>
            <li>You DO need a good moisturizer afterwards though, because like any face brush itll dry out from scrubbing away all the oil and toxins on your skin.</li>
            <li>It seems gentle but can easily &amp;#34;scuff&amp;#34; skin.</li>
            <li>so i cant use it in the shower too long but great face brush and exfoliates gently</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying this kit so far!</li>
            <li>I bought this here on Amazon a month back and LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>After just the first use I felt invigorated!</li>
            <li>Better than when I have had professional treatments!</li>
            <li>Thank you for such an outstanding product at an affordable price!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>

            <li>Love the brushes leaves my skin feeling super soft.</li>
            <li>Love this product, it comes with many attachment options, I&#x27;ve used the body one much more than I expected just because it leaves me feeling extra clean!</li>
            <li>For the money it is a great set being that it&#x27;s not only a facial cleanser, but also has a body brush and a pumice stone attachment to use for a pedicure.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also easy to use and rather quite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin feel so clean n shinny after first use ...</li>
            <li>The unit is very quiet and I was kind of worried it didn&#x27;t have enough umph, but after using it, I think if it had more umph I would complain!  </li>
            <li>I would LOVE for there to be a massaging tool head (I&#x27;ve seen others with this, but they didn&#x27;t have replacement brushes, so I didn&#x27;t get) to add to the others, it would be so awesome for a face massage without worrying about getting raw skin like using the brush for too long at a time will do.  </li>

            <li>Esp  love the sensitive face brush.  </li>
            <li>I can not open it on my own</li>

            <li>So far I LOVE this brush and would give 1,000 stars if I could ~  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>It was worth buying ...</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as i thought</li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money I paid.</li>
            <li>So far - I love it...</li>
            <li>Just so fresh.</li>
            <li>Pretty cool.</li>
            <li>but the results were well worth it.</li>
            <li>The speed of the brush is nice and the various attachments for the face an body work well.</li>
            <li>My skin is more soft and it even help with even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I am excited to see what the results will be but the product overall feels very cheap.</li>
            <li>but yes I see some super small improvements package is very nice and presentable, ALSO VERY FAST SHIPPING SUPER FAST!!</li>
            <li>Originally I just wanted the face brush and wasn&#x27;t sure what I would do with the pumice stone or body brush, but now I use all brushes regularly.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, it absolutely does clean my face and exfoliate far better than anything else I could afford.  </li>
            <li>and they began to return pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>Such high quality and lovely packaging :)</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this because the reviews were really promising</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know how good it is compared to the other ones.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use this system long before you fall in love with it and your skin!</li>
            <li>original system is very affordable and the customer service is always there to support you.  </li>
            <li>I looked at the highly coveted Clarisonic but did not want to spend $100 on something I wasn&#x27;t completely sure I really needed.</li>
            <li>My husband has been looking for the right one, and I came upon this on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I like that you can use the brush right in the shower without hurting it.</li>
            <li>and I think I made the right choice.</li>
            <li>or maybe I&#x27;m not using the right defoliants</li>
            <li>So I tried this, and it cleared the problem right away, when used with the right products.</li>
            <li>Right now, I use it with a cleanser or just with water while in the shower.  </li>
            <li>they can to make it right.</li>
            <li>and I noticed my skin was smother and softer right away.</li>
            <li>The handle and weight of the brush system is also just right.  </li>
            <li>I always wanted a brush system for exfoliation, anD I chose the right one.</li>
            <li>Seems to really get her face clean and polished looking.</li>
            <li>Was looking for something to clean the whole body and this is it.</li>
            <li>Upon first use, the only thing I added to the brush (besides batteries) was warm water, as soap dries out my skin.  </li>
            <li>This brush is just as effective as the more expensive brushes you can purchase, and I love the variety of attachments (as well as the stellar customer service!)</li>
            <li>Dry, cracked feet looking better!</li>
            <li>However, the brushes are attached to the core by squeezing in and the cheap plastic that is not durable can easily chip off, bend or break and the heads, especially the biggest one can fall off.</li>
            <li>Deep exfoliation and cleansing are great once in a while (every few months), but you will do more harm if you do it too often.</li>
            <li>This is essentially the same thing that a person could do with a body mitt and the force is better using your own hand pressure compared to this product.</li>
            <li>The packaging is smooth and refined, the brushes are soft and fluffy, and the brushing system itself has a lovely grip to it for easy and comfortable use</li>
            <li>great little tool that really gets the job done.</li>
            <li>The very first time I used it, the large brush fell broke where it fits on, so it falls off.</li>
            <li>The brushes are versatile and for the price this is a fantastic set which keeps your whole body clean and soft.</li>
            <li>The regular brush is great for deep exfoliating</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth so much more than what it cost, I would definitely recommend this to any and everyone.</li>
            <li>Really appreciate the product and definitely recommend to anyone looking for a cleansing brush of some kind.</li>
            <li>It really cleans pores better than anything I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>After a few months of use, I love this product even more.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly and doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Product arrive very fast (2 days) with no issues.</li>
            <li>I cleans all the dirt and oil off ur skin and is very gentle .</li>
            <li>Very gentle cleaning and exfoliation</li>
            <li>They care very much about their product and customer satisfaction.  </li>
            <li>The scrubbing brush is very gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle non-abrasive cleansing brush.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>I had written a review after receiving it and it was all good , then for one of the little brushes for the face just crumbled apart and did not know what happened</li>
            <li>But, oh it felt sooo good, I over did it a little bit.  </li>
            <li>This is a good little brush.</li>
            <li>Good for a clean skin but not effective for acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it about 2 or so weeks, and I already love it.</li>
            <li>when I first got the bus</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Even better is that it actually works</li>
            <li>They make my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face soft and smooth, without chafing or redness.</li>
            <li>First of all, it&#x27;s waterproof so you can take it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>and I know will only get better.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this brush, I was afraid I wasn&#x27;t going to like it because of other reviews, it is not too powerful but good enough for a good cleansing!</li>
            <li>I really love the product, but it lacks crucial warnings.</li>
            <li>I really love the product, but it lacks crucial warnings.</li>
            <li>When I first got it turned on after putting batteries in, I thought, &amp;#34;There is no way this is going to do anything</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very big on taking care of my face and have wanted one of these for the longest time, bought this and absolutely love.  </li>
            <li>The proper pressure for lymph drainage was compared to touching a newborn&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>I saw results on my face the first day.</li>
            <li>I felt the rejuvenating effect on my skin after the first use.</li>
            <li>I used this the first morning after I got it</li>
            <li>Thought I would buy an affordable version first and see if it was something I could commit to in my skin routine.</li>
            <li>But now since I used it for the first time I relaized that this product will save my mony and time.</li>
            <li>love the multiple brushes and options</li>
            <li>When I went to bed that night, I could still feel the circular vibrations on my skin, which felt really neat!  </li>
            <li>I first got my package and opened it</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, the brush tips turned a brownish color.  </li>
            <li>this is this first time a buyer has taken the time to do this.</li>
            <li>Haha!</li>
            <li>I used this brush the first night I received.  </li>
            <li>I do use a make up remover first  then use the brushing system.  </li>
            <li>I love my Essential Skin Solutions kit!</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>It is also very affordable!</li>
            <li>Hence you won&#x27;t be able to feel much different on your feet and face though brushes are changed.</li>
            <li>The first day I used it I could see the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that the brush comes with multiple heads.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a cheap solution to clear skin I will recommend you get this brush.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize it came with so many different brushes!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t read the instructions first</li>
            <li>I read the directions after and saw that it recommends removing make up first.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t even make me wait and return it first.  </li>
            <li>I have been wanting to get one for some time now and finally after reading many reviews decided to get this brand.</li>
            <li>The skin is soft, it does not damage it, and leaves it feeling smooth and rejuvenated.</li>

            <li>I love the different brushes and the pumice stone.  </li>
            <li>I registered TWICE, thinking that maybe the first time I had made a mistake somewhere.</li>
            <li>It works exactly how is is described.</li>
            <li>Thank you for your produce at a reasonable price!  </li>
            <li>I will gladly send it back so they can see it does not work anymore.</li>
            <li>Love all the brushes especially the biggest one on my legs before I shave.</li>
            <li>After using this system I really feel my skin is super clean and even has a natural glow like to it.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend the product for a more radiant looking screen.</li>
            <li>I love the big body attachment</li>
            <li>I love that it is waterproof and that it has several attachments...great product</li>
            <li>It was much smoother than it had ever felt before!  </li>
            <li>They warn of the exfoliating brush hurting your skin at first but its not hurtful at ALL..</li>
            <li>Skin feels much smoother!  </li>
            <li>This has helped along with her prescribed skin medication  to keep her skin looking smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and not dried out.</li>
            <li>The company seems genuinely interested in client satisfaction and feedback.  </li>
            <li>I used the body brush first on my feet and than switched to the pumice stone.</li>
            <li>My regular stone that doesn&#x27;t rotate works much better.  </li>
            <li>Love the different brushes for the body it comes with.</li>
            <li>Love all the different attachments that can be used on face or body.</li>
            <li>I am willing to buy it again as a gift.</li>
            <li>I used the body brush and the pumice stone attachment for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li>This is my first microdermabrasion kit purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good tool, and I am thinking of getting it as a gift for a few women.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin very soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product and absolutely love that I can use them wet or dry.</li>
            <li>my face feels so soft!!!!</li>
            <li>This is not the case with this cleaning brush system because it really gets your pores clean &amp; gets all the dirt you have on your face that you would normally miss if you just manually did it.</li>
            <li>ESS thank u for an amazing product that delivers for a fraction of the price than other competitors out there.</li>
            <li>Very good for everyday or multiple times a week.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I am very happy with the facial brush, and I have no doubt the other brushes and the pumice stone will make me equally happy.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for a week now together with my clean and clear face wash and face treatment</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so clean &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>Seems like that never gets enough or good enough.</li>
            <li>Love that comes with different attachments but really wish that it was electrically charged.</li>
            <li>Not only does it feel really good after a stressful day, but it actually works!</li>
            <li>My daughter , 15 yrs.old used a different brush on face- sensitive- acne on forehead and liked how ir felt.</li>
            <li>Secondly, when you purchase this brush system, the company wants you to register the warranty at their website and they will give you a coupon and some more information.  </li>
            <li>I plan to return this product promptly unless there are more firm heads available.</li>
            <li>-really makes me feel clean especially getting the remaining make-up off my face after I have removed my make-up with special remover.  </li>
            <li>I was slightly hesitant to order this, but I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li>The soft brush feels luxurious, the spin isn&#x27;t so fast that one can&#x27;t control it, and it really does a fine job exfoliating my skin.  </li>
            <li>Makes my face super soft!</li>
            <li>It makes them super soft!</li>
            <li>Though I do find is a little amusing that the box the items came in feels of better quality than the actual product.</li>
            <li>the first time I used it, it made my dry skin on my legs disappear and feel fantastic!</li>
            <li>I had immediate positive results.</li>
            <li>I went off of all the positive reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li>She thinks it is great and was amazed at the price compared to what some other brands cost for a similar product.  </li>
            <li>I had on a full face of makeup and using this completely removed all of it.</li>
            <li>The brissles are nice and soft and really get deep into your skin.</li>
            <li>I had to find the perfect product, it had to have a good amount of positive reviews and was in my budget, which I have to add (my budget) was very low due to the unfortunate shortage of money.</li>
            <li>I was able to use the normal face brush for a couple weeks before the same thing happened to that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The various attachments easily snap on and off.</li>
            <li>I love the versatility, can be used in shower and dry.  </li>
            <li>The various attachments easily snap on and off.</li>
            <li>Have to buy batteries But seems to last a good long while.</li>
            <li>The battery isn&#x27;t as strong and lasting.</li>
            <li>and I loved it so much that I purchased it for my niece this past Christmas.  </li>
            <li>The face brush did an amazing job at cleaning around my nose, and I felt that it was really getting down into the pores.  </li>
            <li>The large body brush worked well.  </li>
            <li>This product has made a large impact in my skin regimen.</li>
            <li>product itself comes with 4 brushes, 1 large and 3 miniature.</li>
            <li>I wanted to us it long enough to be able to give a accurate review.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this item as it performs very well so far, for a very reasonable price, compared to a major competitor currently being advertised.</li>
            <li>First - right after the procedure of exfoliating you go directly to your freezer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been rinsing them off really well and leaving them out to dry, but want to know if there&#x27;s a better way to do it.</li>
            <li>For the price - it&#x27;s a great buy, I have seen brushes 4-5 times more expensive and looks like they are doing the exact same job.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to those who want clean soft akin.</li>
            <li>the only downside is it seems the brush could be somewhat stronger, but it seems to get the job done just fine</li>
            <li>The body brush is surprisingly large and really works.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t scrub so hard as to irrate sensitive skin but does a great job in cleaning</li>
            <li>And for the first time in a long time, my feet are smooth...</li>
            <li>Emailed the company, who replied very rapidly, asking if there were any tricks to getting the battery compartment open and they sent me detailed instructions.</li>
            <li>I am now a huge fan of Essential Skin Solutions!!</li>
            <li>well this really has helped it opens my pores and allows the acne medication to really get in.  </li>
            <li>I also, really appreciate the seller reaching out to see if I had any questions and offering suggestion for use.</li>
            <li>this is a very practical..</li>
            <li>My skin is ultra smooth, and I think I look younger already!</li>
            <li>It not only looks tighter, but feels smooth to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed too much of a difference on my body, but it&#x27;s helped a lot with my acne.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Gentle</li>
            <li>I really searched and read a lot of reviews before I made my purchase</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>You also get a free gift for writing a review which is the only reason why I&#x27;m writing this.</li>
            <li>I have a very oily face</li>
            <li>Well it&#x27;s very inexpensive</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not using it very often</li>
            <li>The pumice stone works really well, too.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>it does not seem to do much at all.</li>
            <li>The company wants your money and that is it.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Dead cells&amp;#34; is a very convenient term for the cosmetics companies to urge customers to use the brush every day.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much softer and my pores are going away on my nose</li>
            <li>and I absolutely it.</li>
            <li>This thing really works.  </li>
            <li>Very lightweight &amp; portable.</li>
            <li>It left my skin soooo smooth.</li>
            <li>Ok for face, however not much use for the body.</li>
            <li>I feel like my skin is much smoother and softer.  </li>
            <li>and it has really cleared up my acne.  </li>
            <li>Just received my brush a few days ago &amp; im in love so far, my face &amp; body has never felt so smooth.</li>
            <li>Company very helpful with information.</li>
            <li>If I wanted to scrub my whole body with this thing...</li>
            <li>Perhaps the one I received was defective but it seems the way the two pieces attach is very flimsy.</li>
            <li>This product really works in real life👍</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I appreciated the email.</li>
            <li>and it has really improved my skin already.  </li>
            <li>I have not used the foot add-on yet because my feet are smooth already, but I will try it later.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li>so I have to exfoliate a lot, and this is really helping to get in there</li>
            <li>I really wanted to give one of these a try to see if it could help.    </li>
            <li>So you can do your face, whole body and feet with this one set.  </li>
            <li>I feel like when I am done that my face is so much cleaner than just washing with my hands or a washcloth.  </li>
            <li>My whole household loves this.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.  </li>
            <li>The seller is very proactive and sent me an email when I ordered this system with some tips on how to use and how to register for the warranty.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li>I really wanted a Sonic brush</li>
            <li>I never used this product or similar ones available in the market before.</li>
            <li>Thanks to my mom for recommending this product to me.</li>
            <li>(boy, I sound like a commercial.)</li>
            <li>and my face has cleared up so much.</li>
            <li>, It looks so much brighter and healthier.</li>
            <li>Since I started using it, my face has really cleared up.</li>
            <li>In fact my daughter saw mine and wants one now.</li>
            <li>My skin gets dirty from working in a kitchen, and this cleans my skin perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Worked really well.</li>
            <li>What I like so much about this unit is the body brush.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This really brightens my complextion and tightens my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle too.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for the stone to much.</li>
            <li>It makes my legs so smooth especially after I shave.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Dont spend too much time at 1 spot with that head.</li>
            <li>works really well cleansing and exfoliating your skin</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s working better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>The seller was very helpful in fulfilling their warranty obligation &amp; I received a replacement.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>My Mother has callus and and I went straight for the foot attachment to test the product.</li>
            <li>After much research, I chose ESS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so much the system in itself, it&#x27;s the brushes.  </li>
            <li>The price is set is very affordable.  </li>
            <li>It does cleanse the face gently.</li>
            <li>Skin felt so much smoother after using.</li>
            <li>but it works really well.</li>
            <li>All I know is that it did not do much to my feet at all.  </li>
            <li>It works very well for me.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>But it just doesnt have as much power as i was hoping for.</li>
            <li>So happy, as many products like this can really be expensive and do the same things.</li>
            <li>Really like the way this product makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>Take good care of it before your skin gets rough enough.</li>
            <li>I love it left my skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>And, from my everyday use of the set, I have noticed a really nice difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>The turning mechanism is incredibly slow and trying to use this in the shower or bath requires a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>As a result, I tried the other brush and it was very light and gentle, which is the one I now use every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a result, I tried the other brush and it was very light and gentle, which is the one I now use every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin feels amazing and there is even a slight visible improvement after just two uses!</li>
            <li>We did have a minor snafu with the unit, but the company &#x27;not amazon&#x27; sent us a new one,  headache free!</li>
            <li>The brush is very useful for exfoliating the skin, both on the face and your entire body.</li>
            <li>and this brush is every bit as good, if not better, than the competition!</li>
            <li>Something like a clean and clear thin liquid face wash consistency should work good.</li>
            <li>Something like a clean and clear thin liquid face wash consistency should work good.</li>
            <li>Bought this mainly for the large body brush included in the package.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried so many other stuff</li>
            <li>I use my normal facial soap on it and get it good and wet then move it all over my face.  </li>
            <li>so I had to pay $15 extra than the original price that I&#x27;d seen.</li>
            <li>The price is MUCH better than the other options out there</li>
            <li>Sorry for the jumbly review - and good luck!</li>
            <li>clearer pores are clearer and my face feels extra clean every use.</li>
            <li>It not only clean well</li>
            <li>really good.it really prepares your face for your skin regime.use the regular face brush few times a week and in between use the sensitive  brush.the body brush works great too</li>
            <li>Really makes your face feel much cleaner than normal washing.</li>
            <li>My face feels really clean after using it, and I use the big brush on my body.</li>
            <li>I use this several times a week to clean my face.</li>
            <li>It does clean deep!</li>
            <li>I saw this brush, decent reviews and reasonable price</li>
            <li>The stone to scrub the dead skin off of my feet is the perfect size, helps get in to the small areas of my feet and toes.</li>
            <li>My skin felt very clean and tight from the first use.</li>
            <li>for me, the brushes are way too soft and the unit does not rotate very fast at all...</li>
            <li>it was strong enough to clear away spots on my skin that are prone to ingrown hair ...</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and these brushes feel amazing on my skin I&#x27;ve been using it everyday since I got it.</li>
            <li>Keeps her skin clear, and does exactly what it says it does.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for any skin type, however if you have sensitive skin like I do, be sure to use the sensitive brush only on your face.</li>
            <li>My face is smoother and the pumice attachment has really helped keep some areas of psoriasis from being as scaly as they normally would be.</li>
            <li>The motor is not too fast or too slow, the speed is just perfect to get the dead skin off and also exfoliate my face.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend allowing the brushes to air dry before placing them back into their box, which is a great hard shell box that allows for easy storage.</li>
            <li>, it sounds kind of extreme to have such a large brush</li>
            <li>I also think it could spin faster, it does not have much power and my face could use a little more intensity....</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be a typical man, make sure you read the instructions because there is a trick to inserting the batteries.  </li>
            <li>I feel as though my wrinkles are less prominent when I used this device.</li>
            <li>The only good time to do the exfoliation is when there are a few cloudy/ rainy days in a row.</li>
            <li>product has Refill brushes, this was one of the main reasons I bought it.  </li>
            <li>product has Refill brushes, this was one of the main reasons I bought it.  </li>
            <li>Love the brushes, especially the big one for the shower.</li>
            <li>I love the facial brush, I feel it deeply cleanses my face.</li>
            <li>I used the smaller brush on my face with me regular cleanser, my face has never felt cleaner ot more refreshed.</li>
            <li>I really, really love the body brush and regular facial brush.  </li>
            <li>Of this &amp;#34;type&amp;#34;, this is my 3rd or 4th one because they all keep breaking, however out of the box this one&#x27;s quality was evident and considering all the others only use two batteries and issues as for I&#x27;m hopeful that this will have more durability,  but,  hands down,  the brushes and everything else I go,  a genuine value purchase</li>
            <li>It was very soft and gentle on my face, not at all abrasive.</li>
            <li>I also found an unexpected positive result from using the body brush today.</li>
            <li>After a long day working (and swearing) in the garden, it&#x27;s great to jump in the shower and use the body brush to hit my back/shoulders/neck with the rotating brush and clear away all the sunscreen and dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li>But if you don&#x27;t have this I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Recommend it highly</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this face/body brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting to buy one of these for a while but never wanted to spend the money on the high priced systems you see in the store or spas.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this kit.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to operate and the bristles are soft enough to feel comfortable as they clean yet strong enough to do the dirty work.</li>
            <li>So when I found this one by ESS, I decided to do a little digging to see if there are others that are better.  </li>
            <li>and they seem to do a little better.</li>
            <li>My face feels extra clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I had trouble opening the battery compartment at first, like a lot of others, but once you figure out where to squeeze you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>works very well, my face fells so soft</li>
            <li>It made my skin so soft really cleaned it well.</li>
            <li>The way it&#x27;s designed is to be a snug fit so that it can be used in wet conditions.</li>
            <li>Skin exfoliating face brush- Gentle for cleansing or buffing sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was surprised I would like it as much as I did.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a great buy and not as expensive as the others.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the soft facial brush and body brush daily and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>The only downfall is that its battery powered, but for the price its totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Helpful instructions about putting the batteries in and using the product are sent with the product box they are sent through email (e.g., squeeze the sides of the battery compartment to get it to open), which I don&#x27;t find that useful.</li>
            <li>I think it was the brush though because I used the exfoliater before I even used the normal one.</li>
            <li>I received my skin solutions a few days ago and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I have now been using the brush for &#x27;not sensitive skin &#x27;for 2 weeks and my skin is definitely smoother and feels better.</li>
            <li>I really loved this product, I felt that it helped me with not only my acne but also helped me get rid of all that dead skin and calluses on my feet!</li>
            <li>Love it, use it almost everyday</li>
            <li>love it, use it everyday</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the soft facial brush and body brush daily and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>It makes for a smoother, more long lasting shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Takes me longer than normal to shower with it</li>
            <li>For all the people saying they broke out after using it, that&#x27;s a normal occurrence (esthetician here) after using an exfoliating product/tool like this.</li>
            <li>I prefer to have the instructions right in the box when I open it.</li>
            <li>I use the facial brush 2-3 times a week, maybe less, and my face feels great every single time.</li>
            <li>even with brand new duracell batteries.</li>
            <li>Company has responded and they are sending me a new wand.</li>
            <li>I put 4 new batteries in it and used it once</li>
            <li>but like it&#x27;s about to die (brand new batteries).</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower a few days a week &amp; am feeling my skin smile as well!!</li>
            <li>I then used the palm of my hand and did a slight twist and the battery cover opened easily.</li>
            <li>Quickly got rid of pesky dry patches on my face.</li>
            <li>It works better than I expected and is actually nicer than the spa ones I have used.</li>
            <li>It not only cleared my acne, but my pores are much smaller and my skin feels so smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love that it comes with both a soft and firm brush attachment</li>
            <li>Not too heavy, not to light, with an easy grip to hold without it slipping away in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was annoyed and secretly happy that I had to work a double shift.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft and do not aggravate my skin when I use them.</li>
            <li>The brushes are both very soft and I can&#x27;t imagine how these will exfoliate my face.</li>
            <li>puts ESS above the other waterproof systems I researched is the ability to easily replace the brushes at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>The body scrub made me soft as a babies bottom!</li>
            <li>A bit harsh on the skin, even the sensitive one, but really nice quality especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I was done with the cleaning process my face was so soft!</li>
            <li>It felt so soft!</li>
            <li>My face and body feel so soft after my shower!  </li>
            <li>Initially, I was going to order from another competitor but after revising and comparing reviews and my budget essential skin solutions was definitely the top runner.</li>
            <li>I definitely notice a difference when I use it consistently</li>
            <li>i have oily skin and it works wonders to remove the access oil and make my skin soft!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>my skin has never felt so soft!</li>
            <li>first reaction when I put the batteries into the Essential Skin Solutions brush system ...</li>
            <li>the two face brushes are nice, the rough one is not to rough and the soft one is not to soft.</li>
            <li>And, seriously I looked much younger after getting such a good clean it likely sloughed off old skin too.  </li>
            <li>I really like it so far.... except the body brush won&#x27;t stay on and replacements cost the same as a new item from competitors!</li>
            <li>Since using it for the past 2 weeks his skin looks great without all those harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>The item it&#x27;s self is a cheap plastic, with an odd feeling grip.</li>
            <li>I have been using the facial soft brush morning and night for a week now and really like how my face feels afterwards!</li>
            <li>You can finally get the full benefit from using your facial creams,eye creams,oils, or whatever</li>
            <li>The body brushes are pretty nice though the sluffing stone is slightly useless.</li>
            <li>Also, this product doesn&#x27;t spin very quickly--it&#x27;s actually super slow--and it stops working if you apply even a little bit of pressure.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would be nice to have an individual large replacement brush heads, since that is definitely one of the features that this set offers that all the other similar brush makers do not have.</li>
            <li>I love that you can use it wet or dry.</li>
            <li>The handle is wide enough to hold with easy and maneuver.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m loving this system and I use it at least 4 times a week!</li>
            <li>My teenage daughter has acne and I have large, visible pores.  </li>
            <li>$10 less than the original item for brushes?  </li>
            <li>I have had facial brushes in the past and mainly bought this for the body brush, but I absolutely love everything in this kit.</li>
            <li>It feels so gentle like the face one, but the clean is just doing such a better job than other things, and I have used a lot of other things for body scrubbing, especially the back.  </li>
            <li>I started off using the sensitive skin face brush with my facial cleanser, and my face felt much softer after each shower.</li>
            <li>It was great for a few months and then finally stopped working a few days before the warranty.</li>
            <li>So far I am really liking this Skin/body brushing cleaning system from Essential Skin Solutions.</li>
            <li>Use this with PanOxyl in the shower and it has helped to clear that up.</li>
            <li>My face and body feels soft and clean after using and not stripped and dry as I thought it would by using the brushes daily.</li>
            <li>I tried using it even though it was broken, because I could still fit it on there, it just wouldn&#x27;t secure so it fell off constantly while I used it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been considering getting the Clarisonic for awhile now but was iffy on spending near $200 for it.</li>
            <li>Applying face wash onto the brush head and then cleansing my face causes the face wash to lather up so much and then bubbles start flying in all different directions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it for sensitive and oily skin to help smoothen the skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>There are several things I really like about this unit.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft after using this product.</li>
            <li>I would really like a replacement though considering it only worked for a week</li>
            <li>Works like a charm, cleans skin &amp; leaves it soft.  </li>
            <li>; BUT then I started using it, the sensitive skin brush, on my face.....</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>So far no issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and durable.</li>
            <li>I even recorded and gave it to my 38 yr old daughter.</li>
            <li>For my face I just opted for the sensitive skin brush because I preferred the softness of the bristles.</li>
            <li>The brush is way to soft.  </li>
            <li>So I decided to give this a try and so far (I&#x27;ve had it for about a month now)</li>
            <li>The brushes are all soft but still do the job well.</li>
            <li>THIS brush is different, it&#x27;s actually very well made.  </li>
            <li>, I did not know which face brush was the &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; cleaner or the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; and sensitive one.  </li>
            <li>I started using this because I wanted to have a glow and soft skin without the use of makeup.</li>
            <li>and I know this will help my folliculitis caused by my very curly facial hair.</li>
            <li>I have had the kit about a week now and use it every day with a sensitive skin foaming cleanser</li>
            <li>It has different brushes but is really a whole body kit.  </li>
            <li>and I use the sensitive one.  </li>
            <li>I also suffer from adult acne rosacea.</li>
            <li>but it has helped with pore size and made my skin soft.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel incredibly soft</li>
            <li>I give this product 5 stars because thus far I have received every bang for my buck.</li>
            <li>so I have mature sensitive skin, and use the softest brush in the package.</li>
            <li>and I nearly was going to cave--until I found this product miraculously.</li>
            <li>It came so fast and the product has really left me speechless</li>
            <li>I just ordered one for my mother as an early mother&#x27;s day gift as well.</li>
            <li>My skin is too sensitive to it.</li>
            <li>Not so soft</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 16 year old daughter for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li>and like it so far as well.</li>
            <li>I really like how well it deep cleans your face &amp; body versus manually washing it.</li>
            <li>deep cleans, minimizes pores and make the skin ready for maximum moisture absorption.</li>
            <li>I use it so much and extra attachments can be bought.</li>
            <li>I have tried the body brush and sensitive skin brush -</li>
            <li>Using a natural soap, she loves the results.</li>
            <li>I was quite surprised at how ineffective my hand face washing has been.</li>
            <li>The roughest spots on my body have never felt so soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough for face and neck</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I was very pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>My adult acne is clearing up after a month of use.</li>
            <li>It takes all the dirt and oils off of your face and leaves your skin so soft.</li>
            <li>While this is the only skin polishing brush I&#x27;ve ever tried, and it&#x27;s only the 3rd day I&#x27;ve tried it, my review is...not worth much weight.</li>
            <li>Brushes are holding up thus so far and keep there form.  </li>
            <li>I like that this has a body brush and can be used in the shower, the foot brush hasn&#x27;t been useful as I feel there isn&#x27;t enough power to use it properly.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny spent...</li>
            <li>It takes 4 AA batteries, not included, and that was probably the most difficult part was installing the batteries, but all you have to do is squeeze the handle and pull and it comes right off.</li>
            <li>I tried the Aqua Glycolic alone first and saw a slight improvement, so the brush is what really made the biggest difference.  </li>
            <li>As well, if there were other attachments for the feet like a gritty sandpaper one, or more with different harshness&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>As well, if there were other attachments for the feet like a gritty sandpaper one, or more with different harshness&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Works well, but the battery operated system is not powerful, quality is adequate for the price.</li>
            <li>Other than the battery compartment being hard to open, I love it!!</li>
            <li>My face is smoother and less dry, my body feels more toned and toes</li>
            <li>It helps clean your skin deep its not to rough on your skin it can be used on your face and your body.</li>
            <li>And the scrubber it self is not durable after using it a few times , I was so excited about getting this</li>
            <li>Gentle enough for everyday use, and I have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I only wish it went slightly faster to get better friction, especially for use with the pumice attachment.</li>
            <li>Today I used the big body brush over my entire body (except for my face) and I think it worked very well!</li>
            <li>I think it is the exact same, in fact, with just a different logo smacked on to it.</li>
            <li>Too many batteries are needed for such a small product.</li>
            <li>Next I had to attach a brush head to the unit and that was pretty simple to do.</li>
            <li>But when I used the soft normal face brush my face became extremely red and irritated.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it out, I took a shower and used the big body brush and the deep cleansing face brush.  </li>
            <li>I applied a hydrating facial cleanser, put on the normal face brush (there&#x27;s a sensitive one too) and started with my forehead.</li>
            <li>As far as I could tell from their site and here, there are no other heads than what is shown.  </li>
            <li>As far as I could tell from their site and here, there are no other heads than what is shown.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be of the same high quality as the fancy name brand face cleaner</li>
            <li>I use it on my feet after a long soak and it really helps to recirculate the blood and do away with callousness.</li>
            <li>i read a few negative reviews and several great reviews before purchasing this product.  </li>
            <li>After using it for the first time, she stated that the rough skin on her chin and forehead was gone.  </li>
            <li>also used the large brush on my body, no soap, just dry.</li>
            <li>I contacted them per the instructions on the warranty and they shipped a new one the very next day!  </li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable compared to some other skin cleansing brushes .</li>
            <li>My one complaint is the motor drains the four AA batteries very quickly.</li>
            <li>I love this thing, the only complaint I have is that it&#x27;s battery-run rather than rechargeable, but perhaps that&#x27;s what you get with a waterproof scrubber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really helps me get my face deep cleaned, especially helpful in getting every bit of makeup out of my pores.</li>
            <li>If I used the edges I was able to get the dead skin off my toes, but not the rough skin on my heels, even after a soak in water.  </li>
            <li>It would help if the sensitive skin brush was marked as such but</li>
            <li>I have only used the sensitive brush on my face so far</li>
            <li>I would suggest using Alkaline if you have those laying around they last much longer than the regular</li>
            <li>I would suggest using Alkaline if you have those laying around they last much longer than the regular</li>
            <li>So, this was a major factor for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, this was a major factor for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now the other two are tougher to tell apart since they look identical at first.  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and was a little worried the first time I used the facial brush, but I swear, some of the dark spots were not even noticeable.</li>
            <li>I come from a very humid environment and moved to a very dry climate.</li>
            <li>I had a skin peel and it&#x27;s helping to remove the dead skin in the first use!</li>
            <li>I have figured out how hard to press the unit to my face based on what feels comfortable for me.  </li>
            <li>This is too bad as when it worked, it worked great.</li>
            <li>Bacne is a real problem, and apparently pretty common; if this can be part of the solution, it should be offered separately and maketed that way as well to make it easier for people to find.</li>
            <li>I need to clear up my hyper-pigmentation and the deep scars from years of battling acne.</li>
            <li>So far I am using the system daily and am sold on the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this 3 times so far</li>
            <li>but since u get two of them I didn&#x27;t worry about so much but now the second one is starting to do the same thing.</li>
            <li>My husband actually noticed how soft it feels.</li>
            <li>and my pores are barely visible.</li>
            <li>When I woke up my face was still red and was now also sensitive.</li>
            <li>Basically, I had adult acne on my shoulders/back, face &amp; neck and this has helped immensely in clearing that up.  </li>
            <li>I use the sensitive face brush and find that it has enough scrubbing power for my face.</li>
            <li>(I use the soft face brush and he uses the regular) and noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>So far, I have only used each of the brushes once</li>
            <li>Got this as a present for a young friend.</li>
            <li>The facial brush has completely cleared my skin and reduced the oiliness of my skin.</li>
            <li>Or you can use this daily if you are a frequent user of this like I</li>
            <li>I did not really use this much as the others since I already have a callus remover I use specifically for this.</li>
            <li>One regular and one sensitive.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish it has is to replace all brush heads for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the sensitive skin brush on my face once daily.</li>
            <li>It worked okay, not great, but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of two sided as well, in order to truly make it waterproof, I believe they had to make it this difficult, so it&#x27;s a blessing and a curse...</li>
            <li>its and ok product, not great</li>
            <li>Maybe its because I usually exfoliate with products but its not painful or anything.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve tried it, for an unbelievable price, I will be purchasing another at full price as a gift.  </li>
            <li>(Okay, in reality I was secretly planning on hijacking the brushing system from the time I placed the order...</li>
            <li>it slows down and sometimes stops completely, despite how new or old the batteries are.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was using the &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; brush the first time I used it, so I thought it was the softer one, I was aware I was using the wrong one after my skin reacted so negatively.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was using the &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; brush the first time I used it, so I thought it was the softer one, I was aware I was using the wrong one after my skin reacted so negatively.  </li>
            <li>I have persistent cystic acne which flares up hormonally and due to stress, so the fact that the body brush is exfoliating really worked for me.</li>
            <li>I found the other reviews very helpful before purchasing the product.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I really like it.</li>
            <li>If HAVING PROBLEMS OPENING IT just put a RUBBER BAND around the battery compartment handle and push it open -- I use the wide bands that come on vegetables and it works fine with less strength.  </li>
            <li>How did I live this long without one of these!  </li>
            <li>The only only other thing I would say is when you use it near your eyes use our fingertips to hold your skin in place so that it doesn&#x27;t move your skin around too much</li>
            <li>Winter really does a number on my face, leaving it dry and flaky, and even at middle age, I sometimes have breakouts and red patches.  </li>
            <li>, I also am relieved it comes with both a regular and sensitive facial brush.</li>
            <li>Once a week I use this with the sensitive brush head and a simple cleanser, CeraVe foaming facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>The only two cons so far is the battery compartment is a pain to open and in lieu of four AA batteries</li>
            <li>several times before I even wrote a review … to which I did except for the brush for sensitive facial skin … I did not use it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The constant rotation has broke up a major portion of scar tissue and is improving.  </li>
            <li>I decided to switch to the regular small face brush, and not only does my face feel super soft, but my pores also look smaller and lighter!</li>
            <li>The deep cleaning face brush was not rough on my skin at all</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions and soaked and dried them first</li>
            <li>Save your dollars and buy an oscillating brush- because this spins in one direction is pulls your skin a bit and is pretty messy (flings soap everywhere).  </li>
            <li>I have had no problems with putting in the batteries or with the brush stopping, and I was pushing pretty firmly.</li>
            <li>and I have seen a large reduction of black heads and pores.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t want to put it down.</li>
            <li>Brushes wear down fast.</li>
            <li>I began using the small sensitive brush on my face and the large body brush on the rest of my body.</li>
            <li>The regular facial brush and the sensitive facial brush feel the same.</li>
            <li>it is soft enough to do a deep cleanse with my regular facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>One use on my body made my skin so soft and got rid of dry flakes.  </li>
            <li>otherwise it loses umph quick.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be stronger spin... when I put the big body brush head on, it really slows down.</li>
            <li>The small hard one is great to remove dead skin</li>
            <li>Same as the higher priced units on the market for much less!</li>
            <li>I like to use non-foaming facial cleanser, and I can use less with the brush and feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li>The ONLY reason I rated it 1 star was to attract attention of buyers to a very important warning: the instructions to this cleansing set are incredibly vague and incomplete.</li>
            <li>Gives a very thorough cleaning with little effort.</li>
            <li>The little pumice rock doesn&#x27;t really work that we&#x27;ll though</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Nice brushes.</li>

            <li> I looked around Amazon, and this system gave the most options for the price and received good reviews.  </li>
            <li> My leg hairs sometimes try to grow length wise under the top of my skin</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> The body attachment is also nice.</li>
            <li> but I just didn&#x27;t want to spend that kind of money (around $100).  </li>
            <li> Sample purchased at a reduced rate in exchange for evaluation and my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> but I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pay that kind of money.</li>
            <li> My skin is much softer and feel great after a week of using this!</li>
            <li> I refuse to pay $150 for the popular cleansing brush that doesn&#x27;t even rotate like this one.</li>
            <li> and it was really nice.  </li>
            <li> But it is nice to have in case I need to use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it is nice to have in case I need to use it.&lt;br</li>

            <li> and it would be nice if the brushes were labeled.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really nice cleansing brush set</li>
            <li> So excited!!</li>
            <li> It makes your body super smooth and flawless.</li>
            <li> My skin is bright and clean, very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> But still a great product certain for what you get for your money!!</li>
            <li> so most scrubs or anything abrasive does more damage than good.</li>
            <li> After reading all the good reviews on the Essential Skin Solutions Perfect Skin Bushing System, I decided to buy it and give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Love this gentle brush for my face and the body brush is perfect!</li>
            <li> one is great and having tremendous qualities.</li>
            <li> All in all, super happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Still, gets an easy 5 stars because how good it feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> After he used it the first time, he told me it was too good to keep to himself, so we&#x27;re sharing it now!</li>
            <li> I do wish it had more than one speed option, but otherwise i love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all items and I&#x27;m very happy thus far.</li>
            <li> I love this product the brushes feel amazing.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best brushing system that I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> The sensitive skin brush is wonderful around your eye area.</li>
            <li> I love the design and the handy box</li>
            <li> I found it to be more effective manually than with this system when using products with a grainy, drier consistency.</li>
            <li> I was honestly nervous about buying this brush because the price was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> I just moved and just now able to use my wonderful Skin Cleansing  WOW!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and works great, my face has never felt so clean!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the money, but if you are expecting clarisonic or a very popular quality of microdermabrasion, it may not be for you.</li>
            <li> I was so excited for it after reading all of the good reviews.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great, just wish the body brush was a bit more powerful.</li>
            <li> Exfoliation is the best way to healthy soft radiant skin.</li>
            <li> love the way it is presented in a nice box to be able to storte everything.</li>
            <li> My first use and I am very pleased already!</li>
            <li> love love love love love love love, my face felt amazing after one use!</li>
            <li> Great product,  fast delivery !</li>
            <li> it seemed too good to be true...</li>
            <li> I can say that it&#x27;s very easy to use, the most challenging part was getting the battery door opened.  </li>
            <li> Yet another very important thing: when exfoliating (as I mentioned already it is a damage for your skin) mind the weather.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the price my face feels so fresh and clean after every use I would recommend this product to everyone !</li>
            <li> Super good quality-</li>
            <li> There is a nice variety of brushes and easy instructions for use.</li>
            <li> The company that sells this is so nice and easy to talk to.</li>
            <li> Best seller and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Very important to make sure you&#x27;re cleaning the brushes after every use to prevent acne causing bacteria from building up.</li>

            <li> I would love to give this 5 giant stars because it was AWESOME!</li>
            <li> My favorite is the body brush</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s fantastic!  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve been using the softer one with more bristles as my face cleanser brush in the shower.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just a matter of time before I get to</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s FANTASTIC!  </li>
            <li> found that my lotions and face creams seemed to feel better on my skin after using, &amp; the skin stayed hydrated for a longer period of time.</li>

            <li> I have it in my shower and love it.</li>
            <li> My skin feels much better now.</li>
            <li> I have used both face brushes for about a week and am pleased with the results.</li>

            <li> I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe how much &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; it did, lol.</li>
            <li> Buying a couple more for gifts throughout the year instead of the $90 ones.</li>
            <li> This was the best priced of all the similar items on Amazon, and I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> My skin already looks better after just two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I wish it had more speeds</li>
            <li> only I bought in the store and is an excellent replacement.</li>

            <li> This exfoliator makes my whole body feel nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t fit securely so any bit of pressure breaks the plastic.</li>
            <li> It needs to lock on securely</li>
            <li> but I find this much more useful.</li>
            <li> but overall I have been really happy with my purchase.</li>

            <li> Hello and Welcome to My Review of the Essential Skin Solution;</li>
            <li> Nice product and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I can use my own face wash which I really like.  </li>
            <li> Just received it and it works fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I use this everyday with great results!!!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> Gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li> It is free of known chemicals harmful to our health.</li>
            <li> The pumice stone works great on feet, and the larger brush is great for the entire body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The facial brushes are great with cleaning out pores and helping with oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> My teen daughter&#x27;s skin looks great.</li>
            <li> The ESS brushes are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I use it primarily on my knees, elbows, and foot.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous service!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I enjoy it.</li>
            <li> One suggestion however for the sellers, would be to attach a band to the handle so it can be hung up, or have a stand for it to be placed comfortably after use.</li>
            <li> Cheap garbage.  </li>
            <li> I bought this with the LAVO exfoliating scrub and afterwards my face felt as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt, shiny, and</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and it works really good for my feet.</li>
            <li> Well, I am 54 years old and used this once, and loved how my face felt.</li>
            <li> Good so far.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it more than that, not really an everyday kind of thing.</li>
            <li> course I&#x27;m sure using the right face wash, paired with this device, is important.</li>
            <li> It is able to clean much deeper than if I just used my fingers!!</li>
            <li> The large brush is great for arms and legs and the small ones are great for face and neck.</li>
            <li> a real boost to exfoliation!!!  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this, makes my skin feel so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> My face is smooth and clean.</li>

            <li> My daughters love it too, so I will likely be purchasing two more sets soon. :)</li>
            <li> When the brush arrived I was really excited to use it because I thought that it would be like a doupe for clarasonic.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to my family and frinds also my sister is so excited to give it try</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> ,you get multiple use out of it (body/face/feet),waterproof, &amp; most of all because it really does a great job at cleaning/prepping your skin for moisturizing it</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m very excited to see what it will do for my very oily skin!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this on shower many times so far and have had no issues, so it is for sure water proof.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All the brushes work as claimed and makes your skin feel really clean and exfoliated.</li>
            <li> I love this item and would recommend it to anyone who wants a clean smooth face.</li>
            <li> I suggest buying rechargeable batteries because once you use it you will not want to clean your face without it.</li>
            <li> My skin feels extremely clean.</li>
            <li> , I still give it five stars because I got it to clean my skin</li>
            <li> clean brush two days in a row.  </li>
            <li> My face is super smooth immediately afterwards.</li>

            <li> Easy to use and fun...</li>
            <li> My face feels super smooth after I use this.</li>
            <li> I love it so far I love the features.</li>
            <li> It helps get my face really clean.</li>
            <li> The body brush is great for dry brushing which helps with cellulite.</li>
            <li> My face feels so fresh after and its really easy to use.</li>
            <li> My face is amazingly clean every time I use it and</li>
            <li> When I was offered the chance to purchase this at a special price during a promotion period to test for quality, I was excited.  </li>
            <li> I think this is a good product, although I mostly wanted for facial area, it really helped my niece&#x27;s bumpy arms!</li>
            <li> So far I love it!</li>
            <li> For a Long time I am searching for a good and easy to pocket Exfoliation brush, and today my search has stopped.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Works very well, I have tried other cleansing brushes and this one seems to be the best!</li>
            <li> but these brushes have the right texture for the purpose they were designed for!</li>
            <li> I have found dry body brushing to be very effective, but a body brush cannot be used on the face.</li>
            <li> For the face: not bad, but again nothing special.</li>
            <li> I love how soft and clean my face feels after I use it!  </li>
            <li> Product worked great for about a month, then the motor began to drag.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that the exfoliating attachment doesn&#x27;t work good.</li>
            <li> Works very well &amp; better priced than others I viewed.</li>
            <li> My facial pores haven&#x27;t looked this good in years- after 2-3 days</li>
            <li> the big brush i thought would be good for the healing scar that runs from my hip to my knee</li>
            <li> I am not going to get a clarisonic, instead I am getting the full set of replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> Overall I think this is a good value and a quality product</li>
            <li> and i can see good changes!I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I liked the sensitive skin brush as well, but</li>
            <li> Overall, I good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> ~ The customer service department has been phenomenal and that is greatly appreciated.  </li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s good enough strength for my face.</li>
            <li> After six months of regular use the spinner stopped working despite changing the batteries, keeping the apparatus in good shape and never dropping it.</li>
            <li> Really good value for similar items we&#x27;ve seen at stores for over $100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> did get an email from the company, which was a really nice unexpected thing.  </li>
            <li> but I love this thing so much</li>
            <li> I used this in the shower and after the very first use I noticed a noticed a significant difference in the way my face felt.</li>
            <li> I like how it has full circle motion.</li>
            <li> soft and effective.</li>
            <li> and I have been using good skincare systems for about the last 10 years.</li>
            <li> Not a bad value for the money.</li>
            <li> Not bad.  </li>
            <li> I liked how well this cleaned, but it&#x27;s not for super sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not as strong of a mechanism as I expected but for the price it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> It clipped right on and felt secure.</li>
            <li> The product comes exactly as pictured in the ad pictured and was delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> First one didn&#x27;t work, but Amazon sent out a replacement very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Works really well, good on sensitive skin also!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming this is due to the great exfoliation those areas received.</li>
            <li> The price is also great compared to other brush sets.</li>
            <li> I first tried the body brish and that worked fine.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin fresh, clean &amp; glowing.</li>
            <li> One of my best purchases everrrr, Let me know if your company sells extra brushes I use coconut oil and oatmeal mixed and my face is now glowing.</li>
            <li> In fact, I was so impressed with it that I bought a second one a week later for my girl friend as she was impressed with my results in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the pumice stone for the feet, as I already had a good foot care regimen, but the face and body brushes are working really well for my 55 year old skin.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend to a friend (actually, I did, to several).</li>
            <li> Especially pleased with more difficult areas around nose.</li>
            <li> I use Burt&#x27;s Bees Orange facial cleanser with it and it leaves my face nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Once I became pregnant, my skin went haywire.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super bummed.</li>
            <li> I am quite pleased overall. :)</li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased with this system.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased with this system.</li>
            <li> I did notice, from that very first use, that my skin seemed stimulated.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft so using them on my face and other areas of my face is perfect and does not scratch my face.</li>
            <li> I havent used it enough to be able to say if it will help with the scarring and discoloration, but it helping with my acne is a plus enough for me to say I love it!!</li>
            <li> Not sure what I was thinking, but I went and bought Neutrogena oil free acne wash (cream wash) and it has been working great with it.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> I turned it on and was pretty quiet and had good spin to it.</li>
            <li> You DO need a good moisturizer afterwards though, because like any face brush itll dry out from scrubbing away all the oil and toxins on your skin.</li>
            <li> It seems gentle but can easily &amp;#34;scuff&amp;#34; skin.</li>
            <li> so i cant use it in the shower too long but great face brush and exfoliates gently</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this kit so far!</li>
            <li> I bought this here on Amazon a month back and LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> After just the first use I felt invigorated!</li>
            <li> Better than when I have had professional treatments!</li>
            <li> Thank you for such an outstanding product at an affordable price!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>

            <li> The unit is very quiet and I was kind of worried it didn&#x27;t have enough umph, but after using it, I think if it had more umph I would complain!  </li>
            <li> I would LOVE for there to be a massaging tool head (I&#x27;ve seen others with this, but they didn&#x27;t have replacement brushes, so I didn&#x27;t get) to add to the others, it would be so awesome for a face massage without worrying about getting raw skin like using the brush for too long at a time will do.  </li>

            <li> Pretty cool.</li>
            <li> but the results were well worth it.</li>
            <li> The speed of the brush is nice and the various attachments for the face an body work well.</li>
            <li> My skin is more soft and it even help with even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I am excited to see what the results will be but the product overall feels very cheap.</li>
            <li> but yes I see some super small improvements package is very nice and presentable, ALSO VERY FAST SHIPPING SUPER FAST!!</li>
            <li> Originally I just wanted the face brush and wasn&#x27;t sure what I would do with the pumice stone or body brush, but now I use all brushes regularly.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, it absolutely does clean my face and exfoliate far better than anything else I could afford.  </li>
            <li> and they began to return pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> Such high quality and lovely packaging :)</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this because the reviews were really promising</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how good it is compared to the other ones.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use this system long before you fall in love with it and your skin!</li>
            <li> original system is very affordable and the customer service is always there to support you.  </li>
            <li> I looked at the highly coveted Clarisonic but did not want to spend $100 on something I wasn&#x27;t completely sure I really needed.</li>
            <li> My husband has been looking for the right one, and I came upon this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I like that you can use the brush right in the shower without hurting it.</li>
            <li> and I think I made the right choice.</li>
            <li> or maybe I&#x27;m not using the right defoliants</li>
            <li> So I tried this, and it cleared the problem right away, when used with the right products.</li>
            <li> Right now, I use it with a cleanser or just with water while in the shower.  </li>
            <li> they can to make it right.</li>
            <li> and I noticed my skin was smother and softer right away.</li>
            <li> The handle and weight of the brush system is also just right.  </li>
            <li> I always wanted a brush system for exfoliation, anD I chose the right one.</li>
            <li> Seems to really get her face clean and polished looking.</li>
            <li> Was looking for something to clean the whole body and this is it.</li>
            <li> Upon first use, the only thing I added to the brush (besides batteries) was warm water, as soap dries out my skin.  </li>
            <li> This brush is just as effective as the more expensive brushes you can purchase, and I love the variety of attachments (as well as the stellar customer service!)</li>
            <li> Dry, cracked feet looking better!</li>
            <li> However, the brushes are attached to the core by squeezing in and the cheap plastic that is not durable can easily chip off, bend or break and the heads, especially the biggest one can fall off.</li>
            <li> Deep exfoliation and cleansing are great once in a while (every few months), but you will do more harm if you do it too often.</li>
            <li> This is essentially the same thing that a person could do with a body mitt and the force is better using your own hand pressure compared to this product.</li>
            <li> The packaging is smooth and refined, the brushes are soft and fluffy, and the brushing system itself has a lovely grip to it for easy and comfortable use</li>
            <li> great little tool that really gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The very first time I used it, the large brush fell broke where it fits on, so it falls off.</li>
            <li> The brushes are versatile and for the price this is a fantastic set which keeps your whole body clean and soft.</li>
            <li> The regular brush is great for deep exfoliating</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth so much more than what it cost, I would definitely recommend this to any and everyone.</li>
            <li> Really appreciate the product and definitely recommend to anyone looking for a cleansing brush of some kind.</li>
            <li> It really cleans pores better than anything I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> After a few months of use, I love this product even more.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smoothly and doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Product arrive very fast (2 days) with no issues.</li>
            <li> I cleans all the dirt and oil off ur skin and is very gentle .</li>

            <li> The scrubbing brush is very gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle non-abrasive cleansing brush.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> I had written a review after receiving it and it was all good , then for one of the little brushes for the face just crumbled apart and did not know what happened</li>
            <li> But, oh it felt sooo good, I over did it a little bit.  </li>
            <li> This is a good little brush.</li>
            <li> Good for a clean skin but not effective for acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it about 2 or so weeks, and I already love it.</li>
            <li> when I first got the bus</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Even better is that it actually works</li>
            <li> They make my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face soft and smooth, without chafing or redness.</li>
            <li> First of all, it&#x27;s waterproof so you can take it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> and I know will only get better.  </li>
            <li> I really liked this brush, I was afraid I wasn&#x27;t going to like it because of other reviews, it is not too powerful but good enough for a good cleansing!</li>
            <li> I really love the product, but it lacks crucial warnings.</li>
            <li> I really love the product, but it lacks crucial warnings.</li>
            <li> When I first got it turned on after putting batteries in, I thought, &amp;#34;There is no way this is going to do anything</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very big on taking care of my face and have wanted one of these for the longest time, bought this and absolutely love.  </li>
            <li> The proper pressure for lymph drainage was compared to touching a newborn&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> I saw results on my face the first day.</li>
            <li> I felt the rejuvenating effect on my skin after the first use.</li>
            <li> I used this the first morning after I got it</li>
            <li> Thought I would buy an affordable version first and see if it was something I could commit to in my skin routine.</li>
            <li> But now since I used it for the first time I relaized that this product will save my mony and time.</li>
            <li> love the multiple brushes and options</li>
            <li> When I went to bed that night, I could still feel the circular vibrations on my skin, which felt really neat!  </li>
            <li> I first got my package and opened it</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, the brush tips turned a brownish color.  </li>
            <li> this is this first time a buyer has taken the time to do this.</li>
            <li> Haha!</li>
            <li> I used this brush the first night I received.  </li>
            <li> I do use a make up remover first  then use the brushing system.  </li>
            <li> I love my Essential Skin Solutions kit!</li>
            <li> Really works!</li>
            <li> It is also very affordable!</li>
            <li> Hence you won&#x27;t be able to feel much different on your feet and face though brushes are changed.</li>
            <li> The first day I used it I could see the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that the brush comes with multiple heads.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a cheap solution to clear skin I will recommend you get this brush.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it came with so many different brushes!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the instructions first</li>
            <li> I read the directions after and saw that it recommends removing make up first.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even make me wait and return it first.  </li>
            <li> I have been wanting to get one for some time now and finally after reading many reviews decided to get this brand.</li>
            <li> The skin is soft, it does not damage it, and leaves it feeling smooth and rejuvenated.</li>

            <li> I registered TWICE, thinking that maybe the first time I had made a mistake somewhere.</li>

            <li> It was much smoother than it had ever felt before!  </li>

            <li> I used the body brush first on my feet and than switched to the pumice stone.</li>

            <li> Love the different brushes for the body it comes with.</li>
            <li> Love all the different attachments that can be used on face or body.</li>
            <li> I am willing to buy it again as a gift.</li>
            <li> I used the body brush and the pumice stone attachment for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li> This is my first microdermabrasion kit purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good tool, and I am thinking of getting it as a gift for a few women.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin very soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product and absolutely love that I can use them wet or dry.</li>
            <li> my face feels so soft!!!!</li>
            <li> This is not the case with this cleaning brush system because it really gets your pores clean &amp; gets all the dirt you have on your face that you would normally miss if you just manually did it.</li>
            <li> ESS thank u for an amazing product that delivers for a fraction of the price than other competitors out there.</li>
            <li> Very good for everyday or multiple times a week.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am very happy with the facial brush, and I have no doubt the other brushes and the pumice stone will make me equally happy.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a week now together with my clean and clear face wash and face treatment</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so clean &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> Seems like that never gets enough or good enough.</li>
            <li> Love that comes with different attachments but really wish that it was electrically charged.</li>
            <li> Not only does it feel really good after a stressful day, but it actually works!</li>
            <li> My daughter , 15 yrs.old used a different brush on face- sensitive- acne on forehead and liked how ir felt.</li>
            <li> Secondly, when you purchase this brush system, the company wants you to register the warranty at their website and they will give you a coupon and some more information.  </li>
            <li> I plan to return this product promptly unless there are more firm heads available.</li>
            <li> -really makes me feel clean especially getting the remaining make-up off my face after I have removed my make-up with special remover.  </li>
            <li> I was slightly hesitant to order this, but I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li> The soft brush feels luxurious, the spin isn&#x27;t so fast that one can&#x27;t control it, and it really does a fine job exfoliating my skin.  </li>
            <li> Makes my face super soft!</li>
            <li> It makes them super soft!</li>
            <li> Though I do find is a little amusing that the box the items came in feels of better quality than the actual product.</li>
            <li> the first time I used it, it made my dry skin on my legs disappear and feel fantastic!</li>
            <li> I had immediate positive results.</li>
            <li> I went off of all the positive reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> She thinks it is great and was amazed at the price compared to what some other brands cost for a similar product.  </li>
            <li> I had on a full face of makeup and using this completely removed all of it.</li>
            <li> The brissles are nice and soft and really get deep into your skin.</li>
            <li> I had to find the perfect product, it had to have a good amount of positive reviews and was in my budget, which I have to add (my budget) was very low due to the unfortunate shortage of money.</li>
            <li> I was able to use the normal face brush for a couple weeks before the same thing happened to that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The various attachments easily snap on and off.</li>
            <li> I love the versatility, can be used in shower and dry.  </li>
            <li> The various attachments easily snap on and off.</li>
            <li> Have to buy batteries But seems to last a good long while.</li>
            <li> The battery isn&#x27;t as strong and lasting.</li>
            <li> and I loved it so much that I purchased it for my niece this past Christmas.  </li>
            <li> The face brush did an amazing job at cleaning around my nose, and I felt that it was really getting down into the pores.  </li>
            <li> The large body brush worked well.  </li>
            <li> This product has made a large impact in my skin regimen.</li>
            <li> product itself comes with 4 brushes, 1 large and 3 miniature.</li>
            <li> I wanted to us it long enough to be able to give a accurate review.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this item as it performs very well so far, for a very reasonable price, compared to a major competitor currently being advertised.</li>
            <li> First - right after the procedure of exfoliating you go directly to your freezer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been rinsing them off really well and leaving them out to dry, but want to know if there&#x27;s a better way to do it.</li>
            <li> For the price - it&#x27;s a great buy, I have seen brushes 4-5 times more expensive and looks like they are doing the exact same job.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to those who want clean soft akin.</li>
            <li> the only downside is it seems the brush could be somewhat stronger, but it seems to get the job done just fine</li>
            <li> The body brush is surprisingly large and really works.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t scrub so hard as to irrate sensitive skin but does a great job in cleaning</li>
            <li> And for the first time in a long time, my feet are smooth...</li>
            <li> Emailed the company, who replied very rapidly, asking if there were any tricks to getting the battery compartment open and they sent me detailed instructions.</li>
            <li> I am now a huge fan of Essential Skin Solutions!!</li>
            <li> well this really has helped it opens my pores and allows the acne medication to really get in.  </li>
            <li> I also, really appreciate the seller reaching out to see if I had any questions and offering suggestion for use.</li>
            <li> this is a very practical..</li>
            <li> My skin is ultra smooth, and I think I look younger already!</li>
            <li> It not only looks tighter, but feels smooth to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed too much of a difference on my body, but it&#x27;s helped a lot with my acne.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Gentle</li>
            <li> I really searched and read a lot of reviews before I made my purchase</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> You also get a free gift for writing a review which is the only reason why I&#x27;m writing this.</li>
            <li> I have a very oily face</li>
            <li> Well it&#x27;s very inexpensive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not using it very often</li>
            <li> The pumice stone works really well, too.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> it does not seem to do much at all.</li>
            <li> The company wants your money and that is it.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Dead cells&amp;#34; is a very convenient term for the cosmetics companies to urge customers to use the brush every day.</li>

            <li> Very lightweight &amp; portable.</li>
            <li> It left my skin soooo smooth.</li>
            <li> Ok for face, however not much use for the body.</li>
            <li> I feel like my skin is much smoother and softer.  </li>
            <li> and it has really cleared up my acne.  </li>
            <li> Just received my brush a few days ago &amp; im in love so far, my face &amp; body has never felt so smooth.</li>
            <li> Company very helpful with information.</li>
            <li> If I wanted to scrub my whole body with this thing...</li>
            <li> Perhaps the one I received was defective but it seems the way the two pieces attach is very flimsy.</li>
            <li> This product really works in real life👍</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I appreciated the email.</li>
            <li> and it has really improved my skin already.  </li>
            <li> I have not used the foot add-on yet because my feet are smooth already, but I will try it later.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> so I have to exfoliate a lot, and this is really helping to get in there</li>
            <li> I really wanted to give one of these a try to see if it could help.    </li>
            <li> So you can do your face, whole body and feet with this one set.  </li>
            <li> I feel like when I am done that my face is so much cleaner than just washing with my hands or a washcloth.  </li>
            <li> My whole household loves this.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.  </li>
            <li> The seller is very proactive and sent me an email when I ordered this system with some tips on how to use and how to register for the warranty.</li>

            <li> , It looks so much brighter and healthier.</li>
            <li> Since I started using it, my face has really cleared up.</li>
            <li> In fact my daughter saw mine and wants one now.</li>
            <li> My skin gets dirty from working in a kitchen, and this cleans my skin perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Worked really well.</li>
            <li> What I like so much about this unit is the body brush.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This really brightens my complextion and tightens my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle too.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the stone to much.</li>

            <li> , it&#x27;s working better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> The seller was very helpful in fulfilling their warranty obligation &amp; I received a replacement.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> My Mother has callus and and I went straight for the foot attachment to test the product.</li>
            <li> After much research, I chose ESS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so much the system in itself, it&#x27;s the brushes.  </li>
            <li> The price is set is very affordable.  </li>
            <li> It does cleanse the face gently.</li>
            <li> Skin felt so much smoother after using.</li>
            <li> but it works really well.</li>
            <li> All I know is that it did not do much to my feet at all.  </li>
            <li> It works very well for me.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> But it just doesnt have as much power as i was hoping for.</li>
            <li> So happy, as many products like this can really be expensive and do the same things.</li>
            <li> Really like the way this product makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Take good care of it before your skin gets rough enough.</li>
            <li> I love it left my skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li> And, from my everyday use of the set, I have noticed a really nice difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> The turning mechanism is incredibly slow and trying to use this in the shower or bath requires a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> As a result, I tried the other brush and it was very light and gentle, which is the one I now use every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a result, I tried the other brush and it was very light and gentle, which is the one I now use every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin feels amazing and there is even a slight visible improvement after just two uses!</li>
            <li> We did have a minor snafu with the unit, but the company &#x27;not amazon&#x27; sent us a new one,  headache free!</li>
            <li> The brush is very useful for exfoliating the skin, both on the face and your entire body.</li>
            <li> and this brush is every bit as good, if not better, than the competition!</li>
            <li> Something like a clean and clear thin liquid face wash consistency should work good.</li>
            <li> Something like a clean and clear thin liquid face wash consistency should work good.</li>
            <li> Bought this mainly for the large body brush included in the package.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried so many other stuff</li>
            <li> I use my normal facial soap on it and get it good and wet then move it all over my face.  </li>
            <li> so I had to pay $15 extra than the original price that I&#x27;d seen.</li>
            <li> The price is MUCH better than the other options out there</li>
            <li> Sorry for the jumbly review - and good luck!</li>
            <li> clearer pores are clearer and my face feels extra clean every use.</li>
            <li> It not only clean well</li>
            <li> really good.it really prepares your face for your skin regime.use the regular face brush few times a week and in between use the sensitive  brush.the body brush works great too</li>
            <li> Really makes your face feel much cleaner than normal washing.</li>
            <li> My face feels really clean after using it, and I use the big brush on my body.</li>
            <li> I use this several times a week to clean my face.</li>
            <li> It does clean deep!</li>
            <li> I saw this brush, decent reviews and reasonable price</li>
            <li> The stone to scrub the dead skin off of my feet is the perfect size, helps get in to the small areas of my feet and toes.</li>
            <li> My skin felt very clean and tight from the first use.</li>
            <li> for me, the brushes are way too soft and the unit does not rotate very fast at all...</li>
            <li> it was strong enough to clear away spots on my skin that are prone to ingrown hair ...</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and these brushes feel amazing on my skin I&#x27;ve been using it everyday since I got it.</li>
            <li> Keeps her skin clear, and does exactly what it says it does.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for any skin type, however if you have sensitive skin like I do, be sure to use the sensitive brush only on your face.</li>
            <li> My face is smoother and the pumice attachment has really helped keep some areas of psoriasis from being as scaly as they normally would be.</li>
            <li> The motor is not too fast or too slow, the speed is just perfect to get the dead skin off and also exfoliate my face.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend allowing the brushes to air dry before placing them back into their box, which is a great hard shell box that allows for easy storage.</li>
            <li> , it sounds kind of extreme to have such a large brush</li>
            <li> I also think it could spin faster, it does not have much power and my face could use a little more intensity....</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be a typical man, make sure you read the instructions because there is a trick to inserting the batteries.  </li>
            <li> I feel as though my wrinkles are less prominent when I used this device.</li>
            <li> The only good time to do the exfoliation is when there are a few cloudy/ rainy days in a row.</li>
            <li> product has Refill brushes, this was one of the main reasons I bought it.  </li>
            <li> product has Refill brushes, this was one of the main reasons I bought it.  </li>
            <li> Love the brushes, especially the big one for the shower.</li>
            <li> I love the facial brush, I feel it deeply cleanses my face.</li>
            <li> I used the smaller brush on my face with me regular cleanser, my face has never felt cleaner ot more refreshed.</li>
            <li> I really, really love the body brush and regular facial brush.  </li>
            <li> Of this &amp;#34;type&amp;#34;, this is my 3rd or 4th one because they all keep breaking, however out of the box this one&#x27;s quality was evident and considering all the others only use two batteries and issues as for I&#x27;m hopeful that this will have more durability,  but,  hands down,  the brushes and everything else I go,  a genuine value purchase</li>
            <li> It was very soft and gentle on my face, not at all abrasive.</li>
            <li> I also found an unexpected positive result from using the body brush today.</li>
            <li> After a long day working (and swearing) in the garden, it&#x27;s great to jump in the shower and use the body brush to hit my back/shoulders/neck with the rotating brush and clear away all the sunscreen and dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li> But if you don&#x27;t have this I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Recommend it highly</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this face/body brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to buy one of these for a while but never wanted to spend the money on the high priced systems you see in the store or spas.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this kit.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to operate and the bristles are soft enough to feel comfortable as they clean yet strong enough to do the dirty work.</li>
            <li> So when I found this one by ESS, I decided to do a little digging to see if there are others that are better.  </li>
            <li> and they seem to do a little better.</li>
            <li> My face feels extra clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I had trouble opening the battery compartment at first, like a lot of others, but once you figure out where to squeeze you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> works very well, my face fells so soft</li>
            <li> It made my skin so soft really cleaned it well.</li>
            <li> The way it&#x27;s designed is to be a snug fit so that it can be used in wet conditions.</li>
            <li> Skin exfoliating face brush- Gentle for cleansing or buffing sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was surprised I would like it as much as I did.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a great buy and not as expensive as the others.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the soft facial brush and body brush daily and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that its battery powered, but for the price its totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Helpful instructions about putting the batteries in and using the product are sent with the product box they are sent through email (e.g., squeeze the sides of the battery compartment to get it to open), which I don&#x27;t find that useful.</li>
            <li> I think it was the brush though because I used the exfoliater before I even used the normal one.</li>
            <li> I received my skin solutions a few days ago and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I have now been using the brush for &#x27;not sensitive skin &#x27;for 2 weeks and my skin is definitely smoother and feels better.</li>
            <li> I really loved this product, I felt that it helped me with not only my acne but also helped me get rid of all that dead skin and calluses on my feet!</li>
            <li> Love it, use it almost everyday</li>
            <li> love it, use it everyday</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the soft facial brush and body brush daily and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> It makes for a smoother, more long lasting shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Takes me longer than normal to shower with it</li>
            <li> For all the people saying they broke out after using it, that&#x27;s a normal occurrence (esthetician here) after using an exfoliating product/tool like this.</li>
            <li> I prefer to have the instructions right in the box when I open it.</li>
            <li> I use the facial brush 2-3 times a week, maybe less, and my face feels great every single time.</li>
            <li> even with brand new duracell batteries.</li>
            <li> Company has responded and they are sending me a new wand.</li>
            <li> I put 4 new batteries in it and used it once</li>
            <li> but like it&#x27;s about to die (brand new batteries).</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower a few days a week &amp; am feeling my skin smile as well!!</li>
            <li> I then used the palm of my hand and did a slight twist and the battery cover opened easily.</li>
            <li> Quickly got rid of pesky dry patches on my face.</li>
            <li> It works better than I expected and is actually nicer than the spa ones I have used.</li>
            <li> It not only cleared my acne, but my pores are much smaller and my skin feels so smooth.  </li>
            <li> I love that it comes with both a soft and firm brush attachment</li>
            <li> Not too heavy, not to light, with an easy grip to hold without it slipping away in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was annoyed and secretly happy that I had to work a double shift.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft and do not aggravate my skin when I use them.</li>
            <li> The brushes are both very soft and I can&#x27;t imagine how these will exfoliate my face.</li>
            <li> puts ESS above the other waterproof systems I researched is the ability to easily replace the brushes at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> The body scrub made me soft as a babies bottom!</li>
            <li> A bit harsh on the skin, even the sensitive one, but really nice quality especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I was done with the cleaning process my face was so soft!</li>
            <li> It felt so soft!</li>
            <li> My face and body feel so soft after my shower!  </li>
            <li> Initially, I was going to order from another competitor but after revising and comparing reviews and my budget essential skin solutions was definitely the top runner.</li>
            <li> I definitely notice a difference when I use it consistently</li>
            <li> i have oily skin and it works wonders to remove the access oil and make my skin soft!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> my skin has never felt so soft!</li>
            <li> first reaction when I put the batteries into the Essential Skin Solutions brush system ...</li>
            <li> the two face brushes are nice, the rough one is not to rough and the soft one is not to soft.</li>
            <li> And, seriously I looked much younger after getting such a good clean it likely sloughed off old skin too.  </li>
            <li> I really like it so far.... except the body brush won&#x27;t stay on and replacements cost the same as a new item from competitors!</li>
            <li> Since using it for the past 2 weeks his skin looks great without all those harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> The item it&#x27;s self is a cheap plastic, with an odd feeling grip.</li>
            <li> I have been using the facial soft brush morning and night for a week now and really like how my face feels afterwards!</li>
            <li> You can finally get the full benefit from using your facial creams,eye creams,oils, or whatever</li>
            <li> The body brushes are pretty nice though the sluffing stone is slightly useless.</li>
            <li> Also, this product doesn&#x27;t spin very quickly--it&#x27;s actually super slow--and it stops working if you apply even a little bit of pressure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would be nice to have an individual large replacement brush heads, since that is definitely one of the features that this set offers that all the other similar brush makers do not have.</li>
            <li> I love that you can use it wet or dry.</li>
            <li> The handle is wide enough to hold with easy and maneuver.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m loving this system and I use it at least 4 times a week!</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter has acne and I have large, visible pores.  </li>
            <li> $10 less than the original item for brushes?  </li>
            <li> I have had facial brushes in the past and mainly bought this for the body brush, but I absolutely love everything in this kit.</li>
            <li> It feels so gentle like the face one, but the clean is just doing such a better job than other things, and I have used a lot of other things for body scrubbing, especially the back.  </li>
            <li> I started off using the sensitive skin face brush with my facial cleanser, and my face felt much softer after each shower.</li>
            <li> It was great for a few months and then finally stopped working a few days before the warranty.</li>
            <li> So far I am really liking this Skin/body brushing cleaning system from Essential Skin Solutions.</li>
            <li> Use this with PanOxyl in the shower and it has helped to clear that up.</li>
            <li> My face and body feels soft and clean after using and not stripped and dry as I thought it would by using the brushes daily.</li>
            <li> I tried using it even though it was broken, because I could still fit it on there, it just wouldn&#x27;t secure so it fell off constantly while I used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been considering getting the Clarisonic for awhile now but was iffy on spending near $200 for it.</li>
            <li> Applying face wash onto the brush head and then cleansing my face causes the face wash to lather up so much and then bubbles start flying in all different directions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it for sensitive and oily skin to help smoothen the skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> There are several things I really like about this unit.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft after using this product.</li>
            <li> I would really like a replacement though considering it only worked for a week</li>
            <li> Works like a charm, cleans skin &amp; leaves it soft.  </li>
            <li> ; BUT then I started using it, the sensitive skin brush, on my face.....</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> So far no issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and durable.</li>
            <li> I even recorded and gave it to my 38 yr old daughter.</li>
            <li> For my face I just opted for the sensitive skin brush because I preferred the softness of the bristles.</li>
            <li> The brush is way to soft.  </li>
            <li> So I decided to give this a try and so far (I&#x27;ve had it for about a month now)</li>
            <li> The brushes are all soft but still do the job well.</li>
            <li> THIS brush is different, it&#x27;s actually very well made.  </li>
            <li> , I did not know which face brush was the &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; cleaner or the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; and sensitive one.  </li>
            <li> I started using this because I wanted to have a glow and soft skin without the use of makeup.</li>
            <li> and I know this will help my folliculitis caused by my very curly facial hair.</li>
            <li> I have had the kit about a week now and use it every day with a sensitive skin foaming cleanser</li>
            <li> It has different brushes but is really a whole body kit.  </li>
            <li> and I use the sensitive one.  </li>
            <li> I also suffer from adult acne rosacea.</li>
            <li> but it has helped with pore size and made my skin soft.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel incredibly soft</li>
            <li> I give this product 5 stars because thus far I have received every bang for my buck.</li>
            <li> so I have mature sensitive skin, and use the softest brush in the package.</li>
            <li> and I nearly was going to cave--until I found this product miraculously.</li>
            <li> It came so fast and the product has really left me speechless</li>
            <li> I just ordered one for my mother as an early mother&#x27;s day gift as well.</li>
            <li> My skin is too sensitive to it.</li>
            <li> Not so soft</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 16 year old daughter for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li> and like it so far as well.</li>
            <li> I really like how well it deep cleans your face &amp; body versus manually washing it.</li>
            <li> deep cleans, minimizes pores and make the skin ready for maximum moisture absorption.</li>
            <li> I use it so much and extra attachments can be bought.</li>
            <li> I have tried the body brush and sensitive skin brush -</li>
            <li> Using a natural soap, she loves the results.</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised at how ineffective my hand face washing has been.</li>
            <li> The roughest spots on my body have never felt so soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough for face and neck</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I was very pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> My adult acne is clearing up after a month of use.</li>
            <li> It takes all the dirt and oils off of your face and leaves your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> While this is the only skin polishing brush I&#x27;ve ever tried, and it&#x27;s only the 3rd day I&#x27;ve tried it, my review is...not worth much weight.</li>
            <li> Brushes are holding up thus so far and keep there form.  </li>
            <li> I like that this has a body brush and can be used in the shower, the foot brush hasn&#x27;t been useful as I feel there isn&#x27;t enough power to use it properly.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny spent...</li>
            <li> It takes 4 AA batteries, not included, and that was probably the most difficult part was installing the batteries, but all you have to do is squeeze the handle and pull and it comes right off.</li>
            <li> I tried the Aqua Glycolic alone first and saw a slight improvement, so the brush is what really made the biggest difference.  </li>
            <li> As well, if there were other attachments for the feet like a gritty sandpaper one, or more with different harshness&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> As well, if there were other attachments for the feet like a gritty sandpaper one, or more with different harshness&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Works well, but the battery operated system is not powerful, quality is adequate for the price.</li>
            <li> Other than the battery compartment being hard to open, I love it!!</li>
            <li> My face is smoother and less dry, my body feels more toned and toes</li>
            <li> It helps clean your skin deep its not to rough on your skin it can be used on your face and your body.</li>
            <li> And the scrubber it self is not durable after using it a few times , I was so excited about getting this</li>
            <li> Gentle enough for everyday use, and I have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I only wish it went slightly faster to get better friction, especially for use with the pumice attachment.</li>
            <li> Today I used the big body brush over my entire body (except for my face) and I think it worked very well!</li>
            <li> I think it is the exact same, in fact, with just a different logo smacked on to it.</li>
            <li> Too many batteries are needed for such a small product.</li>
            <li> Next I had to attach a brush head to the unit and that was pretty simple to do.</li>
            <li> But when I used the soft normal face brush my face became extremely red and irritated.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it out, I took a shower and used the big body brush and the deep cleansing face brush.  </li>
            <li> I applied a hydrating facial cleanser, put on the normal face brush (there&#x27;s a sensitive one too) and started with my forehead.</li>
            <li> As far as I could tell from their site and here, there are no other heads than what is shown.  </li>
            <li> As far as I could tell from their site and here, there are no other heads than what is shown.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be of the same high quality as the fancy name brand face cleaner</li>
            <li> I use it on my feet after a long soak and it really helps to recirculate the blood and do away with callousness.</li>
            <li> i read a few negative reviews and several great reviews before purchasing this product.  </li>
            <li> After using it for the first time, she stated that the rough skin on her chin and forehead was gone.  </li>
            <li> also used the large brush on my body, no soap, just dry.</li>
            <li> I contacted them per the instructions on the warranty and they shipped a new one the very next day!  </li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable compared to some other skin cleansing brushes .</li>
            <li> My one complaint is the motor drains the four AA batteries very quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this thing, the only complaint I have is that it&#x27;s battery-run rather than rechargeable, but perhaps that&#x27;s what you get with a waterproof scrubber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really helps me get my face deep cleaned, especially helpful in getting every bit of makeup out of my pores.</li>
            <li> If I used the edges I was able to get the dead skin off my toes, but not the rough skin on my heels, even after a soak in water.  </li>
            <li> It would help if the sensitive skin brush was marked as such but</li>
            <li> I have only used the sensitive brush on my face so far</li>
            <li> I would suggest using Alkaline if you have those laying around they last much longer than the regular</li>
            <li> I would suggest using Alkaline if you have those laying around they last much longer than the regular</li>
            <li> So, this was a major factor for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, this was a major factor for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now the other two are tougher to tell apart since they look identical at first.  </li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and was a little worried the first time I used the facial brush, but I swear, some of the dark spots were not even noticeable.</li>
            <li> I come from a very humid environment and moved to a very dry climate.</li>
            <li> I had a skin peel and it&#x27;s helping to remove the dead skin in the first use!</li>
            <li> I have figured out how hard to press the unit to my face based on what feels comfortable for me.  </li>
            <li> This is too bad as when it worked, it worked great.</li>
            <li> Bacne is a real problem, and apparently pretty common; if this can be part of the solution, it should be offered separately and maketed that way as well to make it easier for people to find.</li>
            <li> I need to clear up my hyper-pigmentation and the deep scars from years of battling acne.</li>
            <li> So far I am using the system daily and am sold on the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this 3 times so far</li>
            <li> but since u get two of them I didn&#x27;t worry about so much but now the second one is starting to do the same thing.</li>
            <li> My husband actually noticed how soft it feels.</li>
            <li> and my pores are barely visible.</li>
            <li> When I woke up my face was still red and was now also sensitive.</li>
            <li> Basically, I had adult acne on my shoulders/back, face &amp; neck and this has helped immensely in clearing that up.  </li>
            <li> I use the sensitive face brush and find that it has enough scrubbing power for my face.</li>
            <li> (I use the soft face brush and he uses the regular) and noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> So far, I have only used each of the brushes once</li>
            <li> Got this as a present for a young friend.</li>
            <li> The facial brush has completely cleared my skin and reduced the oiliness of my skin.</li>
            <li> Or you can use this daily if you are a frequent user of this like I</li>
            <li> I did not really use this much as the others since I already have a callus remover I use specifically for this.</li>
            <li> One regular and one sensitive.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish it has is to replace all brush heads for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the sensitive skin brush on my face once daily.</li>
            <li> It worked okay, not great, but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of two sided as well, in order to truly make it waterproof, I believe they had to make it this difficult, so it&#x27;s a blessing and a curse...</li>
            <li> its and ok product, not great</li>
            <li> Maybe its because I usually exfoliate with products but its not painful or anything.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve tried it, for an unbelievable price, I will be purchasing another at full price as a gift.  </li>
            <li> (Okay, in reality I was secretly planning on hijacking the brushing system from the time I placed the order...</li>
            <li> it slows down and sometimes stops completely, despite how new or old the batteries are.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was using the &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; brush the first time I used it, so I thought it was the softer one, I was aware I was using the wrong one after my skin reacted so negatively.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was using the &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; brush the first time I used it, so I thought it was the softer one, I was aware I was using the wrong one after my skin reacted so negatively.  </li>
            <li> I have persistent cystic acne which flares up hormonally and due to stress, so the fact that the body brush is exfoliating really worked for me.</li>
            <li> I found the other reviews very helpful before purchasing the product.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I really like it.</li>
            <li> If HAVING PROBLEMS OPENING IT just put a RUBBER BAND around the battery compartment handle and push it open -- I use the wide bands that come on vegetables and it works fine with less strength.  </li>
            <li> How did I live this long without one of these!  </li>
            <li> The only only other thing I would say is when you use it near your eyes use our fingertips to hold your skin in place so that it doesn&#x27;t move your skin around too much</li>
            <li> Winter really does a number on my face, leaving it dry and flaky, and even at middle age, I sometimes have breakouts and red patches.  </li>
            <li> , I also am relieved it comes with both a regular and sensitive facial brush.</li>
            <li> Once a week I use this with the sensitive brush head and a simple cleanser, CeraVe foaming facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> The only two cons so far is the battery compartment is a pain to open and in lieu of four AA batteries</li>
            <li> several times before I even wrote a review … to which I did except for the brush for sensitive facial skin … I did not use it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The constant rotation has broke up a major portion of scar tissue and is improving.  </li>
            <li> I decided to switch to the regular small face brush, and not only does my face feel super soft, but my pores also look smaller and lighter!</li>
            <li> The deep cleaning face brush was not rough on my skin at all</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and soaked and dried them first</li>
            <li> Save your dollars and buy an oscillating brush- because this spins in one direction is pulls your skin a bit and is pretty messy (flings soap everywhere).  </li>
            <li> I have had no problems with putting in the batteries or with the brush stopping, and I was pushing pretty firmly.</li>
            <li> and I have seen a large reduction of black heads and pores.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to put it down.</li>
            <li> Brushes wear down fast.</li>
            <li> I began using the small sensitive brush on my face and the large body brush on the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> The regular facial brush and the sensitive facial brush feel the same.</li>
            <li> it is soft enough to do a deep cleanse with my regular facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> One use on my body made my skin so soft and got rid of dry flakes.  </li>
            <li> otherwise it loses umph quick.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be stronger spin... when I put the big body brush head on, it really slows down.</li>
            <li> The small hard one is great to remove dead skin</li>
            <li> Same as the higher priced units on the market for much less!</li>
            <li> I like to use non-foaming facial cleanser, and I can use less with the brush and feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li> The ONLY reason I rated it 1 star was to attract attention of buyers to a very important warning: the instructions to this cleansing set are incredibly vague and incomplete.</li>
            <li> Gives a very thorough cleaning with little effort.</li>
            <li> The little pumice rock doesn&#x27;t really work that we&#x27;ll though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it daily and my dark spots are fading and when I get new blemishes they fade faster than before I started using this brush.</li>
            <li> The larger brush is meant to use on your body, the two smaller brushes on your face (one is for regular skin, the other for sensitive skin) and a pumice stone  </li>
            <li> Then, for no apparent reason, the body brush would not remain attached to the handle and would fall off several times during each use.</li>
            <li> Only small negative: I am used to firmer bristles for a body brush with more exfoliating power.  </li>
            <li> second time I used the brush dry,  the third time with the facial soap.</li>
            <li> My face is smooth and glowing, no more blackheads, whiteheads or dead skin.</li>
            <li> I use the small brush for my face and the large brush for my body.  </li>
            <li> The way that the brushes attach, isn&#x27;t in a secure way and the plastic piece around the brush at the attachment point is not really ideal to stand up to the on and off and movement of it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really help with that though :/</li>
            <li> I started pressing the sides of the unit at first, so I could see where that bit of instructions in the manual can get confusing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made and seems like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> The normal brush head feels a bit harsh on my body.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find that, the morning after I first used the brush, my skin felt softer than usual and slightly dewy!  </li>
            <li> The big head is for body and small heads are mainly for face.</li>
            <li> Also, it has helped clear up the little bumps on my upper arms.</li>
            <li> The facial brush was a little soft for me</li>
            <li> I have used other, more expensive face cleansing brushes and this by far surpasses the other brands.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and used my favorite facial soap and the small white brush on my face for approximately 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Installing the batteries is pretty tricky, but I received an email from ESS and they clearly defined how to open the battery compartment and a brief description as to why it is a little tough to open.  </li>
            <li> As a 32 yr old with adult acne, I can tell you this is one beauty tool i found about 20 years too late.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was if you bare down tomuch on the brush  it messes with the spinning of the brush.  </li>
            <li> and my feet are not very dry or rough.</li>
            <li> Just like I tell my clients, do a precleanse with your hands to remove makeup and loose debris then use the brush for a deep cleanse/exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with black heads in my upper back and an occasional break out.</li>
            <li> But, it didn&#x27;t stop under a little pressure, and it did take off a lot of old skin after feet were soaked in the bath.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough the use under your eyes (one of my long-standing milia popped!), and tough enough to use the pumice attachment on my feet.</li>
            <li> It does not stop when you press down a little, and this is Super Plus, because the reality is we need a little pressure to do these things.  </li>
            <li> If you deal with whiteheads, I&#x27;m not sure if it would be too rough or not because it does scrub really vigorously.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about a face washing brush at first because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It comes with the cleaning unit, one big body brush, one sensitive skin face brush, one small face brush, and one pumice.  </li>
            <li> I went back in with my toner and there was absolutely no trace of any residue from makeup.</li>
            <li> The brush heads are also extremely soft, not too harsh on the skin at all.</li>
            <li> Something like this that we intend to use for a long while, needs to have parts acceptable</li>
            <li> Something like this that we intend to use for a long while, needs to have parts acceptable</li>
            <li> When I opened the box, the sensitive skin exfoliating face brush is missing.</li>
            <li> (sensitive brush) on my face for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Before I purchase this product I spent lots of mony on facial sessions</li>
            <li> The price is lower than what I used to spent for one facial sessions.</li>
            <li> like this product, in only a couple days it has done what I expected it would do in a week.  </li>
            <li> like this product, in only a couple days it has done what I expected it would do in a week.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s minor</li>
            <li> Not too harsh on my face but not to soft on my body.  </li>
            <li> This was not really a problem, especially since you don&#x27;t change batteries that often.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the brush for sensitive skin everyday for about 3weeks now and the exfoliating brush about once a week</li>
            <li> As long as this one continues to work correctly, I would reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> In most cases it will leave dark incurable spots.</li>
            <li> In fact as long as it&#x27;s not a rash type breakout, it&#x27;s a good thing (even though we all hate it).</li>
            <li> Only advantage is I can use it wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I had to clean the brush several times in that initial scrubbing because it was getting so dirty</li>
            <li> All the dry itchy skin is long gone.</li>
            <li> The other brush attachments are the same way...</li>
            <li> Wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to buy this!  </li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve tried exfoliating scrubs, gloves, and brushes, but they never worked anywhere near as well as this did!</li>
            <li> The big body brush was actually the reason I chose this kit over other kits that only contained small facial brushes.</li>
            <li> I only use it about every other day.</li>
            <li> It was definitely softer than the other one.</li>
            <li> Then I will spritz some alcohol to desanitize and then let it fully dry.</li>
            <li> so you can use it on your feet for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> with the dry skin</li>
            <li> After I finish, I pat my face dry and apply a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Our son has some dry patches on his legs</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush because I have some dry patches in between my eyes and around my nose that I cannot get rid of.</li>
            <li> Although it works, it causes skin to constantly be dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> update -I use it dry.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully on my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> It was not powerful enough to slough off any of the dry skin of callouses from my feet.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised, because I usually need help opening things like jars and sometimes even water bottles.  </li>
            <li> Some say that it&#x27;s not powerful enough</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even bother wetting the brush as long as my face is wet.</li>
            <li> So many of the brushes were very expensive.  </li>
            <li> It only works if you hold down the button on it.</li>
            <li> To open the housing, I pressed down, pulled, and turned a little.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will definitely tell other people about this product!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been surviving for so long without it!!</li>
            <li> My old one was not able to be used wet or dry....</li>
            <li> I have tried various cheaper facial &amp; body brushes in the past and it has never worked out well</li>
            <li> At first, I was worried about opening the battery housing because people mentioned it was difficult to open.  </li>
            <li> The unit is water proof and can be used wet or dry and with or without soap.      </li>
            <li> I like how you can use this wet or dry.</li>
            <li> This product can be used wet or dry.....</li>
            <li> Well, when I got out of the shower today, I noticed that the dark areas look much, much lighter than usual!</li>
            <li> Battery access was simple to find but a little difficult to open at first.</li>
            <li> Obviously it&#x27;s not meant to be submerged, but the battery compartment is tightly sealed and keeps the moisture</li>
            <li> while using it, it gets a little tricky in trying to open the battery cover even after pinching the device on both sides.</li>
            <li> But it is a little diffrent to open the battery compartment.</li>
            <li> My pores look a little smaller and visibly clogged pore that I&#x27;ve had for awhile is gone.</li>
            <li> I say spend a little extra money.</li>
            <li> Was a little smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving this a three star is the need to pinch the sides so hard to get the battery compartment open.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the battery compartment was hard to open</li>
            <li> only negative is the battery case and trying to open it.</li>
            <li> You can really tell this item deep cleans your face and would recommend this to anyone who is unhappy with just regular washing-</li>
            <li> I find it easier to thoroughly wet my face, use my hands to spread my face wash, and then use the brush.</li>
            <li> If I do wet the brush</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great brush for keeping your face cleansed and exfoliated, just not for my poor old pathetic feet!  </li>
            <li> and I never got the interior wet or anything.</li>
            <li> This cleansing  set is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Not much power.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to get your hair caught in the brush mechanism.</li>
            <li> Comes with a wide range of choices of brushes to choose from</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Package came in as expected.</li>
            <li> My hubby has used this product on his rough areas and loves it as well.  </li>
            <li> I Only wish it had another speed setting and came with a few spare brush heads.</li>
            <li> The rough patches were almost gone when I broke it...</li>
            <li> I have only had this product for a few days and just started using it three days ago.</li>
            <li> They never sent me a certificate of warranty, and within a few short months, the brush gave out.</li>
            <li> However, be careful on your face.</li>
            <li> It removes the dead skin and exfoliates the skin deeply.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks, and a notice a big improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious to see how the &amp;#34;unclogging&amp;#34; breakout time goes</li>
            <li> Ive read a few of the questions and I have never had it stop when applying moderate pressure at all.  </li>
            <li> Over the last few years, I&#x27;ve began to have rough patches of skin on my face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the price and compares to those other expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> So some sensitive areas of my face were raw for a few days after because it felt like a massage</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the callous remover is not powerful enough.</li>
            <li> My skin is looking brighter and less dry.</li>
            <li> but an added benefit is that a little face cleanser now goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Not splotchy or irritated, and some of those uneven areas seemed less obvious.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other alternative.</li>
            <li> I have seen other systems that come with a sponge instead</li>
            <li> and I use this every other day</li>
            <li> Next I used the small face exfoliater and it did the job too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it compares to the $100+ models, but this does the trick and only put me out about $30!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why the other person who wrote a review stating you can&#x27;t use this every day.</li>
            <li> but it can be used on other areas where you may have acne!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will get around to using the other attachments.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s using it every other day now to get her skin use to it and avoid irritation.</li>
            <li> Although I still used other scrubbers</li>
            <li> I have lots of oil spots on my skin due to improper cleaning over the years.</li>
            <li> I will tell other people about it.</li>
            <li> This one works just like the other one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but the other ones make up for it.</li>
            <li> Only tiny problem was that it was very hard to remove the lid to put batteries in.</li>
            <li> Let it air dry!!!</li>
            <li> Let it air dry!!!</li>
            <li> I also wasted to start dry brushing</li>
            <li> I would have preferred to have at least one brush that had a little less soft bristles.  </li>
            <li> I have a very hard time with these systems because of my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I accidentally left the kit behind on a week long vacation and by the time I returned my face had blackheads and small breakouts, but the next day after using it again I could already feel them subsiding.</li>
            <li> but you have to be little careful when you use that head on your face.</li>
            <li> Bristles are a little rough on my face, but it works</li>
            <li> other one that has less bristles is the exfoliation brush.  </li>
            <li> Its hard to get the battery compartment open</li>
            <li> My pores seemed larger, my skin was dull looking etc.</li>
            <li> Hard to do back and shoulders</li>
            <li> Oh and follow the directions to open it or you will have a hard time.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as an exfoliating face brush, but I was shocked how much I enjoy using it to exfoliate the rest of my body.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is how to get the battery cover off we figured it out</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it may help with my acne, acne scarring and dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> For the first few days it is extremely vulnerable.</li>
            <li> Actually, I tell my clients to never ever wipe the face (unless it is a winter season and the temperature is below 32 – in this case you have to allow yourself at least 40 min before leaving the house).</li>
            <li> Actually, I tell my clients to never ever wipe the face (unless it is a winter season and the temperature is below 32 – in this case you have to allow yourself at least 40 min before leaving the house).</li>
            <li> The second complaint was the speed.</li>
            <li> At first I was frustrated because the battery area would not open</li>
            <li> I have a lot of dark acne scars and while this product doesn&#x27;t promise to make them disappear, my skin does look healthier than it has in years.  </li>
            <li> and it really helps the expensive face washes I use to get deeper into the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You just have the squeeze the sides and pull it down.</li>
            <li> For the money it&#x27;s a winner hands down.</li>
            <li> so I cut it down to 2x a week.</li>
            <li> Not much, but other products are a complete fail because they stop under any pressure.</li>
            <li> It was a little hard to open it for batteries</li>
            <li> I put the batteries in wrong and had to open the compartment a second time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the body brush twice and have already noticed less of them.</li>
            <li> But I have tired both the sensitive and the firm brush.</li>
            <li> Crappy product stopped working less than a week after I got it.</li>
            <li> Had it for less than 3 months and it already stopped working.</li>
            <li> I got home and was in the tub in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> The brushes have an odd smell to them.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the case that holds the batteries simply cracked (no drops/falls/etc) and now can&#x27;t hold the batteries in place and obviously is no longer water tight.</li>
            <li> no more rough, cracked heals.</li>
            <li> I have a few dark spots and those</li>
            <li> I think I would use this one daily and the small one after a really hard day.</li>
            <li> I have had it a little over a month</li>
            <li> know the brush heads can start to get a little gunk after a bunch of uses.</li>
            <li> because the water does NOT get into it (like the other &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; brushes I have purchased in the past).  </li>
            <li> I still have a little bit of dryness</li>
            <li> I have to say I was a little hesitate in ordering because of the reviews stating that the motor did not work/</li>
            <li> and I put just a little pressure on my skin</li>
            <li> The unit was tough to open, but my 9 and 10 yr olds worked together and got it loaded with batteries, no problem.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t any other heads to add!!  </li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t any other heads to add!!  </li>
            <li> I had trouble with the on/off switch.</li>
            <li> He now uses it everyday and loves the way it makes his face feel.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few days now</li>
            <li> You remove a layer of dead cells.</li>
            <li> Please don’t use it on damaged skin (heavy acne, cuts, etc.)</li>
            <li> Please don’t use it on damaged skin (heavy acne, cuts, etc.)</li>
            <li> I received it on time but with one piece missing.</li>
            <li> This is now part of my everyday skin care.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with getting ingrown hairs on my legs after shaving</li>
            <li> I held off on writing a review until I had used a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Ive used it for about a week now and its helped buff away my rising acne and exfoliate the dead skin away.</li>
            <li> I could not get the brushes to attach firmly.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve only had it for approximately 2 weeks).  </li>
            <li> That being said after I used this everyday for a week my face started breaking out</li>
            <li> Just not for me, my skin is too sensitive unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Stone - Exfoliates &amp; smooths away your dead skin on your feet.</li>
            <li> so I can use it everyday without causing any flakiness.</li>
            <li> It has few heads which you can switch to.</li>
            <li> It feels substantial and not cheap.</li>
            <li> I bought this set a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> You can feel and see the difference; within a few days my pores were tightened and skin felt a bit smoother.</li>
            <li> I use it with a body scrub, the dead skin is just disappearing.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t heavy</li>
            <li> That just means all the gunk that was trapped was given a way up and out of your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now and can feel and see the difference.</li>
            <li> do another up date in a few months, I dont think anything will change except the batteries getting recharged.  </li>
            <li> Like in some of the other reviews, I had a hard time opening the battery cover.  </li>
            <li> and my normal face wash just wasn&#x27;t cutting it</li>
            <li> I seen a lot of improvement in the quality of my skin from use of this machine in the past few weeks.</li>
            <li> I used the small heavy bristle with a peach scrub and</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed with the speed of the brush when I first started using it</li>
            <li> first, I was a little disappointed with the pumice stone.  </li>
            <li> Save your money, or buy this for somebody who you really want to waste a lot of time and feel frustrated.</li>
            <li> and i dab just a little face wash then go to town!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried exfoliation products, creams, prescription products from my dermatologist, with very little improvement.  </li>
            <li> This product has very little power.</li>
            <li> but I was a little disappointed when the prices went up so fast without any notice</li>
            <li> only disappointment I received from this product is that mine had a few defects on the brushing system itself and since this is a gift I&#x27;ve become a little anxious.</li>
            <li> anxious to see the difference in my skin after another 2 weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m under 70 and have the usual hand strength for someone my age.</li>
            <li> it would always be difficult to get it open to change the batteries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the one I got was just defective?</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to try it because usually anything even remotely abrasive makes my acne worse.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having trouble lately with breaking out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few days and swear I can already see results!</li>
            <li> I am anxious to try it on my face.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t know that I should have removed my makeup first.. :(</li>
            <li> I usually keep this in my shower and use it when I wash my face.</li>
            <li> no better than a loufa at the 99 cent store</li>
            <li> I am not sure what I think about this product.</li>
            <li> Ill give it a shot and update my review when I actually use the product.</li>
            <li> I just recently threw away a motorized brush system from a DIFFERENT MANUFACTURER that was horrible and a waste of money because the motor was way too weak, actually it did not work at all once it touched the skin.  </li>
            <li> No, once again, the motor is going to be weak (because it sounded like the previous one.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s defective, but the button is really hard to press.</li>
            <li> , I find it a little weak for my feet</li>
            <li> The moter in it kinda seems a little weak</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t want your skin to get raw!</li>
            <li> While it was used twice a day, it was hardly abused.</li>
            <li> My skin has improved just after hardly 2 weeks of usage.</li>
            <li> The on and off button is hard to push.</li>
            <li> Just kinda hard getting off the bottom to install batteries.  </li>
            <li> Makes my face hurt, but it could be because I have bad sensitive skin to start with.</li>
            <li> One of the negative reviews concerned opening the battery compartment.</li>
            <li> I have what people call chicken skin on the back of my arms.</li>
            <li> one of the added bonuses (also helping the environment) is that you can use the package as a storage space so your brushes and brushing system do not become dirty after constant use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never liked those anyway.</li>
            <li> and I can reach those awkward spot on my back.  </li>
            <li> Tip: don&#x27;t use thick scrubs.</li>
            <li> The revolution of the scrubber is slow but it cleans my face without causing skin irritation.</li>
            <li> my face is UNBELIEVABLY softer and smoother!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only sorry I never had one of these sets when I was a teenager!</li>
            <li> Seriously, I ordered the set in April 2015 and have been using it all summer.</li>
            <li> The power seems also weak, not like slow</li>
            <li> i was a little skeptical about it</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical</li>
            <li> Cheap and poor quality  and customer service was very very rude would never recommend even my worst enemy purchasing from this company.</li>
            <li> but you can find another cheaper options, so its not a good feeling.</li>
            <li> Feels prickly and rough on my skin and I am afraid the brush could be  damaging to the skin because of how it feels.</li>
            <li> Im a shopper who doesn&#x27;t play when It comes to spending my money, I hate wasting it, but this  is def not a waste.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed that you didn&#x27;t spend in the upper hundreds for it.  </li>
            <li> and it is very very very slow.</li>
            <li> That is so frustrating.</li>
            <li> think that it&#x27;s designed poorly in this way.</li>
            <li> but it took me a minute to figure out which was frustrating</li>
            <li> There is another secret to tripling the effect of this set.</li>
            <li> There is another secret to tripling the effect of this set.</li>
            <li> She stood behind the value and quality of the product and I will definately do business again.</li>
            <li> and I am very disappointed that I probably won&#x27;t get very far if I contact the company for a replacement or a refund.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed dramatic results when it comes to acne scars.</li>
            <li> The makeup did stain the brush a little but not too bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed with the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> For the price and the quality you cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> Its a shame when a company designs a product that requires batteries and then makes it difficult to install them.</li>
            <li> Get one, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> This is absurd, to do exfoliation every day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useless.  </li>
            <li> but they were so expensive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say that this item turned out to be a lemon.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I am changing my rating to two stars.</li>
            <li> The batteries can get expensive.</li>
            <li> My mom got one of the really expensive one&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I was afraid the brushes we&#x27;re going to feel abrasive and may be uncomfortable to exfoliate my skin.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t realize how dirty your face is until you use the brush.</li>
            <li> When sun is out it is dangerous to expose your damaged skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a teenager that suffers from acne and oily skin.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> so that means bad scars and pimples,  </li>
            <li> BAD THING:</li>
            <li> BAD THING:</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone and should the brush go bad</li>
            <li> The price isn&#x27;t bad and you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> She became so frustrated that she no longer uses the item.</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m really disappointed I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad one</li>
            <li> so incredibly disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m disappointed in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with my purchase.</li>
            <li> but it again. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Also I was doubtful</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the worst systems I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> This brush is terrible.</li>
            <li> I threw it in the trash because I didn&#x27;t even want anyone else to have something so horrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product! Works great on face,feet and body! All brushes included!</li>
            <li> works very well, my face fells so soft</li>
            <li> This is the best!  It made my skin so soft really cleaned it well. I have acne so that means bad scars and pimples,  well this really has helped it opens my pores and allows the acne medication to really get in.  The body scrub made me soft as a babies bottom! My husband really liked it after he was done shaving.  The foot scrub is also nice! Only complaint is how to get the battery cover off we figured it out but it&#x27;s tricky.  Also use good batteries otherwise it loses umph quick.</li>
            <li> After daily use , it works to exfoliate but it&#x27;s not as strong of a mechanism as I expected but for the price it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about a face washing brush at first because I have sensitive skin and I thought it might irritate my skin. It didn&#x27;t at all! I&#x27;m happy to report this product lives up to expectations and my skin is clearer pores are clearer and my face feels extra clean every use. Good product.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it may help with my acne, acne scarring and dark spots on my face. It has been a blessing! I&#x27;ve only been using it about 2 or so weeks, and I already love it. It has significantly helped with my acne. I havent used it enough to be able to say if it will help with the scarring and discoloration, but it helping with my acne is a plus enough for me to say I love it!! The body brush is great as well...the first time I used it, it made my dry skin on my legs disappear and feel fantastic! I use it in the shower a few days a week &amp; am feeling my skin smile as well!!</li>
            <li> when I first got the bus I love it! I have had it a little over a month and it no longer will spin once I apply pressure. I tried changing the batteries. so incredibly disappointed. also there was promises of a $10 coupon towards next purchase. We&#x27;re never met, even after the company contacted me and said they would look into it I never received another email. works great new beginning doesn&#x27;t work at all one month later.</li>
            <li> Product arrive very fast (2 days) with no issues. I&#x27;ve tried all items and I&#x27;m very happy thus far. My face and body feels soft and clean after using and not stripped and dry as I thought it would by using the brushes daily. This product has definitely become part of my daily routine.  I also, really appreciate the seller reaching out to see if I had any questions and offering suggestion for use.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and would recommend this to a friend .the brush does wonders I cleans all the dirt and oil off ur skin and is very gentle . The price is very reasonable compared to some other skin cleansing brushes . Only thing I would like</li>
            <li> This is amazing product...i was a little skeptical about it bc it seemed too good to be true...i was looking for something similar to the clearsonic...this is a very practical..as soon as I started using it, my face started clearing up....it was delivered in just a couple days....i would definitely recommend this product to anyone...</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this because the reviews were really promising and it was somewhat affordable...but I&#x27;m disappointed in it. The very first time I used it, the large brush fell broke where it fits on, so it falls off. I tried using it even though it was broken, because I could still fit it on there, it just wouldn&#x27;t secure so it fell off constantly while I used it. That is so frustrating. The other brush attachments are the same way... they don&#x27;t fit securely so any bit of pressure breaks the plastic. I was able to use the normal face brush for a couple weeks before the same thing happened to that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that it&#x27;s designed poorly in this way. The way that the brushes attach, isn&#x27;t in a secure way and the plastic piece around the brush at the attachment point is not really ideal to stand up to the on and off and movement of it. It needs to lock on securely and I think this issue wouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li> The seller is the best, and so is the product. It arrived in perfect shape, in a beautiful box, two days after I ordered it. The product works amazingly, and the seller followed up with the nicest, most thoughtful letter to me, making sure I am having the best buying experience. The Essential Skin Solutions is the best of the exfoliating machines that I have tried over the years. It&#x27;s gentle enough the use under your eyes (one of my long-standing milia popped!), and tough enough to use the pumice attachment on my feet. I really enjoyed using it all over my body in the bath just now. My skin is ultra smooth, and I think I look younger already! Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is just what I wanted. Works great. Easy to use. Great price.</li>
            <li> Love this set!  I was pleasantly surprised at what a great deal this set was.  It works great and I love the attachments.</li>
            <li> After my third use I can finally leave my opinion of this brush and how it worked for me. I followed the directions and used my favorite facial soap and the small white brush on my face for approximately 10 minutes. I took my time and moved slowly.&lt;br /&gt;The second time I used the brush dry,  the third time with the facial soap. I can definitely see a BIG difference in the texture of my skin.  It not only looks tighter, but feels smooth to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;I also used the large brush on my body, no soap, just dry. Nice buffing for your body.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m anxious to see the difference in my skin after another 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is the battery case and trying to open it. My husband opened the case for me. However, this is NOT a reason to not purchase this unit.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my purchase!!</li>
            <li> I just love how my face looks and feels after using this!!</li>
            <li> So excited!! My teenage daughters have been wanting this for about a year now. My husband has been looking for the right one, and I came upon this on Amazon. We&#x27;ve all been using it and our skin feels wonderful. My daughter who is not the most coordinated loves this product! We&#x27;re thinking of getting a second one, because we keep fighting over this at night!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been considering getting the Clarisonic for awhile now but was iffy on spending near $200 for it. I was so happy I was able to find this much, much cheaper dupe. Even better is that it actually works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this about 3-4 times a week and my skin has greatly improved. I only meant to use this on my face but since it comes with a brush head for the body as well as a pumice stone for feet, I use them. I haven&#x27;t noticed too much of a difference on my body, but it&#x27;s helped a lot with my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course I&#x27;m sure using the right face wash, paired with this device, is important. So if you aren&#x27;t seeing results, then it might be the face wash. I&#x27;ve noticed dramatic results when it comes to acne scars. They&#x27;re a lot more lighter, or they seem to be shrinking. Like they&#x27;re getting lighter from the outside in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried different methods of how to use this with my face wash and all the lathering. Applying face wash onto the brush head and then cleansing my face causes the face wash to lather up so much and then bubbles start flying in all different directions. I find it easier to thoroughly wet my face, use my hands to spread my face wash, and then use the brush. I don&#x27;t even bother wetting the brush as long as my face is wet. If I do wet the brush, I squeeze some of excess water out a bit or else it just splashes everywhere once I turn it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this on shower many times so far and have had no issues, so it is for sure water proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the brush heads can start to get a little gunk after a bunch of uses. So to stretch the amount of uses I can get, once a week I will wash the brush head with some dish soap to break up all the oils on it. Then I will spritz some alcohol to desanitize and then let it fully dry. Before using again, I use my face wash to wash the brush head again so that any leftover alcohol won&#x27;t be damaging to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe it is an absolutely great dupe to the Clarisonic, but to be honest I haven&#x27;t tried any other alternative. But I am planning on sticking with this anyways.</li>
            <li> Very gentle cleaning and exfoliation while using it, it gets a little tricky in trying to open the battery cover even after pinching the device on both sides. I&#x27;d recommend it for sensitive and oily skin to help smoothen the skin.</li>
            <li> An excellent exfoliator and overall skin cleansing device. I really like the fact that I can use it in the shower because it makes my legs really smooth, I also am relieved it comes with both a regular and sensitive facial brush. The regular brush is great for deep exfoliating but I want to use this daily and the softer brush is perfect for that.  I have seen other systems that come with a sponge instead but I find this much more useful. The only reason I am giving this a three star is the need to pinch the sides so hard to get the battery compartment open. I realize now that it says to do this in the directions but it took me a minute to figure out which was frustrating but overall I have been really happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My skin feels amazing after the first time using it.  I recommend this product to everyone.  I will be purchasing two more for gifts for my teens!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost two weeks now I believe and I really like it. My only issue is that the exfoliating attachment doesn&#x27;t work good. I&#x27;ve tried it 3 times and have not had good results and my feet are not very dry or rough. But the other 3 attachments are awesome!</li>
            <li> Love it, works great and has so many uses</li>
            <li> Cheap and poor quality  and customer service was very very rude would never recommend even my worst enemy purchasing from this company.</li>
            <li> My first use and I am very pleased already! I currently own a Clarisonic Mia and I enjoy using it but I have to say that the feel of the ESS is slightly better. My skin felt very clean and tight from the first use. For the price and the quality you cannot go wrong. Note: You cannot charge the unit, batteries only.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the soft facial brush and body brush daily and my skin has never looked better. The pumice wheel for the feet does an excellent job. The handle part is water proof making it a great item to have in the bath or shower. And it came in a very nice, sturdy display box suitable for gift giving. The various attachments easily snap on and off.</li>
            <li> I love this thing, the only complaint I have is that it&#x27;s battery-run rather than rechargeable, but perhaps that&#x27;s what you get with a waterproof scrubber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combining it with a good bodywash really cleared up my skin. I have persistent cystic acne which flares up hormonally and due to stress, so the fact that the body brush is exfoliating really worked for me. If you deal with whiteheads, I&#x27;m not sure if it would be too rough or not because it does scrub really vigorously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pumice stone is one of my favorite features. I use it on my feet after a long soak and it really helps to recirculate the blood and do away with callousness.</li>
            <li> How did I live this long without one of these!  My face has never been so clean!</li>
            <li> Works very well &amp; better priced than others I viewed.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t quite as great as I&#x27;d hoped it would be. It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used something like this before so I don&#x27;t know how good it is compared to the other ones. But it works pretty nice. Makes my face hurt, but it could be because I have bad sensitive skin to start with. Overall, it&#x27;s pretty good. But there are cheaper ones out there if you&#x27;re looking for dupes of clairsonic stuff.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted one of these battery operated cleansing systems and when I found this one on Amazon, I had to purchase it.  For the money it is a great set being that it&#x27;s not only a facial cleanser, but also has a body brush and a pumice stone attachment to use for a pedicure.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also easy to use and rather quite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product of you are planning to do your own facials!</li>
            <li> I love this! The large brush is great for arms and legs and the small ones are great for face and neck. They make my skin feel so soft and smooth. I love the pumice stone for my feet! Very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> This face and body brush is AWESOME! Really helps me get my face deep cleaned, especially helpful in getting every bit of makeup out of my pores. The body brush is surprisingly large and really works. I like that you can use the brush right in the shower without hurting it.LOVE IT! This is a nice cleaning system for your skin. I like having all the different brushes as well as the pumice stone. All the brushes work as claimed and makes your skin feel really clean and exfoliated. The body brush is a terrific addition to this</li>
            <li> This is very good for cleaning your face and body. I had trouble with the on/off switch. I was about to return it when my husband asked if her could try it. He now uses it everyday and loves the way it makes his face feel.</li>
            <li> Good machine..Easy to use. Gentle</li>
            <li> it is exactly as described and a great price!</li>
            <li> Very nice, made my feel skin soft.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother and more radiant than ever! This product is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Impressed with followup and interest in my purchase from the seller. So far I am using the system daily and am sold on the results. So glad I made this purchase</li>
            <li> love love love love love love love, my face felt amazing after one use!</li>
            <li> I love this brush system! My face is smooth and glowing, no more blackheads, whiteheads or dead skin. And for the first time in a long time, my feet are smooth...no more rough, cracked heals. Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> I must say it was worth the wait I really searched and read a lot of reviews before I made my purchase and I think I made the right choice. It&#x27;s just what I wanted....I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve tried so many other stuff but these brushes have the right texture for the purpose they were designed for!</li>
            <li> I really like it.  It leaves my face soft and smooth, without chafing or redness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen these types of face brushes on television but had not tried one before.  When I was offered the chance to purchase this at a special price during a promotion period to test for quality, I was excited.  There are several things I really like about this unit.  First of all, it&#x27;s waterproof so you can take it in the shower.  There are three different brushes and a pumice stone.  The larger brush is meant to use on your body, the two smaller brushes on your face (one is for regular skin, the other for sensitive skin) and a pumice stone  The large body brush worked well.  I simply added some of my bath soap and used it on my back and arms, which sometimes break out.  It worked okay, not great, but okay.  I also used the smaller brush on my face.  I used my regular cleansing foam and it did a great job.  When I was finished, my face felt smooth and refreshed.  Afterwards, I followed up with my regular moisturizer and serum.  Finally, I gave the pumice stone a try.  This is the reason for my 4 star vs. 5 star review.  It was not powerful enough to slough off any of the dry skin of callouses from my feet.  I followed the instructions and soaked and dried them first, it just didn&#x27;t have enough umph to get the job done.  Overall, this is a great brush for keeping your face cleansed and exfoliated, just not for my poor old pathetic feet!  lol</li>
            <li> Awesome!  Wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to buy this!  My facial pores haven&#x27;t looked this good in years- after 2-3 days I can not only feel a difference, but I can SEE one too!  Quickly got rid of pesky dry patches on my face.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teen who had acne. Since using it for the past 2 weeks his skin looks great without all those harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered on-time and in excellent shape.  This is a great product and I bought two.  One for me and one for my Mom.  She thinks it is great and was amazed at the price compared to what some other brands cost for a similar product.  Please keep up the good work and look forward to getting replacement supplies soon.</li>
            <li> i love the way it makes my skin feel. I have been using this product for a few days now, I must say my face does feel a lot cleaner looks a lot brighter.One of my best purchases everrrr, Let me know if your company sells extra brushes I use coconut oil and oatmeal mixed and my face is now glowing. Great Product 2 thumbs up</li>
            <li> Item arrived as described. Great buy.</li>
            <li> This is a good system for the price. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this 3 times so far but I can honestly say I LOVE it!  One use on my body made my skin so soft and got rid of dry flakes.  My face has never felt so smooth.  I use this and then put Hyaluronic Acid Serum on and the next morning my face looks radiant.  I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase I&#x27;m going to buy another one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  Love this product!- cece&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;@essentialskinsolutions.com/free4you</li>
            <li> A bit harsh on the skin, even the sensitive one, but really nice quality especially for the price. You also get a free gift for writing a review which is the only reason why I&#x27;m writing this.</li>
            <li> So good. I can&#x27;t stop using! My skin is bright and clean, very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product and am pleased to finally have a skin cleansing brush and all of the elements that came with the system.</li>
            <li> Not for seniors....I&#x27;m under 70 and have the usual hand strength for someone my age. This looked nice and well packaged but when it came time to put the batteries in........no way could I even budge the cover on the battery compartment. Emailed the company, who replied very rapidly, asking if there were any tricks to getting the battery compartment open and they sent me detailed instructions. Try as I might....I never did succeed in getting the battery compartment open and the way it is designed....it would always be difficult to get it open to change the batteries. So am going to have to return the unit.....just cant use it. Its a shame when a company designs a product that requires batteries and then makes it difficult to install them.</li>
            <li> Fabulous!!!  has taken away 90% of the sun spots on my cheeks already and I know will only get better.  skin really looking good.</li>
            <li> I really liked this brush, I was afraid I wasn&#x27;t going to like it because of other reviews, it is not too powerful but good enough for a good cleansing! you don&#x27;t want your skin to get raw! After I use this I put my vitamin C(Pure body naturals) on and my face just feels amazing! Great product, I will recommend.</li>
            <li> Product was beyond my imagination. It was excellent. Only tiny problem was that it was very hard to remove the lid to put batteries in. I almost cried.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot. I like the fact I get to change the brushes. I wish it could have more than one power setting.</li>
            <li> I love this!  Makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> The skin brushing is wonderful. I love the way my skin feels. I used the pumice stone on my husbands feet. It also worked wonderful.</li>
            <li> Very great product !!</li>
            <li> I love this product and I&#x27;m happy I purchased this item. My skin feels soft and it works really good for my feet.Thank You</li>
            <li> I have a very oily face and I use this every other day and my face feels so smooth afterwards.  I love this item and would recommend it to anyone who wants a clean smooth face.</li>
            <li> Well it&#x27;s very inexpensive so that&#x27;s why I bought it. . .maybe I&#x27;m not using it very often or maybe I&#x27;m not using the right defoliants but yes I see some super small improvements package is very nice and presentable, ALSO VERY FAST SHIPPING SUPER FAST!!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use this system long before you fall in love with it and your skin! I can&#x27;t imagine my beauty routine without it!</li>
            <li> I had written a review after receiving it and it was all good , then for one of the little brushes for the face just crumbled apart and did not know what happened but since u get two of them I didn&#x27;t worry about so much but now the second one is starting to do the same thing. It has not been dropped or abused in any way for these to just start falling apart, nor do I even use daily. And the scrubber it self is not durable after using it a few times , I was so excited about getting this and now I&#x27;m really disappointed I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad one or if they all do this.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes. You don&#x27;t realize how dirty your face is until you use the brush. Removes all the makeup. The pumice stone works really well, too. Wish it came with some sort of carrying/holding case.</li>
            <li> The face brush is awesome! I had on a full face of makeup and using this completely removed all of it. I went back in with my toner and there was absolutely no trace of any residue from makeup. The brush heads are also extremely soft, not too harsh on the skin at all. Definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Device is great, love the brushes. The warranty is a scam, there is nothing in the &amp;#34;bonus area&amp;#34; except spam emails.</li>
            <li> I just love this product. The only complaint I have is that the callous remover is not powerful enough. My skin feels like silk and I am over 50. My husband actually noticed how soft it feels. The body brush works well enough but could be a bit stronger in my opinion. The face brushes work great and do not hurt my skin.</li>
            <li> I had to return cause i couldnt open the damn battery case. Instructions said squeeze to open but you cant squeeze the thing at all!</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft after using this product. Great purchase and facial brush.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It has all of the brushes you&#x27;ll need to cleanse and moisturize skin, feet and face for that glorious summer glow.</li>
            <li> I am a trained Esthetician and I cannot believe how well this actually works. I love that you can use it wet or dry. It works better than I expected and is actually nicer than the spa ones I have used.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this thing!  Keeps her skin clear, and does exactly what it says it does.  10/10 would buy again.</li>
            <li> Good for a clean skin but not effective for acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this kit so far! I started off using the sensitive skin face brush with my facial cleanser, and my face felt much softer after each shower. I decided to switch to the regular small face brush, and not only does my face feel super soft, but my pores also look smaller and lighter! Today I used the big body brush over my entire body (except for my face) and I think it worked very well! In the past I&#x27;ve tried exfoliating scrubs, gloves, and brushes, but they never worked anywhere near as well as this did! The big body brush was actually the reason I chose this kit over other kits that only contained small facial brushes. I also found an unexpected positive result from using the body brush today. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only woman who has experienced skin darkening over time where my bra rubs... Well, when I got out of the shower today, I noticed that the dark areas look much, much lighter than usual! I&#x27;m assuming this is due to the great exfoliation those areas received. I&#x27;m definitely looking forward to using this kit from now on!</li>
            <li> I just got my order today and I am truly amazed! I have tried many cleansing face brush but this is the most effecting one yet! My face is smooth and clean. Really glad I purchased this product!</li>
            <li> My product worked great for a week, until it suddenly stopped working. I replaced the batteries and it still wouldn&#x27;t turn on anymore. I&#x27;m not sure if the one I got was just defective? I would really like a replacement though considering it only worked for a week and I never got the interior wet or anything.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm, cleans skin &amp; leaves it soft.  Get one, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Received this product on time, 3 days later i saw results in my face is more smooth and blemishes are dissappearing i love it.</li>
            <li> My last scrubbing brush quit working. This cleansing  set is not what I expected. Not much power. Only advantage is I can use it wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I have been researching facial brushes and chose this model by Essential Skin Solutions because of it&#x27;s price and multiplel brush system. I was very happy with its performance and versatility of brush choices. It works very well. I had immediate positive results. In fact, I was so impressed with it that I bought a second one a week later for my girl friend as she was impressed with my results in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I love this! This is the same quality as the $100 ones I&#x27;ve seen on blogs- I think it is the exact same, in fact, with just a different logo smacked on to it. Super good quality- and the batteries last forever before you have to change them!</li>
            <li> for me, the brushes are way too soft and the unit does not rotate very fast at all...even with brand new duracell batteries. the only thing i feel like has been beneficial is the pumice stone on the tootsies. the big brush i thought would be good for the healing scar that runs from my hip to my knee but no. it does not seem to do much at all.</li>
            <li> 10:57pm May 17&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself IS great!!!!!!!! The ONLY reason I rated it 1 star was to attract attention of buyers to a very important warning: the instructions to this cleansing set are incredibly vague and incomplete. DO NOT USE it every day!!! Then you won&#x27;t have to replace it, as recommended, every 2 months!!! This is absurd, to do exfoliation every day. The company wants your money and that is it. As a cosmetologist with over 20 years of experience - I would like to give some recommendations. It is regarding the exfoliating brush. Exfoliating is a process of literally damaging you skin. You remove a layer of dead cells. &amp;#34;Dead cells&amp;#34; is a very convenient term for the cosmetics companies to urge customers to use the brush every day. In reality, this layer serves as a protection of your skin, like clothes for your body. It is a UV screen and a dust and dirt cover. After exfoliating, your inner layer of skin becomes the outer one. For the first few days it is extremely vulnerable. Take good care of it before your skin gets rough enough. Deep exfoliation and cleansing are great once in a while (every few months), but you will do more harm if you do it too often. Personally I would recommend to do it 2-3 times a year. Yet another very important thing: when exfoliating (as I mentioned already it is a damage for your skin) mind the weather. When sun is out it is dangerous to expose your damaged skin. In most cases it will leave dark incurable spots. The only good time to do the exfoliation is when there are a few cloudy/ rainy days in a row. It is paramount!!!!! While I’m at it, I would like to share my knowledge and experience to double or triple the benefits of using this product. First - right after the procedure of exfoliating you go directly to your freezer. Take an ice cube and rub in into your burning skin. It will give you one of the best (yet - free of any expenses) face skin lifts!!! The ice starts to melt and you see your wrinkles shrink. Of course, the same recommendation goes to any occasion when your face is &amp;#34;on fire&amp;#34; - after a workout, run, sauna and so on. There is another secret to tripling the effect of this set. Do not wipe your face after washing it. Let it air dry!!! Your skin will get moisturized in the most effective (yet - free!!!) way!!! Yay!!! Actually, I tell my clients to never ever wipe the face (unless it is a winter season and the temperature is below 32 – in this case you have to allow yourself at least 40 min before leaving the house). Your skin will get the best treatment and the price of it would be just a price of this set. Oh, almost forgot to mention: when cleansing your skin, do not apply any lotion after. Let the pores breath overnight. Your skin will thank you in a most beautiful way! Good luck!!!&lt;br /&gt; Note: I am not in any way affiliated with this company. I really love the product, but it lacks crucial warnings. This ambiguity in instructions may cause someone to get hurt. Please don’t use it on damaged skin (heavy acne, cuts, etc.) and when in doubt, talk to your doctor.ink. Of course, the same recommendation goes to any occasion when your face is &amp;#34;on fire&amp;#34; - after a workout, run, sauna and so on. There is another secret to tripling the effect of this set. Do not wipe your face after washing it. Let it air dry!!! Your skin will get moisturized in the most effective (yet - free!!!) way!!!

            <li> My skin is so much softer and my pores are going away on my nose</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great product.</li>
            <li> its been two weeks and I absolutely it. It not only clean well but an added benefit is that a little face cleanser now goes a long way. my face feel smoother and more refreshed. the two face brushes are nice, the rough one is not to rough and the soft one is not to soft.</li>
            <li> A great multi-purpose tool.  I plan on buying another as a gift!</li>
            <li> So far I LOVE this thing.  It was a challenge to get the bottom off to put the batteries, maybe it needs a grip or lever or something, as I believe the design is for sealing out water.  When I first got it turned on after putting batteries in, I thought, &amp;#34;There is no way this is going to do anything it&#x27;s so slow!&amp;#34; BUT then I started using it, the sensitive skin brush, on my face..... WOW. IT FEELS SOOOO GOOD.  And tons of leftover makeup and dirt came off.  I had to clean the brush several times in that initial scrubbing because it was getting so dirty the bristles were changing color, but the yuck washed out.  But, oh it felt sooo good, I over did it a little bit.  So some sensitive areas of my face were raw for a few days after because it felt like a massage and it was just so wonderful!! And, seriously I looked much younger after getting such a good clean it likely sloughed off old skin too.  It does not stop when you press down a little, and this is Super Plus, because the reality is we need a little pressure to do these things.  Not much, but other products are a complete fail because they stop under any pressure. Ok, So that&#x27;s the sensitive face brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used the body brush, So great! It feels so gentle like the face one, but the clean is just doing such a better job than other things, and I have used a lot of other things for body scrubbing, especially the back.  Seems like that never gets enough or good enough. But this did pretty darn good, and it didn&#x27;t have any problems with a light shower.  I didn&#x27;t internationally get it soaked or anything, but I used it in the shower and rinsed the bristles while in there. So far no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pumice. This thing really works.  Again, I though &amp;#34;NoWay&amp;#34; because of the speed.  But, it didn&#x27;t stop under a little pressure, and it did take off a lot of old skin after feet were soaked in the bath. It is not all I need for my feet, I need more than this, but it is the perfect tool for keeping them in good shape after or if your feet are in a good state already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has Refill brushes, this was one of the main reasons I bought it.  Something like this that we intend to use for a long while, needs to have parts acceptable, no scrub brush is going to last forever and still work well and remain hygienic. So, this was a major factor for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONLY BAD THING: There aren&#x27;t any other heads to add!!  As far as I could tell from their site and here, there are no other heads than what is shown.  I would LOVE for there to be a massaging tool head (I&#x27;ve seen others with this, but they didn&#x27;t have replacement brushes, so I didn&#x27;t get) to add to the others, it would be so awesome for a face massage without worrying about getting raw skin like using the brush for too long at a time will do.  As well, if there were other attachments for the feet like a gritty sandpaper one, or more with different harshness&#x27;s.  This was also on others, but I wanted this one because of the availability of replacement heads, which for any of those things, except massager maybe, there would be a future need for a replacement head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very satisfied with this product, it is great and makes me so happy I got it.keeping them in good shape after or if your feet are in a good state already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has Refill brushes, this was one of the main reasons I bought it.

            <li> Everything I thought it would be! Love it!</li>
            <li> I just got this product (in a timely manner) &amp; can&#x27;t wait to use it. The product came in a sturdy box with directions on set up, how to use the product &amp; useful tips. I found the other reviews very helpful before purchasing the product.</li>
            <li> omg!!!  Love love this item.  I&#x27;m very big on taking care of my face and have wanted one of these for the longest time, bought this and absolutely love.  Such a great purchase.</li>
            <li> oh my gosh, where has this machine been my whole life,  my skin feels amazing.  I love this exfoliator, I have used others but nothing as great as this.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product !!! Very lightweight &amp; portable. Easy to use. Apply face wash to the brush and presto! It leaves your face smooth and tingly. My daughter is a competition dancer &amp; uses self-tanners. The body brush is great for exfolliating before we apply the tanner. I suggest buying rechargeable batteries because once you use it you will not want to clean your face without it.</li>
            <li> I love this face brush and use it nightly.  Why spend more money when this one works great.  To the lady who had difficulty opening the battery case, you pull it apart not press the open symbol.</li>
            <li> It looks good.  But it is a little diffrent to open the battery compartment.</li>
            <li> This does everything I wanted it to do and more, I wasn&#x27;t even looking for a foot pumice but this little machine does an awesome job. My skin is looking brighter and less dry. Gentle enough for everyday use, and I have super sensitive skin. The only downfall is that its battery powered, but for the price its totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Love that comes with different attachments but really wish that it was electrically charged. Since its battery operated I feel that I&#x27;m not getting enough &amp;#34;juice&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It left my skin soooo smooth. I really didn&#x27;t want to put it down.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing ! In love with this set..been using it for two days and my skin all ready feels so much more smooth! Such high quality and lovely packaging :)</li>
            <li> Its perfect! It makes my face feel smooth and clean. I noticed that my pores getting smaller. I use it every night with olay facial wash. I&#x27;m very happy that i bought it!</li>
            <li> Bought this mainly for the large body brush included in the package. The smaller brush head is no different from the Olay one, which I already had. However, when I had a flare-up of bacne, I knew I needed something bigger than that. So I tried this, and it cleared the problem right away, when used with the right products. I didn&#x27;t immediately see anything about replacement brush heads, which concerned me a little.&lt;br /&gt;Contacted the seller, who promptly replied, sending me the link for the replacement heads, which I bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would be nice to have an individual large replacement brush heads, since that is definitely one of the features that this set offers that all the other similar brush makers do not have. Bacne is a real problem, and apparently pretty common; if this can be part of the solution, it should be offered separately and maketed that way as well to make it easier for people to find.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers were correct, the best thing about this product is the box. Too many batteries are needed for such a small product. Helpful instructions about putting the batteries in and using the product are sent with the product box they are sent through email (e.g., squeeze the sides of the battery compartment to get it to open), which I don&#x27;t find that useful. I prefer to have the instructions right in the box when I open it. The turning mechanism is incredibly slow and trying to use this in the shower or bath requires a good amount of time. This is essentially the same thing that a person could do with a body mitt and the force is better using your own hand pressure compared to this product. Save your money, or buy this for somebody who you really want to waste a lot of time and feel frustrated. For the face: not bad, but again nothing special.</li>
            <li> i read a few negative reviews and several great reviews before purchasing this product.  One of the negative reviews concerned opening the battery compartment. When I tried to open the battery compartment by squeezing with my fingers, it would not budge. I then used the palm of my hand and did a slight twist and the battery cover opened easily. I put the batteries in wrong and had to open the compartment a second time. I squeezed using the palm of my hand and it again came off easily. I then noticed the battery directions on the side of the opening. The second complaint was the speed. I found the speed of the body brush was perfect for dry brushing to move lymph. The proper pressure for lymph drainage was compared to touching a newborn&#x27;s head. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I can see the difference in my skin in just one week of using this brush. I absolutely love this brush!!!! It&#x27;s soft and durable. Thank you for a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Love this set. Use of this cleansing brush set almost daily has helped to exfoliate my oily skin. Just be careful not to get your hair caught in the brush mechanism. It will grab your hair and tangle real quick!</li>
            <li> I bought this here on Amazon a month back and LOVE this product! My face has never felt so clean!. After just the first use I felt invigorated! The buses are so easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right out of the package, I had to purchase 4 AA batteries to put in. Battery access was simple to find but a little difficult to open at first. Next I had to attach a brush head to the unit and that was pretty simple to do. It clipped right on and felt secure. I turned it on and was pretty quiet and had good spin to it. I put a bit of facial cleanser on the brush and touched it to my face. It was very soft and gentle on my face, not at all abrasive. It was a pleasant spa-like experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was done with the cleaning process my face was so soft! And it felt cleaner than it ever has! Better than when I have had professional treatments! I look forward to using it every day!</li>
            <li> This kit works amazing I love how soft and clean my face feels after I use it!  I definitely can see and feel a difference in my skins overall appearance!</li>
            <li> Ok for face, however not much use for the body. No speed control and it is very very very slow. I&#x27;m disappointed with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I saw results on my face the first day. I have what people call chicken skin on the back of my arms.I&#x27;ve used the body brush twice and have already noticed less of them. Of course with the help of a body scrub which was doing nothing before. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the battery compartment was hard to open but I received an email from the company shortly after I received telling me that and how to get it open. You just have the squeeze the sides and pull it down. But if you don&#x27;t have this I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> i bought this brush on a whim after it was recommended that I purchase one to help with roscia. After 1 week of using it I noticed my face wasn&#x27;t as red and my pores are barely visible. This brush also comes with different attachment heads so you can use it on your feet for dry skin.  The box it came on in sturdy and also serves for storage of the brush. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! Great product. Perfect for my skin.</li>
            <li> The product is great.I had only use twice since I received it and so far the result has been great. It leaves my skin smooth and feels clean. I haven&#x27;t tried the body brush or the pumice. But I have tired both the sensitive and the firm brush. The price for this is great and reasonable.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush cleaning system and I am very happy with my purchase. The brush is very useful for exfoliating the skin, both on the face and your entire body. I would recommend this cleaning system especially for the great price.</li>
            <li> I felt the rejuvenating effect on my skin after the first use.</li>
            <li> Crappy product stopped working less than a week after I got it. I paid extra to rush it to me, too. I wish now that I had bought a slightly different item through another seller. Also, this product doesn&#x27;t spin very quickly--it&#x27;s actually super slow--and it stops working if you apply even a little bit of pressure. Total junk!</li>
            <li> Love it so much!! Comes with a wide range of choices of brushes to choose from and I love the way each one of them feels!</li>
            <li> I love it. Especially on my back.  I feel like my skin is much smoother and softer.  Recommend it highly</li>
            <li> I do like this product but don&#x27;t use it as often as I should.  I try to use it once a week to help my skin look great.</li>
            <li> I received it on time but with one piece missing. When I opened the box, the sensitive skin exfoliating face brush is missing. You don&#x27;t get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> Great brush system. I even recorded and gave it to my 38 yr old daughter.</li>
            <li> I love this product the brushes feel amazing.It works perfectly and shipping was very fast. It&#x27;s worth so much more than what it cost, I would definitely recommend this to any and everyone. I have very sensitive skin and these brushes feel amazing on my skin I&#x27;ve been using it everyday since I got it.</li>
            <li> I tried out this body/face cleansing brush immediately after receiving it. My skin feels extremely clean. I am very pleased with this item as it performs very well so far, for a very reasonable price, compared to a major competitor currently being advertised. I need to find out if replacement brush heads are offered... and a handle attachment would be a big plus, too, for body (back) washing... Wishful thinking perhaps.</li>
            <li> PERFECT!  GOOD PRODUCT. THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> Worked great for 6 weeks, then broke.</li>
            <li> This facial brush set is amazing does everything it claims to do and more. The price is also great compared to other brush sets.</li>
            <li> I really like it so far.... except the body brush won&#x27;t stay on and replacements cost the same as a new item from competitors! Makes no sense! $10 less than the original item for brushes?  Hhmm.. I&#x27;ll be moving on to a product that the replacement pieces are affordable</li>
            <li> I love this and it&#x27;s waterproof.</li>
            <li> Love it! Exactly as described and works great, my face has never felt so clean!!</li>
            <li> I used this the first morning after I got it and I have to say I love it!! My face felt so smooth after. I am looking forward to using it again and again and can&#x27;t wait to see the results after multiple uses!!</li>
            <li> I just purchased my second brush for my husband who keeps swiping mine.  The brush is great, but the best part about buying from this company is how wonderful and personable they are.  They care very much about their product and customer satisfaction.  A welcoming email arrives about the same time as the brush and they give you tips and reminders about how they want you to be happy.  You just can&#x27;t help but like them!!!!  Great product, great company!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It came on time! It works great once I put my batteries in it. My skin is smooth. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I keep mine in the shower.  Its easy to use with your face cleanser and body wash.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. Brushes wear down fast.</li>
            <li> I have oily-combination skin and have wanted a clarisonic for a while now. Thought I would buy an affordable version first and see if it was something I could commit to in my skin routine. Three months later and I love this product! I am not going to get a clarisonic, instead I am getting the full set of replacement brushes. Originally I just wanted the face brush and wasn&#x27;t sure what I would do with the pumice stone or body brush, but now I use all brushes regularly. For my face I just opted for the sensitive skin brush because I preferred the softness of the bristles. I accidentally left the kit behind on a week long vacation and by the time I returned my face had blackheads and small breakouts, but the next day after using it again I could already feel them subsiding.</li>
            <li> I have used other, more expensive face cleansing brushes and this by far surpasses the other brands. I have used the face brushes and the body brush and they all leave my skin feeling very clean and smooth. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful wish I would have bought it ten years ago</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! I have tried masks, creams, all sorts of &amp;#34;solutions&amp;#34; for the bumpy skin on my face. After only 2 weeks of using this Perfect Skin Brushing System my face is UNBELIEVABLY softer and smoother! Not only does it feel really good after a stressful day, but it actually works! My skin has never felt smoother or cleaner. My daughters love it too, so I will likely be purchasing two more sets soon. :)</li>
            <li> I really love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it daily (sensitive brush) on my face for a few weeks and it has really cleared up my acne.  I was reluctant to try it because usually anything even remotely abrasive makes my acne worse.  This was a last ditch effort before going to the dermatologist.  So glad I gave it a try.  It not only cleared my acne, but my pores are much smaller and my skin feels so smooth.  Wish I had found this product 20 years ago!  I will be buying additional sets for xmas gifts.</li>
            <li> Its hard to get the battery compartment open but once u get that taken care of its a wonderful tool. Luv it</li>
            <li> Awesome and not extremely expensive! Makes my face super soft! Love it!</li>
            <li> This facial and body brush are great I have seen and even my husband noticed my skin looks healthier and smooth.helped with the dry skin really good.it really prepares your face for your skin regime.use the regular face brush few times a week and in between use the sensitive  brush.the body brush works great too,I use it with my homemade body scrub.definitely recommend this(even helped my son with his acne,his face cleared up nicely.</li>
            <li> Good product. Cleans well,  not to abrasive.</li>
            <li> works well. seems to hold up in the shower. Wish it had a faster setting but otherwise, It works well and I&#x27;d buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE- September 2015. I purchased this is March and now it doesn&#x27;t work. It only works if you hold down the button on it. Used it daily but it no longer works. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very nice. my face feels so soft!!!!</li>
            <li> The product is awesome! The package arrived earlier than I expected and surprised me by its efficiency. In just a couple days of using it I could notice great changes on my skin softness and pores appearance. I always recommend this product because of this good price and also good skin improvements. This is now part of my everyday skin care.</li>
            <li> Just received my brush a few days ago &amp; im in love so far, my face &amp; body has never felt so smooth. Only bummer is it doesn&#x27;t come with the batteries it requires</li>
            <li> I like that this has a body brush and can be used in the shower, the foot brush hasn&#x27;t been useful as I feel there isn&#x27;t enough power to use it properly. Overall I think this is a good value and a quality product</li>
            <li> Had a good review at first but after 6 months, it just stopped working. And yes I changed the batteries. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> Item was received on time and product was of very good quality. I&#x27;ve only used it twice but would recommend the item if looking for a facial cleansing system.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes, especially the big one for the shower. But I dislike that it takes 4 AA batteries. Wish I knew that before I purchased it. Would recommend getting rechargeable batteries for it.</li>
            <li> I love it left my skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying the skin cleansing kit. Really makes your face feel much cleaner than normal washing. Company very helpful with information.</li>
            <li> Great product! I am very happy I purchased the cleansing&lt;br /&gt;system.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS BRUSH I FEEL SMOOTH AND CLEAN. The pumice is a great addition and the body brush is great. It runs on batteries 4 AA but they are not included. Costs about 2 bucks for batteries so no big deal.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the price my face feels so fresh and clean after every use I would recommend this product to everyone !</li>
            <li> When the brush arrived I was really excited to use it because I thought that it would be like a doupe for clarasonic. I first tried the body brish and that worked fine. Next I used the small face exfoliater and it did the job too. But when I used the soft normal face brush my face became extremely red and irritated. i thought it would go away by morning so I went to sleep. When I woke up my face was still red and was now also sensitive. It took about a week for the redness to go away. I don&#x27;t know if it the brush or my skin that caused this. I think it was the brush though because I used the exfoliater before I even used the normal one. I wouldn&#x27;t but it again. :(</li>
            <li> Mine works really great! I&#x27;m not sure how it compares to the $100+ models, but this does the trick and only put me out about $30! I have zero complaints.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I love the versatility, can be used in shower and dry.  Esp  love the sensitive face brush.  Only small negative: I am used to firmer bristles for a body brush with more exfoliating power.  Very good for everyday or multiple times a week. gentle but effective. great price as well.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the worst systems I&#x27;ve ever had.  For one thing, it only has one speed...and that&#x27;s SLLLOOOOOWWWW....The brush is way to soft.  If I wanted to scrub my whole body with this thing...I&#x27;d be in the shower all day.  It&#x27;s useless.  I might as well have thrown my money in a burn pit.  I&#x27;ll never use these products again....EVER!!!</li>
            <li> Had it for less than 3 months and it already stopped working.</li>
            <li> I love it! My skin is a lot clearer after using this.</li>
            <li> Received it yesterday along with an email from the company! Used it for the first time last night and my face feels wonderful! I&#x27;m very excited to see what it will do for my very oily skin!</li>
            <li> Great product,  fast delivery ! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Love this set. Use all the attachments, face, body, heels.  Better than the Sonicare I had!  Love it!  Can&#x27;t beat the value!  Get one!</li>
            <li> I love that it exfoliates head to toe.</li>
            <li> Save your dollars and buy an oscillating brush- because this spins in one direction is pulls your skin a bit and is pretty messy (flings soap everywhere).  Also I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s defective, but the button is really hard to press.</li>
            <li> I love this system! Works excellent! A great deal for the price!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy useing this face washer. For the money it&#x27;s a winner hands down. Only 4 stars do to only one speed and no eternal battery with charger. Have to buy batteries But seems to last a good long while. I use it about 3 times a week do not that often but your not supposed to over exfoliate anyway. Also it spins only in one direction. But still a great product certain for what you get for your money!! 👍👍👍</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother who was very happy with the product initially. Then, for no apparent reason, the body brush would not remain attached to the handle and would fall off several times during each use. While it was used twice a day, it was hardly abused. She became so frustrated that she no longer uses the item. Perhaps the one I received was defective but it seems the way the two pieces attach is very flimsy. How about a locking-in mechanism?</li>
            <li> I just received this today! I have used it once and I am impressed! I could tell a difference already. After just one use, my pores are smaller.&lt;br /&gt;I am looking forward to seeing how my skin looks after regular use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about a week and my skin feels softer with fewer blackheads. The brush could spin a bit faster though</li>
            <li> Body brush works immediately, the face one takes longer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a teenager that suffers from acne and oily skin. I wanted to purchase a clarosonic brush but it was too pricey. So I decided to give this a try and so far (I&#x27;ve had it for about a month now) it&#x27;s working well. I noticed my skin is a lot clearer and smoother.</li>
            <li> Omg. Luv this it works amazingly. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this, makes my skin feel so fresh and clean. Removes impurities and gives my face a chance to build a healthy glow!</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim and I have to say that this product is amazing. The brushes are all soft but still do the job well. I am very satisfied with this purchase.  UPDATE: July 16, 2016  It is now a year since I purchased this product. It was great for a few months and then finally stopped working a few days before the warranty. I have reached out to the company and have yet to hear a reply.  UPDATE: July 17, 2016  Company has responded and they are sending me a new wand. Great and fast customer service.</li>
            <li> Great product, works well on sensitive skin and I like the fact that you can use it in the shower. The brushes are versatile and for the price this is a fantastic set which keeps your whole body clean and soft. Really appreciate the product and definitely recommend to anyone looking for a cleansing brush of some kind.</li>
            <li> Before I purchase this product I spent lots of mony on facial sessions wich was time consuming as well. But now since I used it for the first time I relaized that this product will save my mony and time. The price is lower than what I used to spent for one facial sessions. Using it with my favorite cleanser makes me feel fresh immediatly. I recommend it to my family and frinds also my sister is so excited to give it try, I think she will purchase it soon. This product really works in real life👍</li>
            <li> I was honestly nervous about buying this brush because the price was too good to be true.  I have tried various cheaper facial &amp; body brushes in the past and it has never worked out well and they&#x27;ve all ended up in the trash.  THIS brush is different, it&#x27;s actually very well made.  I can not open it on my own, I actually hurt myself trying, that is the bummer.  It&#x27;s kind of two sided as well, in order to truly make it waterproof, I believe they had to make it this difficult, so it&#x27;s a blessing and a curse...because the water does NOT get into it (like the other &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; brushes I have purchased in the past).  I also think it could spin faster, it does not have much power and my face could use a little more intensity....HOWEVER, it absolutely does clean my face and exfoliate far better than anything else I could afford.  I use it every day in the shower on my body and face, I find it a little weak for my feet so I still use my non-electric foot brush.  Basically, I had adult acne on my shoulders/back, face &amp; neck and this has helped immensely in clearing that up.  It&#x27;s definitely worth the money, but if you are expecting clarisonic or a very popular quality of microdermabrasion, it may not be for you.</li>
            <li> After using my face feels so smooth and clean.  The scrubbing brush is very gentle on my skin.  Wish I had gotten this along time ago!</li>
            <li> This brush is terrible. I was so excited for it after reading all of the good reviews. I put 4 new batteries in it and used it once and it worked great, ever since then it doesn&#x27;t work. It doesn&#x27;t turn on or spin at all. I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good product, although I mostly wanted for facial area, it really helped my niece&#x27;s bumpy arms!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I love it and I love the way my face looks and feels. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Package came in as expected. I&#x27;m very pleased with the product. My skin from head to toe feels so clean and smooth. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and haven&#x27;t had any issues with my skin or the system itself. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This body brush feels wonderful.  I have now used all four heads and they all work well, are easy to attach and are easy to clean.  Can&#x27;t wait to take a bath and use them all.</li>
            <li> I Love it I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and i can see good changes!I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> An excellent skin cleansing device. I really like this because it can used in the shower and it makes my skin really smooth.</li>
            <li> I loved this item the first time I used it! My face feels tingly and smooth and CLEAN! It was a little hard to open it for batteries but once I figured it out, it was easy. There is a nice variety of brushes and easy instructions for use.</li>
            <li> I received my skin solutions a few days ago and I love it.  Installing the batteries is pretty tricky, but I received an email from ESS and they clearly defined how to open the battery compartment and a brief description as to why it is a little tough to open.  I appreciated the email.</li>
            <li> love the multiple brushes and options</li>
            <li> This is a great deal for a great quality product.  I love that it comes with a body brush and a pumice as well as the two face brushes.  The deep cleaning face brush was not rough on my skin at all and it does a good job of removing makeup.  I liked the sensitive skin brush as well, but if Im wearing makeup, I use the deep cleaning brush.  The pumice stone didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped and it stops spinning if you apply pressure.  If I used the edges I was able to get the dead skin off my toes, but not the rough skin on my heels, even after a soak in water.  I&#x27;ll still need to use my pedi egg for my heels, but all in all, I still give it five stars because I got it to clean my skin and it works great for that purpose.</li>
            <li> I decided to order this exfoliator because the basic throw-away exfoliation sponges did not work well enough for me.  I looked around Amazon, and this system gave the most options for the price and received good reviews.  At first, I was worried about opening the battery housing because people mentioned it was difficult to open.  Upon receiving my package and purchasing the batteries required at a local store, I had no problem opening the battery housing.  I was surprised, because I usually need help opening things like jars and sometimes even water bottles.  To open the housing, I pressed down, pulled, and turned a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the device three times now.  The first time I tried it out, I took a shower and used the big body brush and the deep cleansing face brush.  When I went to bed that night, I could still feel the circular vibrations on my skin, which felt really neat!  It actually helped me sleep.  The second time I used it, I used it while taking a bath.  I used the body brush after I shaved, which made my legs crazy soft, especially after using my favorite moisturizers afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; face brush daily and it has really improved my skin already.  I had breakouts because my face wasn&#x27;t cleaned deep enough and it felt &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; even after using exfoliation sponges.  A lot of my pimples went away and the overall texture of my skin is improving.  Right now, I use it with a cleanser or just with water while in the shower.  After I finish, I pat my face dry and apply a moisturizer.  I have a fringe, so keeping my forehead clean is very important.  The soft brush does a great job, and is really gentle on my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got my package and opened it, I did not know which face brush was the &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; cleaner or the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; and sensitive one.  I accidentally used the &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; clean brush two days in a row.  The first time I used it, the brush tips turned a brownish color.  I was happy but upset.  I was happy because I figured it sure worked well, but upset because my face did not have makeup on it and the brush became dirty-looking after being used only once.  The second time I used the &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; brush, my skin became very red.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was using the &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; brush the first time I used it, so I thought it was the softer one, I was aware I was using the wrong one after my skin reacted so negatively.  As a result, I tried the other brush and it was very light and gentle, which is the one I now use every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product, in only a couple days it has done what I expected it would do in a week.  I have not used the foot add-on yet because my feet are smooth already, but I will try it later.sh color.  I was happy but upset.

            <li> Works as advertised, I haven&#x27;t had the chance to try it on my face yet, I bought this so my epilator can grab the hairs on my legs.  My leg hairs sometimes try to grow length wise under the top of my skin so I was hoping this would brush away the top layer of skin on my legs. It didn&#x27;t really help with that though :/</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend money on Clarisonic!  This system is fantastic.  Body, feet, face -- it does it all.  Being waterproof means it can be used with showers, baths, watching off makeup before bed.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Works beautifully and the follow up from the buyer was amazing. She went out of her way to email me to make sure I was satisfied and to give me more information about the product as well as offering to answer any additional questions. She stood behind the value and quality of the product and I will definately do business again. I&#x27;ve been using Amazon to purchase products for years and this is this first time a buyer has taken the time to do this. Thank you.</li>
            <li> The three brushes are all the same, just different sizes.  I would have preferred to have at least one brush that had a little less soft bristles.  Otherwise it works okay.</li>
            <li> I really love this brush. The body brush is so great for working on areas that might have raised bumps and smooths out your skin. I use the sensitive face brush and find that it has enough scrubbing power for my face. The pumice stone works wonder on my heels as well. I highly recommend this product. The product comes exactly as pictured in the ad pictured and was delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> The battery isn&#x27;t as strong and lasting.</li>
            <li> Well, I am 54 years old and used this once, and loved how my face felt. My daughter , 15 yrs.old used a different brush on face- sensitive- acne on forehead and liked how ir felt. We will see. There are brushes for face and body. We will see. Thanks. I have now been using the brush for &#x27;not sensitive skin &#x27;for 2 weeks and my skin is definitely smoother and feels better. It has a very healthy glow and I have not put any face powder,cover up or concealer.</li>
            <li> I have a very hard time with these systems because of my sensitive skin. I started using this because I wanted to have a glow and soft skin without the use of makeup. This system was amazing! I use it every day in the shower and i dab just a little face wash then go to town! I don&#x27;t know why the other person who wrote a review stating you can&#x27;t use this every day. I do and I have no problems. I follow up with my toner and moisturizer after. People have defiantly noticed a difference and I have seen a large reduction of black heads and pores. My husband has been using it too (I use the soft face brush and he uses the regular) and noticed a difference. The company that sells this is so nice and easy to talk to. I will be buying these for Christmas gifts this year!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend. This product has made a large impact in my skin regimen. Once a week I use this with the sensitive brush head and a simple cleanser, CeraVe foaming facial cleanser. After showers I use a say yes to cucumber face wipe and nighttime say yes to carrots moisturizer. When I wake I use say yes to carrots daytime moisturizer. I have combination skin. I hope this review helps 🌈</li>
            <li> I really loved this product, I felt that it helped me with not only my acne but also helped me get rid of all that dead skin and calluses on my feet! I will definitely tell other people about this product!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and seems to work really well!</li>
            <li> Nice product. Cleans skin and helps it shine</li>
            <li> OMG! So I never had a facial, and never used a Microdermabrasion brush. I was afraid the brushes we&#x27;re going to feel abrasive and may be uncomfortable to exfoliate my skin. Boy was I wrong! I applied a hydrating facial cleanser, put on the normal face brush (there&#x27;s a sensitive one too) and started with my forehead. It felt so soft! I felt like a car getting buffed! Haha! I went all around my face and it worked beautifully! I also used it on my stubble (around my cheeks and my neck) and I know this will help my folliculitis caused by my very curly facial hair. I HIGHLY recommend this product! 😍😍😍</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it compares to a clarisonic but it does work.  For the price it is good.</li>
            <li> Nice ! Works great ! Got mine the day I was told.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product, it was just as described!!!!</li>
            <li> Works really well, good on sensitive skin also!</li>
            <li> I used this brush the first night I received.  I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> Immediately after he started using it, I could tell a difference in the number of blackheads on my teen son&#x27;s face.  Even though he objected to using it, he now does it without even being told to.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of using the brush for face and body. It really cleans pores better than anything I&#x27;ve tried so far. However, the brushes are attached to the core by squeezing in and the cheap plastic that is not durable can easily chip off, bend or break and the heads, especially the biggest one can fall off.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I ordered this set instea­d of paying $100 or more for a Clairison­ic. It works wonderfully. I love that it­ is water proof.</li>
            <li> Love this! Its a must for my every day beauty regime. I have had facial brushes in the past and mainly bought this for the body brush, but I absolutely love everything in this kit. I have super sensitive skin and was a little worried the first time I used the facial brush, but I swear, some of the dark spots were not even noticeable. I have had the kit about a week now and use it every day with a sensitive skin foaming cleanser and my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> it was a gift so can&#x27;t say much thought it was nice</li>
            <li> This cleansing brush feels good and does what it&#x27;s supposed to. I only wish it went slightly faster to get better friction, especially for use with the pumice attachment.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!! Gentle but effective</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having trouble lately with breaking out and my normal face wash just wasn&#x27;t cutting it so I thought I would give this a try. I have only been using it for a week now but I am loving it! It is able to clean much deeper than if I just used my fingers!! My face is super smooth immediately afterwards. I love that it is waterproof, I wash my face in the shower so it&#x27;s perfect for that. The body attachment is also nice. I have trouble with getting ingrown hairs on my legs after shaving so I have to exfoliate a lot, and this is really helping to get in there deep. Tip: don&#x27;t use thick scrubs. I used my sugar scrub for my face and it just got clumped on there and it made the bristles oily since my scrub has oil in it. Not sure what I was thinking, but I went and bought Neutrogena oil free acne wash (cream wash) and it has been working great with it. I&#x27;m wondering how I should be properly cleaning the brushes and storing them? I&#x27;ve been rinsing them off really well and leaving them out to dry, but want to know if there&#x27;s a better way to do it.I haven&#x27;t been storing them in the box, I&#x27;m worried the moisture might cause molding. Any suggestions?</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price &amp; shipping was fast came before the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> I held off on writing a review until I had used a few weeks.  I&#x27;ve had it about a month now, and I can say my skin looks clearer, pores are smaller, I do think some of the lines are diminishing somewhat.  I haven&#x27;t used the pumice stone for the feet, as I already had a good foot care regimen, but the face and body brushes are working really well for my 55 year old skin.</li>
            <li> Love it, use it almost everyday</li>
            <li> Am happy with the product. Works as well as the more expensive name brand. Also appreciate the different brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have problems with my sonic care brush recharging. This is battery operated and more dependable for me. I use the face and body brush in the shower every day. It is a great product.</li>
            <li> Finally found a product that lives up to its claims. Very satisfied and I give it my highest recommendations</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. My skin feels great.</li>
            <li> I had a skin peel and it&#x27;s helping to remove the dead skin in the first use! Good so far.</li>
            <li> I jumped at the opportunity to try this cleansing brush as I have always wanted to incorporate one into my routine.  I have found that using this once at most twice a week is sufficient.  I love how soft my skin feels once I use it.  Don&#x27;t be a typical man, make sure you read the instructions because there is a trick to inserting the batteries.  My hubby has used this product on his rough areas and loves it as well.  LOVE THIS BRUSH!!!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. My face feels really clean after using it, and I use the big brush on my body. Its great cause its  waterproof. I notice some of these brush couldn&#x27;t go under water, but this item can.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:6112fe873baebd88bdcf016ff8ba96a0]]I have wanted one of these for quite a while now.  My teenage daughter has acne and I have large, visible pores.  A salesperson at a department store wanted me to buy one but I just didn&#x27;t want to spend that kind of money (around $100).  I really wanted to give one of these a try to see if it could help.    This kit is even better than others I have looked it.  It has different brushes but is really a whole body kit.  It comes with the cleaning unit, one big body brush, one sensitive skin face brush, one small face brush, and one pumice.  So you can do your face, whole body and feet with this one set.  It&#x27;s very easy to use.  The attachments just pop onto the end and you press the power button.  I use my normal facial soap on it and get it good and wet then move it all over my face.  I have figured out how hard to press the unit to my face based on what feels comfortable for me.  My daughter uses the regular face brush and I use the sensitive one.  I feel like when I am done that my face is so much cleaner than just washing with my hands or a washcloth.  My daughter uses it once a day in the evenings when washing her face.  I do use a make up remover first  then use the brushing system.  After you are done, you rinse the brush off and store.  The unit is water proof and can be used wet or dry and with or without soap.      If you are looking for an affordable brushing system, I would recommend giving this one a try.  It has definitely earned 5 stars in my book!    Sample purchased at a reduced rate in exchange for evaluation and my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> OMG!!! My whole household loves this. I absolutely enjoy the whole routine. My face and body feel so soft after my shower!  Our son has some dry patches on his legs and I have had him use it over those and his legs are getting better. Its a great product. Love that it us waterproof.  It has the pumice attachment for my feet and I have been using that to my advantage a lot!!!  This is a must!!! Thank you so much.  Getting one for my mom for her b-day!</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush because I have some dry patches in between my eyes and around my nose that I cannot get rid of. I also suffer from adult acne rosacea. I was a little disappointed with the speed of the brush when I first started using it but it has done the job. I still have a little bit of dryness but it has helped with pore size and made my skin soft. I use the body brush in the shower every day for acne on my shoulders and it has cleared up since using the body brush. Overall, I good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> The revolution of the scrubber is slow but it cleans my face without causing skin irritation. I use mine twice a day. Love this product.</li>
            <li> The seller is very proactive and sent me an email when I ordered this system with some tips on how to use and how to register for the warranty. So far, I&#x27;m loving this system and I use it at least 4 times a week!</li>
            <li> Great brush for your whole body. I was contemplating the sonic brush for a year but I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pay that kind of money. I got this one and love it! Great price and the replacements are a good price too. i highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> I really wanted a Sonic brush but I lack the money to afford one. This brush set is just as good though! Ive used it for about a week now and its helped buff away my rising acne and exfoliate the dead skin away. You DO need a good moisturizer afterwards though, because like any face brush itll dry out from scrubbing away all the oil and toxins on your skin.</li>
            <li> I have never left a review before but I had to come and write one for this product. I have only been using this for 1 week and I have seen and noticed tremendous improvement on my skin, my acne blemishes are clearing and skin looks smoother and lovely. Will definitely  recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> I love my Essential Skin Solutions kit! It makes my skin feel incredibly soft and I love love love how soft the brushes are!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I hesitated to make this investment.  I give this product 5 stars because thus far I have received every bang for my buck. Initially, I was going to order from another competitor but after revising and comparing reviews and my budget essential skin solutions was definitely the top runner. Delivery was quick and stress free. Packaging and Product was immaculate upon arrival.  Now to the meat of the matter:&lt;br /&gt;After having a baby I found that my skin didn&#x27;t look the same. My pores seemed larger, my skin was dull looking etc. I began using the small sensitive brush on my face and the large body brush on the rest of my body. As I began using ESS  I can admit that I have seen a huge reduction in my pores and my skin looks and feels so much softer. And I if I thought I was imagining, my husband complimented me on the improvement of my skin texture etc and how impressed he is with this product.  He&#x27;ll be getting one as well. ESS thank u for an amazing product that delivers for a fraction of the price than other competitors out there. I would be recommending  this product  to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Really works!</li>
            <li> Great kit with quality brushes at a good price (1 brush for sensitive, 1 large body, and one regular) plus exfoliating pumice that is very effective on calluses.  If HAVING PROBLEMS OPENING IT just put a RUBBER BAND around the battery compartment handle and push it open -- I use the wide bands that come on vegetables and it works fine with less strength.  It would help if the sensitive skin brush was marked as such but that&#x27;s minor -- you can always use a sharpie on the back.  It&#x27;s still working great over a year later.  PS. I use rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use it every day.  The facial brush was a little soft for me but I just use body brush on my fave too</li>
            <li> Perfect Cleansing Brush! The variety of heads make it great for the whole body. My skin is much softer and feel great after a week of using this! It is also very affordable!</li>
            <li> The Perfect Skin Brushing System is everything  that was advertised  and  very  easy to use.  I  am telling all of my friends  and family about it  and  encourage them to get  one.</li>
            <li> So far I LOVE this brush and would give 1,000 stars if I could ~  I have to say I was a little hesitate in ordering because of the reviews stating that the motor did not work/quit working after a short amount of time.  Although I have only had this (wonderful) brush for a couple of days I have fallen in love with it already and pray every time that I use it that will not be an issue with it turning on because I am addicted! LOL ~ The customer service department has been phenomenal and that is greatly appreciated.  I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone and should the brush go bad I have all the confidence that Essential Skin Solutions will do ever they can to make it right. Thank you for such an outstanding product at an affordable price!</li>
            <li> The kit has all required brushes that can be used on both your face and body (back, arms, feet). The only thing bothering me is that it has only one speed. Hence you won&#x27;t be able to feel much different on your feet and face though brushes are changed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few days and swear I can already see results! My face is smoother and less dry, my body feels more toned and toes look like I just got a pedicure. This is a great product and at the fraction of the price of some competitors.</li>
            <li> I never used this product or similar ones available in the market before. So, I am not the best person to compare this product with its counterparts. However, this product had instant effects on my acnes, especially on my shoulder and upper back, and arms. It hasn&#x27;t changed my facial skin a lot yet! Thanks to my mom for recommending this product to me.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works great. My skin feels smooth afterwards. I only use it about every other day. I have had no problems with putting in the batteries or with the brush stopping, and I was pushing pretty firmly. It works in the shower well. I like it!</li>
            <li> I use this several times a week to clean my face. Does a great job. Even use it in the shower at times when doing a facial cleaning. No issues. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I use this frequently, mostly on my face, but often on my body when I bathe. I definitely notice a difference when I use it consistently - my face is brighter, clearer, blackheads and pores shrink. It&#x27;s a good tool, and I am thinking of getting it as a gift for a few women. The only drawback is that it is battery-operated. I would prefer it to be chargeable and not go through batteries. Other than that, I really like it.</li>
            <li> I recently brought this product &amp; have used all the attachments several times already. The best part is I am able to use it in the shower. I only wish the pumice stone was bigger otherwise I love it!</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how my skin felt. Super smooth and clean. Plus with the use of batteries no need to worry about charging, or over charging to the point where the internal battery will die. Honestly I am happy with the results I am getting and won&#x27;t be spending hundreds of dollars on something else. I am over 60 so I have mature sensitive skin, and use the softest brush in the package.</li>
            <li> I have used this once on my legs before using a self tanner, it was easy to use and my skin felt great. I am anxious to try it on my face.</li>
            <li> Love this system it&#x27;s great, just wish the body brush was a bit more powerful. It&#x27;s a real good quality system.</li>
            <li> Hello and Welcome to My Review of the Essential Skin Solution; Perfect Skin - Brushing System!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been in search of a perfect gift for my Mum that was not over my budget. I settled to purchase her an electronic acne cleanser. Myself not being experienced with the acne cleansing industry, did not help my search. I had to find the perfect product, it had to have a good amount of positive reviews and was in my budget, which I have to add (my budget) was very low due to the unfortunate shortage of money. All of the products I&#x27;ve found were around $50-$200 and I nearly was going to cave--until I found this product miraculously. It is a perfect find! The rating is great and the price was perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself comes with 4 brushes, 1 large and 3 miniature. It also comes with a lovely booklet that tells you that by reviewing their products they&#x27;ll send you a free gift! (Who doesn&#x27;t love freebies?!) The packaging is smooth and refined, the brushes are soft and fluffy, and the brushing system itself has a lovely grip to it for easy and comfortable use (boy, I sound like a commercial.) one of the added bonuses (also helping the environment) is that you can use the package as a storage space so your brushes and brushing system do not become dirty after constant use. The product itself is waterproof which is always a lovely bonus, but what I am most impressed with is the fact that this is not just for your face but it can be used on other areas where you may have acne!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only disappointment I received from this product is that mine had a few defects on the brushing system itself and since this is a gift I&#x27;ve become a little anxious. Nonetheless I am extremely impressed and cannot wait to gift my mother this in a couple of days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product; whether it be for yourself or a loved one!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. The first day I used it I could see the difference in my skin. I have been using it for a week now together with my clean and clear face wash and face treatment and my face has cleared up so much. I can walk around with no makeup and my face looks great. I love the fact that the brush comes with multiple heads. I saw similar brushes for about 100 dollars and then found this brush for 25 dollars. If you are looking for a cheap solution to clear skin I will recommend you get this brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Used it as soon as I got it and I noticed my skin was smother and softer right away.</li>
            <li> LOVE! I didn&#x27;t realize it came with so many different brushes! The body brush feels great and the stone is fantastic on my feet. I&#x27;m so happy I ordered this!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as an exfoliating face brush, but I was shocked how much I enjoy using it to exfoliate the rest of my body.  I use the small brush for my face and the large brush for my body.  After a long day working (and swearing) in the garden, it&#x27;s great to jump in the shower and use the body brush to hit my back/shoulders/neck with the rotating brush and clear away all the sunscreen and dead skin cells.  I really like the whole kit and think that it&#x27;s a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Very gentle non-abrasive cleansing brush. At this price it makes a great gift!</li>
            <li> Love this brush i feel so smooth and clean , this is the perfect skin brushing system that clean deep inside.</li>
            <li> This has been great so far. I have very sensitive skin so most scrubs or anything abrasive does more damage than good. I have only used the sensitive brush on my face so far and it hasn&#x27;t caused any discomfort. I&#x27;m already seeing a difference in my skins texture, it&#x27;s becoming smoother and softer.  For the price you can&#x27;t beat it. Nice product!</li>
            <li> It came so fast and the product has really left me speechless</li>
            <li> This this is amazing! I just started using it today but, I can already say that this makes my skin glow. I used it with my microdermabrasion scrub and the power this brush has is what I needed for the effectiveness I need to clear up my hyper-pigmentation and the deep scars from years of battling acne. I refuse to pay $150 for the popular cleansing brush that doesn&#x27;t even rotate like this one. I am looking forward to see how my skin will look a month from now. I just ordered one for my mother as an early mother&#x27;s day gift as well. So happy that I took a chance on this.</li>
            <li> I just moved and just now able to use my wonderful Skin Cleansing  WOW! G8 price and the product works. I am getting another because my daughters keep taking mine out of my bathroom :)</li>
            <li> great body brush and very luxuriating makes me feel so clean.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT ! I Best customer service!!!!!!  &amp; product is great WOULD DEFINITELY R ECCO MEND</li>
            <li> Made my pores on my nose smaller in two uses.</li>
            <li> Perfect! i have oily skin and it works wonders to remove the access oil and make my skin soft!</li>
            <li> love it, use it everyday</li>
            <li> this product is amazing! i can&#x27;t explain how amazing it works, even my husband loves the product</li>
            <li> It works great! I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I was not quite sure what to expect out of this product.  However, I used it and loved it.  I used it on my face and my skin was glowing afterwards.  I also used the pumice on my feet and it worked great.  Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I received the item on Friday(very quickly), I used it that night! I didn&#x27;t read the instructions first so I didn&#x27;t know that I should have removed my makeup first.. :( The makeup did stain the brush a little but not too bad. I read the directions after and saw that it recommends removing make up first. After I rinsed my face my skin feel wonderful! So far I love it! Now I need to find a spot to keep it in my bathroom...</li>
            <li> the product is just awesome .... My skin feel so clean n shinny after first use ... It was worth buying ... I have suggested my friends for same ...:</li>
            <li> My skin is too sensitive to it.</li>
            <li> I could not get the brushes to attach firmly.  I followed the directions but once I put the body brush (the reason why I bought it) to my skin, I could give it zero pressure or it would fly off.  It&#x27;s going back.</li>
            <li> I love the skin cleansing face and body brush. The brushes for the face are wonderful and makes your face feel so clean and are not abrasive like others I used. I would definitely recomend this. I have seen a change in my face, It looks so much brighter and healthier. I have a few dark spots and those also seem to be fading.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the brushes. Not so soft</li>
            <li> Works great! Makes your skin feel smooth &amp; skin products absorb better. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product!  Must skin feels sooo smooth and clean!!  I,m so glad I found it!  a real boost to exfoliation!!!  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I like it! I&#x27;ve been using it daily and my dark spots are fading and when I get new blemishes they fade faster than before I started using this brush. I Only wish it had another speed setting and came with a few spare brush heads.</li>
            <li> Works well for me. Some say that it&#x27;s not powerful enough but I think it&#x27;s good enough strength for my face.</li>
            <li> 英语&lt;br /&gt;Tell a friend buy cleansing instrument after use is also good</li>
            <li> I love the facial brush, I feel it deeply cleanses my face. Since I started using it, my face has really cleared up. I will definitely be buying the replacement brushes as soon as possible.</li>
            <li> I just got this brush set and can tell I&#x27;m going to love it. I&#x27;ve been using the soft facial brush and body brush daily and my skin has never looked better. The pumice wheel for the feet does an excellent job. The handle part is water proof making it a great item to have in the bath or shower. And it came in a very nice, sturdy display box suitable for gift giving. In fact my daughter saw mine and wants one now. The various attachments easily snap on and off. It takes 4 AA batteries, not included, and that was probably the most difficult part was installing the batteries, but all you have to do is squeeze the handle and pull and it comes right off. The way it&#x27;s designed is to be a snug fit so that it can be used in wet conditions. I would buy this again without hesitation.</li>
            <li> I reserved my review to after 8 days of usage. This is by far the best brushing system that I have ever owned. I&#x27;ve been battling fine lines and pimple scars and within 8 days I&#x27;ve not only seen a difference but also felt a difference. The pumice does wonders for my feet and the body brush makes my shower experience even better. It feels as though the brushes get way below the skin and cleans my pores out.  I have received many compliments from strangers about how radiant my skin looks. I would recommend this product for any skin type, however if you have sensitive skin like I do, be sure to use the sensitive brush only on your face. I should mention that I was not given an incentive to write this review.</li>
            <li> I love it!! Just make sure you buy the 4 AA batteries! I almost didn&#x27;t think of it! Love all the brushes. Not a fan of the pumice stone one; but I&#x27;ve never liked those anyway. All around nice product and very well priced! Also can use it in the shower!!!! Wonderful!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Using and enjoying it very much.</li>
            <li> This was an awesome deal, i use it all the time. I love it. For anyone looking for one, this is the one. My skin gets dirty from working in a kitchen, and this cleans my skin perfectly.  I highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it comes with many attachment options, I&#x27;ve used the body one much more than I expected just because it leaves me feeling extra clean! Company takes great pride in their product too, will be using this over and over again, can&#x27;t beat the price either</li>
            <li> Great product for great price</li>
            <li> Worked really well. But you have to hold the ON button. Hard to do back and shoulders</li>
            <li> I know there are tons of these brushes out on the market. I can&#x27;t tell you how this one compares to others, but I can tell you that this one is a great product!! I use it on my face, body, and yes my feet!! It truly works great!! I would definitely purchase this again!! Great product!! Great seller!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! I use it for my face and body and it works great!</li>
            <li> I ordered one for me and one for my daughter! She loves it and uses it twice a day. I use mine in the morning on my face and like the way it makes my skin feel. Nice product and the shipping was fast. It&#x27;s also good that you can use it in the shower! Easy to use and makes the skin feel good!</li>
            <li> Over the last few years, I&#x27;ve began to have rough patches of skin on my face.  I&#x27;ve tried exfoliation products, creams, prescription products from my dermatologist, with very little improvement.  FINALLY I&#x27;m seeing results.  It took a couple of months, but this brush along with Aqua Glycolic wash and cream has helped a lot.  I tried the Aqua Glycolic alone first and saw a slight improvement, so the brush is what really made the biggest difference.  The rough patches were almost gone when I broke it...and they began to return pretty quickly.  I contacted them per the instructions on the warranty and they shipped a new one the very next day!  Didn&#x27;t even make me wait and return it first.  Super nice people, super product!  Do it!</li>
            <li> I love this!  Not too harsh on my face but not to soft on my body.  I can use my own face wash which I really like.  Easy to clean and operate!</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to get one for some time now and finally after reading many reviews decided to get this brand. I don&#x27;t know how well the others work, but I am very happy with this system. I use the facial brush 2-3 times a week, maybe less, and my face feels great every single time. The skin is soft, it does not damage it, and leaves it feeling smooth and rejuvenated. For the price - it&#x27;s a great buy, I have seen brushes 4-5 times more expensive and looks like they are doing the exact same job. I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend to a friend (actually, I did, to several).</li>
            <li> So far, I have only used each of the brushes once but I have already noticed a difference in my skin, especially in my face.</li>
            <li> Just received it and it works fantastic.  Had an accident on my bike and have scar tissue on my eyebrow.  The constant rotation has broke up a major portion of scar tissue and is improving.  I love this face &amp; body brush!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 16 year old daughter for Christmas.  She had been asking for one for months but they were so expensive.  I found this one and it had good reviews and a good price.  My daughter is very pleased with it.  After using it for the first time, she stated that the rough skin on her chin and forehead was gone.  She uses it daily.  I have used it once and it was really nice.  I think I will have to purchase one for myself.  Like in some of the other reviews, I had a hard time opening the battery cover.  I think it is more of a pull downward than pinch inward.  This was not really a problem, especially since you don&#x27;t change batteries that often.  Overall, this is a very good purchase.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes leaves my skin feeling super soft. The power is perfect even with the pumice stone.</li>
            <li> I liked how well this cleaned, but it&#x27;s not for super sensitive skin like mine. I got blotchy. I do play to try it again with a different cleanser. I do love how it works on my body though. Specially my feet! It makes them super soft!</li>
            <li> Just started using product and very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> My face has never felt so smooth and clean! I love this!</li>
            <li> I love this system. It was cheaper and more affordable than others. I use this everyday with great results!!!</li>
            <li> I thought I liked my last face brush, but this one is so much better.  For the money, I don&#x27;t know how I get more from a product.  What I like so much about this unit is the body brush.  I use it in the shower every couple of days and can&#x27;t believe how smooth and soft my skin feels.  My face loves it too.  Highly recommend this face/body brush.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product. I received the product a week ago and have used twice. Item as described and pleased with exfoliation results. Especially pleased with more difficult areas around nose.</li>
            <li> MAY 2015:So far, so good. I have only had this product for a few days and just started using it three days ago. It&#x27;s very easy to operate and the bristles are soft enough to feel comfortable as they clean yet strong enough to do the dirty work. It does clean deep! The only two cons so far is the battery compartment is a pain to open and in lieu of four AA batteries I would rather have it rechargeable like a razor, etc. I&#x27;m sure I will be replacing batteries often. But that&#x27;s not a deal breaker. I like this product. I use Burt&#x27;s Bees Orange facial cleanser with it and it leaves my face nice and smooth. Will update this review when I use the pumice attachment. This is a good product for the money. Give it a try. UPDATED REVIEW: November 28, 2015: I&#x27;m sorry to say that this item turned out to be a lemon. After six months of regular use the spinner stopped working despite changing the batteries, keeping the apparatus in good shape and never dropping it. I think it should last longer than six months and I am very disappointed that I probably won&#x27;t get very far if I contact the company for a replacement or a refund. This is too bad as when it worked, it worked great. Unfortunately, I am changing my rating to two stars. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Lets just say that the product its good but you can find another cheaper options, so its not a good feeling.</li>
            <li> I use this almost every night and I love how well it cleans.  The blackheads on my nose disappeared after just a couple uses and it exfoliates so well!</li>
            <li> I love this product but I was a little disappointed when the prices went up so fast without any notice so I had to pay $15 extra than the original price that I&#x27;d seen. I definitely recommend though.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this! The price is MUCH better than the other options out there and this brush is every bit as good, if not better, than the competition! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> We received the skin cleaning system and was really impressed with the look and feel. It seems to be made well. Really good value for similar items we&#x27;ve seen at stores for over $100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my husband I are actually using it and after 10 days, starting to see a difference in our complexion</li>
            <li> Got this as a present for a young friend. She loves it! Seems to really get her face clean and polished looking. Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Fantastic!  My face never felt better!  Excellent product have referred many of my friends.</li>
            <li> This really brightens my complextion and tightens my skin.  It&#x27;s gentle too.</li>
            <li> I love the different brushes and the pumice stone.  The face brush did an amazing job at cleaning around my nose, and I felt that it was really getting down into the pores.  I used the pumice stone on my heels, and I know I&#x27;ll be using it often.  It&#x27;s going to save me a lot of money when I get pedicures, not paying the extra money to have them work on my heels.  I love this product, and I&#x27;d recommend it to all of my friends.  It&#x27;s well worth the price and compares to those other expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> Once I became pregnant, my skin went haywire.  An esthetician recommended that I purchase a face cleansing brush.  So many of the brushes were very expensive.  With a baby on the way, spending tons of money on a brush was not on the list.  I saw this brush, decent reviews and reasonable price so I decided to give it a shot.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It&#x27;s battery-operated, works in the shower and has already improved the appearance of my skin (I&#x27;ve only had it for approximately 2 weeks).  For the cost and quality, you can&#x27;t find a better product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this set. Seriously, I ordered the set in April 2015 and have been using it all summer. The facial brush has completely cleared my skin and reduced the oiliness of my skin. I have not worn any makeup all summer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body brush is also awesome! It makes your body super smooth and flawless. I use the body brush daily to prevent any shoulder or elbow breakouts. I use it in the bikini and underarm area before shaving. It makes for a smoother, more long lasting shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really does a fantastic job of keeping my body blemish free!</li>
            <li> They tell you they provide a warranty if you register with them - but they don&#x27;t. Don&#x27;t fall for it. I registered TWICE, thinking that maybe the first time I had made a mistake somewhere. Nope! They never sent me a certificate of warranty, and within a few short months, the brush gave out. Save your time, save your money.</li>
            <li> It works exactly how is is described. The moter in it kinda seems a little weak but it does the job great. The brissles are nice and soft and really get deep into your skin. I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Works great.  We did have a minor snafu with the unit, but the company &#x27;not amazon&#x27; sent us a new one,  headache free!</li>
            <li> I love it! I&#x27;ve NEVER felt so clean!!! Easy to use and fun...Thank you for your produce at a reasonable price!  Mrs. M</li>
            <li> Gives a very thorough cleaning with little effort.</li>
            <li> Best product ive bought to date! Awesome customer service!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this! My skin feels amazing and there is even a slight visible improvement after just two uses! My pores look a little smaller and visibly clogged pore that I&#x27;ve had for awhile is gone. And it&#x27;s affordable too!</li>
            <li> I love the skin cleansing face and body. It helps clean your skin deep its not to rough on your skin it can be used on your face and your body. Plus gave the attachment to get rid of the calluses on your feet. You can use it the shower.  I highly recommend this to those who want clean soft akin.</li>
            <li> The price isn&#x27;t bad and you get what you pay for. My face feels super smooth after I use this. That being said after I used this everyday for a week my face started breaking out so I cut it down to 2x a week. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it more than that, not really an everyday kind of thing.</li>
            <li> While the product works well, it is NOT durable. My set lasted 3 months and the reviews pertaining to great customer service aren&#x27;t accurate in my situation as I reached out to them over 2 weeks ago via email wanting a new set or a discount. I will gladly send it back so they can see it does not work anymore. But they have not even responded. I say spend a little extra money. Also the brushes are not durable either...</li>
            <li> Works very well, I have tried other cleansing brushes and this one seems to be the best!</li>
            <li> Works great for smooth skin!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft. I love it! Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product. It leaves my skin fresh, clean &amp; glowing.</li>
            <li> I just received this today and used it about an hour after I got it.  I can&#x27;t give any &#x27;long-term&#x27; results yet, but I will update in about 2 months.  I can say that it&#x27;s very easy to use, the most challenging part was getting the battery door opened.  However, they do tell you to expect this as it assures the unit of being waterproof!  My husband to the rescue.....and he had to play with it to get it open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get an email from the company, which was a really nice unexpected thing.  They also mentioned the &#x27;how to&#x27;  and &#x27;why&#x27; of the battery door.  This product, and the customer service, got rave reviews on Amazon.  I always read the reviews before I buy anything from Amazon.  These either let me go forward to purchase, or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this Perfect Skin - Brushing System.....you&#x27;ll be most satisfied!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to buy one of these for a while but never wanted to spend the money on the high priced systems you see in the store or spas. I also wasted to start dry brushing and I thought this kit would be a perfect solution for a good price to have both a brush for my face and for my body. I have been using the facial soft brush morning and night for a week now and really like how my face feels afterwards! I&#x27;ve only used the body brush about twice and like it so far as well. I would definitely recommend this product especially for the price, quality, and the amount of customer service they show on everyone that purchases! Thank you! :)</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. I love this product. My face feels extra clean and soft. I have only used the face brush at this point which was my intent. I will get around to using the other attachments. I&#x27;m going to get another set for my fiancé.</li>
            <li> Really happy with my purchase!  Love all the brushes especially the biggest one on my legs before I shave. I don&#x27;t care for the stone to much. But over all very happy with it.  Oh and follow the directions to open it or you will have a hard time.</li>
            <li> Just not for me, my skin is too sensitive unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I love it so far I love the features. Other than the battery compartment being hard to open, I love it!!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:b0c3f2b1d4bf579a6b245642e70723f7]] So far I am really liking this Skin/body brushing cleaning system from Essential Skin Solutions.I really like how well it deep cleans your face &amp; body versus manually washing it.We have all had those days where you wear makeup all day come manually wash your face and finish with toner &amp; you still see dirt being picked up on your cotton ball.This is not the case with this cleaning brush system because it really gets your pores clean &amp; gets all the dirt you have on your face that you would normally miss if you just manually did it.Those are one of my reasons of liking this soo much and it does a great job at prepping your skin for moisturizing.You can finally get the full benefit from using your facial creams,eye creams,oils, or whatever it is that you use after washing up.I have a variation of what I use and change it up between my organic face creams,eye creams,oils(jojoba),&amp; serums.After using this system I really feel my skin is super clean and even has a natural glow like to it.You can totally tell the difference after using this.I also like how it has 4 different attachments to use when in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you get:&lt;br /&gt;1-Handheld unit - I like the handle and how it fits in your hand.It has a rubber part that makes it easy to grip in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;1-Big exfoliating body brush - Great to use to exfoliate your entire body.I like how you can use this wet or dry.Great to prevent ingrown hairs after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;1-Small exfoliating face brush - This has done a great job at exfoliating my face and removing all those unwanted dead skin &amp; dirt.Everything you miss while manually washing your face this will get it all.&lt;br /&gt;1-Sensitive Skin exfoliating face brush- Gentle for cleansing or buffing sensitive skin.Or you can use this daily if you are a frequent user of this like I am.&lt;br /&gt;1-Pumice Stone - Exfoliates &amp; smooths away your dead skin on your feet.I did not really use this much as the others since I already have a callus remover I use specifically for this.But it is nice to have in case I need to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This does not come with AA batteries which are required.I would suggest using Alkaline if you have those laying around they last much longer than the regular AA.I would also suggest NOT using thicker cleaning face/body wash for this system or even lotions as they suggest it can shorten the life of your bristles &amp; get stuck between the bristles.Something like a clean and clear thin liquid face wash consistency should work good.Overall I am very pleased with this system.I like the quality of the product,you get multiple use out of it (body/face/feet),waterproof, &amp; most of all because it really does a great job at cleaning/prepping your skin for moisturizing it so you can get the maximum benefit from the creams you use afterwards.This is way better than manually trying to clean your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample received at discount for inspection purposes.a callus remover I use specifically for this.But it is nice to have in case I need to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This does not come with AA batteries which are required.I would suggest using Alkaline if you have those laying around they last much longer than the regular AA.I would also suggest NOT using thicker cleaning face/body wash for this system or even lotions as they suggest it can shorten the life of your bristles &amp; get stuck between the bristles.Something like a clean and clear thin liquid face wash consistency should work good.Overall I am very pleased with this system.I like the quality of the product,you get multiple use out of it (body/face/feet),waterproof, &amp; most of all because it really does a great job at cleaning/prepping your skin for moisturizing it so you can get the maximum benefit from the creams you use afterwards.This is way better than manually trying to clean your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample received at discount for inspection purposes.</li>
            <li> Great set! I really am impressed. I wasn&#x27;t sure what the hype was about these skin cleansing systems, but I do now that I have this unit. My skin feels and looks amazing! I used the large body brush in the shower and it&#x27;s awesome. All the dry itchy skin is long gone. I used the smaller brush on my face with me regular cleanser, my face has never felt cleaner ot more refreshed. It looks brighter, healthier and more radiant. It&#x27;s the middle of winter here in ohio and my skin, face and body, looks incredible! It was easy to use. Comes in a nice gift/storage box. I am happy to recieve this system to review. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Excellent, us it twice weekly.</li>
            <li> Gentle yet effective. Skin feels clean and smooth. Use with any cleansing soap if desired.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have ordered it several times now. It goes on so smoothly and doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin. It is free of known chemicals harmful to our health.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and as described. Have been using the product for about a week now and I can already see a difference in my skin. It gets rid of all my blackheads. The body brush is great too! It&#x27;s been smoothing away the bumps on my upper arms.</li>
            <li> Total body care package</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an electric brush for my face. This one is great! I highly recommend this kit.</li>
            <li> Very very good I love it</li>
            <li> I was slightly hesitant to order this, but I&#x27;m so glad I did! As a 32 yr old with adult acne, I can tell you this is one beauty tool i found about 20 years too late. I use tretinoin, which is a cream prescribed for acne. Although it works, it causes skin to constantly be dry and flaky. This tool helps to gently slough it away without being to harsh on my face. I like that it comes with multiple brush heads, and I use them all! The pumice stone works great on feet, and the larger brush is great for the entire body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that on some reviews people complain about the speed, but I think it&#x27;s fine... The only time I&#x27;ve noticed a lack in power or speed is when the batteries are dying. Unless you are looking for something with the power of a belt sander (which, for my face, I am not, lol!), this tool will suffice :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The waterproof aspect is also great. I usually keep this in my shower and use it when I wash my face. Obviously it&#x27;s not meant to be submerged, but the battery compartment is tightly sealed and keeps the moisture out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this brush and have noticed an improvement in my skin. It&#x27;s well made and seems like it will last a long time. I also love the box it came in. It was well packaged in a sturdy box, which I still use to store the brushes. Overall, a great purchase!</li>
            <li> This is a good little brush. However, be careful on your face. It seems gentle but can easily &amp;#34;scuff&amp;#34; skin. The body brushes are pretty nice though the sluffing stone is slightly useless. Not a bad value for the money.</li>
            <li> no better than a loufa at the 99 cent store</li>
            <li> deep cleans, minimizes pores and make the skin ready for maximum moisture absorption. I use it almost every day now.</li>
            <li> I got this set but one of the head was wroken.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 2 weeks now. My skin has cleared and it feels a lot smoother. Definitely recommend the product for a more radiant looking screen.</li>
            <li> Love this product, my face feels so clean and smooth after using it. Also, the pumice stone is AMAZING, it got rid of all of the dead skin on my feet and made them so smooth!</li>
            <li> This works very well on all the attachments and power is great. I use it so much and extra attachments can be bought.</li>
            <li> I bought this face &amp;amp; body brush system because my more expesive one broke. I was a little skeptical but I thought I would try it. I am so glad I did. At first I was frustrated because the battery area would not open but then I read the instructions and realized I had to pinch it to get it to open. The manufacturer explained to me that this how they keep sealed so it can be waterproof in the shower. Anyway the Body Brush is awesome. It makes my legs so smooth especially after I shave. The face brushes are great too. I love that it comes with both a soft and firm brush attachment so I can use it everyday without causing any flakiness. The only only other thing I would say is when you use it near your eyes use our fingertips to hold your skin in place so that it doesn&#x27;t move your skin around too much but I love this thing so much I am buying some more as presents. Plus it comes in an awesome gift box so the presentation is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! Highly recommend it! Leaves skin soft and smooth! Merry Christmas to me!!!! :)</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! I am very pleased with this product and absolutely love that I can use them wet or dry. The ability to use the body brush in the shower has been my favorite part. The brushes are very soft and do not aggravate my skin when I use them. I would highly recommend allowing the brushes to air dry before placing them back into their box, which is a great hard shell box that allows for easy storage. My one complaint is the motor drains the four AA batteries very quickly. So best to invest in some rechargeable batteries! I would definitely recommend getting these brushes. I am now a huge fan of Essential Skin Solutions!!</li>
            <li> its and ok product, not great</li>
            <li> Amazing brush. I was looking for some product which can work deeply in my skin. This product is amazing. I tried it on my face, hands and legs. It has few heads which you can switch to. The small hard one is great to remove dead skin but you have to be little careful when you use that head on your face. Dont spend too much time at 1 spot with that head. It deeply cleans the skin.&lt;br /&gt;This has great packaging and it works great on my skin. The big head is for body and small heads are mainly for face. It removes the dead skin and exfoliates the skin deeply.  I am 100% satisfies with this product. I received this product to give my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Same as the higher priced units on the market for much less!</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying this product. It feels substantial and not cheap. The brush helps my skin feel and look great.  After a few months of use, I love this product even more. I like to use non-foaming facial cleanser, and I can use less with the brush and feel much cleaner. It has held up over time and I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!! My skin has improved just after hardly 2 weeks of usage.</li>
            <li> works really well cleansing and exfoliating your skin</li>
            <li> The battery compartment doesnt close all the way so water seeps in so i cant use it in the shower too long but great face brush and exfoliates gently</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as i thought</li>
            <li> Bought it 2 Months ago  and just  stop working ...</li>
            <li> great little tool that really gets the job done. I love the big body attachment And there are2 smalls heads... One regular and one sensitive. You can buy replacement parts on Amazon. Well worth the money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the brush for sensitive skin everyday for about 3weeks now and the exfoliating brush about once a week and I have to say, it&#x27;s working better than I expected.  I have a lot of dark acne scars and while this product doesn&#x27;t promise to make them disappear, my skin does look healthier than it has in years.  My face just feels cleaner and my skin is definitely softer.  I use this along with Murad products that I&#x27;ve been using for a bit longer and I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It helps get my face really clean. It is well worth the money I paid.</li>
            <li> I can understand why it&#x27;s #1... Have had no problems yet... Using this product with a good face cream gets an awesome result... Worth every penny spent...😁</li>
            <li> So far - I love it... I have tried the body brush and sensitive skin brush - I love the way they feel and the way they leave my skin feeling. I actually bought it for my teenage son - hoping he will give it a try on his somewhat acne-prone face. When he does, I will update my feedback.</li>
            <li> just in three days I see My skin glowing....   update -I use it dry. Even my pimple scars are going away....</li>
            <li> It stopped working shortly after I got it.  I used it twice a day, on my face only, and only one head morning and night for about 60-90 seconds each time.  It was slowing and slowing until it eventually just stopped working.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my daughter for Christmas because she tends to break out after exercise. Using a natural soap, she loves the results. She&#x27;s using it every other day now to get her skin use to it and avoid irritation.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Love how it makes my skin feel!</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for two weeks and I love the way it makes my skin look and feel!</li>
            <li> I love that it is waterproof and that it has several attachments...great product</li>
            <li> Product worked great for about a month, then the motor began to drag. The seller was very helpful in fulfilling their warranty obligation &amp; I received a replacement. As long as this one continues to work correctly, I would reccomend this product. I love how smooth it has made my face. Also, it has helped clear up the little bumps on my upper arms.</li>
            <li> WOW! my skin has never felt so soft! Can&#x27;t wait to try it on my body &amp; buy more brushes!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality product. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I think it is an excellent cleansing system-really makes me feel clean especially getting the remaining make-up off my face after I have removed my make-up with special remover.  You can really tell this item deep cleans your face and would recommend this to anyone who is unhappy with just regular washing-I never realized that my cleanser was not removing all of my make-up at night until I used this product.</li>
            <li> The Neutrogena dermabrasion works better for me.  I don&#x27;t use this product on my body.  Maybe if I did I wd be more impressed.</li>
            <li> Exfoliation is the best way to healthy soft radiant skin. I have found dry body brushing to be very effective, but a body brush cannot be used on the face. I finally decided to try a face brush. I looked at the highly coveted Clarisonic but did not want to spend $100 on something I wasn&#x27;t completely sure I really needed. After reading all the good reviews on the Essential Skin Solutions Perfect Skin Bushing System, I decided to buy it and give it a try.  The face brush was the perfect texture and the brush rotated a an ideal speed, not to fast or slow. I used this in the shower and after the very first use I noticed a noticed a significant difference in the way my face felt. It was much smoother than it had ever felt before!  I could also see the difference! I was quite surprised at how ineffective my hand face washing has been. I am now a believer in washing with a face brush over hand washing alone. The Essential Skin Solutions Perfect Skin Brushing System was the Ideal Solution for me!</li>
            <li> Love this gentle brush for my face and the body brush is perfect! Thanks</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.! Every attachment works great... My Mother has callus and and I went straight for the foot attachment to test the product. Although I still used other scrubbers This work GREAT.. No Im not getting paid to say this Im a shopper who doesn&#x27;t play when It comes to spending my money, I hate wasting it, but this  is def not a waste. They warn of the exfoliating brush hurting your skin at first but its not hurtful at ALL.. Maybe its because I usually exfoliate with products but its not painful or anything. The only problem I had was if you bare down tomuch on the brush  it messes with the spinning of the brush.  I recommend going against the spin of the brush I got good results that way with the body attachment.</li>
            <li> Love this purchase! The body brush is great for dry brushing which helps with cellulite. Very happy with this product especially for the price. I&#x27;ve paid more than $200 for sets like this so this was a total score. The facial brushes are great with cleaning out pores and helping with oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works wonderfully on my extremely dry skin. Wonderful for self tanning prep and skin renewal. Love it. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Use in shower.  Skin feels much smoother!  Dry, cracked feet looking better!</li>
            <li> Very effective. I have lots of oil spots on my skin due to improper cleaning over the years. This exfoliator makes my whole body feel nice and smooth. The only thing I wish it has is to replace all brush heads for sensitive skin. The normal brush head feels a bit harsh on my body.</li>
            <li> I have been using the brush for a couple weeks now and I LOVE IT!  This is one of my best purchases for 2014.  My face is smoother and the pumice attachment has really helped keep some areas of psoriasis from being as scaly as they normally would be.</li>
            <li> I would love to give this 5 giant stars because it was AWESOME! Unfortunately, the case that holds the batteries simply cracked (no drops/falls/etc) and now can&#x27;t hold the batteries in place and obviously is no longer water tight. I&#x27;m super bummed.</li>
            <li> My teen daughter&#x27;s skin looks great. This has helped along with her prescribed skin medication  to keep her skin looking smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used face cleansing systems before but they were never waterproof.  So when I found this one by ESS, I decided to do a little digging to see if there are others that are better.  After much research, I chose ESS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What puts ESS above the other waterproof systems I researched is the ability to easily replace the brushes at a reasonable price.  That&#x27;s the biggest expense of cleansing systems.  It&#x27;s not so much the system in itself, it&#x27;s the brushes.  Good brushes that&#x27;s easily replaceable is the key.  The ESS brushes are fantastic.  My favorite is the body brush, it sounds kind of extreme to have such a large brush but it&#x27;s fantastic!  I use it primarily on my knees, elbows, and foot.  The roughest spots on my body have never felt so soft.  Also I was doubtful it was strong enough to clear away spots on my skin that are prone to ingrown hair ... but it does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pumice stone head is also great.  Now the other two are tougher to tell apart since they look identical at first.  But I&#x27;ve been using the softer one with more bristles as my face cleanser brush in the shower.  It&#x27;s gentle enough for face and neck and it really helps the expensive face washes I use to get deeper into the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other one that has less bristles is the exfoliation brush.  I have yet to use it.  But I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just a matter of time before I get to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ESS system also spins, not like some others that just vibrates.  This system is a spinning system, waterproof, with easily replaceable brushes.  The handle and weight of the brush system is also just right.  Not too heavy, not to light, with an easy grip to hold without it slipping away in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original system is very affordable and the customer service is always there to support you.  What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed significant improvement in my skin. I feel as though my wrinkles are less prominent when I used this device.</li>
            <li> I got this during a $1 promotion.  It&#x27;s FANTASTIC!  Now that I&#x27;ve tried it, for an unbelievable price, I will be purchasing another at full price as a gift.  Worth it!</li>
            <li> For a Long time I am searching for a good and easy to pocket Exfoliation brush, and today my search has stopped.&lt;br /&gt;This one is great and having tremendous qualities. I am very happy to get this one.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing system. After just the first use, your skin feels softer, &amp; more &amp;#34;awake&amp;#34;. I felt so great when I stepped out of the shower! The sensitive skin brush is wonderful around your eye area. The body brush is the perfect size, &amp; the pumice stone is a wonderful add on! I had trouble opening the battery compartment at first, like a lot of others, but once you figure out where to squeeze you&#x27;ll be fine. You want to push in the sides of the piece that you&#x27;re removing while pushing the part that says &amp;#34;open&amp;#34; away from the unit. I started pressing the sides of the unit at first, so I could see where that bit of instructions in the manual can get confusing. It&#x27;s definitely waterproof (I accidentally dropped in in the bathtub)&lt;br /&gt;I found that my lotions and face creams seemed to feel better on my skin after using, &amp; the skin stayed hydrated for a longer period of time. I&#x27;m so glad I bought this!</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and is easy to use. It doesn&#x27;t scrub so hard as to irrate sensitive skin but does a great job in cleaning</li>
            <li> First of all, the delivery was actually earlier than what was estimated, which was a wonderful surprise. I also received an email from the seller with information about the product&#x27;s use and an invitation to contact her with any questions I might have. Fabulous service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself, I purchased it for my guy. After he used it the first time, he told me it was too good to keep to himself, so we&#x27;re sharing it now! He uses only the face brush, but I use the face brush, body brush, and pumice. (Okay, in reality I was secretly planning on hijacking the brushing system from the time I placed the order...so sue me.) After using the body brush in the shower, I follow up with moisturizer and my skin feels so silky! My face is smoother, and makeup goes on better. I&#x27;m very happy with &amp;#34;our&amp;#34; Perfect Skin Brushing System!</li>
            <li> Good product. Only wish it had an electric charger.  The batteries can get expensive.</li>
            <li> I like how it has full circle motion. Would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Best seller and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I bought this set a few months ago.  I wanted to us it long enough to be able to give a accurate review.  I love this brush set and I&#x27;m so happy I bought it.  The price is set is very affordable.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed that you didn&#x27;t spend in the upper hundreds for it.  The quality is amazing.  I love the design and the handy box it came in.  Don&#x27;t second guess yourself,  just buy one.</li>
            <li> This is what I wanted,  and I love it. It makes my skin very soft and clean. I will tell other people about it.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Great price.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this skin cleaning unit. I have had the more expensive one (starting with the letter C). This one works just like the other one.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it is presented in a nice box to be able to storte everything. I love that I don&#x27;t have to leave it plugged in to a charging unit and use electricity. This is so portable and easy to travel with. I love all the attachments for body, face and feet. I have used the brushes on my face and was very pleased with the results and love being able to use the bigger brush on my body. All in all I am very pleased with my purchas and the great price.</li>
            <li> I love it. The body scrub is by far the best one, never knew how much dirt you have until you scrub with that . The little pumice rock doesn&#x27;t really work that we&#x27;ll though but the other ones make up for it. I use the regular face brush and I love the way my skin looks after. Just so fresh.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Cute set, good product, with a lot of good instruction in it. I&#x27;ve used it a lot and I enjoy it. I only wish the spinning head were stronger. In the shower when I go to use the body brush and I put just a little pressure on my skin it slows down and sometimes stops completely, despite how new or old the batteries are.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price!</li>
            <li> You can feel and see the difference; within a few days my pores were tightened and skin felt a bit smoother. Works much better than just using your hands to wash your face. I purchased rechargeable batteries to cut the cost of replacing batteries in the future since this uses 4AA batteries. One suggestion however for the sellers, would be to attach a band to the handle so it can be hung up, or have a stand for it to be placed comfortably after use. Otherwise, great product! Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Just started using it and I can tell a difference in my skin already. My face feels so fresh after and its really easy to use. Great product!</li>
            <li> The on and off button is hard to push. It does cleanse the face gently.</li>
            <li> Amazing, very happy, my skin very soft!!!!</li>
            <li> Of this &amp;#34;type&amp;#34;, this is my 3rd or 4th one because they all keep breaking, however out of the box this one&#x27;s quality was evident and considering all the others only use two batteries and issues as for I&#x27;m hopeful that this will have more durability,  but,  hands down,  the brushes and everything else I go,  a genuine value purchase&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;06 2016 ID</li>
            <li> I have it in my shower and love it. My skin feels much better now. I use it with a body scrub, the dead skin is just disappearing.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome</li>
            <li> I have used both face brushes for about a week and am pleased with the results. My face feels smooth and not dried out. I am 62 and have always had enlarged pores and combination skin. The company seems genuinely interested in client satisfaction and feedback.  Highly recommend. Great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Just received it after 1 day! I was given a cheap one for Christmas that I really liked before it broke. Saw this one and decided to splurge. I am glad I did. My mom got one of the really expensive one&#x27;s but as I opened it up, this one looked and felt just as good. It wasn&#x27;t heavy but it didn&#x27;t have that flimsy plastic feel, either. I had just enough time to try the facial brushes. I used the big one on my neck and shoulders. It was like a rapid fire loofah! Couldn&#x27;t believe how much &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; it did, lol. I was annoyed and secretly happy that I had to work a double shift. I got home and was in the tub in less than 5 minutes. I used the body brush first on my feet and than switched to the pumice stone. My feet haven&#x27;t felt this relaxed since my last vacation! I realized there was a 2nd face brush and tried it. It was definitely softer than the other one. I think I would use this one daily and the small one after a really hard day. All in all, super happy with my purchase. Buying a couple more for gifts throughout the year instead of the $90 ones.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be stronger spin... when I put the big body brush head on, it really slows down.</li>
            <li> Works well. Good quality product and could see a difference after one day of use</li>
            <li> This was the best priced of all the similar items on Amazon, and I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been surviving for so long without it!! I will be using this face and body brush system forever. My skin already looks better after just two weeks of use. I&#x27;d recommend this product to everyone (and I have!)</li>
            <li> Pretty cool. I wish it had more speeds and it would be nice if the brushes were labeled.</li>
            <li> Was looking for something to clean the whole body and this is it. Seems to be of the same high quality as the fancy name brand face cleaner only I bought in the store and is an excellent replacement. Takes me longer than normal to shower with it but the results were well worth it. Skin felt so much smoother after using.</li>
            <li> First one didn&#x27;t work, but Amazon sent out a replacement very quickly.  They also covered the cost of shipping back the non-functioning unit.  Have used this twice now on my face and daily for an all over scrub.  I am quite pleased overall. :)</li>
            <li> overall, I like the product. the only downside is it seems the brush could be somewhat stronger, but it seems to get the job done just fine</li>
            <li> I love this system. It gives just enough pull on my skin. I feel it working. My face feels rejuvenated afterwards. I tried using the face brush with my exfoliating scrub. I found it to be more effective manually than with this system when using products with a grainy, drier consistency.</li>
            <li> Loving this product already!!! Its so easy to use and very great for the price. I just recieved it and loving it!!</li>
            <li> I seen a lot of improvement in the quality of my skin from use of this machine in the past few weeks.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this but it works really well. Great exfoliator, easy to use,  and really awesome price.</li>
            <li> As far as a $25 rotary brush goes, this one is pretty great. I&#x27;ve used the clarisonic brush and this does just as good of a job. It arrived in perfect working order and with all shown pieces. The speed of the brush is nice and the various attachments for the face an body work well. For all the people saying they broke out after using it, that&#x27;s a normal occurrence (esthetician here) after using an exfoliating product/tool like this. In fact as long as it&#x27;s not a rash type breakout, it&#x27;s a good thing (even though we all hate it). That just means all the gunk that was trapped was given a way up and out of your face. Just like I tell my clients, do a precleanse with your hands to remove makeup and loose debris then use the brush for a deep cleanse/exfoliation. You don&#x27;t need to add any pressure when using it either. Let the brush do the work for you!! Very important to make sure you&#x27;re cleaning the brushes after every use to prevent acne causing bacteria from building up.</li>
            <li> I just recently threw away a motorized brush system from a DIFFERENT MANUFACTURER that was horrible and a waste of money because the motor was way too weak, actually it did not work at all once it touched the skin.  I threw it in the trash because I didn&#x27;t even want anyone else to have something so horrible.  So, I was apprehensive when I purchased this system; but the reviews looked promising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first reaction when I put the batteries into the Essential Skin Solutions brush system ... I thought &amp;#34;Oh No, once again, the motor is going to be weak (because it sounded like the previous one.&amp;#34;  Anyway, I was INCORRECT … The motor did a fabulous job rotating using the brush on my whole body.  I told myself that I was going to use each piece in the system several times before I even wrote a review … to which I did except for the brush for sensitive facial skin … I did not use it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I was very pleasantly surprised.  I really, really love the body brush and regular facial brush.  Totally awesome.  However, I only gave the system 4 stars as opposed to 5 stars for two reasons … first, I was a little disappointed with the pumice stone.  My regular stone that doesn&#x27;t rotate works much better.  My guess is it is the stone itself that just doesn&#x27;t seem to do a very good job.  But I could be incorrect.  All I know is that it did not do much to my feet at all.  Secondly, when you purchase this brush system, the company wants you to register the warranty at their website and they will give you a coupon and some more information.  I tried to do this three times and I kept getting directed to PAGE NOT FOUND on their website.  Hopefully, they will take care of this.</li>
            <li> This is the best!&lt;br /&gt;i love this so much!&lt;br /&gt;Totally happy!&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this to anybody and everybody..&lt;br /&gt;Thank you !</li>
            <li> It works very well for me. Happy how easy it is to used. Love the different brushes for the body it comes with.</li>
            <li> Winter really does a number on my face, leaving it dry and flaky, and even at middle age, I sometimes have breakouts and red patches.  I&#x27;ve always wanted a good skin brush, and this was promising.  The kit comes in an elegant box that looks very attractive on the bathroom counter.  Upon first use, the only thing I added to the brush (besides batteries) was warm water, as soap dries out my skin.  The soft brush feels luxurious, the spin isn&#x27;t so fast that one can&#x27;t control it, and it really does a fine job exfoliating my skin.  I was surprised to find that, the morning after I first used the brush, my skin felt softer than usual and slightly dewy!  Needless to say, I am very happy with the facial brush, and I have no doubt the other brushes and the pumice stone will make me equally happy.  I&#x27;m only sorry I never had one of these sets when I was a teenager!</li>
            <li> Love it. My adult acne is clearing up after a month of use.</li>
            <li> Great product! I like that it has multiple attachments for your different needs. I do wish it had more than one speed option, but otherwise i love it!</li>
            <li> This really is a great face and body brush.  It takes all the dirt and oils off of your face and leaves your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> 😍 This product is AMAZING! Not only is the face scrub brush incredible,  the body brush is heaven!</li>
            <li> Junk.  Cheap garbage.  Next to zero power.</li>
            <li> I love my Perfect skin Brushing System.  My old one was not able to be used wet or dry.... This product can be used wet or dry..... I wish I would have botught this from Amazon months ago.  HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY!</li>
            <li> I am not sure what I think about this product. I am excited to see what the results will be but the product overall feels very cheap. The item it&#x27;s self is a cheap plastic, with an odd feeling grip. The power seems also weak, not like slow but like it&#x27;s about to die (brand new batteries). The brushes have an odd smell to them. I&#x27;m a little disappointed with the quality of the product. However I did pay 25 dollars for it, so Ill give it a shot and update my review when I actually use the product. Though I do find is a little amusing that the box the items came in feels of better quality than the actual product.</li>
            <li> I love this system. After the first time you use it your skin feels so smooth! I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now and can feel and see the difference. I also used the body brush in the shower and it&#x27;s great for before self tanning! The seller is also great.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Works like a charm and I will be purchasing for my mother.</li>
            <li> The system is nice and at a good price.</li>
            <li> Works well, but the battery operated system is not powerful, quality is adequate for the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  It arrived quickly and I was impressed with the heavy duty packaging.  Works very well. I did an extensive search and this one had the best reviews.  I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Was a little smaller than I expected but ........... Works GREAT!!!!</li>
            <li> This product has very little power. Is mine defective or is this how it&#x27;s supposed to be?</li>
            <li> great product.  I use it regularly now as a part of my routine</li>
            <li> Just okay. The body brush does not work. It stops spinning. The face ones instantly made my skin break out so i cleaned them with bleach and they seem to do a little better. But it just doesnt have as much power as i was hoping for. I prefer the clarsonic one.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  I have dry skin and it helps exfoliate it and I can reach those awkward spot on my back.  I like the fact that I can use it in the shower and the brushes don&#x27;t stop with the necessary pressure to get results.  The reason for four starts is the battery compartment is diffcult to open. I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter who is having a problem with acne.  It seems to be doing the job for her.  Great value for a skin care product .</li>
            <li> Love this product! Really great for the value. It makes my skin feel so clean &amp; soft. Love all the different attachments that can be used on face or body. So happy, as many products like this can really be expensive and do the same things. Great!!!</li>
            <li> I always wanted a brush system for exfoliation, anD I chose the right one. I am willing to buy it again as a gift.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks, and a notice a big improvement in my skin. My skin is more soft and it even help with even out my skin tone. If you&#x27;re thinking about buying this brush I would recommended it.</li>
            <li> Not bad.  Bristles are a little rough on my face, but it works</li>
            <li> This brush is just as effective as the more expensive brushes you can purchase, and I love the variety of attachments (as well as the stellar customer service!)</li>
            <li> Feels prickly and rough on my skin and I am afraid the brush could be  damaging to the skin because of how it feels. I don&#x27;t know if a brush is supposed to be like that?</li>
            <li> this is so nice.battery operated is so great. soft and effective.</li>
            <li> While this is the only skin polishing brush I&#x27;ve ever tried, and it&#x27;s only the 3rd day I&#x27;ve tried it, my review is...not worth much weight. I did notice, from that very first use, that my skin seemed stimulated. I had more color to my completion (glowing?!).  Not splotchy or irritated, and some of those uneven areas seemed less obvious.  I just turned 39 last week and I have been using good skincare systems for about the last 10 years. This brush did make my face so very smooth - yet not tight feeling. I&#x27;m curious to see how the &amp;#34;unclogging&amp;#34; breakout time goes (I hear it starts about one week into use). I&#x27;ve been using the sensitive skin brush on my face once daily. I used the body brush and the pumice stone attachment for the first time yesterday. The body brush is nice, if not time consuming, and the pumice stone is pretty awesome!  The unit was tough to open, but my 9 and 10 yr olds worked together and got it loaded with batteries, no problem. The unit is very quiet and I was kind of worried it didn&#x27;t have enough umph, but after using it, I think if it had more umph I would complain!  Sorry for the jumbly review - and good luck!</li>
            <li> Better than my Clarasonic.I am so impressed. My face is amazingly clean every time I use it and the body brush is great.  i recieved this in exchange fo a product review</li>
            <li> This is such a great set to gift to others and even yourself! First off I love how this set is packaged and sealed keeping the set protected and clean. The brushes are soft so using them on my face and other areas of my face is perfect and does not scratch my face. The stone to scrub the dead skin off of my feet is the perfect size, helps get in to the small areas of my feet and toes. The motor is not too fast or too slow, the speed is just perfect to get the dead skin off and also exfoliate my face. The handle is wide enough to hold with easy and maneuver. This is definitely a spa in a box and I highly recommend everyone to have this set in your bathroom, great using this during your showers or long relaxing bathes.</li>
            <li> I received this cleansing brush set as a gift one Christmas and I loved it so much that I purchased it for my niece this past Christmas.  It&#x27;s a really nice cleansing brush set and I&#x27;ve had it for well over a year and I have not had any issues with it.  And, from my everyday use of the set, I have noticed a really nice difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Received today.  Very fast delivery.  I tried it out and very pleased.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I do not like the facial brushes. The regular facial brush and the sensitive facial brush feel the same. The brushes are both very soft and I can&#x27;t imagine how these will exfoliate my face. I plan to return this product promptly unless there are more firm heads available. Batteries are also not included.</li>
            <li> This is the first scrubber I ever tried and see how it would make a very very nice gift for anyone!  The quality is very good.  I was surprised I would like it as much as I did.  Definitely a great buy and not as expensive as the others.  Fits well in hand.  Just kinda hard getting off the bottom to install batteries.  Still, gets an easy 5 stars because how good it feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  5/15&lt;br /&gt;Just want to say ... I STILL LOVE IT!  Ive read a few of the questions and I have never had it stop when applying moderate pressure at all.  I used the small heavy bristle with a peach scrub and Im glowing.  So fresh and clean!  I even love the box!  Its sturdy, easy to keep everything in.  Brushes are holding up thus so far and keep there form.  This WILL make the holiday gift list for every female member.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ill do another up date in a few months, I dont think anything will change except the batteries getting recharged.  lol</li>
            <li> Really like the way this product makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> This is my first microdermabrasion kit purchase. I went off of all the positive reviews on Amazon. I love it! I come from a very humid environment and moved to a very dry climate. I have been here two years and all the moisturizing and sunscreen did nothing for me face. I&#x27;m also almost 40 and thought maybe it&#x27;s the sign of the time. I bought this with the LAVO exfoliating scrub and afterwards my face felt as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt, shiny, and the fine lines gone. I don&#x27;t feel that the brush is doing damage it is soft enough to do a deep cleanse with my regular facial cleanser. You can use it in the shower! I have a problem with black heads in my upper back and an occasional break out. Use this with PanOxyl in the shower and it has helped to clear that up. I have not yet tried the foot stone but that is next on my list. Happy exfoliating!!</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift and I Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Love it, my skin feels great.  I do it once or twice a week with</li>
