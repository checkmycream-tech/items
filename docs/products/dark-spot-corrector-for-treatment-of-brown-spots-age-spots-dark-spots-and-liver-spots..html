            <li>I received a reduced price to give my honest opinion of this product and I have to say that I really liked it.</li>
            <li>be honest</li>
            <li>great company great products highly recommend</li>
            <li>very good product you can see a difference the first time if you pair it with the mask</li>
            <li>I have now changed my routine and found one that is helping me whiten my spots (age, brown) more effectively.  </li>
            <li>Have been very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell, and is smooth, easy to apply/rub in.</li>
            <li>The product smells nice and absorbs easily into the skin as well which is a bonus.</li>
            <li>love love love Swiss Bontany products.</li>
            <li>I used this in conjunction with Olay Regenerist Serum; I have used Olay&#x27;s Serum from its inception: I love it.</li>
            <li>Yes, it requires this many products.  </li>
            <li>Love the &amp;#34;dropper&amp;#34; style application.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for more to add to my regimen.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and my face looks so much more healthier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this serum</li>
            <li>Excellent Product I would recommend it ,planning to buy more in the future</li>
            <li>I am sure I can see a reduction in freckles and sun spots already (used about 2 weeks now).&lt;br /&gt;Really pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>I love it .</li>
            <li>My skin is looking more uniform in color each day.  </li>
            <li>I love that serum.</li>
            <li>Such a great product!</li>
            <li>It smells nice and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Lovely serum, absorbs really easily.</li>
            <li>Happy so far.</li>
            <li>I am getting great results so far.</li>
            <li>Then I also use another brand&#x27;s Night Repair serum (all over face) on top, then the Swiss Botany Retinol Moisturizer (all over) 4 times a week, switching it off with another rich evening moisturizer to give my face a break from the retinol.   </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never seen such good results!</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this to use</li>
            <li>This one is too strong to her.  </li>
            <li>but once it dries it feels just fine.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it and recommend it highly to others.</li>
            <li>I am using this in combination with the Swiss Botany Vitamin C eye gel which is also a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>The spots have faded considerably and my skin is so bright.  </li>
            <li>Feels silky smooth and soaks in without tacky residue.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin pretty quickly and feels nice on.  </li>
            <li>So if your looking to brighten and even your skin tone this is one worth trying!</li>
            <li>I have some sun spots and acne scars which have lightened significantly.</li>
            <li>You will definitely not be disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li>I have used a lot of different products for skin discoloration, but this is by far the best out there.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try Sym White after reading all the good reviews.</li>
            <li>ok I have not seen major change - just OK</li>
            <li>I have only used the Symwhite Serum for about two weeks, but my skin is already looking more radiant and fresh, and my skin tone is becoming more even.</li>
            <li>Truely works.</li>
            <li>I think this product has a lot of potential, it feels good on my skin, sort of stimulating and cooling (niacin?)</li>
            <li>I can already tell a great difference in my dark spots.</li>
            <li>Happy to get rid of the dark rings under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I like it very much!</li>
            <li>it is a good product I have used it for a long time</li>
            <li>It has a nice sent, spreads on easily and it doesnâ€™t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>If you are going to buy it, check the amount of product in the bottle first!</li>
            <li>Really lightens up the skin and reduces fine lines and blemishes.</li>
            <li>WELL WORTH THE PRICE.  </li>
            <li>I rarely use my &#x27;concealer&#x27;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>and I can see a distinct difference in my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Upon first opening the bottle, you can smell a mild citrusy scent.  </li>
            <li>But it is mild, does not irritate sensitive skin, no odor, disappears on skin, easy to apply with the eyedropper.</li>
            <li>I really cannot tell if its the peel or this product that has made a significant impact on the areas of hyperpigmentation&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li>i will buy one more bottle today 1/06/2015 just to see how quickly it runs out again and see if theirs any results after my second bottle.</li>
            <li>I really noticed a difference compared to other argan oils, I liked it a lot!</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference the first time I used it right away</li>
            <li>so it wasn&#x27;t like I had a large area I was trying to cover!</li>
            <li>I applied the Olay serum first, and then treated the spots with the Swiss Botany serum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to continue using it though for the potential benefits of the Songyi mushroom extract and Niacinamide in regards to sun damage under the skin surface unless I&#x27;m 100% sure it is breaking me out</li>
            <li>Will have to use regularly for a month to see more visible results.  </li>
            <li>I intentionally only used it on one spot to make sure I could see the difference.</li>
            <li>I have been able to get away with occasionally just applying a tinted sunscreen for the day.</li>
            <li>NOT FAKE USER</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>love both the symwhite and facial mask, been weeks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for 3 weeks</li>
            <li>The serum goes on nicely and dries quickly but leaves the skin feeling a little sticky.</li>
            <li>, it is quite disheartening to read all these positive reviews?</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and had ZERO reaction to this formula.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this product is working for me because it ran out so fast.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>They also gave me a very generous coupon for inquiring about their products.  </li>
            <li>I am sure the spots will be gone way before the bottle is empty.  </li>
            <li>I really like how this helped to hydrate my skin</li>
            <li>However, I really like the hydrating effects and the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight .</li>
            <li>Unfortunatelly, on saturday my friend thought I went to the beach because she said I looked very tanned.</li>
            <li>but I did not see much difference</li>
            <li>It really works on my skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I suffer from acne and from my own experience with acne your left with the left over pigmentation.</li>
            <li>It soaks in pretty quickly and actually leaves the skin feeling rather hydrated.</li>
            <li>Along with the Niacinamide, which is one of the first ingredients listed, I was really intrigued by the rare Songyi mushroom extract also found in this product which is said to further reduce inflammation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just finished my first bottle and revived my second, and I&#x27;m more than convinced that my skins complexion will only improve.</li>
            <li>thing I need to add is make sure you let the serum dry completely before putting on makeup.</li>
            <li>but less clear kind of ,I used it for almost a month</li>
            <li>This serum works quickly when applied properly and allows for a very radiant complexion.</li>
            <li>They replied that it would work, but that they had a new product to be released very soon</li>
            <li>It faded some red spots and seems to have actually given my skin a better texture.</li>
            <li>Though not rapid, it is steadily changing.</li>
            <li>In fact, I can actually measure a bit more success with generic brands such as alpha hydroxy acid, porcelana, palmers, and etc.</li>
            <li>ive been using no significant changes but love how my faces feels..</li>
            <li>The product smells good and yes a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>So far I really like this product, I have been using it for a week in conjunction with a prescription hydroquinone/retinol skin lightener for my hyperpigmentation from acne.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait go see more results after s few weeks</li>
            <li>I am a light complexion African American if that helps.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin very soft and it&#x27;s a lot brighter.</li>
            <li>Honestly in the first 2 weeks I was skeptical since I did not see any change,I think it takes time</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for 2 weeks now, so these are early results.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to wear a lot of makeup and prefer the natural look.  </li>
            <li>So it works, and she has sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So far my skin looks radiant and fresh.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first I was using a little too much</li>
            <li>My other serum took the redness away right before my eyes and kept it away all day.</li>
            <li>I used this product for 1 week and starting seeing positive changes in my complexion, after two weeks saw even better results, and after three the results where dramatic.</li>
            <li>Check my reviews and you can see my journey to repair my skin, took 4 months for my skin to calm down an</li>
            <li>My skin look younger and clear ...</li>
            <li>Too early to tell about fading of brown spots, it&#x27;s only been 10 days.</li>
            <li>but I have noticed a diminshed tendency to produce facial freckles so far</li>
            <li>it really help to fade the dark spots .</li>
            <li>Have not used very long but seems to brighten  my face so far.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to assess the complete effect</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I rarely use my &#x27;concealer&#x27;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> and I can see a distinct difference in my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Upon first opening the bottle, you can smell a mild citrusy scent.  </li>
            <li> But it is mild, does not irritate sensitive skin, no odor, disappears on skin, easy to apply with the eyedropper.</li>
            <li> I really cannot tell if its the peel or this product that has made a significant impact on the areas of hyperpigmentation&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li> i will buy one more bottle today 1/06/2015 just to see how quickly it runs out again and see if theirs any results after my second bottle.</li>
            <li> I really noticed a difference compared to other argan oils, I liked it a lot!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference the first time I used it right away</li>
            <li> so it wasn&#x27;t like I had a large area I was trying to cover!</li>
            <li> I applied the Olay serum first, and then treated the spots with the Swiss Botany serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to continue using it though for the potential benefits of the Songyi mushroom extract and Niacinamide in regards to sun damage under the skin surface unless I&#x27;m 100% sure it is breaking me out</li>
            <li> Will have to use regularly for a month to see more visible results.  </li>
            <li> I intentionally only used it on one spot to make sure I could see the difference.</li>
            <li> I have been able to get away with occasionally just applying a tinted sunscreen for the day.</li>
            <li> NOT FAKE USER</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> love both the symwhite and facial mask, been weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for 3 weeks</li>
            <li> The serum goes on nicely and dries quickly but leaves the skin feeling a little sticky.</li>
            <li> , it is quite disheartening to read all these positive reviews?</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and had ZERO reaction to this formula.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product is working for me because it ran out so fast.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> They also gave me a very generous coupon for inquiring about their products.  </li>
            <li> I am sure the spots will be gone way before the bottle is empty.  </li>
            <li> I really like how this helped to hydrate my skin</li>
            <li> However, I really like the hydrating effects and the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight .</li>
            <li> Unfortunatelly, on saturday my friend thought I went to the beach because she said I looked very tanned.</li>
            <li> but I did not see much difference</li>
            <li> It really works on my skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I suffer from acne and from my own experience with acne your left with the left over pigmentation.</li>
            <li> It soaks in pretty quickly and actually leaves the skin feeling rather hydrated.</li>
            <li> Along with the Niacinamide, which is one of the first ingredients listed, I was really intrigued by the rare Songyi mushroom extract also found in this product which is said to further reduce inflammation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just finished my first bottle and revived my second, and I&#x27;m more than convinced that my skins complexion will only improve.</li>
            <li> thing I need to add is make sure you let the serum dry completely before putting on makeup.</li>
            <li> but less clear kind of ,I used it for almost a month</li>
            <li> This serum works quickly when applied properly and allows for a very radiant complexion.</li>
            <li> They replied that it would work, but that they had a new product to be released very soon</li>
            <li> It faded some red spots and seems to have actually given my skin a better texture.</li>
            <li> Though not rapid, it is steadily changing.</li>
            <li> In fact, I can actually measure a bit more success with generic brands such as alpha hydroxy acid, porcelana, palmers, and etc.</li>
            <li> ive been using no significant changes but love how my faces feels..</li>
            <li> The product smells good and yes a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this product, I have been using it for a week in conjunction with a prescription hydroquinone/retinol skin lightener for my hyperpigmentation from acne.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait go see more results after s few weeks</li>
            <li> I am a light complexion African American if that helps.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin very soft and it&#x27;s a lot brighter.</li>
            <li> Honestly in the first 2 weeks I was skeptical since I did not see any change,I think it takes time</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 weeks now, so these are early results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to wear a lot of makeup and prefer the natural look.  </li>
            <li> So it works, and she has sensitive skin</li>
            <li> So far my skin looks radiant and fresh.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first I was using a little too much</li>
            <li> My other serum took the redness away right before my eyes and kept it away all day.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 1 week and starting seeing positive changes in my complexion, after two weeks saw even better results, and after three the results where dramatic.</li>
            <li> Check my reviews and you can see my journey to repair my skin, took 4 months for my skin to calm down an</li>
            <li> My skin look younger and clear ...</li>
            <li> Too early to tell about fading of brown spots, it&#x27;s only been 10 days.</li>
            <li> but I have noticed a diminshed tendency to produce facial freckles so far</li>
            <li> it really help to fade the dark spots .</li>
            <li> Have not used very long but seems to brighten  my face so far.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to assess the complete effect</li>
            <li> The dark spots have lightened considerably!  </li>
            <li> I am a sun lover and have developed some dark spots.  </li>
            <li> No apparent reaction to my skin which is a blessing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing my spots lightened to the point where I only need Foundation, and I use a matching loose powder on the spots to &#x27;set&#x27; my foundation.  </li>
            <li> Only takes a little bit of product and is really simple to use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two weeks now, however, not consistently yet I notice such a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> The scars on one side of my face are almost gone, and the scars that were a little darker haven&#x27;t faded in these days (not that I expect them to in such a short time period)</li>
            <li> It has cleared up my dark spots and had given my face an overall brighter appearance.</li>
            <li> it is not what expected but at least it has some positive effect, my dark spot are still there</li>
            <li> It is all natural and appears to fade my trouble areas (dark spots), I will definitively keep on using and re-order.</li>
            <li> I saw absolutely no change in the dark spots on the back of my hand or face.  </li>
            <li> I really can not say this one by Swiss Botany has done much of anything visible over the month and a half I&#x27;ve been using it which has been disappointing.</li>
            <li> I found that if I just tap on a little bit and pat it without actually rubbing it in, it wldnt mix with face cream and stay where I put it.</li>
            <li> I applied the serum 2 times per day as directed until the bottle was empty, which lasted 2 months.</li>
            <li> I used the product twice a day per the instructions until the bottle was empty.  </li>
            <li> I mean I&#x27;ve used so many expensive creams, serums, and masks for lightening hyperpigmentation</li>
            <li> I was disappointed, especially after the cost and strong claims of this product.</li>
            <li> and I think it is enhancing the work of the other product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get a chance to see if the product worked because after a week of using it, I realized that my bottle was half empty</li>
            <li> I know it may seem a little pricy for a 1oz bottle, but a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;whitening cream serum&amp;#34; had no effect on diminishing and/or removing my dark spots.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it has done absolutely  nothing for my face.</li>
            <li> After 2 months of continuous use I saw no changes in my dark spots or \\&quot;luminosity\\&quot; of my skin.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this has started to lighten some of the dark circles on my face.</li>
            <li> A couple of weeks ago I had emailed Swiss Botany about another product for fading dark spots.  </li>
            <li> and I can see my dark spots are getting lighter.</li>
            <li> I have even cut down on the amount of makeup I use.</li>
            <li> Just a slight difference in lightness after one week of use.  </li>
            <li> They still exist, but are MUCH less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Just started using this and afternoons week I have noticed a little bit of my dark spot is slightly lighter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a week</li>
            <li> Goodbye dark spots!</li>
            <li> used it for my body and got a few shades lighter.</li>
            <li> But when she used it everyday, she got breakout.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I will admit that it is a little hard to rub in when used in conjunction with other face creams</li>
            <li> serum itself looks typical of Niacinamide serums in that it&#x27;s a milky, thick almost Elmer&#x27;s glue consistency that liquefies immediately when tapped onto the skin.</li>
            <li> I am not pleased with the results, and have to wonder what all these stars are about.</li>
            <li> although, when I did get lazy and forget to put stuff on at night, or if I forget to use my SPF in the day time, the spots do darken again...   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a day for the past couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> but it was very harsh on my face.  </li>
            <li> I wash my face then use their Micropolish every day, the mask at least 2 â€“ 3 times a week,</li>
            <li> Slowly seeing a difference.</li>
            <li> , in fact I feel it sets on top of your skin and does not even soak in, very disappointed on the $35 spent. :(</li>
            <li> The scent is a faint green lime.</li>
            <li> also the symwhite came broken and all i did is email the company and was shipped out another one immediately..</li>
            <li> My facialist used to tell me this...but being young then, I  thought she was insane or too finicky.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> Sorry.....</li>
            <li> And yes I&#x27;m sorry too.....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think ill be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I said to her to use it three times per week, apply a very thin layer and don&#x27;t rub on the skin to see if it works.  </li>
            <li> AWFUL!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Too early to tell about fading of brown spots, it&#x27;s only been 10 days. But it is mild, does not irritate sensitive skin, no odor, disappears on skin, easy to apply with the eyedropper.</li>
            <li> love love love Swiss Bontany products. Always delivers and I will be saying ta ta to those age spots on my hands</li>
            <li> Wow. I have to admit, it is quite disheartening to read all these positive reviews? This &amp;#34;whitening cream serum&amp;#34; had no effect on diminishing and/or removing my dark spots. In fact, I can actually measure a bit more success with generic brands such as alpha hydroxy acid, porcelana, palmers, and etc. on &amp;#34;fading of spots.&amp;#34; In hindsight, I only wish I could get my $ back.  Note: I used this in conjunction with Olay Regenerist Serum; I have used Olay&#x27;s Serum from its inception: I love it. I applied the Olay serum first, and then treated the spots with the Swiss Botany serum. I am not pleased with the results, and have to wonder what all these stars are about. Just being honest...</li>
            <li> very good product you can see a difference the first time if you pair it with the mask I noticed a difference the first time I used it right away</li>
            <li> This white creamy serum i have used for about two weeks now, and my skin is definitely brighter just by naked eye. My pimple scars are fading away a bit too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a week and it&#x27;s been great.  Upon first opening the bottle, you can smell a mild citrusy scent.  The product itself has a pearl-like color and sheen to it as you squeeze a drop out.  It absorbs into the skin pretty quickly and feels nice on.  It faded some red spots and seems to have actually given my skin a better texture. I tend to use it along with Swiss botany&#x27;s Apple stem cell serum. Great product!</li>
            <li> THIS WAS A GREAT ITEM!!  IT IS WELL WORTH THE PRICE.  I WILL DEFINETLY BUY IT AGAIN!!  MY SKIN HAS NEVER LOOKED BETTER!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to lighten freckles and it seems to be doing a great job after about 3 weeks of use. Very nice to see a cosmetic product that delivers!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product is working for me because it ran out so fast. Didn&#x27;t even use a lot i used a  pea size drop a day and about a week this product was gone. its really a low amount they give you i don&#x27;t know if i should continue on discontinue i will buy one more bottle today 1/06/2015 just to see how quickly it runs out again and see if theirs any results after my second bottle. if not i would rewrite on this posting stating my end results after using my next bottle.</li>
            <li> this product is really good for my skin ..... My skin look younger and clear ... I strongly recommend this to use</li>
            <li> A great product, good for chapped hands.</li>
            <li> I have now changed my routine and found one that is helping me whiten my spots (age, brown) more effectively.  I use the Swiss Botany Whitening Mask (all over face) twice a week, and I use this Whitening Serum (only on the spots) 4x a week at night.   Then I also use another brand&#x27;s Night Repair serum (all over face) on top, then the Swiss Botany Retinol Moisturizer (all over) 4 times a week, switching it off with another rich evening moisturizer to give my face a break from the retinol.   Yes, it requires this many products.  My facialist used to tell me this...but being young then, I  thought she was insane or too finicky.  Now, I understand ...sigh....   This combination works for me.  I&#x27;m seeing my spots lightened to the point where I only need Foundation, and I use a matching loose powder on the spots to &#x27;set&#x27; my foundation.  I rarely use my &#x27;concealer&#x27; although, when I did get lazy and forget to put stuff on at night, or if I forget to use my SPF in the day time, the spots do darken again...   All in all,  my routine is working for me,  It took me a while to figure out what it takes.  Good luck to everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a day for the past couple of weeks. I can already tell a great difference in my dark spots. The product smells good and absorbs well. Only takes a little bit of product and is really simple to use. Love the &amp;#34;dropper&amp;#34; style application. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have only used the Symwhite Serum for about two weeks, but my skin is already looking more radiant and fresh, and my skin tone is becoming more even. The product smells nice and absorbs easily into the skin as well which is a bonus.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to assess the complete effect but I have noticed a diminshed tendency to produce facial freckles so far and this is one of the ways it works.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 weeks now, so these are early results. I put it on once a day in the morning, just along my jawline where I have age spots. It is definitely lightening them. It smells nice and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> The product smells good and yes a little goes a long way. Unfortunately, it has done absolutely  nothing for my face. I&#x27;m sorry but I do consider this a waste.of money and I will definitely  be returning  it. Sorry.....And yes I&#x27;m sorry too.....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to wear a lot of makeup and prefer the natural look.  Recently, I had a breakout that left  noticeable marks. I bought this based on reviews. Very pleased!! I use this at night along with my prescription Retin-A.  I did have a prescription hydroquinone but it was very harsh on my face.  Just to mention, I only used the hydroquinone if I had a mark. I will treat the Symwhite Serum the same. I&#x27;ve been using this for close to 3 weeks. Also, I make sure I use a good sunscreen during the day.</li>
            <li> After having amazing redness reducing results with another 3.5% Niacinamide/Retional based serum I purchased on here I&#x27;ve been looking for more to add to my regimen. Especially one without the Retional as that has a tendency to sting. That&#x27;s when I stumbled on this serum by Swiss Botany. Along with the Niacinamide, which is one of the first ingredients listed, I was really intrigued by the rare Songyi mushroom extract also found in this product which is said to further reduce inflammation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum itself looks typical of Niacinamide serums in that it&#x27;s a milky, thick almost Elmer&#x27;s glue consistency that liquefies immediately when tapped onto the skin. It soaks in pretty quickly and actually leaves the skin feeling rather hydrated. The scent is a faint green lime. One thing that I immediately noticed is it did nothing to visibly change my skin. My other serum took the redness away right before my eyes and kept it away all day. I really can not say this one by Swiss Botany has done much of anything visible over the month and a half I&#x27;ve been using it which has been disappointing. I&#x27;m going to continue using it though for the potential benefits of the Songyi mushroom extract and Niacinamide in regards to sun damage under the skin surface unless I&#x27;m 100% sure it is breaking me out (I have a feeling it is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided at a discount in exchange for an unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! Works great!</li>
            <li> I used this product for 1 week and starting seeing positive changes in my complexion, after two weeks saw even better results, and after three the results where dramatic. I suffer from acne and from my own experience with acne your left with the left over pigmentation.Honestly with all the products I&#x27;ve tried to help with my issue none have helped me like this product has. I just finished my first bottle and revived my second, and I&#x27;m more than convinced that my skins complexion will only improve.So if your looking to brighten and even your skin tone this is one worth trying!</li>
            <li> Have not used very long but seems to brighten  my face so far.</li>
            <li> My wife is using it for her skin on arms and neck. We are still observing the result. I&#x27;ll be Back for further review</li>
            <li> Feels silky after application.  Just a slight difference in lightness after one week of use.  Will have to use regularly for a month to see more visible results.  Good for use under makeup.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely a keeper. I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and my face looks so much more healthier. I have some sun spots and acne scars which have lightened significantly. I am using this in combination with the Swiss Botany Vitamin C eye gel which is also a fantastic product. I have even cut down on the amount of makeup I use. I don&#x27;t use foundation like I used to and now am just using a tinted moisturizer with a bit of concealer. I will continue to purchase this and hope that it is not discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I need to add is make sure you let the serum dry completely before putting on makeup. It does feel a bit sticky going on but once it dries it feels just fine.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter.  She said she loves it.  she said it has lighted the area by her chin.  So it works, and she has sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t bother her.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working as advertised</li>
            <li> Slowly seeing a difference. Happy so far. Surprising thing was my husband wanted to try it also. I can see a difference in him also.</li>
            <li> Work great good product</li>
            <li> I received a reduced price to give my honest opinion of this product and I have to say that I really liked it. I intentionally only used it on one spot to make sure I could see the difference. I will admit that it is a little hard to rub in when used in conjunction with other face creams but it definitely worked. I found that if I just tap on a little bit and pat it without actually rubbing it in, it wldnt mix with face cream and stay where I put it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this serum</li>
            <li> Used it for over a month now and have noticed a big difference&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> Excellent Product I would recommend it ,planning to buy more in the future</li>
            <li> I ordered the whitening face mask from this company a week or so ago, and I LOVE it! I thought I would give this stuff a try to maximize my results. It has a pleasant smell, and is smooth, easy to apply/rub in. Goodbye dark spots!</li>
            <li> Honestly in the first 2 weeks I was skeptical since I did not see any change,I think it takes time it is not what expected but at least it has some positive effect, my dark spot are still there but less clear kind of ,I used it for almost a month now I hope my skin will get even better.&lt;br /&gt;Gool Luck guys.</li>
            <li> Me personally,  has used all of it and has not notice any changes in my skin complexion and has had a breakout or two. I don&#x27;t think ill be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Happy to get rid of the dark rings under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try Sym White after reading all the good reviews. I applied the serum 2 times per day as directed until the bottle was empty, which lasted 2 months. The serum goes on nicely and dries quickly but leaves the skin feeling a little sticky. After 2 months of continuous use I saw no changes in my dark spots or \\&quot;luminosity\\&quot; of my skin. I was disappointed, especially after the cost and strong claims of this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taken time to notice a difference, but after a couple of months of using this product my sun spots have definitely lightened. They still exist, but are MUCH less noticeable. I have been able to get away with occasionally just applying a tinted sunscreen for the day.</li>
            <li> Truely works. used it for my body and got a few shades lighter. NOT FAKE USER</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift to my sister-in-law. She has just told me that her skin looked brighter the next day. But when she used it everyday, she got breakout.  So, she stopped using it.  Therefore, I said to her to use it three times per week, apply a very thin layer and don&#x27;t rub on the skin to see if it works.  I hope it works for her.  If it does not, please suggest a lighter product. This one is too strong to her.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Lovely serum, absorbs really easily. I am sure I can see a reduction in freckles and sun spots already (used about 2 weeks now).&lt;br /&gt;Really pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This whitening cream serum by Swiss Botany is excellent! This serum works quickly when applied properly and allows for a very radiant complexion. It has cleared up my dark spots and had given my face an overall brighter appearance.</li>
            <li> This is rubbish didn&#x27;t do a thing to me.&lt;br /&gt;It does not work . It also make my skin ruff</li>
            <li> I have to say that this has started to lighten some of the dark circles on my face.</li>
            <li> this product is perfect for my face.  i have used serveral products to  maintain my  skin  color with no luck&lt;br /&gt;until i stumbled on this product on Amazon. i love it</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for over a month and I love it! It is all natural and appears to fade my trouble areas (dark spots), I will definitively keep on using and re-order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my sun spots and they appear to be fading</li>
            <li> I waited to write my review of this product.  This is a process ~ not an overnight miracle.  I am a sun lover and have developed some dark spots.  I&#x27;ve gotten smarter with the use of my sunscreen and Swiss Botany is taking care of the damage already done.  I like it very much!</li>
            <li> A couple of weeks ago I had emailed Swiss Botany about another product for fading dark spots.  They replied that it would work, but that they had a new product to be released very soon and they thought I should give it a try.  About a week later, they sent me an email telling me that it had been released for sale and I could buy it on Amazon.  They also gave me a very generous coupon for inquiring about their products.  I received this product in the mail last Friday and I cannot believe the results after only a week.  I have used a lot of different products for skin discoloration, but this is by far the best out there.  The spots have faded considerably and my skin is so bright.  By the way, I am using it on my chest area.  I know it may seem a little pricy for a 1oz bottle, but a little goes a long way.  I am sure the spots will be gone way before the bottle is empty.  You will definitely not be disappointed in this product.  Hats off to you Swiss Botany for another great beauty product!!</li>
            <li> Really lightens up the skin and reduces fine lines and blemishes. Love this product</li>
            <li> I really noticed a difference compared to other argan oils, I liked it a lot!</li>
            <li> I have using the Whitening Cream Serum Symwhite since the ending of July 2015. At first I was using a little too much so I only have about a quarter of a bottle left but I already bought another bottle so I donâ€™t run out. It has a nice sent, spreads on easily and it doesnâ€™t dry out my skin. My face has become lighter (I am working on my hyperpigmentation).&lt;br /&gt;I am trying to create a regimen with the Swiss Botany products, they are not the cheapest but they seem to work for me. I wash my face then use their Micropolish every day, the mask at least 2 â€“ 3 times a week, and then I put on their eye serum and the Symwhite. I am also using their moisturizer twice a day. I am getting great results so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks now, after a Jessner Peel treatment. I really like how this helped to hydrate my skin&lt;br /&gt;post peel. I use this as a stand-alone with sunscreen. So far my skin looks radiant and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;To be honest I really cannot tell if its the peel or this product that has made a significant impact on the areas of hyperpigmentation&lt;br /&gt;on my face. However, I really like the hydrating effects and the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and had ZERO reaction to this formula. Feels silky smooth and soaks in without tacky residue. My skin tone is evening out. Though not rapid, it is steadily changing. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> ok I have not seen major change - just OK</li>
            <li> it really help to fade the dark spots .</li>
            <li> This is a great product . I have been using this for about two weeks and I am noticing a great improvement on the darker spots on my face. Very lightweight . I love it . Try the Argan oil too it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. My Wife bought it and after seeing it work I am using it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell : Get it. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get a chance to see if the product worked because after a week of using it, I realized that my bottle was half empty and I had run out!!!!!!!!!! I only used the product on a portion of my arm that had a discoloration so it wasn&#x27;t like I had a large area I was trying to cover! If you are going to buy it, check the amount of product in the bottle first!</li>
            <li> Just started using this and afternoons week I have noticed a little bit of my dark spot is slightly lighter. Can&#x27;t wait go see more results after s few weeks</li>
            <li> Start using about 2 weeks and i can see some sport fading already</li>
            <li> I diligently applied this three times a day for two months, the bottle is almost finished. Unfortunatelly, on saturday my friend thought I went to the beach because she said I looked very tanned.</li>
            <li> This product has faded my acne scars.  My skin is looking more uniform in color each day.  It is not greasy nor has it caused an acne break out.  Great product for my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Have been very happy with it so far. No apparent reaction to my skin which is a blessing. I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this for my pigmentation but I did not see much difference but your skin feels softer that is plus I can say. May be it may have worked for others but for me it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I like it. ive been told my skin looks smoother.</li>
            <li> it is a good product I have used it for a long time and I can see my dark spots are getting lighter.</li>
            <li> love both the symwhite and facial mask, been weeks ive been using no significant changes but love how my faces feels.. also the symwhite came broken and all i did is email the company and was shipped out another one immediately.. great company great products highly recommend</li>
            <li> The product is good and i love it! Yet delivery is bit delayed.</li>
            <li> AWFUL! This stuff didn&#x27;t do anything! I am returning this ASAP!</li>
            <li> I love that serum. It really works on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for 3 weeks and I don&#x27;t see any improvement at all, in fact I feel it sets on top of your skin and does not even soak in, very disappointed on the $35 spent. :(</li>
            <li> Great Product!!!  I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and I can see a distinct difference in my skin tone.  The dark spots have lightened considerably!  My skin looks years younger.  I am very pleased with it and recommend it highly to others.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this product, I have been using it for a week in conjunction with a prescription hydroquinone/retinol skin lightener for my hyperpigmentation from acne. I think this product has a lot of potential, it feels good on my skin, sort of stimulating and cooling (niacin?) and I think it is enhancing the work of the other product. It does not irritate my skin even though I am using a retinol product daily. I get sort of rosy glow after using it, the finish on my skin is shiny, not matte so bear that in mind if you want to go out with it on. I am a light complexion African American if that helps. For hyperpigmentation from acne I would also recommend the Diva Stuff Acne Scar Cream, I have had good results with that too, and it leaves a matte finish. They work in different ways so I use both of them. Check my reviews and you can see my journey to repair my skin, took 4 months for my skin to calm down an I am grateful it finally has, now its time to strengthen, repair and brighten!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two weeks now, however, not consistently yet I notice such a difference in my skin. It makes my skin very soft and it&#x27;s a lot brighter. Such a great product! I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I used the product twice a day per the instructions until the bottle was empty.  I saw absolutely no change in the dark spots on the back of my hand or face.  The product did not work for me, and would not order again.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this serum morning and night all over my acne scars and hyperpigmentation areas in conjunction with the Swiss Botany Whitening Cream Mask. I actually already see a difference in just a couple of days on my acne scars! The scars on one side of my face are almost gone, and the scars that were a little darker haven&#x27;t faded in these days (not that I expect them to in such a short time period) but they have also drastically lightened! I mean I&#x27;ve used so many expensive creams, serums, and masks for lightening hyperpigmentation and I&#x27;ve never seen such good results!</li>
