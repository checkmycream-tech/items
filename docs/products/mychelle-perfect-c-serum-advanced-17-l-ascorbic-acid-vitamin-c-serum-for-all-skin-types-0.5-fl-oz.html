    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I have 2 compliants about this Perfect C Serum...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a great product for aging skin!  </li>
            <li>I love Mychelle products, if you have oily/acne skin,Vitamin C serum is a MUST!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using The Perfect C Serum for about 4 months [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The Perfect C Serum, 15 ml]]</li>
            <li>The Perfect C Serum, 15 ml]</li>
            <li>I asked my dermatologist for the best ingredients to put on my skin for anti aging and she said vitamin c and vitamin A.</li>
            <li>To me this is perfect vitamin c serum.  </li>
            <li>The product, when stable (and not brown) is an excellent one!</li>
            <li>I used it for two weeks and saw results already, I was impressed.  </li>
            <li>Her skin looked great!  </li>
            <li>I want to start off by saying that I LOVE Amazon!!!</li>
            <li>Love it!!!</li>
            <li>After a month of using this serum from a sample pack I bought (Oily/Acne), my skin cleared up for the first time in YEARS!!!!!!</li>
            <li>The Perfect C Serum is great to use on cuts, scrapes, etc.</li>
            <li>B000MAOWOS Mychelle Incredible Pumpkin Peel, 1.2 Fl oz]]</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for my skin.  </li>
            <li>Another bonus is that the MyChelle line smells great, not perfumey,  but honest-to-goodness yummy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works like a toner and my face feels great (not overly drying like a lot of C serums).</li>
            <li>Started using these products about 2 years ago and have been happy with all of the serums.  </li>
            <li>greatly improved.</li>
            <li>Great</li>
            <li>great</li>
            <li>Mychelle Vitamin C Serum works great</li>
            <li>I am so happy with the results of MyChelle products.  </li>
            <li>It does feel a bit sticky,but the results are great.</li>
            <li>My skin looks so great from using this morning and night.</li>
            <li>This Serum is a great moisturizer and it disappears into your skin leaving no greasy</li>
            <li>Very effective with noticeable improvement within days</li>
            <li>I love perfect c serum and the supreme polypeptide cream.  </li>
            <li>MyChelle products are very nice for my skin and one of my favorite one!</li>
            <li>The MyChelle website does have a really good sale every now and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m over 50, and I have a good deal of sun damage spots.  </li>
            <li>Amazon seems to have a good price compared to retail.</li>
            <li>I might end up buying it again because they have a good percentage of vitamin C and no fillers.</li>
            <li>I have LOVED this product for years.  </li>
            <li>I found it on amazon for a good price</li>
            <li>and I have fair skin.</li>
            <li>I tried using it for six full months and never was impressed.  </li>
            <li>What I love about this Perfect C Serum is that within 2 days of using it, my skin appeared a bit more smoother both in tone (discolorations) and in texture - even immediately after washing my face so there was no product on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Dr. Hauschka, skintactics, Pangea, Aveda, Aubrey, and many more naturals, but Mychelle has been the best.</li>
            <li>The biggest test--Mychelle products keep working through periods to keep skin looking good, an amazing feat.    </li>
            <li>if so, I&#x27;d be more than happy to edit my review to note that Amazon (again) has the best pricing on this particular product...until then, YES!</li>
            <li>so I use the Perfect C in the evening first then layer it with the Firming Serum then follow with a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>but this WAS being sold on Amazon for $33.25 (since I was tracking it in Jan 2010) and as of today, 2/8/10, the price skyrocketed to a whopping $7 MORE in ONE day!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>and my skin is better for it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS LINE OF PRODUCTS!</li>
            <li>, This line ( i bough 19 of the products_) is amazing and it has changed my face over night, texture, hydration, minimizing lines and contuor http://photographicarteditions.blogspot.com/2015/07/mychelle-skin-care-line-for-fabulous.html</li>
            <li>It smells nice and isn&#x27;t sticky like others I have tried.</li>
            <li>MyChelle does not supply expiration dates (they are supposed to be good for 18 to 24 months from purchase), so I prefer to buy from a reputable source.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d read so many consistently good reviews about this serum that I thought it would be a sure-fire winner.  </li>
            <li>I had read so many great things about it that I was sure that it would create some visible results in my skin.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try it from seeing all the good reviews</li>
            <li>Still, I love the non-toxic MyChelle products and have found that they&#x27;re as effective as they claim to be.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve found that Amazon is the best place to buy MyChelle.</li>
            <li>I am 60 years old and very happy with this product</li>
            <li>Best of all MyChelle products are safe and natural.  </li>
            <li>Serums are always better than creams.  </li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>but I LOVE the majority of the line and can&#x27;t say enough great things about the company and their products!  </li>
            <li>I do tend to use more than most</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update any more changes in my skin as time goes on...    </li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles, the tone and texture of my skin have greatly benefited from the use of this serum.</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of ordering through Amazon at lower prices, and setting up recurrent shipments, so that I never run out of this product.</li>
            <li>I use this C serum and have for many years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I love this serum.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin looking better</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I always notice the best results after I go back to these products.  </li>
            <li>It wont give you perfect skin only genetics</li>
            <li>That seemed ok.</li>
            <li>Mychelle, that&#x27;s over the top.  </li>
            <li>many of them contain Parabens and petrochemicals...</li>
            <li>and I LOVE THEM ALL.</li>
            <li>Try them, you&#x27;ll love them.</li>
            <li>However, I think I&#x27;ve noticed more clogged pores from it.</li>
            <li>I read that the Perfect C Serum helps to prevent scarring, which I have from numerous blemishes.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>my skin always looks better when I use it.</li>
            <li>I look better by using it then when I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff it dimishis my brown spots</li>
            <li>It was more of a scratching my face and debating whether to wash it off feeling.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a better Vitamin C product out there.</li>
            <li>But the liquid keeps leaking out of the top.  </li>
            <li>It takes about two or three months (applying it every day), but somehow the scarring is reduced, not bumpy any more.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Products costing many times more can&#x27;t touch it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product but the bottle needs to be redesigned.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years now and love it.</li>
            <li>Ok so many complain about the amount of serum you get, people try to remember the c serum oxidizes so more</li>
            <li>My skin tone and texture are better as well.  </li>
            <li>and I am so glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks tighter and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I loved it at first.  </li>
            <li>: I spoke to a rep at MyChelle today to be certain that I&#x27;m using what is best for my needs in their skincare line and was told that their Perfect C serum is the most popular serum because people actually notice an obvious difference in their skin.  </li>
            <li>And even though I&#x27;m now putting more serums and lotions on my face than ever before, my skin is not breaking out which was an unexpected, and welcome, bonus.</li>
            <li>Ascorbic is what you want in a C serum, and the higher the percentage, the more effective (and therefore more pricey)</li>
            <li>hopefully soon, Amazon will be one of the places where we can enjoy this at a more affordable price.    </li>
            <li>The packaging is good, because you can twist the lid off to get out every bit of product, and the dispenser does not squirt out too much.    </li>
            <li>- my bottle had a faulty dispenser in that the pumping tube was much shorter than the botte, so a good portion of the product would not come out.  </li>
            <li>I use the Perfect C Serum along with other MyChelle skincare products.</li>
            <li>This Perfect C serum is sold in the same size bottle as their Magnolia Fresh Eyes...</li>
            <li>I easily go through one bottle a month</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s strong so</li>
            <li>just fine</li>
            <li>(if I&#x27;m lucky!)</li>
            <li>and I have never seen the amazing positive changes in my skin that I have seen using MyChelle.  </li>
            <li>Excellent, best &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; serum I have ever used, and I have tried many in the past few years, it&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I liked it because it seemed very natural and authentic, with lots of vitamin C.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product, higher percentage of C than many other serums.</li>
            <li>Any more they say won&#x27;t get absorbed as well</li>
            <li>This stuff isn&#x27;t cheap</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely not as five star happy with it as I used to be, and I don&#x27;t think it works as well.    </li>
            <li>Here at amazon you can get it at 22% discount and free shipping as well.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and has made a difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>use it to smooth out raised scar tissue.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with the product and will definitely continue using it!</li>
            <li>I really like how my skin feels after I use the Perfect C Serum for several days.  </li>
            <li>I first heard of using vitamin C on your face from a panel of dermatologists and cosmetic surgeons on a famous Dr. television show.  </li>
            <li>This is the first Mychelle product I&#x27;ve ever used and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Love the product and fast shipper!</li>
            <li>This is my first bottle and the product might be okay</li>
            <li>It would be nice if they sold a larger size with a better dispensing mechanism.</li>
            <li>B000MAOE46 Mychelle Mychelle For Men So Clean, 4</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple days but my skin tone is already clearer and more even.</li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s kind of a big deal when you literally spend 30 minutes trying to lift the plastic top off of pump and just can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure that I would continue with it, but I quickly noticed a difference after I stopped using the C Serum.</li>
            <li>They have the same or better ingredients than some of the most popular wrinkle products at a much lower price.</li>
            <li>since you get twice as much product for a better price.  </li>
            <li>Love the whole</li>
            <li>They did good on me, especially the scrub.</li>
            <li>So I opened the product by unscrewing the whole top (plastic cover and pump apparatus) and dabbing the bottom of the pump apparatus</li>
            <li>so I have not got to experience the full results from one bottle.  </li>
            <li>I can feel the slight sting which for me is a good sign that the vitamin c is potent and working.  </li>
            <li>The entire MyChelle line is sensational.  </li>
            <li>I have used other vitamin c serums and this product is the best one I have used so far.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy supporting woman-owned, philanthropic, sustainable businesses.</li>
            <li>My skin can&#x27;t tolerate OTC acne products very well--they are too strong, but if I use this serum on any emerging blemish, it will disappear within a day or two.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comforting to know that MyChelle is also a socially responsible company looking to help people (and animals!) and create effective products free of potentially harmful ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Mychelle products are great because they are not full of chemicals.</li>
            <li>Serum is light and gentle.</li>
            <li>They can cost far more than this</li>
            <li>I am especially happy to be free from harsh chemicals such as salicylic acid, differin gels, retin A, and benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li>But the results are well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Really grateful to have found something that actually works and smells good.</li>
            <li>My skin looks way better since I started using natural skin care and it has reduced some sun damage and a lot of my wrinkles from the sun appear to be smoother.  </li>
            <li>I had great hopes for this product as MyChelle&#x27;s sunblock is my favorite, and commenters spoke highly of the Perfect C Serum, but I had a terrible experience with it.</li>
            <li>All of the Mychelle products are good, they free of ingredients you can&#x27;t understand, they are potent, and anyone who complains about the prices has not been to Macy&#x27;s lately and tried to buy a real natural product.</li>
            <li>My skin felt so clean, smooth and soft after it.</li>
            <li>It was originally around $25 (thanks for the history Amazon).</li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>This product offers a higher percentage of L-Ascorbic acid than many serums.  </li>
            <li>I felt compelled to write a review about it because I obviously wanted to share how wonderful this product was and also share that people can find it for less than $40...</li>
            <li>The next day, the plastic top spontaneously popped off, freeing the pump mechanism to actually work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m voting the good old American way...</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this stuff - love the natural list of ingredients - but I can&#x27;t see any difference in my skin at all.</li>
            <li>After checking myself out in the rearview mirror in the parking lot, I went right back in and bought more.</li>
            <li>but as I notice an item here and there having a price increase, then I won&#x27;t be able to justify keeping my Amazon Prime membership and may have to consider going back to the brick &amp; mortar days of shopping.  </li>
            <li>I use several MyChelle products and I love them all.  </li>
            <li>My skin is finally even toned and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li>and when I finally started researching ingredients in most of todays drugstore and even highend skincare lines-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous products over the years, but I&#x27;m really pleased with the Mychelle line.</li>
            <li>My mother in-law asked me last week if I had work done since my skin looks tighter - what better compliment.</li>
            <li>MyChelle lets you sample most of their products in smaller trial sizes.  </li>
            <li>The pump doesn&#x27;t give the same amount every time and leaks around the top.</li>
            <li>Had a funny odor and a bit greasy.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product to help even out sun-damaged/dehydrated/tired skin but noticed that it helps the most in just keeping the occasional blemish at bay.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easily although you have to be careful with pump because it will dispense too much if not pressed lightly.  </li>
            <li>But then I tried to re-close the whole thing and the plastic top would not screw back in.</li>
            <li>My skin has NEVER looked better (no adult breakouts and cleaner pores).  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m certain that&#x27;s what happened to me.</li>
            <li>some say you can&#x27;t, that what goes on first gets penetrated and the rest doesn&#x27;t get absorbed enough to be worth putting on your skin after the 1st layer of serum and others</li>
            <li>Mychelle products are very high quality, and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li>This is a very high quality serum.  </li>
            <li>I can find this Perfect C serum for less than $40 locally and when my local health food stores have their 15% - 25% off sales, then unless Amazon will lower back their price on this to the original $33.25, I&#x27;ll be buying it elsewhere and stocking up when on sale.  </li>
            <li>I think the 17% vitamin C&lt;br /&gt;content may have been too much for my skin.  </li>
            <li>The one area that it hasn&#x27;t made much difference are the lines in my neck</li>
            <li>I go through this stuff too fast to spend that much on it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Towards the end, I just shake out as much of the remnants as I can.</li>
            <li>and it really seemed to help control my acne.</li>
            <li>When I use this stuff, even once a day in the morning, I notice the spots are much lighter after about a week.  </li>
            <li>I really like this.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re available at the mychelleusa.com website if you can&#x27;t find them locally.</li>
            <li>I have absolutely seen the quotation marks around my mouth diminish and my forehead wrinkles reduced.  </li>
            <li>I see no benefits really.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>My teenage niece uses it to smooth out her skin for what she calls &amp;</li>
            <li>and i really like how it feels.</li>
            <li>Really seems to make a difference.</li>
            <li>and it is really smoothing out my skin and helps to reduce break outs.</li>
            <li>obviously very oxidized and not something i am about to put on my face.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product and would highly recommend it to others!</li>
            <li>I purchased this after reading several other good reviews on it&#x27;s ability to minimize poors and even skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I find it interesting that on every other skincare website it has 5 star reviews but</li>
            <li>Since I have sensitive skin, it does burn a bit, but the burning subsides pretty quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m able to wear less foundation.</li>
            <li>Many products have ingredients (like preservatives) that actually age your skin and then add moisturizers to just make it look younger.</li>
            <li>It was not a subtle tingling to let you know</li>
            <li>Bottom line, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>my skin - highly unsanitary.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>When I told her that I noticed that the skin discolorations in my skin were less evident within just a few days, she thought it was due to the 17% Ascorbic Acid in it but said that she&#x27;s heard some wonderful claims from this product.  </li>
            <li>Yet, so far, it really seems to be working well.</li>
            <li>Pimples normally disappear in 1-2 days.</li>
            <li>It normally sells for $45 so for $30</li>
            <li>so i often dont replace it right away, but always come back to it!</li>
            <li>I was told that it&#x27;s not suggested to use it anywhere near the eye area because this is so effective and the eye area is so delicate...</li>
            <li>My skin was left feeling very very sticky, I had to wait a while to put my make up on and even after my make up was on it still felt sticky.</li>
            <li>I have is that the bottle is very small and you end up buying more because it runs out fast.</li>
            <li>About 2yrs ago, I found it a convenience that most items that I purchased were either comprable in pricing OR that Amazon&#x27;s prices were lower than what I could find locally and at other online retailers.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not expensive and give you about 7-10 days of the various products so you can see if they work for you.</li>
            <li>Love the product but my past two orders have come damaged where the product had seeped out all over the box.  </li>
            <li>The calibrated pump doesn&#x27;t always dispense a full application and it stops working before the bottle is empty.</li>
            <li>Makes me wonder if people are receiving genuine products that are not watered down or expired.</li>
            <li>What other reviewers said about the pump and packaging is true.</li>
            <li>I apply it right after I shower to my face, and neck and let it dry and sink in before I apply my SPF moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Not a miracle product, but it certainly does improve the overall appearance and health of my skin,</li>
            <li>I have searched for years for the right product line where I could use each step from a single brand, this is it.</li>
            <li>and this helps even out the skin tone and clear up any blemishes and exfoliates</li>
            <li>I just started this prodcut a few days ago, even though I didn&#x27;t see any improvement of my skin, my skin did feel soft and comfortable every night after I used this serum.</li>
            <li>You can read my review of the Mychelle Clear Skin Serum.</li>
            <li>So far I really like this product, although there hasn&#x27;t been enough time to tell if it does what it claims.</li>
            <li>I purchased it along with the Cranberry Cleanser, Fruit Enzyme Spray, Clear Skin Serum, Eye Brightener Cream, and Oil-Free Grapefruit Lotion.</li>
            <li>However I do recommend this product if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t do much on the acne red marks.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and rosacea and have never had a problem with the Vit C serum.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s suddenly nearly $40.  </li>
            <li>I have dealt with skin care issues (adult acne) for years</li>
            <li>My 16 year old son also uses the Cranberry Cleanser, Pumpkin Peel and Men</li>
            <li>It seems to be working so far.</li>
            <li>I am 48 and really began noticing my wrinkles in the last year.</li>
            <li>, I had seen the comment before about the design flaw in the bottle and thought, how big of a deal could it really be?</li>
            <li>No allergic reactions for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Use year round to help with sun protection and light wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I bought a sample pack, then tried FreshEyes in the  Felton, California natural foods store.  </li>
            <li>Probably buy from the store instead so at least i know its safe.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product last August at first and I&#x27;m using the third one.</li>
            <li>I think the reason why I&#x27;m so irked about this today is that I purchased this one sale locally and have a couple weeks worth of product left and was planning on purchasing it via Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe &amp; Save program only to find out they increased the price.</li>
            <li>While the product feels nice and absorb quickly, I&#x27;m not sure if I would buy it again due to the price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more expensive than I like, but certainly does the job.  </li>
            <li>I want to start off by saying that there isn&#x27;t anything that I have tried so far of the MyChelle line that I dislike;  there ARE a few products that I think are simply OK and perhaps not worth the price</li>
            <li>Other MyChelle products ([[ASIN:B001ET7GI0 MyChelle White Cranberry Cleanser, 4.4-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 2)]] and [[ASIN:B000MANVOU MyChelle Clear Skin Serum, 1-Ounce Bottle]]) still work great for my sensitive skin, but be wary of this one.</li>
            <li>This particular seller either didn&#x27;t store the product correctly or has had it for too long, but it arrived with spillage throughout the cap and all over the bottle and the serum was completely brown -- that is totally oxidized.</li>
            <li>Their prices are consistently lower than average.</li>
            <li>It helps heal broken blemishes, helps minimize my pores, and leaves my skin looking better than it has for 20 years.     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a &#x27;clean&#x27; line that avoids harmful or questionable chemicals and ingredients like most other lines contain and this line actually WORKS!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t worry about absorbing excess parabens and other problematic ingredients.</li>
            <li>The dark spots (which have gotten worse as I&#x27;ve gotten closer to 40) and redness (which has always been part of my fair skin) suddenly looked noticeably lighter to me.  </li>
            <li>I no longer use their face creams only because I found a better one from Lotus Moon&#x27;s cherry blossom healing smoothe (very thick and greasy but changed the texture of my skin almost instantly.  </li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive, oily in the t-zone, and dry everywhere else.</li>
            <li>My skin is complex type and very sensitive, so I&#x27;m very picky at skin care.</li>
            <li>So essentially, it costs twice as much as their other serums in the long run...</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m too much of an Amazon fan to eagerly make that change but a whopping $7 increase for one item that I use on a regular basis that is too little of product to begin with is not settling well with me today.  </li>
            <li>The only down side is that there&#x27;s not much in the bottle and it tends to dry out quickly.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>

            <li> I asked my dermatologist for the best ingredients to put on my skin for anti aging and she said vitamin c and vitamin A.</li>

            <li> B000MAOWOS Mychelle Incredible Pumpkin Peel, 1.2 Fl oz]]</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for my skin.  </li>
            <li> Another bonus is that the MyChelle line smells great, not perfumey,  but honest-to-goodness yummy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works like a toner and my face feels great (not overly drying like a lot of C serums).</li>
            <li> Started using these products about 2 years ago and have been happy with all of the serums.  </li>
            <li> greatly improved.</li>
            <li> Great</li>
            <li> great</li>
            <li> Mychelle Vitamin C Serum works great</li>
            <li> I am so happy with the results of MyChelle products.  </li>
            <li> It does feel a bit sticky,but the results are great.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so great from using this morning and night.</li>
            <li> This Serum is a great moisturizer and it disappears into your skin leaving no greasy</li>
            <li> Very effective with noticeable improvement within days</li>
            <li> I love perfect c serum and the supreme polypeptide cream.  </li>
            <li> MyChelle products are very nice for my skin and one of my favorite one!</li>
            <li> The MyChelle website does have a really good sale every now and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over 50, and I have a good deal of sun damage spots.  </li>
            <li> Amazon seems to have a good price compared to retail.</li>
            <li> I might end up buying it again because they have a good percentage of vitamin C and no fillers.</li>
            <li> I have LOVED this product for years.  </li>
            <li> I found it on amazon for a good price</li>
            <li> and I have fair skin.</li>
            <li> I tried using it for six full months and never was impressed.  </li>
            <li> What I love about this Perfect C Serum is that within 2 days of using it, my skin appeared a bit more smoother both in tone (discolorations) and in texture - even immediately after washing my face so there was no product on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Dr. Hauschka, skintactics, Pangea, Aveda, Aubrey, and many more naturals, but Mychelle has been the best.</li>
            <li> The biggest test--Mychelle products keep working through periods to keep skin looking good, an amazing feat.    </li>
            <li> if so, I&#x27;d be more than happy to edit my review to note that Amazon (again) has the best pricing on this particular product...until then, YES!</li>
            <li> so I use the Perfect C in the evening first then layer it with the Firming Serum then follow with a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> but this WAS being sold on Amazon for $33.25 (since I was tracking it in Jan 2010) and as of today, 2/8/10, the price skyrocketed to a whopping $7 MORE in ONE day!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> and my skin is better for it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS LINE OF PRODUCTS!</li>
            <li> , This line ( i bough 19 of the products_) is amazing and it has changed my face over night, texture, hydration, minimizing lines and contuor http://photographicarteditions.blogspot.com/2015/07/mychelle-skin-care-line-for-fabulous.html</li>
            <li> It smells nice and isn&#x27;t sticky like others I have tried.</li>
            <li> MyChelle does not supply expiration dates (they are supposed to be good for 18 to 24 months from purchase), so I prefer to buy from a reputable source.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read so many consistently good reviews about this serum that I thought it would be a sure-fire winner.  </li>
            <li> I had read so many great things about it that I was sure that it would create some visible results in my skin.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try it from seeing all the good reviews</li>
            <li> Still, I love the non-toxic MyChelle products and have found that they&#x27;re as effective as they claim to be.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve found that Amazon is the best place to buy MyChelle.</li>
            <li> I am 60 years old and very happy with this product</li>
            <li> Best of all MyChelle products are safe and natural.  </li>
            <li> Serums are always better than creams.  </li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> but I LOVE the majority of the line and can&#x27;t say enough great things about the company and their products!  </li>
            <li> I do tend to use more than most</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update any more changes in my skin as time goes on...    </li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles, the tone and texture of my skin have greatly benefited from the use of this serum.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of ordering through Amazon at lower prices, and setting up recurrent shipments, so that I never run out of this product.</li>
            <li> I use this C serum and have for many years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin looking better</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I always notice the best results after I go back to these products.  </li>
            <li> It wont give you perfect skin only genetics</li>
            <li> That seemed ok.</li>
            <li> Mychelle, that&#x27;s over the top.  </li>
            <li> many of them contain Parabens and petrochemicals...</li>
            <li> and I LOVE THEM ALL.</li>
            <li> Try them, you&#x27;ll love them.</li>
            <li> However, I think I&#x27;ve noticed more clogged pores from it.</li>
            <li> I read that the Perfect C Serum helps to prevent scarring, which I have from numerous blemishes.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> my skin always looks better when I use it.</li>
            <li> I look better by using it then when I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it dimishis my brown spots</li>
            <li> It was more of a scratching my face and debating whether to wash it off feeling.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a better Vitamin C product out there.</li>
            <li> But the liquid keeps leaking out of the top.  </li>
            <li> It takes about two or three months (applying it every day), but somehow the scarring is reduced, not bumpy any more.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Products costing many times more can&#x27;t touch it.  </li>
            <li> I love this product but the bottle needs to be redesigned.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years now and love it.</li>
            <li> Ok so many complain about the amount of serum you get, people try to remember the c serum oxidizes so more</li>
            <li> My skin tone and texture are better as well.  </li>
            <li> and I am so glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks tighter and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I loved it at first.  </li>
            <li> : I spoke to a rep at MyChelle today to be certain that I&#x27;m using what is best for my needs in their skincare line and was told that their Perfect C serum is the most popular serum because people actually notice an obvious difference in their skin.  </li>
            <li> And even though I&#x27;m now putting more serums and lotions on my face than ever before, my skin is not breaking out which was an unexpected, and welcome, bonus.</li>
            <li> Ascorbic is what you want in a C serum, and the higher the percentage, the more effective (and therefore more pricey)</li>
            <li> hopefully soon, Amazon will be one of the places where we can enjoy this at a more affordable price.    </li>
            <li> The packaging is good, because you can twist the lid off to get out every bit of product, and the dispenser does not squirt out too much.    </li>
            <li> - my bottle had a faulty dispenser in that the pumping tube was much shorter than the botte, so a good portion of the product would not come out.  </li>
            <li> I use the Perfect C Serum along with other MyChelle skincare products.</li>
            <li> This Perfect C serum is sold in the same size bottle as their Magnolia Fresh Eyes...</li>
            <li> I easily go through one bottle a month</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s strong so</li>
            <li> just fine</li>
            <li> (if I&#x27;m lucky!)</li>
            <li> and I have never seen the amazing positive changes in my skin that I have seen using MyChelle.  </li>
            <li> Excellent, best &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; serum I have ever used, and I have tried many in the past few years, it&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I liked it because it seemed very natural and authentic, with lots of vitamin C.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product, higher percentage of C than many other serums.</li>
            <li> Any more they say won&#x27;t get absorbed as well</li>
            <li> This stuff isn&#x27;t cheap</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely not as five star happy with it as I used to be, and I don&#x27;t think it works as well.    </li>
            <li> Here at amazon you can get it at 22% discount and free shipping as well.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and has made a difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> use it to smooth out raised scar tissue.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with the product and will definitely continue using it!</li>
            <li> I really like how my skin feels after I use the Perfect C Serum for several days.  </li>
            <li> I first heard of using vitamin C on your face from a panel of dermatologists and cosmetic surgeons on a famous Dr. television show.  </li>
            <li> This is the first Mychelle product I&#x27;ve ever used and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> Love the product and fast shipper!</li>
            <li> This is my first bottle and the product might be okay</li>
            <li> It would be nice if they sold a larger size with a better dispensing mechanism.</li>
            <li> B000MAOE46 Mychelle Mychelle For Men So Clean, 4</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple days but my skin tone is already clearer and more even.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s kind of a big deal when you literally spend 30 minutes trying to lift the plastic top off of pump and just can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure that I would continue with it, but I quickly noticed a difference after I stopped using the C Serum.</li>
            <li> They have the same or better ingredients than some of the most popular wrinkle products at a much lower price.</li>
            <li> since you get twice as much product for a better price.  </li>
            <li> Love the whole</li>
            <li> They did good on me, especially the scrub.</li>
            <li> So I opened the product by unscrewing the whole top (plastic cover and pump apparatus) and dabbing the bottom of the pump apparatus</li>
            <li> so I have not got to experience the full results from one bottle.  </li>
            <li> I can feel the slight sting which for me is a good sign that the vitamin c is potent and working.  </li>
            <li> The entire MyChelle line is sensational.  </li>
            <li> I have used other vitamin c serums and this product is the best one I have used so far.</li>
            <li> I also enjoy supporting woman-owned, philanthropic, sustainable businesses.</li>
            <li> My skin can&#x27;t tolerate OTC acne products very well--they are too strong, but if I use this serum on any emerging blemish, it will disappear within a day or two.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comforting to know that MyChelle is also a socially responsible company looking to help people (and animals!) and create effective products free of potentially harmful ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Mychelle products are great because they are not full of chemicals.</li>
            <li> Serum is light and gentle.</li>
            <li> They can cost far more than this</li>
            <li> I am especially happy to be free from harsh chemicals such as salicylic acid, differin gels, retin A, and benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> But the results are well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Really grateful to have found something that actually works and smells good.</li>
            <li> My skin looks way better since I started using natural skin care and it has reduced some sun damage and a lot of my wrinkles from the sun appear to be smoother.  </li>
            <li> I had great hopes for this product as MyChelle&#x27;s sunblock is my favorite, and commenters spoke highly of the Perfect C Serum, but I had a terrible experience with it.</li>
            <li> All of the Mychelle products are good, they free of ingredients you can&#x27;t understand, they are potent, and anyone who complains about the prices has not been to Macy&#x27;s lately and tried to buy a real natural product.</li>
            <li> My skin felt so clean, smooth and soft after it.</li>
            <li> It was originally around $25 (thanks for the history Amazon).</li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> This product offers a higher percentage of L-Ascorbic acid than many serums.  </li>
            <li> I felt compelled to write a review about it because I obviously wanted to share how wonderful this product was and also share that people can find it for less than $40...</li>
            <li> The next day, the plastic top spontaneously popped off, freeing the pump mechanism to actually work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m voting the good old American way...</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this stuff - love the natural list of ingredients - but I can&#x27;t see any difference in my skin at all.</li>
            <li> After checking myself out in the rearview mirror in the parking lot, I went right back in and bought more.</li>
            <li> but as I notice an item here and there having a price increase, then I won&#x27;t be able to justify keeping my Amazon Prime membership and may have to consider going back to the brick &amp; mortar days of shopping.  </li>
            <li> I use several MyChelle products and I love them all.  </li>
            <li> My skin is finally even toned and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li> and when I finally started researching ingredients in most of todays drugstore and even highend skincare lines-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous products over the years, but I&#x27;m really pleased with the Mychelle line.</li>
            <li> My mother in-law asked me last week if I had work done since my skin looks tighter - what better compliment.</li>
            <li> MyChelle lets you sample most of their products in smaller trial sizes.  </li>
            <li> The pump doesn&#x27;t give the same amount every time and leaks around the top.</li>
            <li> Had a funny odor and a bit greasy.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product to help even out sun-damaged/dehydrated/tired skin but noticed that it helps the most in just keeping the occasional blemish at bay.  </li>
            <li> Goes on easily although you have to be careful with pump because it will dispense too much if not pressed lightly.  </li>
            <li> But then I tried to re-close the whole thing and the plastic top would not screw back in.</li>
            <li> My skin has NEVER looked better (no adult breakouts and cleaner pores).  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m certain that&#x27;s what happened to me.</li>
            <li> some say you can&#x27;t, that what goes on first gets penetrated and the rest doesn&#x27;t get absorbed enough to be worth putting on your skin after the 1st layer of serum and others</li>
            <li> Mychelle products are very high quality, and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality serum.  </li>
            <li> I can find this Perfect C serum for less than $40 locally and when my local health food stores have their 15% - 25% off sales, then unless Amazon will lower back their price on this to the original $33.25, I&#x27;ll be buying it elsewhere and stocking up when on sale.  </li>
            <li> I think the 17% vitamin C&lt;br /&gt;content may have been too much for my skin.  </li>
            <li> The one area that it hasn&#x27;t made much difference are the lines in my neck</li>
            <li> I go through this stuff too fast to spend that much on it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Towards the end, I just shake out as much of the remnants as I can.</li>
            <li> and it really seemed to help control my acne.</li>
            <li> When I use this stuff, even once a day in the morning, I notice the spots are much lighter after about a week.  </li>
            <li> I really like this.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re available at the mychelleusa.com website if you can&#x27;t find them locally.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely seen the quotation marks around my mouth diminish and my forehead wrinkles reduced.  </li>
            <li> I see no benefits really.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> My teenage niece uses it to smooth out her skin for what she calls &amp;</li>
            <li> and i really like how it feels.</li>
            <li> Really seems to make a difference.</li>
            <li> and it is really smoothing out my skin and helps to reduce break outs.</li>
            <li> obviously very oxidized and not something i am about to put on my face.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product and would highly recommend it to others!</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading several other good reviews on it&#x27;s ability to minimize poors and even skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I find it interesting that on every other skincare website it has 5 star reviews but</li>
            <li> Since I have sensitive skin, it does burn a bit, but the burning subsides pretty quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m able to wear less foundation.</li>
            <li> Many products have ingredients (like preservatives) that actually age your skin and then add moisturizers to just make it look younger.</li>
            <li> It was not a subtle tingling to let you know</li>
            <li> Bottom line, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> my skin - highly unsanitary.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> When I told her that I noticed that the skin discolorations in my skin were less evident within just a few days, she thought it was due to the 17% Ascorbic Acid in it but said that she&#x27;s heard some wonderful claims from this product.  </li>
            <li> Yet, so far, it really seems to be working well.</li>
            <li> Pimples normally disappear in 1-2 days.</li>
            <li> It normally sells for $45 so for $30</li>
            <li> so i often dont replace it right away, but always come back to it!</li>
            <li> I was told that it&#x27;s not suggested to use it anywhere near the eye area because this is so effective and the eye area is so delicate...</li>
            <li> My skin was left feeling very very sticky, I had to wait a while to put my make up on and even after my make up was on it still felt sticky.</li>
            <li> I have is that the bottle is very small and you end up buying more because it runs out fast.</li>
            <li> About 2yrs ago, I found it a convenience that most items that I purchased were either comprable in pricing OR that Amazon&#x27;s prices were lower than what I could find locally and at other online retailers.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not expensive and give you about 7-10 days of the various products so you can see if they work for you.</li>
            <li> Love the product but my past two orders have come damaged where the product had seeped out all over the box.  </li>
            <li> The calibrated pump doesn&#x27;t always dispense a full application and it stops working before the bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> Makes me wonder if people are receiving genuine products that are not watered down or expired.</li>
            <li> What other reviewers said about the pump and packaging is true.</li>
            <li> I apply it right after I shower to my face, and neck and let it dry and sink in before I apply my SPF moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Not a miracle product, but it certainly does improve the overall appearance and health of my skin,</li>
            <li> I have searched for years for the right product line where I could use each step from a single brand, this is it.</li>
            <li> and this helps even out the skin tone and clear up any blemishes and exfoliates</li>
            <li> I just started this prodcut a few days ago, even though I didn&#x27;t see any improvement of my skin, my skin did feel soft and comfortable every night after I used this serum.</li>
            <li> You can read my review of the Mychelle Clear Skin Serum.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this product, although there hasn&#x27;t been enough time to tell if it does what it claims.</li>
            <li> I purchased it along with the Cranberry Cleanser, Fruit Enzyme Spray, Clear Skin Serum, Eye Brightener Cream, and Oil-Free Grapefruit Lotion.</li>
            <li> However I do recommend this product if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t do much on the acne red marks.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and rosacea and have never had a problem with the Vit C serum.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s suddenly nearly $40.  </li>
            <li> I have dealt with skin care issues (adult acne) for years</li>
            <li> My 16 year old son also uses the Cranberry Cleanser, Pumpkin Peel and Men</li>
            <li> It seems to be working so far.</li>
            <li> I am 48 and really began noticing my wrinkles in the last year.</li>
            <li> , I had seen the comment before about the design flaw in the bottle and thought, how big of a deal could it really be?</li>
            <li> No allergic reactions for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Use year round to help with sun protection and light wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I bought a sample pack, then tried FreshEyes in the  Felton, California natural foods store.  </li>
            <li> Probably buy from the store instead so at least i know its safe.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product last August at first and I&#x27;m using the third one.</li>
            <li> I think the reason why I&#x27;m so irked about this today is that I purchased this one sale locally and have a couple weeks worth of product left and was planning on purchasing it via Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe &amp; Save program only to find out they increased the price.</li>
            <li> While the product feels nice and absorb quickly, I&#x27;m not sure if I would buy it again due to the price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more expensive than I like, but certainly does the job.  </li>
            <li> I want to start off by saying that there isn&#x27;t anything that I have tried so far of the MyChelle line that I dislike;  there ARE a few products that I think are simply OK and perhaps not worth the price</li>
            <li> Other MyChelle products ([[ASIN:B001ET7GI0 MyChelle White Cranberry Cleanser, 4.4-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 2)]] and [[ASIN:B000MANVOU MyChelle Clear Skin Serum, 1-Ounce Bottle]]) still work great for my sensitive skin, but be wary of this one.</li>
            <li> This particular seller either didn&#x27;t store the product correctly or has had it for too long, but it arrived with spillage throughout the cap and all over the bottle and the serum was completely brown -- that is totally oxidized.</li>
            <li> Their prices are consistently lower than average.</li>
            <li> It helps heal broken blemishes, helps minimize my pores, and leaves my skin looking better than it has for 20 years.     </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a &#x27;clean&#x27; line that avoids harmful or questionable chemicals and ingredients like most other lines contain and this line actually WORKS!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t worry about absorbing excess parabens and other problematic ingredients.</li>
            <li> The dark spots (which have gotten worse as I&#x27;ve gotten closer to 40) and redness (which has always been part of my fair skin) suddenly looked noticeably lighter to me.  </li>
            <li> I no longer use their face creams only because I found a better one from Lotus Moon&#x27;s cherry blossom healing smoothe (very thick and greasy but changed the texture of my skin almost instantly.  </li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive, oily in the t-zone, and dry everywhere else.</li>
            <li> My skin is complex type and very sensitive, so I&#x27;m very picky at skin care.</li>
            <li> So essentially, it costs twice as much as their other serums in the long run...</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m too much of an Amazon fan to eagerly make that change but a whopping $7 increase for one item that I use on a regular basis that is too little of product to begin with is not settling well with me today.  </li>
            <li> The only down side is that there&#x27;s not much in the bottle and it tends to dry out quickly.</li>
            <li> Received a new bottle yesterday and it was DARK BROWN in color.</li>
            <li> I used this in combination with the Mychelle Clear Skin serum [as their website said they increase the efficacy of each other] but my skin is no clearer, smoother, my pores no smaller, see no fewer breakouts.</li>
            <li> It use to be mostly clear with a yellow tint, adn had a slightly skunky smell.  </li>
            <li> but she strongly suggested that I don&#x27;t for concern that it may too harsh for that delicate skin area.    </li>
            <li> I received a sample which seemed to be helping my tired, congested skin, so I thought I&#x27;d go ahead and order a full bottle of it.</li>
            <li> and / or a larger size for this since the size is the same as their eye gel yet the same price as other serums...</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, you -might- feel a slight burn when you apply, since it is after all an acid.  </li>
            <li> After a few months I finally had money to buy it and my skin immediately started to clear again.</li>
            <li> Although I know the price tag is a little high for a product so small, if you compare to other quality vitamin C serums, this one is quite reasonable.  </li>
            <li> The other serums are sold in larger bottles at the same price range.  </li>
            <li> but for the most part it made my just washed face feel dirty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;About me: I am a 48-year old grandmother of three and in the past three months, since I began using the MyChelle line, I&#x27;ve been carded twice and have received numerous compliments about my \\&quot;glowing\\&quot; complexion.</li>
            <li> It also took a long time to arrive.</li>
            <li> Amazon agreed to replace it, but the second bottle was completely empty.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product for that long</li>
            <li> She said the key is to only use very little if you choose to layer - she said she only uses 1 calibrated pump of each serum since she prefers to layer them.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely try other Mychelle products as well.</li>
            <li> I also used some other products from Mychelle, like the eye serum and fruits facial scrub..</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the bottle is glass and when I dropped it in my porcelin sink it broke, I was only able to save a small amount of the product</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t ever tried any other &amp;#34;serums&amp;#34; so I am not sure if they are all similar but the scent of this serum was a little too much for me.  </li>
            <li> It cleared up dark spots and swollen sun spots in about 1week from recently being in the sun.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive to use the full line - cleanser, serums, toner and moisturizers, but nothing else has worked as well.</li>
            <li> only to have th product GUSH into my hand and run down the drain.  </li>
            <li> but I notice that my pores get smaller, black heads start popping out and</li>
            <li> I have purchased a different vitamin C product with less vitamin C</li>
            <li> I only use half of the amount recommended.  </li>
            <li> After 3 months my skin started to become very dry and started to peel.</li>
            <li> That burned my skin a little so need to alternate nights.</li>
            <li> only downside for me is that the bottle leaked a little during the shipping process</li>
            <li> #34;chicken skin&amp;#34; little tiny bumps on her face (not acne).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used 2 times and on the third day my face and neck is covered in little bumps.  </li>
            <li> -- it is a very small bottle -- but I was using only 2 small pumps per application, so I was really surprised it didn&#x27;t last longer.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d suggest seeing if you can catch it on sale from a local store, MyChelle&#x27;s website or other online retailers as you CAN find it for less than $40.  </li>
            <li> I do feel I can see the difference in my skin and like that it is chemical free and less expensive than other C products.  </li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t age your skin, so it takes a few extra weeks to for you to see results.</li>
            <li> I DO notice a difference in my skin texture, even skin tone, pore size (I don&#x27;t believe that they can be shrunk but using this line makes them appear smaller), the small teeny wrinkle lines either are less obvious and in some cases have disappeared.  </li>
            <li> In the end, I think it probably IS a decent product, but the INCREDIBLY poor design of the packaging outweighs the benefits of the serum.  </li>
            <li> : I hate to do do this because I really did like this product when I first began using it in 2010.</li>
            <li> one is that it&#x27;s simply too small.  </li>
            <li> Simply because of the small bottle size that MyChelle bottles &amp; sells it at.  </li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t have the red look to it that it usually has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE ON 1-12-13:  Like some other reviewers, I had problems getting this serum to dispense when I got to the bottom of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> They are pricey and I&#x27;m a product junkie, so when I run out I try other things.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on with this product, but somehow the formula is now different.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t combine w. other creams like Retin A.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the size is too small...</li>
            <li> I just got away from it for awhile to try other products and have returned to it</li>
            <li> I also use other Chelle products along with the Vit.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not realize this at first -- I just thought the product was gone already</li>
            <li> Also, the bottle is just too small, especially for the cost.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does have a scent, but I believe it it due to the strenght of the vitamin C.  </li>
            <li> I know mychelle has other products for this as well, but I use it for under eye circles.  </li>
            <li> I use it with other MyChelle products.  </li>
            <li> I am thinking of trying other products by MyChelle</li>
            <li> I ordered this and received  a half empty bottle - it didn&#x27;t leak in the packing box but leaked inside the product box, meaning it had already happened before being shipped.  </li>
            <li> My other complaint is actually about Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Plus, I have noticed a reduction in the dark marks I had on my cheek and chin.    </li>
            <li> The last time I bought it in late 2014, it was around $29.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found it uncomfortable myself, but I have very tolerant skin.  </li>
            <li> It was not worth the money for me.</li>
            <li> Appears to be lightening dark spots and my face looks &#x27;fresher&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I use this, along with other Mychelle creams at night because the creams tend to be heavy for daytime use.  </li>
            <li> is not better, also a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I started using this serum about a year and a half ago</li>
            <li> This is half an ounce of vitamin C.  </li>
            <li> and it had less of a scent.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it is SO expensive for the tiny tiny bottle you receive.</li>
            <li> I was spending alot of money on high priced expensive (LA MER) moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> so, at $30 a pop, it&#x27;s just as expensive as the high end C-serum lines.</li>
            <li> It is never full when I get it because it leaks.</li>
            <li> I mentioned before in a previous review, they had changed the recipe (I thought it was less pure) over a year ago, which was also a disappointment.</li>
            <li> it did sting a little when I put it on.</li>
            <li> I get a little aromatherapy boost twice a day now...  </li>
            <li> so I lost a little bit of product.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s the weird color they put in there (?), because I previously had a clear vitamin c product that did not cause this</li>
            <li> The pump did not work after a few days, it got clogged</li>
            <li> When I put my moisturizer on after the serum the layering of product doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li> It lasts a month or two if I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Thinking it was empty, however, I unscrewed the pump and dumped the bottle energetically into my hand, to get out the last few expensive drops ...</li>
            <li> The only negatives I&#x27;d read were that the packaging was poorly designed.  </li>
            <li> It does tend to waste and leak.</li>
            <li> I wish it was either a little larger or a little less expensive</li>
            <li> If you have dried cracked skin and you use this everyday after your shower, that will be a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> It lightens brown spots, very slightly, but no miracles.  </li>
            <li> For the past couple of years, about 90% of my purchases - besides food and clothing come from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> AND you&#x27;ll end up with &#x27;peeling dried serum&#x27; since it would be too thick.  </li>
            <li> Although it is expensive for a small amount, I did see a big difference.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate it 5 stars is that it is expensive for the amount of product.</li>
            <li> and I totally understand the reason behind it, because the ingredients irritates my skin!</li>
            <li> I am not sure why.  </li>
            <li> This product has done wonders for my skin in the past.  </li>
            <li> Have had no problems in the past so maybe just a fluke</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no unpleasant smell, and MyChelle does not fill their products with a bunch of nasty dyes, parabens, and other preservatives.    </li>
            <li> Have had a hard time getting return issues resolved as sometimes Amazon says return product</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one negative, in my opinion, is the C Serum packaging.</li>
            <li> Maybe some dummies complained.  </li>
            <li> This serum was recommended to me from a women in her late fifties.  </li>
            <li> my dollar, so no more for me!    </li>
            <li> But I hope my warning will keep you from experiencing the same [expensive!]</li>

            <li> I just wish that it was less expensive.</li>
            <li> I think compared to the one I used previously, Ole Henricksen truth serum, this is rather expensive.  </li>
            <li> I use it with \\&quot;serious hyaluronic</li>
            <li> No more expensive moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> and then I had to open it every time and dab some on my fingers to apply, which is really annoying.</li>
            <li> Paula&#x27;s Choice rates this product poorly</li>
            <li> but I found that it was irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> either I am allergic or the product was oxidized and unhealthy to put on my skin.  </li>
            <li> The smell is sort of strange and it lingers on your hands even after you wash them, which is rather annoying.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed after waiting nearly two weeks for this product to turn up.</li>
            <li> real disappointed with this entire line of skin care</li>
            <li> For those who say it&#x27;s expensive...</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> Now it looks sort of thicker with an egg yolk-type consistency, and the smell is weird, like they reduced the strength and tried to cover up the smell.  </li>
            <li> This is an expensive product to feel &#x27;meh&#x27; about.</li>
            <li> It stung my skin in a weird way that felt like an allergy.</li>
            <li> This is unfortunate as I will be returning the product to Amazon in the mail.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this serum did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I never run out, although it is expensive.</li>
            <li> I think the pump is a bad choice for delivering this thin serum.</li>
            <li> Annoyed and disappointed.</li>
            <li> When I ran out of the expensive serum, I started to get zits again but not as bad as before.</li>
            <li> The pump is horrible because it just drips on my fingers and waste products.</li>
            <li> I buy products from mychelle, I am charged, but until now not sent this products and never reply to my emails and facebook messages, too bad, I will never buy mychelle products again.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so frustrated by the watery serum</li>
            <li> I was shocked to find out what was in them!</li>
            <li> A lot of the serum has ended up on my clothes or the floor and at this price that makes me feel terrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I was spending alot of money on high priced expensive (LA MER) moisturizers.  I first heard of using vitamin C on your face from a panel of dermatologists and cosmetic surgeons on a famous Dr. television show.  Sooo...I went to a local health food store and&lt;br /&gt;purchased this product.  I loved it at first.  I immediately could see my skin tighten and the pores actually appeared smaller.  Eureka!! No more expensive moisturizers.  After 3 months my skin started to become very dry and started to peel. I think the 17% vitamin C&lt;br /&gt;content may have been too much for my skin.  However I do recommend this product if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.  The only&lt;br /&gt;issue I have is that the bottle is very small and you end up buying more because it runs out fast.</li>
            <li> Serums are always better than creams.  If you have dried cracked skin and you use this everyday after your shower, that will be a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product last August at first and I&#x27;m using the third one. This adds brightness and moisture as well on my face. My skin is complex type and very sensitive, so I&#x27;m very picky at skin care. MyChelle products are very nice for my skin and one of my favorite one!</li>
            <li> ok. it did sting a little when I put it on. but for the most part it made my just washed face feel dirty. real disappointed with this entire line of skin care</li>
            <li> I want to start off by saying that there isn&#x27;t anything that I have tried so far of the MyChelle line that I dislike;  there ARE a few products that I think are simply OK and perhaps not worth the price but I LOVE the majority of the line and can&#x27;t say enough great things about the company and their products!  It&#x27;s a &#x27;clean&#x27; line that avoids harmful or questionable chemicals and ingredients like most other lines contain and this line actually WORKS!! I DO notice a difference in my skin texture, even skin tone, pore size (I don&#x27;t believe that they can be shrunk but using this line makes them appear smaller), the small teeny wrinkle lines either are less obvious and in some cases have disappeared.  The one area that it hasn&#x27;t made much difference are the lines in my neck so I&#x27;m still searching for something to help me there.  In the meantime, I&#x27;m using MyChelle&#x27;s protocol for sun damaged skin for that area.    What I love about this Perfect C Serum is that within 2 days of using it, my skin appeared a bit more smoother both in tone (discolorations) and in texture - even immediately after washing my face so there was no product on my skin.  I do tend to use more than most I would assume...I use it on my entire face - under eyes &amp; eyelids to my neck and decollate&#x60; area.   I&#x27;ve heard conflicting info from skin care companies in regards to layering serums...some say you can&#x27;t, that what goes on first gets penetrated and the rest doesn&#x27;t get absorbed enough to be worth putting on your skin after the 1st layer of serum and others say that it will penetrate through the skin but at a slower rate.  MyChelle claims that you CAN layer your serums so I use the Perfect C in the evening first then layer it with the Firming Serum then follow with a moisturizer.  In the daytime, I only use the Firming Serum with a moisturizer.    I have 2 compliants about this Perfect C Serum...one is that it&#x27;s simply too small.  The other serums are sold in larger bottles at the same price range.  This Perfect C serum is sold in the same size bottle as their Magnolia Fresh Eyes...so essentially you are supposed to use this serum on your entire face but yet you are only offered enough for your eye area.  So essentially, it costs twice as much as their other serums in the long run...something is amiss there!      My other complaint is actually about Amazon.  I want to start off by saying that I LOVE Amazon!!! For the past couple of years, about 90% of my purchases - besides food and clothing come from Amazon.  I DO realize that at times some prices fluctuate but this WAS being sold on Amazon for $33.25 (since I was tracking it in Jan 2010) and as of today, 2/8/10, the price skyrocketed to a whopping $7 MORE in ONE day!  So now the price on this item is $40 and change!! About 2yrs ago, I found it a convenience that most items that I purchased were either comprable in pricing OR that Amazon&#x27;s prices were lower than what I could find locally and at other online retailers.  I can find this Perfect C serum for less than $40 locally and when my local health food stores have their 15% - 25% off sales, then unless Amazon will lower back their price on this to the original $33.25, I&#x27;ll be buying it elsewhere and stocking up when on sale.  Now granted, one item that I use on a regular basis that I have to pick up somewhere besides Amazon is no big deal but as I notice an item here and there having a price increase, then I won&#x27;t be able to justify keeping my Amazon Prime membership and may have to consider going back to the brick &amp; mortar days of shopping.  I HOPE NOT - I&#x27;m too much of an Amazon fan to eagerly make that change but a whopping $7 increase for one item that I use on a regular basis that is too little of product to begin with is not settling well with me today.  Hopefully Amazon will revert the pricing back...if so, I&#x27;d be more than happy to edit my review to note that Amazon (again) has the best pricing on this particular product...until then, YES! I do recommend this product but I&#x27;d suggest seeing if you can catch it on sale from a local store, MyChelle&#x27;s website or other online retailers as you CAN find it for less than $40.  I go through this stuff too fast to spend that much on it.  I think the reason why I&#x27;m so irked about this today is that I purchased this one sale locally and have a couple weeks worth of product left and was planning on purchasing it via Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe &amp; Save program only to find out they increased the price. I felt compelled to write a review about it because I obviously wanted to share how wonderful this product was and also share that people can find it for less than $40...hopefully soon, Amazon will be one of the places where we can enjoy this at a more affordable price.    Why the 4 star review? Simply because of the small bottle size that MyChelle bottles &amp; sells it at.  If it weren&#x27;t for this, this would be a 100% 5 star product in my opinion!!!  I&#x27;ll update any more changes in my skin as time goes on...    ETA: I spoke to a rep at MyChelle today to be certain that I&#x27;m using what is best for my needs in their skincare line and was told that their Perfect C serum is the most popular serum because people actually notice an obvious difference in their skin.  When I told her that I noticed that the skin discolorations in my skin were less evident within just a few days, she thought it was due to the 17% Ascorbic Acid in it but said that she&#x27;s heard some wonderful claims from this product.  I was told that it&#x27;s not suggested to use it anywhere near the eye area because this is so effective and the eye area is so delicate...I HAVE been using it in my eye area since I wanted it to &#x27;do it&#x27;s thing!&#x27; and I told her that I have been using and my eye area seems to handle it just fine but she strongly suggested that I don&#x27;t for concern that it may too harsh for that delicate skin area.    Last tidbit: According to MyChelle company, you CAN layer up to 3 of their serums and will benefit from all 3of them.  Any more they say won&#x27;t get absorbed as well AND you&#x27;ll end up with &#x27;peeling dried serum&#x27; since it would be too thick.  She said the key is to only use very little if you choose to layer - she said she only uses 1 calibrated pump of each serum since she prefers to layer them.      ***I DID beg for a lower price on this and / or a larger size for this since the size is the same as their eye gel yet the same price as other serums...she said she doesnt&#x27; know of any plans to do so but she would note it in their customer feedback area...I would think that if enough people asked the same, MAYBE they&#x27;d consider it?? We can hope, right?</li>
            <li> I have noticed a definite improvement in my complexion with this serum.  My skin is softer, my pores are cleaner. While I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles, the tone and texture of my skin have greatly benefited from the use of this serum. Mychelle products are very high quality, and this one is no exception. I love the convenience of ordering through Amazon at lower prices, and setting up recurrent shipments, so that I never run out of this product. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is the first Mychelle product I&#x27;ve ever used and I absolutely love it.  My skin (oily) looks radiant.  Pimples normally disappear in 1-2 days. However, it doesn&#x27;t do much on the acne red marks.  I&#x27;ll definitely try other Mychelle products as well.</li>
            <li> I use this C serum and have for many years. It&#x27;s the best. The only down side is that there&#x27;s not much in the bottle and it tends to dry out quickly. It&#x27;s great for my skin.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Didn&#x27;t see enough results for the price. I used it for 3 months. It smells nice and isn&#x27;t sticky like others I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about six weeks, and I started suddenly noticing a difference in my facial skin tone just last week.  The dark spots (which have gotten worse as I&#x27;ve gotten closer to 40) and redness (which has always been part of my fair skin) suddenly looked noticeably lighter to me.  My face doesn&#x27;t have the red look to it that it usually has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this once a day.  I apply it right after I shower to my face, and neck and let it dry and sink in before I apply my SPF moisturizer.  Since I have sensitive skin, it does burn a bit, but the burning subsides pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great product for aging skin!  Be patient and you&#x27;ll see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE ON 1-12-13:  Like some other reviewers, I had problems getting this serum to dispense when I got to the bottom of the bottle.  I still had quite a bit of serum in the bottle, but had to open each time (which lets in air and degrades the serum) to get it to come out.  Once I finished it, I ended up switching to [[ASIN:B000SAPE3A Devita Devita-C Accelerator, 1-Ounce]] since you get twice as much product for a better price.  The Devita serum works just as well as the MyChelle one.</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  It cleared up dark spots and swollen sun spots in about 1week from recently being in the sun.  The pump did not work after a few days, it got clogged and then I had to open it every time and dab some on my fingers to apply, which is really annoying.</li>
            <li> I use the Perfect C Serum along with other MyChelle skincare products. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure that I would continue with it, but I quickly noticed a difference after I stopped using the C Serum. I easily go through one bottle a month (if I&#x27;m lucky!) so, at $30 a pop, it&#x27;s just as expensive as the high end C-serum lines. Still, I love the non-toxic MyChelle products and have found that they&#x27;re as effective as they claim to be. And even though I&#x27;m now putting more serums and lotions on my face than ever before, my skin is not breaking out which was an unexpected, and welcome, bonus. Another bonus is that the MyChelle line smells great, not perfumey,  but honest-to-goodness yummy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one negative, in my opinion, is the C Serum packaging. It would be nice if they sold a larger size with a better dispensing mechanism. The calibrated pump doesn&#x27;t always dispense a full application and it stops working before the bottle is empty. I&#x27;ve taken to undoing and replacing the cap which seems to help as the bottle gets low. Towards the end, I just shake out as much of the remnants as I can. This stuff isn&#x27;t cheap so I try to get every last bit of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best deals: So far, I&#x27;ve found that Amazon is the best place to buy MyChelle. Their prices are consistently lower than average. You can also get deals on eBay, but you have to work (snipe) for them. MyChelle does not supply expiration dates (they are supposed to be good for 18 to 24 months from purchase), so I prefer to buy from a reputable source. The MyChelle website does have a really good sale every now and then so, if you like her products, you may want to get on the email list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About me: I am a 48-year old grandmother of three and in the past three months, since I began using the MyChelle line, I&#x27;ve been carded twice and have received numerous compliments about my \\&quot;glowing\\&quot; complexion. I followed the suggestions on the MyChelle website and I&#x27;m using the [[ASIN:B000MAPFRG Mychelle Honeydew Cleanser, 4.4 Fl oz (130 ml) (Pack of 2)]], [[ASIN:B000MANVP4 Mychelle Firming Serum, Serious Hyaluronic, 30 ml]], [[ASIN:B000MAQW9Q Mychelle Supreme Polypeptide Cream, With Matrixyl 3000 And Marine Polypeptides, Unscented, 1.2 Fl oz]], [[ASIN:B000MAOWO8 Mychelle Deep Repair Cream, 1.2 Fl oz]] (AM), [[ASIN:B000MANVPE Mychelle Night Cream, Revitalizing, 30 ml]] (PM) and [[ASIN:B000MASTM4 Mychelle Fruit Enzyme Mist, 4.4 Fl oz (130 ml)]].

            <li> Serum is light and gentle. I use this, along with other Mychelle creams at night because the creams tend to be heavy for daytime use.  Haven&#x27;t seen any decrease in hyper-pigmentation/freckles, but I just started about 6 weeks ago.  I do notice skin is softer and brighter/clearer.  I have used other vitamin c serums and this product is the best one I have used so far.</li>
            <li> This stuff stops my hormonal acne in its tracks.  I use several MyChelle products and I love them all.  For those who say it&#x27;s expensive... what about the department store, \\&quot;upscale\\&quot; brands?  They can cost far more than this and I have never seen the amazing positive changes in my skin that I have seen using MyChelle.  It&#x27;s comforting to know that MyChelle is also a socially responsible company looking to help people (and animals!) and create effective products free of potentially harmful ingredients.  What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> No praise or accolades are enough for this product. It leaves my skin looking better everytime I use it. It helps heal broken blemishes, helps minimize my pores, and leaves my skin looking better than it has for 20 years.     The biggest test--Mychelle products keep working through periods to keep skin looking good, an amazing feat.    I am especially happy to be free from harsh chemicals such as salicylic acid, differin gels, retin A, and benzoyl peroxide. My skin is finally even toned and feeling healthy. I&#x27;ve tried Dr. Hauschka, skintactics, Pangea, Aveda, Aubrey, and many more naturals, but Mychelle has been the best.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works like a toner and my face feels great (not overly drying like a lot of C serums). When I put my moisturizer on after the serum the layering of product doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. Plus, I have noticed a reduction in the dark marks I had on my cheek and chin.    I don&#x27;t worry about absorbing excess parabens and other problematic ingredients. Many products have ingredients (like preservatives) that actually age your skin and then add moisturizers to just make it look younger. This product doesn&#x27;t age your skin, so it takes a few extra weeks to for you to see results. But the results are well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I started using this serum about a year and a half ago and it really seemed to help control my acne. There were a couple of times when I ran out and, while waiting for the next bottle to arrive, my skin would flare up. However, it seems that the formula changed and I now get allergic bumps all over my forehead when I use it. Other MyChelle products ([[ASIN:B001ET7GI0 MyChelle White Cranberry Cleanser, 4.4-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 2)]] and [[ASIN:B000MANVOU MyChelle Clear Skin Serum, 1-Ounce Bottle]]) still work great for my sensitive skin, but be wary of this one.</li>
            <li> Excellent, best &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; serum I have ever used, and I have tried many in the past few years, it&lt;br /&gt;Just works!!!!</li>
            <li> I noticed a big difference when I was using this product.  Although it is expensive for a small amount, I did see a big difference.  I often switch the products that I use so that my skin doesn&#x27;t get used to them but I continually go back to the product.  The smell also didn&#x27;t bother me.  I like how it goes on and it dries well.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love the product and fast shipper!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!  You notice a difference with just one use.  I have a lot of hyperpigmentation coming out and this helps even out the skin tone and clear up any blemishes and exfoliates.. etc.  It is a must have!  I wish it was either a little larger or a little less expensive but I will stil buy it anyway.</li>
            <li> Started using these products about 2 years ago and have been happy with all of the serums.  They are pricey and I&#x27;m a product junkie, so when I run out I try other things.  I always notice the best results after I go back to these products.  I no longer use their face creams only because I found a better one from Lotus Moon&#x27;s cherry blossom healing smoothe (very thick and greasy but changed the texture of my skin almost instantly.  I have sensitive skin and rosacea and have never had a problem with the Vit C serum. It wont give you perfect skin only genetics can but I notice that my pores get smaller, black heads start popping out and skin tone (Im turning 40)is greatly improved.</li>
            <li> This skin serum is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;I would never of used a serum product if it wasnt for this one!</li>
            <li> Final Update 1/29/15: I hate to do do this because I really did like this product when I first began using it in 2010. It was originally around $25 (thanks for the history Amazon). The last time I bought it in late 2014, it was around $29.  That seemed ok. Now it&#x27;s suddenly nearly $40.  Sorry Mychelle, that&#x27;s over the top.  And I won&#x27;t pay it.  It lightens brown spots, very slightly, but no miracles.  Not enough to warrant $40.  I mentioned before in a previous review, they had changed the recipe (I thought it was less pure) over a year ago, which was also a disappointment. This is the last straw.  I&#x27;m voting the good old American way...my dollar, so no more for me!    Update: 2/16/11 I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on with this product, but somehow the formula is now different.  It use to be mostly clear with a yellow tint, adn had a slightly skunky smell.  I liked it because it seemed very natural and authentic, with lots of vitamin C.  Now it looks sort of thicker with an egg yolk-type consistency, and the smell is weird, like they reduced the strength and tried to cover up the smell.  Maybe some dummies complained.  I&#x27;m definitely not as five star happy with it as I used to be, and I don&#x27;t think it works as well.    Love it! I&#x27;m over 50, and I have a good deal of sun damage spots.  When I use this stuff, even once a day in the morning, I notice the spots are much lighter after about a week.  All of the Mychelle products are good, they free of ingredients you can&#x27;t understand, they are potent, and anyone who complains about the prices has not been to Macy&#x27;s lately and tried to buy a real natural product.</li>
            <li> I have dealt with skin care issues (adult acne) for years and when I finally started researching ingredients in most of todays drugstore and even highend skincare lines- I was shocked to find out what was in them! Do the research yourself- then look at the so called \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products you are using now- many of them contain Parabens and petrochemicals...I found Mychelle line on the internet and have been using them faithfully for a couple of years now- Love the whole line- especially the pumkin renew cream, Vitamin C serum, and the fruit enzyme spray, oh yeah and try the cranberry cleanser as well! Great line- great company- I&#x27;m sold! Here at amazon you can get it at 22% discount and free shipping as well.</li>
            <li> Although I know the price tag is a little high for a product so small, if you compare to other quality vitamin C serums, this one is quite reasonable.  The packaging is good, because you can twist the lid off to get out every bit of product, and the dispenser does not squirt out too much.    I use the serum for preventive maintenance against oxidation and sun damage.    This product offers a higher percentage of L-Ascorbic acid than many serums.  Ascorbic is what you want in a C serum, and the higher the percentage, the more effective (and therefore more pricey) the item is.  So again, when comparing against competing products, MyChelle is a winner.    If you have sensitive skin, you -might- feel a slight burn when you apply, since it is after all an acid.  I&#x27;ve never found it uncomfortable myself, but I have very tolerant skin.  There&#x27;s no unpleasant smell, and MyChelle does not fill their products with a bunch of nasty dyes, parabens, and other preservatives.    Bottom line, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I really like this.  Started using it &amp; immediately saw results.  But it&#x27;s strong so don&#x27;t combine w. other creams like Retin A.  That burned my skin a little so need to alternate nights.</li>
            <li> I just started this prodcut a few days ago, even though I didn&#x27;t see any improvement of my skin, my skin did feel soft and comfortable every night after I used this serum. I also used some other products from Mychelle, like the eye serum and fruits facial scrub.. They did good on me, especially the scrub. My skin felt so clean, smooth and soft after it. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the size is too small...</li>
            <li> You can read my review of the Mychelle Clear Skin Serum. Mychelle Vitamin C Serum works great, I don&#x27;t think the rest of the Mychelle oily/acne products work as well in clearing up skin as it does when it&#x27;s coupled with Vitamin C Serum. After a month of using this serum from a sample pack I bought (Oily/Acne), my skin cleared up for the first time in YEARS!!!!!! When I ran out of the expensive serum, I started to get zits again but not as bad as before. After a few months I finally had money to buy it and my skin immediately started to clear again. I love Mychelle products, if you have oily/acne skin,Vitamin C serum is a MUST!!!!!!!! Mychelle products are great because they are not full of chemicals. I just wish that it was less expensive. Amazon seems to have a good price compared to retail.</li>
            <li> The Perfect C Serum is great to use on cuts, scrapes, etc. Not just on your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using The Perfect C Serum for about 4 months [[ASIN:B000MAOWP2 Mychelle The Perfect C Serum, 15 ml]] along with the Fruit Enzyme Mist[[ASIN:B000MASTM4 Mychelle Fruit Enzyme Mist, 4.4 Fl oz (130 ml)]] and the Deep Repair Cream [[ASIN:B000MAOWO8 Mychelle Deep Repair Cream, 1.2 Fl oz]] and Cranberry Cleanser[[ASIN:B000BD2L2G Cranberry Cleanser - 4.4 oz - Liquid]] and Pumpkin Peel and [[ASIN:B000BD2L44 Sun Shield - 2.25 oz - Cream]]and SunShield[[ASIN:B000MAOWOS Mychelle Incredible Pumpkin Peel, 1.2 Fl oz]] and I LOVE THEM ALL. My skin has NEVER looked better (no adult breakouts and cleaner pores).  My 16 year old son also uses the Cranberry Cleanser, Pumpkin Peel and Men so Clean[[ASIN:B000MAOE46 Mychelle Mychelle For Men So Clean, 4 In One, 4.3 Fl oz (128 ml) (Pack of 2)]] and his face is clearing up.  Try them, you&#x27;ll love them.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive, oily in the t-zone, and dry everywhere else. I&#x27;ve tried numerous products over the years, but I&#x27;m really pleased with the Mychelle line. I bought the Dry/Mature Skin Sampler package at a local health food store, so I got to try several of the products together. My skin has dramatically improved in just 10 days. Not only has the acne cleared, but the texture and tone have also improved. The products feel like they&#x27;re feeding and nourishing my skin, rather than stripping it and then replacing the moisture. Really grateful to have found something that actually works and smells good. I get a little aromatherapy boost twice a day now...  It is expensive to use the full line - cleanser, serums, toner and moisturizers, but nothing else has worked as well. I also enjoy supporting woman-owned, philanthropic, sustainable businesses. I&#x27;d suggest trying one of the sampler packages before investing though. They&#x27;re not expensive and give you about 7-10 days of the various products so you can see if they work for you. They&#x27;re available at the mychelleusa.com website if you can&#x27;t find them locally.</li>
            <li> I really like how my skin feels after I use the Perfect C Serum for several days.  However, I think I&#x27;ve noticed more clogged pores from it.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this product, although there hasn&#x27;t been enough time to tell if it does what it claims. I purchased it along with the Cranberry Cleanser, Fruit Enzyme Spray, Clear Skin Serum, Eye Brightener Cream, and Oil-Free Grapefruit Lotion. I read that the Perfect C Serum helps to prevent scarring, which I have from numerous blemishes. It seems to be working so far. I&#x27;ll update this review if anything changes.</li>
            <li> This is half an ounce of vitamin C.  I think compared to the one I used previously, Ole Henricksen truth serum, this is rather expensive.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and I can&#x27;t tell what it does for my skin. The pump is horrible because it just drips on my fingers and waste products. While the product feels nice and absorb quickly, I&#x27;m not sure if I would buy it again due to the price.  I might end up buying it again because they have a good percentage of vitamin C and no fillers.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, higher percentage of C than many other serums. All quality ingredients, nothing unkind for the skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It seems to make your complexion glow. The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate it 5 stars is that it is expensive for the amount of product. It lasts a month or two if I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I know for wrinkles Vitamin C. is essential. I have been using it for 2 years actually longer I just got away from it for awhile to try other products and have returned to it, I will keep it as a staple in my beauty routine my skin always looks better when I use it. I am 60 years old and very happy with this product it has 17% vitamin C serum. MyChelle truly is MyChelle I also use other Chelle products along with the Vit. C serum. When applied it gives a tingling feeling and a tightening effect. I look better by using it then when I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000MAOWP2 Mychelle The Perfect C Serum, 15 ml] I am 48 and really began noticing my wrinkles in the last year. I began researching products that were proven to reduce wrinkles. I found MyChelle Dermaceuticals and have been using this product since March of 2008 along with MyChelle Supreme Polypeptide Cream. I have absolutely seen the quotation marks around my mouth diminish and my forehead wrinkles reduced.  I am so happy with the results of MyChelle products.  They have the same or better ingredients than some of the most popular wrinkle products at a much lower price. My mother in-law asked me last week if I had work done since my skin looks tighter - what better compliment.</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality serum.  It goes on smoothly and has made a difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this stuff - love the natural list of ingredients - but I can&#x27;t see any difference in my skin at all. I used this in combination with the Mychelle Clear Skin serum [as their website said they increase the efficacy of each other] but my skin is no clearer, smoother, my pores no smaller, see no fewer breakouts. I wish I could report different results!&lt;br /&gt;Also - my bottle had a faulty dispenser in that the pumping tube was much shorter than the botte, so a good portion of the product would not come out.  Unfortunately, I did not realize this at first -- I just thought the product was gone already -- it is a very small bottle -- but I was using only 2 small pumps per application, so I was really surprised it didn&#x27;t last longer.  Thinking it was empty, however, I unscrewed the pump and dumped the bottle energetically into my hand, to get out the last few expensive drops ... only to have th product GUSH into my hand and run down the drain.  Ouch.&lt;br /&gt;The product didn&#x27;t seem to be working for me, anyway -- But I hope my warning will keep you from experiencing the same [expensive!] loss.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple days but my skin tone is already clearer and more even. I used to have a lot of clogged pores and blackheads on my nose, but even those are gone now and my skin looks poreless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside for me is that the bottle leaked a little during the shipping process so I lost a little bit of product. That&#x27;s the reason why I gave it four as opposed to five stars. I think in the future I&#x27;ll try to find a local store where I can buy the product but I won&#x27;t have to worry about it spilling.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it dimishis my brown spots and if I use it daily I can&#x27;t seem them. It does feel a bit sticky,but the results are great.</li>
            <li> everyone raves about vitamin c serum... I see no benefits really. In fact, I find when I use this product, I break out in acne. I tried using it for six full months and never was impressed.  This is an expensive product to feel &#x27;meh&#x27; about.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product!!  I&#x27;d read so many consistently good reviews about this serum that I thought it would be a sure-fire winner.  The only negatives I&#x27;d read were that the packaging was poorly designed.  In the end, I think it probably IS a decent product, but the INCREDIBLY poor design of the packaging outweighs the benefits of the serum.  Also, the bottle is just too small, especially for the cost.  I probably won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I had great hopes for this product as MyChelle&#x27;s sunblock is my favorite, and commenters spoke highly of the Perfect C Serum, but I had a terrible experience with it. It stung my skin in a weird way that felt like an allergy. It was not a subtle tingling to let you know it&#x27;s working feeling. It was more of a scratching my face and debating whether to wash it off feeling. Maybe it&#x27;s the weird color they put in there (?), because I previously had a clear vitamin c product that did not cause this sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I had seen the comment before about the design flaw in the bottle and thought, how big of a deal could it really be? Well, it&#x27;s kind of a big deal when you literally spend 30 minutes trying to lift the plastic top off of pump and just can&#x27;t. So I opened the product by unscrewing the whole top (plastic cover and pump apparatus) and dabbing the bottom of the pump apparatus my skin - highly unsanitary. The next day, the plastic top spontaneously popped off, freeing the pump mechanism to actually work. But then I tried to re-close the whole thing and the plastic top would not screw back in. So the thing is not sealed and is utterly untransportable. This is unfortunate as I will be returning the product to Amazon in the mail. I guess I&#x27;ll have to double plastic bag it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never return anything, but this disaster of a product will have to go.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  Very effective with noticeable improvement within days</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product. I received a sample which seemed to be helping my tired, congested skin, so I thought I&#x27;d go ahead and order a full bottle of it. I had read so many great things about it that I was sure that it would create some visible results in my skin. Sadly, this serum did nothing for me. What other reviewers said about the pump and packaging is true. It does tend to waste and leak. The smell is sort of strange and it lingers on your hands even after you wash them, which is rather annoying. I guess it just doesn&#x27;t work for my skin, which is a bummer.</li>
            <li> I asked my dermatologist for the best ingredients to put on my skin for anti aging and she said vitamin c and vitamin A. I haven&#x27;t found a better Vitamin C product out there. My skin looks so great from using this morning and night. It normally sells for $45 so for $30 it&#x27;s a steal. I find it interesting that on every other skincare website it has 5 star reviews but only 4 on Amazon. Makes me wonder if people are receiving genuine products that are not watered down or expired.</li>
            <li> To me this is perfect vitamin c serum.  Has the amount of vitamin c that&#x27;s recommended by experts.  Goes on easily although you have to be careful with pump because it will dispense too much if not pressed lightly.  No allergic reactions for my sensitive skin.  Use year round to help with sun protection and light wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Its color turn to yellow from transparency after a month of use? They should notice us before we purchase it! Paula&#x27;s Choice rates this product poorly and I totally understand the reason behind it, because the ingredients irritates my skin! But thought Vitamin C can reduce the pigments on my face</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  My skin looks way better since I started using natural skin care and it has reduced some sun damage and a lot of my wrinkles from the sun appear to be smoother.  Can&#x27;t say enough about MyChelle!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  But the liquid keeps leaking out of the top.  I am not sure why.  I leave it upright but liquid will still seep out of it.  I did not experience this when I purchased the same product at a retail store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it to smooth out raised scar tissue.  It takes about two or three months (applying it every day), but somehow the scarring is reduced, not bumpy any more.  My teenage niece uses it to smooth out her skin for what she calls &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; little tiny bumps on her face (not acne).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does have a scent, but I believe it it due to the strenght of the vitamin C.  I have purchased a different vitamin C product with less vitamin C and it had less of a scent.</li>
            <li> I only used this serum twice because it made my skin feel so sticky! I couldn&#x27;t stand it. I was very excited to try it from seeing all the good reviews but I guess my skin didn&#x27;t soak it in too well. My skin was left feeling very very sticky, I had to wait a while to put my make up on and even after my make up was on it still felt sticky. Not to mention it is SO expensive for the tiny tiny bottle you receive. It was not worth the money for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a year.  I do feel I can see the difference in my skin and like that it is chemical free and less expensive than other C products.  I use it with \\&quot;serious hyaluronic acid\\&quot;  and \\&quot;notox\\&quot; from the same company.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin the day after I started using this stuff. I use it with the fruit cleanserand the scrub.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This is my first bottle and the product might be okay but I&#x27;m so frustrated by the watery serum and how it squirts out I won&#x27;t buy it again.  A lot of the serum has ended up on my clothes or the floor and at this price that makes me feel terrible.  I think the pump is a bad choice for delivering this thin serum.</li>
            <li> This product has done wonders for my skin in the past.  This particular seller either didn&#x27;t store the product correctly or has had it for too long, but it arrived with spillage throughout the cap and all over the bottle and the serum was completely brown -- that is totally oxidized. This of course means that this tiny $30 puchase has lost the majority if not all of its anti-oxidizing effectiveness.  It also took a long time to arrive. Annoyed and disappointed. Won&#x27;t be using Fragrance Net again.  The product, when stable (and not brown) is an excellent one!</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading several other good reviews on it&#x27;s ability to minimize poors and even skin tone.  I used it for two weeks and saw results already, I was impressed.  Unfortunately, the bottle is glass and when I dropped it in my porcelin sink it broke, I was only able to save a small amount of the product so I have not got to experience the full results from one bottle.  I will defninetly replace it though.</li>
            <li> I love perfect c serum and the supreme polypeptide cream.  The entire MyChelle line is sensational.  Products costing many times more can&#x27;t touch it.  Best of all MyChelle products are safe and natural.  MyChelle lets you sample most of their products in smaller trial sizes.  I bought a sample pack, then tried FreshEyes in the  Felton, California natural foods store.  My husband noticed a reduction in the puffiness under my eyes before I left the store.  After checking myself out in the rearview mirror in the parking lot, I went right back in and bought more.</li>
            <li> Love the product but my past two orders have come damaged where the product had seeped out all over the box.  Have had a hard time getting return issues resolved as sometimes Amazon says return product and then I get a message not to return the product but have yet to see a credit for damaged product!</li>
            <li> I ordered this and received  a half empty bottle - it didn&#x27;t leak in the packing box but leaked inside the product box, meaning it had already happened before being shipped.  Amazon agreed to replace it, but the second bottle was completely empty.  I hope this problem has been resolved!!!!!!</li>
            <li> After about 1 week I started to notice my face clearing up. After two weeks my complexion began to even out and I&#x27;m able to wear less foundation. I starting using two pumps as instructed on the packaging but I found that it was irritating my skin. I decided to apply only one pump and it has made all the difference. I use it morning and evening and my skin is better for it!</li>
            <li> The bottle dispenser dries out lost product should return if I can return &amp; credit me I will.</li>
            <li> i have been using this for about a year and i really like how it feels. i dont like the price so i often dont replace it right away, but always come back to it!</li>
            <li> This on is a keeper! I use it every day and my skin feels moistered and plump after using it. It helps with discoloration too.  I introduced my friend to it and she loves it too. Take care not to get any in your eyes as it will sting.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product for that long but I feel when I use it, it&#x27;s doing something.  I&#x27;ll have to wait and see.</li>
            <li> Really seems to make a difference. My skin just drinks it up! I never run out, although it is expensive.</li>
            <li> This Serum is a great moisturizer and it disappears into your skin leaving no greasy film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it every day. It does not cause any blemishes.</li>
            <li> I started using MyChelle vitamin C serum because it was recommended by a friend. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now and it is really smoothing out my skin and helps to reduce break outs. I&#x27;m really happy with the product and will definitely continue using it!</li>
            <li> I have LOVED this product for years.  It&#x27;s more expensive than I like, but certainly does the job.  I know mychelle has other products for this as well, but I use it for under eye circles.  It really seems to firm the skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product but the bottle needs to be redesigned. It is never full when I get it because it leaks. The pump doesn&#x27;t give the same amount every time and leaks around the top.</li>
            <li> Appears to be lightening dark spots and my face looks &#x27;fresher&#x27;.  I would recommend trying this product to see if it works for you</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t ever tried any other &amp;#34;serums&amp;#34; so I am not sure if they are all similar but the scent of this serum was a little too much for me.  It smelled like vitamins.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years now and love it. Received a new bottle yesterday and it was DARK BROWN in color. obviously very oxidized and not something i am about to put on my face. Very disappointed after waiting nearly two weeks for this product to turn up. Have had no problems in the past so maybe just a fluke but I&#x27;m not going to risk my skin. Probably buy from the store instead so at least i know its safe.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Ok so many complain about the amount of serum you get, people try to remember the c serum oxidizes so more is not better, also a little goes a long way, This line ( i bough 19 of the products_) is amazing and it has changed my face over night, texture, hydration, minimizing lines and contuor http://photographicarteditions.blogspot.com/2015/07/mychelle-skin-care-line-for-fabulous.html</li>
            <li> I buy products from mychelle, I am charged, but until now not sent this products and never reply to my emails and facebook messages, too bad, I will never buy mychelle products again.</li>
            <li> Had a funny odor and a bit greasy.  Would not use again</li>
            <li> Terrible allergic reaction!!  The color was already orange when I bought it from Nutters, but I didn&#x27;t know that was a problem until I did some research.  Used 2 times and on the third day my face and neck is covered in little bumps.  either I am allergic or the product was oxidized and unhealthy to put on my skin.  Either way, i will not be trying this one again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help even out sun-damaged/dehydrated/tired skin but noticed that it helps the most in just keeping the occasional blemish at bay.  My skin can&#x27;t tolerate OTC acne products very well--they are too strong, but if I use this serum on any emerging blemish, it will disappear within a day or two.  My skin tone and texture are better as well.  Not a miracle product, but it certainly does improve the overall appearance and health of my skin,</li>
            <li> This serum was recommended to me from a women in her late fifties.  Her skin looked great!  I found it on amazon for a good price and I am so glad I bought it.  My skin looks tighter and healthy.  I only use half of the amount recommended.  I have been using it for a couple of months.  It comes in a glass container which protects the serum.  I will continue to use this product and would highly recommend it to others!</li>
            <li> I can tell a big difference in the appearance of my skin since I&#x27;ve been using this.  I use it with other MyChelle products.  I LOVE THIS LINE OF PRODUCTS!</li>
            <li> I got this as part of the mychelle tester and this is the only vitamin c product that has ever gave me ACNE and an ORANGE spot on my face and I have fair skin. Don&#x27;t buy this product, use an actual vitamin c lotion because this serum cannot be trusted for regular use. I heard vitamin c oxidizes and turns skin orange when your in sunlight and I&#x27;m certain that&#x27;s what happened to me. I even had the mychelle sunscreen on and it was in a spot where I did not put enough sunscreen on so if you do buy this please avoid excessive sunlight and use sunscreen!</li>
            <li> This product line does what it claims.  I have searched for years for the right product line where I could use each step from a single brand, this is it.</li>
            <li> I have bought C serum from the dermatologist before so was a bit sceptical about buying a product over the counter. Yet, so far, it really seems to be working well. I can feel the slight sting which for me is a good sign that the vitamin c is potent and working.  I like how it spreads on.  I am thinking of trying other products by MyChelle</li>
