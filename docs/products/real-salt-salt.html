            <li>I have been able to use</li>
            <li>Love this salt--only one I use.&lt;br /&gt;Makes</li>
            <li>We love this salt in my house</li>
            <li>Tastes better as well as being better for you.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Everything OK.  </li>
            <li>A lot of health experts say unrefined salt is much better for you.  </li>
            <li>so I just ground it up more here at home in my Nutri-Bulet and love it.</li>
            <li>Pricey, but healthy.  </li>
            <li>our favorite table salt.</li>
            <li>Thank you!! :)</li>
            <li>Love this, it is great salt with many natural minerals in it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s flavor isn&#x27;t overwhelming, and it&#x27;s a good all-around cooking and table salt.</li>
            <li>My teeth always feel so smooth and clean after I brush!</li>
            <li>Now, yes I do believe that they took that process a bit too far and that the end product is not the most idea form of salt to use, far removed from the way it is found in nature, however it was and still is the best cheapest alternative to sea</li>
            <li>I actually have experienced first hand that washing the salt produces a better product because I did an experimental batch at home in my own kitchen this way.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice &amp; dry &amp; very free flowing.  </li>
            <li>It tastes great and as a bonus it is a healthy replacement for the old standard of table salt.</li>
            <li>It lasts awhile, and actually tastes good.</li>
            <li>Redmond Trading sea salt tastes good in food in much smaller amounts</li>
            <li>The one thing a person might want to know is this particular kind of Real Salt is finely ground.  </li>
            <li>I love this salt, it has so much more flavor than regular salt.</li>
            <li>This is such great salt and so much better for us than the regular table salt we used to eat.</li>
            <li>I love this salt, and I couldn&#x27;t find it in the place I live.</li>
            <li>Product arrived as expected and in good condition.</li>
            <li>The pouch keeps it fresh.</li>
            <li>I originally bought the Real Salt in disposable shakers from amazon but this packaging is no longer amiable for prime shipping</li>
            <li>Right?  </li>
            <li>If you want a cleaner pink salt (iron oxide) without sandy grit in it, Bolivian rose or Bolivian/Peruvian pink salt may be a good alternative to &#x27;Himalayan&#x27; (pakastani) salt.  </li>

            <li>Honestly I think redmond could produce a washed version of their salt with all the same soluble for much cheaper but</li>
            <li>Honestly I think redmond could produce a washed version of their salt with all the same soluble for much cheaper but</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I love the idea of Himalayan salt, but frankly prefer to know that American regulations and quality traditions are in place during salt harvest.  </li>
            <li>going of send back but is more of a hassle</li>
            <li>We use many different salts for eating and cooking.  </li>
            <li>Similar product in store cost a lot more.</li>
            <li>and I would be willing to pay the difference.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty backwards to think otherwise in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I can bet that when white salt first came to market, people were probably really pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s a real shame to have to say!  </li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s a real shame to have to say!  </li>
            <li>food taste better than regular salt.</li>
            <li>Not as crisp flavor as the Aztec Sea Salt, made from sea water.</li>
            <li>Have used it for years since driving through Utah and buying it the first time.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this sea salt when I was out in Utah.  </li>
            <li>Tastes like salt, only better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would be nice to have a Made in USA natural mineralized rock salt alternative to Morton and possibly radioactive modern ocean sea salt.  </li>
            <li>I like the idea of using a pure salt in my food</li>
            <li>Prefer the coarse grind rather than the fine grind however.</li>
            <li>This is real salt.  </li>
            <li>They really should.  </li>
            <li>the top layer of concentrated (translucent pink) brine</li>
            <li>What I produced from the &#x27;real salt&#x27; with my experiment was not a demineralized salt.  </li>
            <li>Like I said, I like what I produced and would really like if the redmond company would follow my lead on this.  </li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t trust sea salt anymore do to ocean pollution</li>
            <li>I have also been looking at a salt from Australia that I really like called Murray river salt.  </li>
            <li>I have also been looking at a salt from Australia that I really like called Murray river salt.  </li>
            <li>this salt is REAL</li>
            <li>Fast delivery&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is reasonably priced and packaged very well and convenient to get into.</li>
            <li>However the end result was a really nice product free of sandy grit with a slightly off white ever so peachy white color and an extremely mild gentle flavor.  </li>
            <li>- the flavor test is amazing and shows how it is different from the highly processed white stuff...</li>
            <li>This is the only salt we use; great flavor and far less sodium, all of the minerals left in ithe salt is fantastic plus.</li>
            <li>I have chosen to boycott products from nations ruled by islam with so many human rights abuses, oppression of women, barbaric practices, murder of christian, sex slavery</li>
            <li>I have chosen to boycott products from nations ruled by islam with so many human rights abuses, oppression of women, barbaric practices, murder of christian, sex slavery</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with this product and will likely order it again in the future.</li>
            <li>It was actually modern innovation and ingenuity that produced purified white table salt for the modern world in the first place.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for all the trace nutrients and because it is from the USA.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I tried the regular kind before and it caused me sharp nerve pain through my teeth.  </li>
            <li>It would be worth the extra cost</li>
            <li>Well worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>I ordered it online because I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere around where I live.</li>
            <li>The taste is fantastic and once you try it you will not want to go back to regular salt ever.</li>
            <li>Very pleased..it is somewhat gritty being real salt out of the earth...</li>
            <li>It was a washed version that still contains all the soluble minerals found in the original raw material, and actually I would bet my purified version of the salt contains the mineral spectrum that closely matches that found within the original ancient sea from which this salt originated as described on the redmond website.  </li>
            <li>If i did it again I would use a different evaporating pan with a higher quality brand of silicone because I think the silicone molds released some flavor into the salt</li>
            <li>A lot of brands that are the same old thing are claiming to be sea salt and charging 3 times as much!</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is all natural and has the natural minerals in it and no iodine.</li>
            <li>But you may FEEL it grinding on your teeth if your have sensitive teeth like I do.  </li>
            <li>and then added just enough more boiling water back into the pyrex cup to dissolve any remaining salt until all the salt material appeared dissolved basically repeating the above process twice without adding any extra salt and waiting for the sediment to settle out.  </li>
            <li>WHETHER YOU HAVE SENSITIVE TEETH OR NOT -- I DO NOT RECOMMEND; I REPEAT.</li>
            <li>WHETHER YOU HAVE SENSITIVE TEETH OR NOT -- I DO NOT RECOMMEND; I REPEAT.</li>
            <li>Much healthier than the processed white stuff.</li>
            <li>Real Salt or Himalayan Salt are the only salt one should buy!</li>
            <li>and I am trying to stop buying all products made with it; think Fukushima cesium found in kelp off the coast of California and the big sea salt plant off San Francisco bay supplying sea salt to put on all your organic foods with the new sea salt craze.  </li>

            <li>It produced a really soft, mild tasting off white, ever so slightly pinkish white salt with a very soft crystal</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a little sandy residue, but I don&#x27;t mind it because I like the taste so much more than other unrefined salts I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and the only Redmond salt</li>
            <li>and I was told apparently they have no plans to make any changes in the way they do things.  </li>
            <li>Mild salt that enhances food with just using small amounts.</li>
            <li>I originally found this at Target, but after not having it I was forced to find it here.</li>
            <li>I would rather have refined white salt than any natural salt that has SAND or GRIT mixed into it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li>This is an American made natural mineral salt and this company cannot even have the human decency to cleanse it of sand?  </li>
            <li>This is an American made natural mineral salt and this company cannot even have the human decency to cleanse it of sand?  </li>
            <li>I really wish it had the iodine content like the other salts intended for culinary use.</li>
            <li>is very abrasive and could probably wear down a persons tooth enamel over time.  </li>
            <li>is the powder salt, but even that still has the grit; it&#x27;s just ground down much finer.  </li>
            <li>I just hope they haven&#x27;t been &amp;#34;grandfathered&amp;#34; in under pre-existing laws from half a century ago which may exempt them from complying with modern practices and standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I think that&#x27;s a real shame to have to say!  </li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s a real shame to have to say!  </li>
            <li> food taste better than regular salt.</li>
            <li> Not as crisp flavor as the Aztec Sea Salt, made from sea water.</li>
            <li> Have used it for years since driving through Utah and buying it the first time.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this sea salt when I was out in Utah.  </li>
            <li> Tastes like salt, only better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It would be nice to have a Made in USA natural mineralized rock salt alternative to Morton and possibly radioactive modern ocean sea salt.  </li>
            <li> I like the idea of using a pure salt in my food</li>
            <li> Prefer the coarse grind rather than the fine grind however.</li>
            <li> This is real salt.  </li>
            <li> They really should.  </li>
            <li> the top layer of concentrated (translucent pink) brine</li>
            <li> What I produced from the &#x27;real salt&#x27; with my experiment was not a demineralized salt.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, I like what I produced and would really like if the redmond company would follow my lead on this.  </li>
            <li> really don&#x27;t trust sea salt anymore do to ocean pollution</li>
            <li> I have also been looking at a salt from Australia that I really like called Murray river salt.  </li>
            <li> I have also been looking at a salt from Australia that I really like called Murray river salt.  </li>
            <li> this salt is REAL</li>
            <li> Fast delivery&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is reasonably priced and packaged very well and convenient to get into.</li>
            <li> However the end result was a really nice product free of sandy grit with a slightly off white ever so peachy white color and an extremely mild gentle flavor.  </li>
            <li> - the flavor test is amazing and shows how it is different from the highly processed white stuff...</li>
            <li> This is the only salt we use; great flavor and far less sodium, all of the minerals left in ithe salt is fantastic plus.</li>
            <li> I have chosen to boycott products from nations ruled by islam with so many human rights abuses, oppression of women, barbaric practices, murder of christian, sex slavery</li>
            <li> I have chosen to boycott products from nations ruled by islam with so many human rights abuses, oppression of women, barbaric practices, murder of christian, sex slavery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with this product and will likely order it again in the future.</li>
            <li> It was actually modern innovation and ingenuity that produced purified white table salt for the modern world in the first place.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for all the trace nutrients and because it is from the USA.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I tried the regular kind before and it caused me sharp nerve pain through my teeth.  </li>
            <li> It would be worth the extra cost</li>
            <li> Well worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> I ordered it online because I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere around where I live.</li>
            <li> The taste is fantastic and once you try it you will not want to go back to regular salt ever.</li>
            <li> Very pleased..it is somewhat gritty being real salt out of the earth...</li>
            <li> It was a washed version that still contains all the soluble minerals found in the original raw material, and actually I would bet my purified version of the salt contains the mineral spectrum that closely matches that found within the original ancient sea from which this salt originated as described on the redmond website.  </li>
            <li> If i did it again I would use a different evaporating pan with a higher quality brand of silicone because I think the silicone molds released some flavor into the salt</li>
            <li> A lot of brands that are the same old thing are claiming to be sea salt and charging 3 times as much!</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is all natural and has the natural minerals in it and no iodine.</li>
            <li> But you may FEEL it grinding on your teeth if your have sensitive teeth like I do.  </li>
            <li> and then added just enough more boiling water back into the pyrex cup to dissolve any remaining salt until all the salt material appeared dissolved basically repeating the above process twice without adding any extra salt and waiting for the sediment to settle out.  </li>
            <li> WHETHER YOU HAVE SENSITIVE TEETH OR NOT -- I DO NOT RECOMMEND; I REPEAT.</li>
            <li> WHETHER YOU HAVE SENSITIVE TEETH OR NOT -- I DO NOT RECOMMEND; I REPEAT.</li>
            <li> Much healthier than the processed white stuff.</li>
            <li> Real Salt or Himalayan Salt are the only salt one should buy!</li>
            <li> and I am trying to stop buying all products made with it; think Fukushima cesium found in kelp off the coast of California and the big sea salt plant off San Francisco bay supplying sea salt to put on all your organic foods with the new sea salt craze.  </li>

            <li> It produced a really soft, mild tasting off white, ever so slightly pinkish white salt with a very soft crystal</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little sandy residue, but I don&#x27;t mind it because I like the taste so much more than other unrefined salts I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and the only Redmond salt</li>
            <li> and I was told apparently they have no plans to make any changes in the way they do things.  </li>
            <li> Mild salt that enhances food with just using small amounts.</li>
            <li> I originally found this at Target, but after not having it I was forced to find it here.</li>
            <li> I would rather have refined white salt than any natural salt that has SAND or GRIT mixed into it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li> This is an American made natural mineral salt and this company cannot even have the human decency to cleanse it of sand?  </li>
            <li> This is an American made natural mineral salt and this company cannot even have the human decency to cleanse it of sand?  </li>
            <li> I really wish it had the iodine content like the other salts intended for culinary use.</li>
            <li> is very abrasive and could probably wear down a persons tooth enamel over time.  </li>
            <li> is the powder salt, but even that still has the grit; it&#x27;s just ground down much finer.  </li>
            <li> I just hope they haven&#x27;t been &amp;#34;grandfathered&amp;#34; in under pre-existing laws from half a century ago which may exempt them from complying with modern practices and standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> At least it&#x27;s pure.  </li>
            <li> This salt contains a small percentage of naturally occurring sand and or rocky grit mixed into it.  </li>
            <li> Have been using it for a long time.  </li>
            <li> They sell other forms, though, like coarse, for example.</li>
            <li> Maybe others think I&#x27;m crazy, but I believe this salt tastes better than other salts I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Is it not essentially the distilled down (evaporated) version of ocean water?  </li>
            <li> Uploaded pictures of it, those tiny little specks DO NOT dissolve in water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All I can say is no thanks.  </li>
            <li> All I can say is no thanks.  </li>
            <li> progressed from there to the pink himalayan salt...</li>

            <li> I would never go back to using ordinary table salt.  </li>
            <li> I dissolved a portion of the salt in a 2 cup pyrex glass measuring cup with boiling water to make a brine of the highest concentration possible until no more salt would dissolve.  </li>
            <li> but it is extremely time consuming.  </li>
            <li> Does it contain minerals other than sodium chloride?  </li>
            <li> There really is no logical reason to be eating salt with dirt and sand in it.  </li>
            <li> I have been taking baby steps in other food areas to change up food at our house.  </li>
            <li> We use this salt on our grass feed beef and you don&#x27;t need any other seasoning.</li>
            <li> We are very careful about the amount of salt we consume.  </li>
            <li> They would not have to bake it at 2000 degrees or remove ALL the minerals like the conventional companies</li>
            <li> - it makes every other salt seem bland.</li>
            <li> At least not until maybe they get enough complaints from customers calling into the FDA to perhaps shut down their &amp;#34;food grade&amp;#34;</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this salt, and I couldn&#x27;t find it in the place I live. The price was great and it was Prime shipping.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love this salt!  I would never go back to using ordinary table salt.  Great price and service from Amazon, too.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as expected and in good condition.</li>
            <li> We started using this salt when bleached salt started burning our mouths. We like the taste, and it doesn&#x27;t overwhelm what it&#x27;s used on.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of Himalayan salt, but frankly prefer to know that American regulations and quality traditions are in place during salt harvest.  So this is a great solution for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying the Redmond&#x27;s salt for years now.  It really is the best tasting salt I&#x27;ve ever had - it makes every other salt seem bland.</li>
            <li> Love this Salt and it&#x27;s good for you!  Minerals that you can&#x27;t get from ordinary salt.  A great price also.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best tasting salt I ever had the only thing I wish it had was iodine then it would be really great</li>
            <li> I like the idea of using a pure salt in my food and I&#x27;ve used this salt for several years now. I keep the small shaker on hand and refill it with this bag. It&#x27;s flavor isn&#x27;t overwhelming, and it&#x27;s a good all-around cooking and table salt. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product with a great taste. I like this salt and the price here is great. I originally found this at Target, but after not having it I was forced to find it here.</li>
            <li> Uploaded pictures of it, those tiny little specks DO NOT dissolve in water.&lt;br /&gt;IF you like it grinding dirt with your teeth when you are chewing your food then by all means buy this.....even though is not as bad as I first thought......it is good tasting though.&lt;br /&gt;Was going of send back but is more of a hassle</li>
            <li> I had been looking for this sea salt at the health food stores but could not find this size bag. You had it and I wanted it!</li>
            <li> This salt tastes great and is super healthy.  It was recommended by my chiropractor and I use it in every dish.  Highly recommended for all the trace nutrients and because it is from the USA.</li>
            <li> I love this salt and again was unable to locate any in my town.  As usual I went to Amazon and they had it.  I like the fact that it is all natural and has the natural minerals in it and no iodine.</li>
            <li> This salt is excellent!!!</li>
            <li> This is real salt.  We use many different salts for eating and cooking.  This one is excellent and we use it for both eating and cooking.</li>
            <li> Excellent product,  worth every penny. Will buy again and I have already recommended it to my friends. Similar product in store cost a lot more.</li>
            <li> The only salt I buy, loaded with minerals, this is the best!</li>
            <li> I love this salt.  Have been using it for a long time.  My holistic contact person recommended it because it is healthy for you.</li>
            <li> HAVE USED THIS SALT FOR YEARS</li>
            <li> This salt contains a small percentage of naturally occurring sand and or rocky grit mixed into it.  I think this issue must be very bad for the companies public relations department.  I would rather have refined white salt than any natural salt that has SAND or GRIT mixed into it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Yes I have tried the product but no, I did not buy it through amazon.  However I feel it is my duty to offer up my opinion as a public service to advise people against using this salt based on my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You obviously cannot taste the sand.  But you may FEEL it grinding on your teeth if your have sensitive teeth like I do.  Even if it doesn&#x27;t break a tooth, silica (sand, granite, what have you...) is very abrasive and could probably wear down a persons tooth enamel over time.  I have sensitive teeth and the only Redmond salt I have been able to use is the powder salt, but even that still has the grit; it&#x27;s just ground down much finer.  I tried the regular kind before and it caused me sharp nerve pain through my teeth.  This stuff has to be pulverized into a powder order to obliterate the sand particles if its not going to be mechanically removed.  I think the company really should mechanically process this to remove the insoluble heavy matter, but I&#x27;ve already called them on this issue and I was told apparently they have no plans to make any changes in the way they do things.  As a result, I am thinking of filing a complaint with the FDA over this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think what would make a a safer, cleaner version of their salt would be to get the sediment and insoluble matter removed via washing, precipitation, and re-crystallization.  They really should.  They would not have to bake it at 2000 degrees or remove ALL the minerals like the conventional companies do, but they could and should at least remove the grit.  It would be worth the extra cost and I would be willing to pay the difference.  I actually have experienced first hand that washing the salt produces a better product because I did an experimental batch at home in my own kitchen this way.  It produced a really soft, mild tasting off white, ever so slightly pinkish white salt with a very soft crystal structure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s how I did it:  I dissolved a portion of the salt in a 2 cup pyrex glass measuring cup with boiling water to make a brine of the highest concentration possible until no more salt would dissolve.  Have to stir it well for awhile to achieve this.  Next I left it alone for a while (30 minutes) to allow for the insoluble materials to settle out.  Then I poured off into a glass mason jar the top layer of concentrated (translucent pink) brine and then added just enough more boiling water back into the pyrex cup to dissolve any remaining salt until all the salt material appeared dissolved basically repeating the above process twice without adding any extra salt and waiting for the sediment to settle out.  After all the translucent brine was poured off into the mason jar, I transferred it into several 1.5 inch deep silicone baking cups into the oven to evaporate at betwenn 220 - 300 degrees.  I experimented with the temperature.  The lower the temp the longer it takes to evaporate.  It took over two hours (actually closer to three or four hours - I forget) to fully evaporate the water out and recrystallize the salt.  However the end result was a really nice product free of sandy grit with a slightly off white ever so peachy white color and an extremely mild gentle flavor.  I have actually made a couple batches but it is extremely time consuming.  If i did it again I would use a different evaporating pan with a higher quality brand of silicone because I think the silicone molds released some flavor into the salt but I digress.  The redmond company, if they wanted to could produce any variation of salts based on this model that I used without removing all the minerals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider this: What is sea salt?  Is it not essentially the distilled down (evaporated) version of ocean water?  Does it contain minerals other than sodium chloride?  Of course it does.  But what does sea salt not have?  Answer: undissolved solids and iron oxide (dirt, rock, silt, sand, soil).  What I produced from the &#x27;real salt&#x27; with my experiment was not a demineralized salt.  It was a washed version that still contains all the soluble minerals found in the original raw material, and actually I would bet my purified version of the salt contains the mineral spectrum that closely matches that found within the original ancient sea from which this salt originated as described on the redmond website.  However what is removed is the dirt, sand, etc.  Like I said, I like what I produced and would really like if the redmond company would follow my lead on this.  But, my guess is that they will probably not because they are too stubborn and &amp;#34;if it ain&#x27;t broke, why fix it?&amp;#34;  Right?  Yeah, until somebody can prove that their salt broke their tooth and sues them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice to have a Made in USA natural mineralized rock salt alternative to Morton and possibly radioactive modern ocean sea salt.  I think it would make a lot of people happy and improve the redmond product integrity by leaps and bounds as I have discovered.  It&#x27;s pretty backwards to think otherwise in my opinion.  We aren&#x27;t living in the 1800&#x27;s anymore, folks... There really is no logical reason to be eating salt with dirt and sand in it.  It was actually modern innovation and ingenuity that produced purified white table salt for the modern world in the first place.  I can bet that when white salt first came to market, people were probably really pleased with it.  At least it&#x27;s pure.  Now, yes I do believe that they took that process a bit too far and that the end product is not the most idea form of salt to use, far removed from the way it is found in nature, however it was and still is the best cheapest alternative to sea salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t trust sea salt anymore do to ocean pollution and I am trying to stop buying all products made with it; think Fukushima cesium found in kelp off the coast of California and the big sea salt plant off San Francisco bay supplying sea salt to put on all your organic foods with the new sea salt craze.  All I can say is no thanks.  In the mean time, I guess that something like Himalayan is a far safer bet.  Himalayan salt does not have sand and grit in it which can risk cracking the edge of a tooth.  But honestly I won&#x27;t buy it because it is produced in a muslim majority nation.  I have chosen to boycott products from nations ruled by islam with so many human rights abuses, oppression of women, barbaric practices, murder of christian, sex slavery etc.  No can do.  If you want a cleaner pink salt (iron oxide) without sandy grit in it, Bolivian rose or Bolivian/Peruvian pink salt may be a good alternative to &#x27;Himalayan&#x27; (pakastani) salt.  I have also been looking at a salt from Australia that I really like called Murray river salt.  It&#x27;s insanely expensive but it&#x27;s not made from ocean water.  Honestly I think redmond could produce a washed version of their salt with all the same soluble for much cheaper but that is something they just don&#x27;t want to do.  At least not until maybe they get enough complaints from customers calling into the FDA to perhaps shut down their &amp;#34;food grade&amp;#34; salt division.  I just hope they haven&#x27;t been &amp;#34;grandfathered&amp;#34; in under pre-existing laws from half a century ago which may exempt them from complying with modern practices and standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this salt to anyone unless you plan to wash and recrystallize it yourself as I have described.  I think that&#x27;s a real shame to have to say!  This is an American made natural mineral salt and this company cannot even have the human decency to cleanse it of sand?  Frankly I think that is pathetic and shameful.  WHETHER YOU HAVE SENSITIVE TEETH OR NOT -- I DO NOT RECOMMEND; I REPEAT. I RECOMMEND THIS SALT!!!  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!rust sea salt anymore do to ocean pollution and I am trying to stop buying all products made with it; think Fukushima cesium found in kelp off the coast of California and the big sea salt plant off San Francisco bay supplying sea salt to put on all your organic foods with the new sea salt craze.

            <li> Love this salt--only one I use.&lt;br /&gt;Makes food taste better than regular salt.</li>
            <li> We love this salt in my house</li>
            <li> I really wish it had the iodine content like the other salts intended for culinary use. The taste is fantastic and once you try it you will not want to go back to regular salt ever.</li>
            <li> Tastes better as well as being better for you. Well worth the extra cost. Prefer the coarse grind rather than the fine grind however.</li>
            <li> This is THE only sea salt I will buy.</li>
            <li> it has a some what dirt flavor.  Not as crisp flavor as the Aztec Sea Salt, made from sea water.</li>
            <li> Love this, it is great salt with many natural minerals in it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> This salt is wonderful!  Much healthier than the processed white stuff.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and the product is as advertised.  thank you.</li>
            <li> best salt available. been using this for 5 years.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than buying the separate containers.  very easy to refill my dispenser.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because it best fits the feeling I have, and I also tend to be too generous</li>
            <li> This is the best salt on the market!  I&#x27;ve been using it for years for everyday cooking, seasoning and baking.  It tastes great and as a bonus it is a healthy replacement for the old standard of table salt.</li>
            <li> Mild salt that enhances food with just using small amounts. Have used it for years since driving through Utah and buying it the first time.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this sea salt when I was out in Utah.  I like it because it has no additives or chemicals.  It enhances the favor of the food you put it on.  I ordered it online because I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere around where I live.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It lasts awhile, and actually tastes good. I have a problem with my sodium getting low because I can&#x27;t stand the taste of salt, well this stuff I can and add it to everything.</li>
            <li> Everything OK.  Prices vary wildly, so always shop carefully and buy the cheapest.  It takes some effort to calculate the comparable price per.</li>
            <li> I have been using this unrefined salt for quite some time every since I discovered it on amazon.  A lot of health experts say unrefined salt is much better for you.  I originally bought the Real Salt in disposable shakers from amazon but this packaging is no longer amiable for prime shipping so I have switch to these larger packages.  The salt tastes great and its supposed to be healthier.</li>
            <li> Real Salt or Himalayan Salt are the only salt one should buy!</li>
            <li> No longer use store bought table salt so I started using sea salt...progressed from there to the pink himalayan salt...and so thought Id try this.  Very pleased..it is somewhat gritty being real salt out of the earth...so I just ground it up more here at home in my Nutri-Bulet and love it.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, great product!</li>
            <li> prompt delivery, good value</li>
            <li> Great tasting salt. Have purchased several times. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> this salt is REAL - the flavor test is amazing and shows how it is different from the highly processed white stuff...plus, it&#x27;s from the US (not shipped from overseas)</li>
            <li> I like this salt because it is &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;!  It takes great and there are no additives.  It is mined from  the AMERICAN interior!  The one thing a person might want to know is this particular kind of Real Salt is finely ground.  It&#x27;s hard to see when you are using it.  They sell other forms, though, like coarse, for example.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over ten years.  We are very careful about the amount of salt we consume.  Redmond Trading sea salt tastes good in food in much smaller amounts so I cook with it and never add salt at the table.</li>
            <li> Maybe others think I&#x27;m crazy, but I believe this salt tastes better than other salts I&#x27;ve used.  One of the things I like about it, is the containers it comes in.  It&#x27;s nice &amp; dry &amp; very free flowing.  There&#x27;s a little sandy residue, but I don&#x27;t mind it because I like the taste so much more than other unrefined salts I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> When you get into eating healthier, you run into all sorts of paths this way and that.  It can be mind boggling.  My mantra - baby steps.  I have been taking baby steps in other food areas to change up food at our house.  I finally sprung for this.  Pricey, but healthy.  You have to do the research to find out why.  Read, read, read.</li>
            <li> This is the only salt we use; great flavor and far less sodium, all of the minerals left in ithe salt is fantastic plus.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST SALT IN THE WORLD.  HONESTLY, THE FLAVOR IT ADDS TO FOOD IS AMAZING.  DOESN&#x27;T COME CLOSE TO COMPARING WITH TABLE SALT.  VENDOR DID A GREAT JOB SHIPPPING ITEM WILL ORDER FROM AGAIN.  THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> This stuff is delicious! A nice unrefined salt that you can literally see the trace minerals in it. You will improve every dish with this salt!</li>
            <li> -Excellent product...our favorite table salt. Order was received in a timely manner. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is such great salt and so much better for us than the regular table salt we used to eat.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery&lt;br /&gt;As described</li>
            <li> This is an excellent natural salt that has not been chemically treated or changed. It is reasonably priced and packaged very well and convenient to get into. The pouch keeps it fresh. I&#x27;m satisfied with this product and will likely order it again in the future.</li>
            <li> Use this salt every day -- well almost every day.  Great flavor with the minerals in it.</li>
            <li> I used this salt as an ingredient in homemade remineralizing toothpaste. My teeth always feel so smooth and clean after I brush! Product arrived on time and in good condition. Thank you!! :)</li>
            <li> Tastes like salt, only better. Contains the 60 industrial minerals that are stripped away (to be sold) from table salt. In my opinion (gotta watch that medical advice thing!) you can normalize your blood pressure and strengthen your bones by using this all the time. I carry a small shaker in my purse, so I can use it at restaurants. A lot of brands that are the same old thing are claiming to be sea salt and charging 3 times as much! Look for the colored specks.</li>
            <li> I love this salt, it has so much more flavor than regular salt. We use this salt on our grass feed beef and you don&#x27;t need any other seasoning.</li>
