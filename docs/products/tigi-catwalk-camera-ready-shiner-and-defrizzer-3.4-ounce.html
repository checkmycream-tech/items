            <li>I hope they will beginning making this again and being available in the stores.</li>
            <li>rich and conditioned....best word for it is &#x27;yummy.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>Have used this product before and the one I received was not the original.</li>
            <li>I discovered the Camera Ready product at my hairdressers but found a better price for it on Amazon.  </li>

            <li>I have used this product in the past and loved it.</li>
            <li>Such a great product, I hunted it down in CA.  </li>
            <li>Camera Ready.</li>
            <li>I used to really like this because it smells</li>
            <li>It has a really fowl smell.  </li>
            <li>An occasional treatment like this is okay but don&#x27;t do it frequently.</li>
            <li>but it stunk to high heaven.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and have trouble finding it in the store.</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t know if this was very old product or a knock off,  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>If your hair is wet with Camera Ready spray (or any liquid) and you expose it to a hot curling iron, you risk damaging your hair.  </li>
            <li>The one I received apparently is old.  </li>
            <li>After drying my hair completely (either air dry or blow dry), I lightly spritz this all over my hair and (using the LOW setting) gently use my round styling brush and blow dryer to style my hair.  </li>
            <li>The one I recently purchased was cloudy instead of clear.</li>
            <li>The stuff was either old or was substitued with vinegar or something else entirely.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love Camera Ready. It&#x27;s a great product. Unfortunatly, I was sent a product that was fake! I will not order anything from this seller again!</li>
            <li> This is a great product but not in the stores no longer.</li>
            <li> It was nothing like I was used to. I am very disappointed my recommendation is do not buy.</li>
            <li> I adore this product. I have long straight hair and this product does not weigh it down. I have fine hair, but  lots of it. I called the manufacturer and it is discontinued. I am so bummed</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shine without weighing it down.  Perfect before or after straight iron.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. I love being able to use it on wet or dry hair to transform dry/damage/frizzy/coarse hair into silky smooth hair. You simply cannot just spray it and expect it to work. I work the product into hair pulling it through the strands. It is worth it to me for the result it gives making hair manageable. I also use it as a flat iron protection spray.</li>
            <li> I used to really like this because it smells great- and then I found a comparable sebastian product I enjoy more.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and loved it.  The one I received apparently is old.  It has a really fowl smell.  I will not be using it!!</li>
            <li> This product was clearly past it&#x27;s prime - the scent was totally off from what it should be. The item could not be returned and I wasn&#x27;t offered a refund for the defective product.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry and damaged-looking hair (even though it isn&#x27;t damaged).  No amount of leave-in conditioner or VO5 has helped.  I discovered the Camera Ready product at my hairdressers but found a better price for it on Amazon.  After drying my hair completely (either air dry or blow dry), I lightly spritz this all over my hair and (using the LOW setting) gently use my round styling brush and blow dryer to style my hair.  Wow!  What a difference.  Now my hair looks like the hair in hair-product commercials...rich and conditioned....best word for it is &#x27;yummy.&#x27;  I love this spray!  PS-- If you&#x27;re going to use a curling iron, go easy.  If your hair is wet with Camera Ready spray (or any liquid) and you expose it to a hot curling iron, you risk damaging your hair.  An occasional treatment like this is okay but don&#x27;t do it frequently.</li>
            <li> Have used this product before and the one I received was not the original. It stinks and I donot even want to try it. What a waste. Amazon should know better before selling such fake outs. I am a regular buyer at Amazon, I donot want such experiences affecting buying from Amazon. I cannot return/refund the amount on the product as well.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and loved it. The one I recently purchased was cloudy instead of clear.It also smelled like cheap rubbing alcohol instead of candy like I remember.I believe the seller sold me a product that had sat on the shelf or in the heat. I will not buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to spray on wet hair leaving a nice shine without a product build up.</li>
            <li> This is a product that TIGI had discontinued and I couldn&#x27;t find anymore.  I  had used it all the time and loved it.  Needless to say I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon.  However, I don&#x27;t know if this was very old product or a knock off,  but it stunk to high heaven.  I had to toss it.  Bummer.</li>
            <li> It smell very bad! I believe this product is not the real one is fake! I&#x27;m very disappointed. The real one smell so good and leave my hair very soft .</li>
            <li> Love this! My hair is &amp;#34;less&amp;#34; frizzy in this Texas heat. It&#x27;s a daily staple in my hair routine! Def recommend!</li>
            <li> It was awful. I&#x27;ve always gotten this from my stylist and I should&#x27;ve did so this time. Just thought it would be quicker to order online. The stuff was either old or was substitued with vinegar or something else entirely.  It should have a good sweet smell to it and this was plain nasty. People need to check their products before they sell. Nothing like literally dumping money down the drain.</li>
            <li> great product.  Found it in Florida first.  Such a great product, I hunted it down in CA.  Love it. Perfect for hair that frizzes and needs to stay straight and un-frizzed</li>
            <li> Love this product, smells great, makes the hair shine and helps prevent dryness for damaged hair.  Unfortunately TIGI discontinued it.  They replaced it with an aerosol which I don&#x27;t like, bad for the environment and you breath more in.</li>
            <li> Love love love!i wish Catwalk would bring it back.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have trouble finding it in the store. I use it daily after my regular spray for just a bit of shine.  It is never oily.  I hope they will beginning making this again and being available in the stores.</li>
            <li> This product is hard to find in this area.  I like the way it works on my hair so will continue ordering it as long as it&#x27;s available.&lt;br /&gt;No problem with it and it&#x27;s the same as what was used on me in a beauty shop.</li>
