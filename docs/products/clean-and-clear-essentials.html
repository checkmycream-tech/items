            <li>This face wash is great for either situation.  </li>
            <li>I saw this on Amazon selling in two packs with great reviews, so I tried the two pack....</li>
            <li>I have used this for over a year now and it works great.</li>
            <li>The price is great as well.</li>
            <li>A good face wash without a ton of smells.</li>
            <li>My daughter was using Mary Kay &amp;#34;Creamy Cleanser Formula 2&amp;#34; for cleaning her face at night, and loved it.</li>
            <li>I think I prefer the Olay Foaming Face wash for the scent but both are really good products.</li>
            <li>It is a good value and we recommend it.</li>
            <li>These are good.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried before, It&#x27;s so mild and good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years and love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product !</li>
            <li>Brightens skin nicely.</li>
            <li>I bought the package so they can have their own bottle each.  </li>
            <li>I tried this on my own and haven&#x27;t used anything else for years.  </li>
            <li>it makes good foam but comes out as a liquid, which is better value.</li>
            <li>A very nice face cleaner with a light smell to it.</li>
            <li>It washes off very easily and doesn&#x27;t cause any problems to my skin.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I get tons more oily spots and breakouts.</li>
            <li>I tried dermatologist prescribed and recommended OTC products, many of which aggravated instead of helping.  </li>
            <li>People asked me what I did since my skin looked so much better and were amazed that one of the most inexpensive OTC products worked this well.  </li>
            <li>I use this daily and it is perfect for my skin.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I love it for that reason, and will keep using it.</li>
            <li>For the price, this is my favorite face wash.  </li>
            <li>I prefer my cosmetics unscented, so I don&#x27;t think the fragrance would bother most people.</li>
            <li>and we love it.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly in the shower but also at the sink.</li>
            <li>I love the scent, very fresh and clean, and the texture is nice too.</li>
            <li>Amazons price is very good compared to local retailers.</li>
            <li>I bought this cleanser because I thought it would be free of scents and too many chemicals.</li>
            <li>It is also great for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It actually has a very pleasant amount of foam and seems to clean well.</li>
            <li>I love that this cleanser smells nice and it works very well, just like Paula Begoun writes in her review of this product.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t foam easily.</li>
            <li>I have always liked this face wash, it makes me clean my face and feel fresh without breaking out.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 5 years now, and everytime I try a new product, its not as good as this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is now my favorite nighttime cleanser because it&#x27;s gentle, yet does an amazing job of getting my face clean and makeup-free at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I use it in-between my classes since I like to do some cardio with my long break, works great, removes all the oil and grease you somehow accumulate on your face :)</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;ti is worthy to re-buying one!</li>
            <li>I now have sweet looking skin because my skin is finally clean, something not even soap could do for me!</li>
            <li>She is 13 and said this is an amazing product, she wants to keep using it.</li>
            <li>This is such a great product.</li>
            <li>I am really happy I found this product since I can&#x27;t seem to find it at the local drug store.</li>
            <li>I am constantly reordering because it is so great.</li>
            <li>This works great for a basic face wash.  </li>
            <li>Clean and clear&#x27;s products seem to be just as good as the name brands (which i have tried).</li>
            <li>I love the clean and clear - it&#x27;s great for my sensitive over age 50 skin!  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t quite foam as much as I want it too, and the top of the pump breaks off easily.</li>
            <li>does its job which is to clean the face and neck twice</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my face feel clean at all.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate how there aren&#x27;t fruity gimmicks or scrubbing pads or acrid mint/citrus/tea tree beads that are supposed to &#x27;explode refreshingly&#x27; on my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice smelling and lightweight, just didn&#x27;t clear my acne.</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t dry my face off, I leaves my face feeling clean and soft, it&#x27;s great!!!</li>
            <li>(more watery) and really doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34; at all.</li>
            <li>This product is the holy grail for me, after searching endlessly for a product that would clean well and not irritate the skin I came to the conclusion that this is pretty much the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>You have to use more of it and, frankly, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be any more gentle than the normal version.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;this is a great product as a gentle, thorough facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>I purchased this even though I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, and it still does a great job keeping my face clear and balancing the oils.</li>
            <li>But when we ran out, we didn&#x27;t have it in the budget to get more at the time, so we tried Clean &amp; Clear (for 1/3 the price!)</li>
            <li>The product does not dry out my skin either which is nice.  </li>
            <li>some more points: I also like the fact that this product foams up easily in the hands, despite what people say about it not foaming enough it does quite well and has no scent.</li>
            <li>Heck it was worth the money.</li>
            <li>She has been using Clean &amp; Clear for years and the grocery store would not always have this one available.</li>
            <li>It really does leave your skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li>I have been using clean &amp; clear face wash for a few years and absolutely love it, this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li>Love this face wash and Amazon has it for a better price than any local store near me.</li>
            <li>This cleanser works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Maybe all of the reviews are based on the fact that this is the only one they have ever tried and they dispense a lot more.</li>
            <li>first - glorious.</li>
            <li>The sensitive skin version of Clean &amp; Clear Foaming Facial Cleanser is perfectly OK in most respects, but  doesn&#x27;t work as well as the normal version insofar as it is thinner</li>
            <li>fragrance is amazing, very woody and notes of crushed leaves.&lt;br /&gt;Clean residue after cleaning with water.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used clean and clear.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li>i have super sensitive skin-</li>
            <li>This is the first time I purchased this particular brand.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry it out and my face feels fresh and clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>Firstly, thanks Ross for your skin care review.</li>
            <li>It leaves face feeling clean but not dry.</li>
            <li>This one does neither because it&#x27;s so gentle.</li>
            <li>Nor has this ever really foamed for me.  </li>
            <li>I think if you have skin on the oily side, this may work very well for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than being a bit drying, it also takes a lot if this stuff to work.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive,reactive and intolerant skin&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works very well on my skin.</li>
            <li>Simple face cleaner, almost-fragrance free and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>No adverse reactions, and my pores began to clean up nicely after only a few weeks.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t love is the fragrance, it&#x27;s really flowery and a little strong for my taste.</li>
            <li>Seems to remove my long wear foundation just fine.</li>
            <li>I really like that this stuff is mild and gentle, but also totally cleans off any makeup that I&#x27;m wearing, even waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>Not too harsh, no crazy scent, and easy to use twice a day.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Long time product in this house used by the missus, and I&#x27;ve always been happy with the person behind the face that uses clean and clear.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>2x/day (Clinique Dramatically Different at night, Cetaphil Dermacontrol SPF 30 in the day), and my skin has been awesome--not too oily, not too dry, and best of all, very little acne!</li>
            <li>I wish it did lather a little more since it is labeled as a foaming cleanser</li>
            <li>Or you could use the &#x27;Clean &amp; Clear morning burst facial cleanser&#x27; in the morning and this at night.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it to help clear up acne (yet) but does clean your face properly.</li>
            <li>My wife and I have been using the regular medicated (orange) Clean &amp; Clear for years</li>
            <li>This works for my sensitive oily/dry/combo skin without drying out too much.</li>
            <li>I do alright with the normal version and will be returning to that when this is used up.</li>
            <li>My skin sort of normal</li>
            <li>If you have normal skin, buy this, if not try it.</li>
            <li>If you find the normal (orange colored) version too harsh and don&#x27;t mind the fact that the sensitive skin cleanser doesn&#x27;t foam up at all when you use it, this may be worthwhile.  </li>
            <li>Has too much fragrance which surprised me, though it hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation so far.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that you don&#x27;t even need a full pump to get the foam that you need to clean just your face so less waste, and just one bottle could last you for months easily.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Most likely won&#x27;t purchase again due to that.</li>
            <li>My wife uses this product because the ingredient list is better than other facial cleansers.</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t really see why there needs to be Blue 2 and Red 40 in an oil free facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>soap is very hard to foam, which is supposed to be a good thing because the cleaner would not dry out your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It removes the most stubborn mascara I have ever owned (it&#x27;s hard to wash off).</li>
            <li>Then for about 6 weeks everything was crystal clear.</li>
            <li>I prefer face washes which have a scrubbing action.</li>
            <li>I have so far found it satisfactory and would probably buy it at the price I paid 6.75 for two  8 ounce</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised on how it worked.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps I&#x27;m not sufficiently sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and after using this cleanser it caused me to have a severe allergic reaction and caused me to break out severely</li>
            <li>This works very well as a facial cleanser, removing dirt and excess oil while leaving you with some of the nutrients on your skin you need.</li>
            <li>I have to use twice as much as I did for the regular, and I still can&#x27;t get a foamy lather.</li>
            <li>Not knowing it was the new Essentials foaming facial cleanser because the bottle was exactly the same, however I didn&#x27;t notice \\&quot;essentials\\&quot; on the bottle.</li>
            <li>True oily, acme, and I have slightly overly dilated pores on my t region.</li>
            <li>I only wish that it were easier to find in stores, and I&#x27;m only rating it 4 stars because I find that it is not a good product for removing face makeup completely on its own.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY cleanser, along with the moisturizer, that helped clear up and settle my rosacea and adult acne type problems.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a Basic and Straight forward facial cleanser</li>
            <li>but Biore doesn&#x27;t wash off my silly mascara very well :) choices choices.</li>
            <li>When I used it in the shower, like I usually did, it didn&#x27;t seem to clean my face like the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; not Essentials cleaned my face.</li>
            <li>I no longer have red blotchy skin near the nose area where all the bacteria and dirt was hiding, it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li>Many cleansers dry skin and in the winter that is not a nice feeling.</li>
            <li>A daily facial cleanser should not zap your skin of all its natural oils.</li>
            <li>Did not dry out my skin or leave it oily.  </li>
            <li>I have a problem with acne, and haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement on it because of this product, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t make it worse and really makes me feel fresh after I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and I won&#x27;t use any other product to wash my face at night.</li>

            <li> I purchased this even though I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, and it still does a great job keeping my face clear and balancing the oils.</li>
            <li> But when we ran out, we didn&#x27;t have it in the budget to get more at the time, so we tried Clean &amp; Clear (for 1/3 the price!)</li>
            <li> The product does not dry out my skin either which is nice.  </li>
            <li> some more points: I also like the fact that this product foams up easily in the hands, despite what people say about it not foaming enough it does quite well and has no scent.</li>
            <li> Heck it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> She has been using Clean &amp; Clear for years and the grocery store would not always have this one available.</li>
            <li> It really does leave your skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I have been using clean &amp; clear face wash for a few years and absolutely love it, this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li> Love this face wash and Amazon has it for a better price than any local store near me.</li>
            <li> This cleanser works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Maybe all of the reviews are based on the fact that this is the only one they have ever tried and they dispense a lot more.</li>
            <li> first - glorious.</li>
            <li> The sensitive skin version of Clean &amp; Clear Foaming Facial Cleanser is perfectly OK in most respects, but  doesn&#x27;t work as well as the normal version insofar as it is thinner</li>
            <li> fragrance is amazing, very woody and notes of crushed leaves.&lt;br /&gt;Clean residue after cleaning with water.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used clean and clear.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li> i have super sensitive skin-</li>
            <li> This is the first time I purchased this particular brand.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry it out and my face feels fresh and clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> Firstly, thanks Ross for your skin care review.</li>
            <li> It leaves face feeling clean but not dry.</li>
            <li> This one does neither because it&#x27;s so gentle.</li>
            <li> Nor has this ever really foamed for me.  </li>
            <li> I think if you have skin on the oily side, this may work very well for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than being a bit drying, it also takes a lot if this stuff to work.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive,reactive and intolerant skin&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works very well on my skin.</li>
            <li> Simple face cleaner, almost-fragrance free and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> No adverse reactions, and my pores began to clean up nicely after only a few weeks.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t love is the fragrance, it&#x27;s really flowery and a little strong for my taste.</li>
            <li> Seems to remove my long wear foundation just fine.</li>
            <li> I really like that this stuff is mild and gentle, but also totally cleans off any makeup that I&#x27;m wearing, even waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> Not too harsh, no crazy scent, and easy to use twice a day.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Long time product in this house used by the missus, and I&#x27;ve always been happy with the person behind the face that uses clean and clear.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> 2x/day (Clinique Dramatically Different at night, Cetaphil Dermacontrol SPF 30 in the day), and my skin has been awesome--not too oily, not too dry, and best of all, very little acne!</li>
            <li> I wish it did lather a little more since it is labeled as a foaming cleanser</li>
            <li> Or you could use the &#x27;Clean &amp; Clear morning burst facial cleanser&#x27; in the morning and this at night.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it to help clear up acne (yet) but does clean your face properly.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using the regular medicated (orange) Clean &amp; Clear for years</li>
            <li> This works for my sensitive oily/dry/combo skin without drying out too much.</li>
            <li> I do alright with the normal version and will be returning to that when this is used up.</li>
            <li> My skin sort of normal</li>
            <li> If you have normal skin, buy this, if not try it.</li>
            <li> If you find the normal (orange colored) version too harsh and don&#x27;t mind the fact that the sensitive skin cleanser doesn&#x27;t foam up at all when you use it, this may be worthwhile.  </li>
            <li> Has too much fragrance which surprised me, though it hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation so far.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that you don&#x27;t even need a full pump to get the foam that you need to clean just your face so less waste, and just one bottle could last you for months easily.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Most likely won&#x27;t purchase again due to that.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product because the ingredient list is better than other facial cleansers.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t really see why there needs to be Blue 2 and Red 40 in an oil free facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> soap is very hard to foam, which is supposed to be a good thing because the cleaner would not dry out your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It removes the most stubborn mascara I have ever owned (it&#x27;s hard to wash off).</li>
            <li> Then for about 6 weeks everything was crystal clear.</li>
            <li> I prefer face washes which have a scrubbing action.</li>
            <li> I have so far found it satisfactory and would probably buy it at the price I paid 6.75 for two  8 ounce</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised on how it worked.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I&#x27;m not sufficiently sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and after using this cleanser it caused me to have a severe allergic reaction and caused me to break out severely</li>
            <li> This works very well as a facial cleanser, removing dirt and excess oil while leaving you with some of the nutrients on your skin you need.</li>
            <li> I have to use twice as much as I did for the regular, and I still can&#x27;t get a foamy lather.</li>
            <li> Not knowing it was the new Essentials foaming facial cleanser because the bottle was exactly the same, however I didn&#x27;t notice \\&quot;essentials\\&quot; on the bottle.</li>
            <li> True oily, acme, and I have slightly overly dilated pores on my t region.</li>
            <li> I only wish that it were easier to find in stores, and I&#x27;m only rating it 4 stars because I find that it is not a good product for removing face makeup completely on its own.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY cleanser, along with the moisturizer, that helped clear up and settle my rosacea and adult acne type problems.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a Basic and Straight forward facial cleanser</li>
            <li> but Biore doesn&#x27;t wash off my silly mascara very well :) choices choices.</li>
            <li> When I used it in the shower, like I usually did, it didn&#x27;t seem to clean my face like the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; not Essentials cleaned my face.</li>
            <li> I no longer have red blotchy skin near the nose area where all the bacteria and dirt was hiding, it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> Many cleansers dry skin and in the winter that is not a nice feeling.</li>
            <li> A daily facial cleanser should not zap your skin of all its natural oils.</li>
            <li> Did not dry out my skin or leave it oily.  </li>
            <li> I have a problem with acne, and haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement on it because of this product, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t make it worse and really makes me feel fresh after I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and I won&#x27;t use any other product to wash my face at night.</li>
            <li> I personally believe exfoliating should not be done every single day, and this is one of the easiest cheapest daily cleansers I&#x27;ve found that knows its place.</li>
            <li> Cleans my skin and only causes minimal amount of dryness.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out or irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> This goes on cleanly with hte pump dispenser but can be a bit difficult to wash off afterwards - hence the 4 star review.  </li>
            <li> but it can get dry.</li>
            <li> So after I wash my face with this cleanser, my face feels a bit dry</li>
            <li> I usually let it soak in for a minute or two (while I brush my teeth) and when I rinse it off, my skin is soo soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that ranges from a little dry to a little oily depending on the weather.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Notice after regular use...it works a little too well.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s really not drying at all, but i still do recommend moisturizer like SkinMD, B5 gel, or Paula&#x27;s Choice moisture gel.  </li>
            <li> Turns out it has a really strong, unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> Ended up having to use it every other 2 days.</li>
            <li> actual bottle is very hard to open</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this product doesn&#x27;t have any of this garbage in it, it simply has ingredients that clean up your skin and leaving out all the useless junk behind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products in the past that caused breakouts or dry skin.</li>
            <li> and I would rather use regular soap then waste my money on this face wash!!</li>
            <li> I find that I have less blemishes when using it</li>
            <li> but that is a minor complaint.</li>
            <li> In the next couple days, my face started feeling awkward and thats when I finally noticed that it was this Essentials brand.  </li>
            <li> Literally removed all the oil from my skin and dried it out.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling soapy and stiff, nor does my skin get irritated from it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also less expensive compared to the other other brand name products.</li>
            <li> all of these just made my complexion more miserable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if you have to use this product in cycles, but I&#x27;ll try that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually afraid to try other products because of my skin sensitivity and as long as these work without issues, I&#x27;m not venturing anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I hate the new product</li>
            <li> So my genes offer a few unfortunate problems with my skin.</li>
            <li> I slowly started seeing breakouts again, and it got the point where I felt worse after using the product, and it made my skin itch.</li>
            <li> But when I recieved the package it came in a an envelope with bubble lining and one of the pump was broken and the liquid spilled all over the packaging.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent product. Brightens skin nicely.</li>
            <li> I bought this cleanser because I thought it would be free of scents and too many chemicals. Turns out it has a really strong, unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> Firstly, thanks Ross for your skin care review. It really does leave your skin feeling clean. Literally removed all the oil from my skin and dried it out. I will continue using this product. Check out mensskincarewithross on youtube.[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notice after regular use...it works a little too well. It sorta dries your skin out. Ended up having to use it every other 2 days.</li>
            <li> This product is the holy grail for me, after searching endlessly for a product that would clean well and not irritate the skin I came to the conclusion that this is pretty much the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve tried products with Salcylic Acid, Benzoyl Peroxide, Alcohol Toners, Apricot Scrubs.. all of these just made my complexion more miserable. I like the fact that this product doesn&#x27;t have any of this garbage in it, it simply has ingredients that clean up your skin and leaving out all the useless junk behind. Since using this product I have not had one acne flare up, which is a blessing. I no longer have red blotchy skin near the nose area where all the bacteria and dirt was hiding, it&#x27;s gone. I no longer have flaking around the mouth area, it&#x27;s gone. I now have sweet looking skin because my skin is finally clean, something not even soap could do for me! Plus it&#x27;s really not drying at all, but i still do recommend moisturizer like SkinMD, B5 gel, or Paula&#x27;s Choice moisture gel.  some more points: I also like the fact that this product foams up easily in the hands, despite what people say about it not foaming enough it does quite well and has no scent. I also like the fact that you don&#x27;t even need a full pump to get the foam that you need to clean just your face so less waste, and just one bottle could last you for months easily.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate how there aren&#x27;t fruity gimmicks or scrubbing pads or acrid mint/citrus/tea tree beads that are supposed to &#x27;explode refreshingly&#x27; on my face. A good face wash without a ton of smells. I only wish that it were easier to find in stores, and I&#x27;m only rating it 4 stars because I find that it is not a good product for removing face makeup completely on its own. Still, I find that when I stop using my go to facewash I get tons more oily spots and breakouts.</li>
            <li> I prefer face washes which have a scrubbing action. This is the first time I purchased this particular brand. I have so far found it satisfactory and would probably buy it at the price I paid 6.75 for two  8 ounce bottles.&lt;br /&gt;The package comes in very good packaging.&lt;br /&gt;The actual bottle is very hard to open&lt;br /&gt;The soap is very hard to foam, which is supposed to be a good thing because the cleaner would not dry out your face.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is amazing, very woody and notes of crushed leaves.&lt;br /&gt;Clean residue after cleaning with water.&lt;br /&gt;It does its job which is to clean the face and neck twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended at the price I paid and for the quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about eight years now and it works great for me. I have very sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and it does a great job at removing all the dirt and make-up from my skin. It&#x27;s not for acne and blackheads but it keeps my breakouts under control it&#x27;s a great morning and night cleanser to use. Or you could use the &#x27;Clean &amp; Clear morning burst facial cleanser&#x27; in the morning and this at night.</li>
            <li> I bought the product for my daughter &amp; my son.  I bought the package so they can have their own bottle each.  But when I recieved the package it came in a an envelope with bubble lining and one of the pump was broken and the liquid spilled all over the packaging.  This is a fragile container and should be boxed not shipped in an \\&quot;envelope\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser a lot! I have pretty sensitive skin so I needed a facial skin cleanser that would remove makeup and also keep me from breaking out.  The product does not dry out my skin either which is nice.  I would recommend A plus from me</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY cleanser, along with the moisturizer, that helped clear up and settle my rosacea and adult acne type problems.  I tried dermatologist prescribed and recommended OTC products, many of which aggravated instead of helping.  I tried this on my own and haven&#x27;t used anything else for years.  People asked me what I did since my skin looked so much better and were amazed that one of the most inexpensive OTC products worked this well.  I&#x27;m actually afraid to try other products because of my skin sensitivity and as long as these work without issues, I&#x27;m not venturing anywhere else.</li>
            <li> My daughter was using Mary Kay &amp;#34;Creamy Cleanser Formula 2&amp;#34; for cleaning her face at night, and loved it. But when we ran out, we didn&#x27;t have it in the budget to get more at the time, so we tried Clean &amp; Clear (for 1/3 the price!) She is 13 and said this is an amazing product, she wants to keep using it. She said she notices a difference with it and loves it.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product. If you are looking for a Basic and Straight forward facial cleanser then this is the product for you. I am really happy I found this product since I can&#x27;t seem to find it at the local drug store. It is also great for people with sensitive skin. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This works for my sensitive oily/dry/combo skin without drying out too much. I also use Differin (prescription) on my forehead and moisturizer 2x/day (Clinique Dramatically Different at night, Cetaphil Dermacontrol SPF 30 in the day), and my skin has been awesome--not too oily, not too dry, and best of all, very little acne!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and love it!</li>
            <li> Seems to remove my long wear foundation just fine. Leaves my skin feeling cleansed without dryness. Has too much fragrance which surprised me, though it hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation so far. Most likely won&#x27;t purchase again due to that.</li>
            <li> I use this daily and it is perfect for my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t dry it out and my face feels fresh and clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> This personally made me breakout, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be a miracle product. It&#x27;s nice smelling and lightweight, just didn&#x27;t clear my acne. My mom&#x27;s been using it to see if it would work for her and her face has cleared up some. So it works for some people.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and I won&#x27;t use any other product to wash my face at night. It doesn&#x27;t dry out or irritate my skin at all. Great product.</li>
            <li> I love the clean and clear - it&#x27;s great for my sensitive over age 50 skin!  It&#x27;s all I will use!  Give it a try today.</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser has helped me maintain my skin for some time now. I find that I have less blemishes when using it but my skin maintains a balanced moisture level, which is ideal. Many cleansers dry skin and in the winter that is not a nice feeling. Amazons price is very good compared to local retailers. I wish it did lather a little more since it is labeled as a foaming cleanser but that is a minor complaint. Overall I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> A very nice face cleaner with a light smell to it. Face feels great after using it for 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this cleanser because it was foaming.  I was pleasantly surprised on how it worked.  Did not dry out my skin or leave it oily.  Clean and clear&#x27;s products seem to be just as good as the name brands (which i have tried).</li>
            <li> This cleanser is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried before, It&#x27;s so mild and good, it doesn&#x27;t dry my face off, I leaves my face feeling clean and soft, it&#x27;s great!!!</li>
            <li> The sensitive skin version of Clean &amp; Clear Foaming Facial Cleanser is perfectly OK in most respects, but  doesn&#x27;t work as well as the normal version insofar as it is thinner (more watery) and really doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34; at all. You have to use more of it and, frankly, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be any more gentle than the normal version.  Perhaps I&#x27;m not sufficiently sensitive.  If you find the normal (orange colored) version too harsh and don&#x27;t mind the fact that the sensitive skin cleanser doesn&#x27;t foam up at all when you use it, this may be worthwhile.  I do alright with the normal version and will be returning to that when this is used up.</li>
            <li> I really like that this stuff is mild and gentle, but also totally cleans off any makeup that I&#x27;m wearing, even waterproof mascara. I love the scent, very fresh and clean, and the texture is nice too. It washes off very easily and doesn&#x27;t cause any problems to my skin. I have a problem with acne, and haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement on it because of this product, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t make it worse and really makes me feel fresh after I&#x27;ve used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is now my favorite nighttime cleanser because it&#x27;s gentle, yet does an amazing job of getting my face clean and makeup-free at the end of the day. I love it for that reason, and will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I used the product twice before it slipped from my hands and bottle stem&lt;br /&gt;broke off in shower.  Manufacturer might consider another way to get&lt;br /&gt;contents from container.....</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this product. It leaves face feeling clean but not dry. I am constantly reordering because it is so great.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is perfect for sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve used other products in the past that caused breakouts or dry skin. This one does neither because it&#x27;s so gentle. It&#x27;s also less expensive compared to the other other brand name products.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is my favorite face wash.  I have sensitive skin that ranges from a little dry to a little oily depending on the weather.  This face wash is great for either situation.  The only thing I don&#x27;t love is the fragrance, it&#x27;s really flowery and a little strong for my taste. I prefer my cosmetics unscented, so I don&#x27;t think the fragrance would bother most people.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used clean and clear. Then one day, I ran out of my foaming facial cleanser so I ran to the drugstore and grabbed a bottle. Not knowing it was the new Essentials foaming facial cleanser because the bottle was exactly the same, however I didn&#x27;t notice \\&quot;essentials\\&quot; on the bottle. When I used it in the shower, like I usually did, it didn&#x27;t seem to clean my face like the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; not Essentials cleaned my face. In the next couple days, my face started feeling awkward and thats when I finally noticed that it was this Essentials brand.  I hate the new product and I would rather use regular soap then waste my money on this face wash!!</li>
            <li> i have super sensitive skin- plus eczema.&lt;br /&gt;this is a great product as a gentle, thorough facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> This goes on cleanly with hte pump dispenser but can be a bit difficult to wash off afterwards - hence the 4 star review.  Nor has this ever really foamed for me.  But it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling soapy and stiff, nor does my skin get irritated from it.  I think I prefer the Olay Foaming Face wash for the scent but both are really good products.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and after using this cleanser it caused me to have a severe allergic reaction and caused me to break out severely</li>
            <li> Long time product in this house used by the missus, and I&#x27;ve always been happy with the person behind the face that uses clean and clear.  It is a good value and we recommend it.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t quite foam as much as I want it too, and the top of the pump breaks off easily.</li>
            <li> Brilliant product. A daily facial cleanser should not zap your skin of all its natural oils. This works very well as a facial cleanser, removing dirt and excess oil while leaving you with some of the nutrients on your skin you need. I personally believe exfoliating should not be done every single day, and this is one of the easiest cheapest daily cleansers I&#x27;ve found that knows its place.</li>
            <li> I purchased this even though I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, and it still does a great job keeping my face clear and balancing the oils.</li>
            <li> I love that this cleanser smells nice and it works very well, just like Paula Begoun writes in her review of this product. It removes the most stubborn mascara I have ever owned (it&#x27;s hard to wash off). I don&#x27;t even have to use eye makeup remover afterwards! My skin sort of normal but it can get dry. So after I wash my face with this cleanser, my face feels a bit dry and I have to put some moisturizer on.....with Biore that I wrote review for before I didn&#x27;t have to do that but Biore doesn&#x27;t wash off my silly mascara very well :) choices choices. I think if you have skin on the oily side, this may work very well for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than being a bit drying, it also takes a lot if this stuff to work. With some cleansers it takes 1 pump.....it takes 3-4 of this. Doesn&#x27;t foam easily. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d get this one again yet I&#x27;d give it 4 stars still.</li>
            <li> So my genes offer a few unfortunate problems with my skin. True oily, acme, and I have slightly overly dilated pores on my t region. This cleanser works pretty well. It actually has a very pleasant amount of foam and seems to clean well. I didn&#x27;t find it to help clear up acne (yet) but does clean your face properly. If you have normal skin, buy this, if not try it. Heck it was worth the money. 2 bottles for ten bucks.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive,reactive and intolerant skin&lt;br /&gt;It works very well on my skin. I love this product !</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product because the ingredient list is better than other facial cleansers. She has been using Clean &amp; Clear for years and the grocery store would not always have this one available. We don&#x27;t really see why there needs to be Blue 2 and Red 40 in an oil free facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> excellent for oily skin and great bargain&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely recommend this to my friends&lt;br /&gt;ti is worthy to re-buying one!</li>
            <li> Not too harsh, no crazy scent, and easy to use twice a day.</li>
            <li> I have always liked this face wash, it makes me clean my face and feel fresh without breaking out. I have been using it for 5 years now, and everytime I try a new product, its not as good as this.</li>
            <li> I have been using clean &amp; clear face wash for a few years and absolutely love it, this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li> This works great for a basic face wash.  I usually let it soak in for a minute or two (while I brush my teeth) and when I rinse it off, my skin is soo soft.</li>
            <li> Simple face cleaner, almost-fragrance free and gets the job done. it makes good foam but comes out as a liquid, which is better value.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using the regular medicated (orange) Clean &amp; Clear for years and we love it. I saw this on Amazon selling in two packs with great reviews, so I tried the two pack....I can&#x27;t wait to use this stuff up and go back! I have to use twice as much as I did for the regular, and I still can&#x27;t get a foamy lather. It doesn&#x27;t make my face feel clean at all. Maybe all of the reviews are based on the fact that this is the only one they have ever tried and they dispense a lot more. Well, I don&#x27;t know that, but what I do know is I will never go back again!</li>
            <li> I use it in-between my classes since I like to do some cardio with my long break, works great, removes all the oil and grease you somehow accumulate on your face :)</li>
            <li> I have used this for over a year now and it works great. I use it mostly in the shower but also at the sink. Cleans my skin and only causes minimal amount of dryness. The price is great as well.</li>
            <li> Look, all of our bodies are different. We each react differently to creams, medications, life, etc. This is my bodies reaction to this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first - glorious. No adverse reactions, and my pores began to clean up nicely after only a few weeks. Then for about 6 weeks everything was crystal clear. However, about 2 months into using this product, it was as if my skin got used to it. I slowly started seeing breakouts again, and it got the point where I felt worse after using the product, and it made my skin itch. So, I discontinued use and what do you know, everything cleared up again. I&#x27;m not sure if you have to use this product in cycles, but I&#x27;ll try that if that&#x27;s what I need to do. For now though, 2 stars.</li>
            <li> These are good. I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> Love this face wash and Amazon has it for a better price than any local store near me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for quite some time. I started buying it on amazon since I couldn&#x27;t find it in any supermarket in my area. It leaves my skin clean and soft. I like that I can use it to remove my makeup too.</li>
