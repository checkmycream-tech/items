            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>Sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li>I have already ordered another box and plan to order more.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying Nagchampa Incense.</li>
            <li>Would like more time to assess</li>
            <li>However, they smoke more than what I am used to for a scented cone incense.</li>
            <li>It has always had odors of many kinds .  </li>
            <li>Well , I still have some but not as many .</li>
            <li>It has more perfume type scent.</li>
            <li>I love these incense cones, because they don&#x27;t get into everything.</li>
            <li>I know, most people would think that</li>
            <li>okay...</li>
            <li>This one is more floral.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping, very pleased with the seller.</li>
            <li>value, nice box, works every time, order came quickly</li>
            <li>It is quite a strong scent, too.</li>
            <li>Buy these cone-shaped incense, the smell is ok, don&#x27;t think that is the true sandalwood scent I&#x27;ve smelled in others.</li>
            <li>Burn fairly quickly and I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>Smells fabulous, it helps me relax.</li>
            <li>The oil is cheap, it smokes a lot and it smells of cheap soap, not sandalwood.  </li>
            <li>The humidity has not affected them , they light every time .  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many types and brands of incense, and this is far and away my favorite.</li>
            <li>This one burns clean, and then disappears from the house in a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>And the price is right!</li>
            <li>Very pleasant sandalwood scent in a cone shaped incense and even comes with a small metal plate to burn them on.</li>
            <li>It lights quickly and burns clean.  </li>
            <li>I usually light one in the morning while I&#x27;m getting ready for work and another one in the evening when I bath.  </li>
            <li>The one it comes with is a cheap ring of metal that I wouldn&#x27;t trust on my tables or much of anywhere else.</li>
            <li>Have been using the cones for about a week, and am so far satisfied.</li>
            <li>They burn much longer than other cones I&#x27;ve bought and smell great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;as far as the cones and general product happiness go, they work very well and aren&#x27;t a problem to light at all.  </li>
            <li>In fact, we found that we could put them out about half way through and still have the pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>you wouldn&#x27;t be burning incense if you were sensitive to strong scents, now would you?</li>
            <li>They burn very fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time I buy incense cones</li>
            <li>Definitely will be purchasing more of these.</li>
            <li>We love the smell,long lasting!</li>
            <li>I really like them, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for people who are sensitive to strong scents .</li>
            <li>Scent does not linger for a long time after burning but during the burning process is even and enjoyable.</li>
            <li>it was nice that each little package in the large one also comes with a disk that will keep the cones off what surface you use for burning.  </li>
            <li>The scent lasts a reasonably sufficient amount of time.</li>
            <li>I wish they were just a *tad* sweeter smelling, but they are very relaxing</li>
            <li>I really like these cones.  </li>
            <li>They are the real thing.</li>
            <li>,there&#x27;s nothing to really write here?&lt;br /&gt;light</li>
            <li>I live in Michigan and it is very humid .  </li>
            <li>highly recomended</li>
            <li>I do not think it&#x27;s worth buying, the smell lasts a short time.</li>
            <li>Nice sence and slow burning</li>
            <li>/&gt;After some research I found that Japanese and Tibetan insence is typically much higher quality.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice but is a little over powering because it burns so long.</li>
            <li>Maybe if you were to use it outside and would be a little more</li>
            <li>These cones are the right size for burning in an incense coffin, and other places as well.  </li>
            <li>We previously ordered holiday varieties and they were not too strong and lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>Be warned - the scent is STRONG, so a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Very pungent and long lasting smell just having them around.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very aromatic and long lasting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fragrant and burns longer than I expected.</li>
            <li>get my old hippie back by burning this!!</li>
            <li>AND they have a nice, large diameter base (preventing them from falling over)</li>
    </ol>

            <li> when an earthquake, or Godzilla, marches down your street.</li>
            <li> and they emit oily black smoke.  </li>
            <li> Black smoke comes off of it.</li>
            <li> Some of the cones are oddly shaped.</li>
            <li> I do like this incense, but it&#x27;s a little flowery for me.  </li>
            <li> To fix this, I mash a few grains of rice, and use it to stick the cone onto the holder.</li>
            <li> The smoke is harsh and may cause some to cough.</li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s because they are small.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s another scent hidden behind the sandalwood that I found I dislike.  </li>
            <li> wait wrong forum.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this item</li>

            <li> This is a wonderfull product. It&#x27;s the first time I buy incense cones and I am really impressed. The smell is great. Don&#x27;t believe those reviews about the cones being difficult to burn or that they will burn too fast.</li>
            <li> Very pungent and long lasting smell just having them around.  Burn fairly quickly and I love the smell.  Sandalwood is one of my favorite incenses.  I just hope not too many sandalwood trees were sacrificed.</li>
            <li> Anyone who&#x27;s come to my home has commented how nice these smell.  Wonderful earthy scent, not overpowering.  I never liked incense much until this.  And the price is right!</li>
            <li> These sandalwod cones smell great and for the amount of them you get, the price is great!</li>
            <li> I have always loved Incense as my brother used it and probably still does and have found it does put a relaxed feeling in the rooms of my home.  Always been a fan of Sandalwood and this is the perfect fit for me and my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks! Sharman L Bowman</li>
            <li> And all-time favorite… Smells great</li>
            <li> Love the smell. I usually light one in the morning while I&#x27;m getting ready for work and another one in the evening when I bath.  Definitely will be purchasing more of these.</li>
            <li> These cones are the right size for burning in an incense coffin, and other places as well.  The aroma is just great and lingers around for quite some time.  It lights quickly and burns clean.  Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I do like this incense, but it&#x27;s a little flowery for me.  I prefer a truly \\&quot;woody\\&quot; sandalwood.  But once it&#x27;s burning, it&#x27;s alright--especially for the price.  Would I purchase it again?  Probably not.  Will I keep it &amp; burn it?  Sure.</li>
            <li> A fragrant sandal-woody aroma fills my apartment and stimulates my senses with ... wait wrong forum. it&#x27;s a nice smelling incense that is strong and pungent. The scent lasts a reasonably sufficient amount of time. I&#x27;m quite pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li> Smells fabulous, it helps me relax.</li>
            <li> I wish they were just a *tad* sweeter smelling, but they are very relaxing and they keep my brother&#x27;s tobacco smell at bay.</li>
            <li> I really like these cones.  They burn much longer than other cones I&#x27;ve bought and smell great.  Be warned - the scent is STRONG, so a little goes a long way.  It also seems to linger for quite a while after the cone has burned out. I really like them, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for people who are sensitive to strong scents . . .but you wouldn&#x27;t be burning incense if you were sensitive to strong scents, now would you?</li>
            <li> I use a lot of cone incense and this one is Awesome. The scent is very aromatic and long lasting. The cone burns completely.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a quality incense that smells great, This is a must buy. I have already ordered another box and plan to order more.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s another scent hidden behind the sandalwood that I found I dislike.  I&#x27;ve smelled it before but can&#x27;t identify it.&lt;br /&gt;as far as the cones and general product happiness go, they work very well and aren&#x27;t a problem to light at all.  it was nice that each little package in the large one also comes with a disk that will keep the cones off what surface you use for burning.  that will save extra effort for cleaning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to be the bearer of bad news but this product is very low quality.  The oil is cheap, it smokes a lot and it smells of cheap soap, not sandalwood.  It is not relaxing.  On the contrary it gave me a headache.  The balance of the incense went in the trash. Maybe if you were to use it outside and would be a little more appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some research I found that Japanese and Tibetan insence is typically much higher quality.  I am enjoying Nagchampa Incense.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant sandalwood scent in a cone shaped incense and even comes with a small metal plate to burn them on.</li>
            <li> Buy these cone-shaped incense, the smell is ok, don&#x27;t think that is the true sandalwood scent I&#x27;ve smelled in others. They burn very fast. They do not last even 5 min lighted think it&#x27;s because they are small. I do not think it&#x27;s worth buying, the smell lasts a short time.</li>
            <li> I buy these for my mother all the time. They are the real thing. If you like the scent of sandalwood, these are the ones to get.</li>
            <li> Theses are a great little find...smells awesome and easy to use....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many types and brands of incense, and this is far and away my favorite. It&#x27;s very fragrant and burns longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> I bought a case of these sandalwood incense cones and have been very happy with them.  I will soon order another.  The fragrance is great, and the resulting smoke is exactly what I would expect from a good quality product.</li>
            <li> this is what I was looking for..... burns nice and easy to start... has a very light sent that give the room a feeling of happy...&lt;br /&gt;very good sandalwood... highly recomended</li>
            <li> nice pleasant smell and fair burning time. Scent does not linger for a long time after burning but during the burning process is even and enjoyable.</li>
            <li> They smell great although some packs lack an incense or two.</li>
            <li> The smell is quite good,but they tend to stop burning prematurely.</li>
            <li> Very happy, will continue to purchase this product through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I tried these cones along with a couple of other India-made brands on Amazon. Although they do stay lit, they are overly perfumed with something that I wouldn&#x27;t call Sandalwood and they emit oily black smoke.  I will just burn these out on the patio.  Check out my other reviews for recommendations.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite scent, and seem to be a good value :)</li>
            <li> As described and delivered on time</li>
            <li> Have been using the cones for about a week, and am so far satisfied. Would like more time to assess</li>
            <li> Black smoke comes off of it. It does not smell like any other Sandalwood I have ever had.</li>
            <li> If I were a \\&quot;Cone-Head\\&quot;, I&#x27;d marry these!  They are THE best...for aroma, ease of lighting AND they have a nice, large diameter base (preventing them from falling over)...when an earthquake, or Godzilla, marches down your street.</li>
            <li> We have never been disappointed with Kamini Incense. We previously ordered holiday varieties and they were not too strong and lasted a long time. In fact, we found that we could put them out about half way through and still have the pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Very strong aroma and burns for quite awhile, like 20 minutes and sometimes longer. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this item</li>
            <li> These have a wonderful scent and are certainly well worth the price paid.  However, they smoke more than what I am used to for a scented cone incense.</li>
            <li> My garage is my gym .  It has always had odors of many kinds .  These cones are wonderful .  My gym smells great and the sandalwood discourages mosquitoes .  Well , I still have some but not as many . The ones I do have are discouraged . I live in Michigan and it is very humid .  The cones are kept on a shelf in my garage .  The humidity has not affected them , they light every time .  No hassle ,  GREAT .</li>
            <li> My wife likes incense. It smells nice I have asthma it does not bother me. The spray that you spray in the house. Makes me have asthma attacks.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the musk smelling sandlewood. It has more perfume type scent. It&#x27;s different but I like it!</li>
            <li> Nice sence and slow burning</li>
            <li> Great smelling. Everyone who comes in the house asks what the beautiful fragrance is. They all go home with a box of 12 cones.</li>
            <li> I love these incense cones, because they don&#x27;t get into everything. I&#x27;ve had issues with scented things in my house getting permeated into the walls and furniture. This one burns clean, and then disappears from the house in a couple of hours. The smell is pleasant and mild. Some of the cones are oddly shaped. To fix this, I mash a few grains of rice, and use it to stick the cone onto the holder. If you are buying a pack of this size, please go and invest in a proper cone incense holder. The one it comes with is a cheap ring of metal that I wouldn&#x27;t trust on my tables or much of anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but is a little over powering because it burns so long. I know, most people would think that a good thing LOL. Use it in a room of about 450Sq Ft.</li>
            <li> get my old hippie back by burning this!! nice scent, easy lighting.</li>
            <li> okay...,there&#x27;s nothing to really write here?&lt;br /&gt;light it..burn it...smell it...&lt;br /&gt;good value, nice box, works every time, order came quickly</li>
            <li> We love the smell,long lasting!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite the scent I remember sandalwood having, when I was a teenager, but that was another brand.  This one is more floral.  It is quite a strong scent, too.</li>
            <li> The smoke is harsh and may cause some to cough. If you are sensitive to smoke, purchase Knox incense, it is less irratating. Otherwise the scent is very nice and lingers for a while. Just keep the burner at a distance.</li>
            <li> Very nice cones, smell great, long burning.  Quick shipping, very pleased with the seller.</li>
