            <li>LOVE the function of these</li>
            <li>Love em.</li>
            <li>Love these things.</li>

            <li>I absolutely love these.</li>
            <li>We love them.</li>
            <li>There are better choices on amazon that hold better and offer more.</li>
            <li>Make sure the comb curves towards the head, not away.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ordering more</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and love how many hair styles I can create them.</li>
            <li>These are medium sized combs, with pretty good elastic.  </li>
            <li>Could not find them locally so ended up paying more than I would have liked, it would have been nice if they&#x27;d taken the price tag off from Bath &amp; Beyond!</li>
            <li>These things are so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to put in, and easy to take off.  </li>
            <li>The bronze one is still going strong however.</li>
            <li>This items is wonderful, the price is just right and but order plenty because some don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>Excellent product - exactly what I was looking for, only 1/2 the price of stores.</li>
            <li>The comb looks very cheap and only good for kids.</li>
            <li>I was looking for replacement and was so happy to find exactly same thing at Amazon.</li>
            <li>Great for a special occasion, but I intended to use them daily.</li>
            <li>I get compliments about how pretty these are/how interesting my hair looks with them in.</li>
            <li>Compared to other beaded combs I own, I reach for these RARELY because they just don&#x27;t hold my hair like others that I own.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love how this holds my hair back along with it being very decorative.</li>
            <li>Of course it&#x27;s not perfect quality and it will tear again one day -- still great price and good product</li>
            <li>My daughter is into doing her hair in different styles and these were very cure and a great price.</li>
            <li>so I can leave some at work and in the purse for quick access.</li>
            <li>They arrived looking very pretty.</li>
            <li>youre fine and for us bigger hair just purchase so more</li>
            <li>, I hear they are far more durable..</li>
            <li>is worth</li>
            <li>The ones in store are far better.</li>
            <li>I run with them, Plus they look a bit more professional at work when I need or want to wear my hair up.</li>
            <li>Mine stay in all day comfortably, and I love how they are flat against the head unlike the claw-clips.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised how easy it was for me to use these combs.</li>
            <li>I selected this item (at a higher cost than others) specifically for the Caramel Bronze comb.  </li>
            <li>Have used these since they first came out.</li>
            <li>Those combs come in a larger size, which works much better for my hair.</li>
            <li>I have a bunch of these in several sizes, and I make sure I have one in all of my bags.</li>
            <li>I got my first set in CVS</li>
            <li>They will &amp;#34;hang in there&amp;#34; for a bit if I &amp;#34;rat&amp;#34; [backcomb] my hair, but who wants to ruin their hair just to use a pretty comb?</li>
            <li>I love the colors with this brand but the teeth are very flimsy and the beads get tangled easily and break with very little wear</li>
            <li>They lay relatively flat so taking a nap with one in is possible; also, wearing one while driving is much more comfortable than using a clip.</li>
            <li>Then getting it out afterward was just as much of a bother.</li>
            <li>so well, I would never have paid this much.</li>
            <li>They work very well.  </li>
            <li>They hold my hair whether it is straight or curly, and they don&#x27;t pull out strands like ponytail bands</li>
            <li>They are holding up very well.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has used them a few times and they look nice.  </li>
            <li>i use it for work most of the time and it holds all day i only wish after a couple months it would stay the same some of the beeds start to fall off</li>
            <li>All in all they are worth what you pay for them because you get enough use every time.</li>
            <li>NO MORE BUNS :)</li>
            <li>Pretty, but I really can&#x27;t use these much as they seem to require a HEAVY HEAD OF HAIR.  </li>
            <li>It works for my purposes, simply securing a pony tail tightly to my head for work safety compliance, but I do not recommend it for any truly &#x27;stylish&#x27; uses.</li>
            <li>I kept mine because it was too much effort to take them back.</li>
            <li>I have the bronze/silver set, and I use them frequently.  </li>
            <li>i love this product it holds tight and doesnt fall down</li>
            <li>It had been sliced open completely along one side.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really good at a lot of hair styles but these combs give me several more possible hairstyles.</li>
            <li>I tried bending them more into shape, but because I have very thick, long hair</li>
            <li>The other is still together, but only because I rarely use it, and then only very carefully.</li>

            <li> My long locks are fine and thin ...</li>
            <li> Definitely of a cheaper construction than some of the other similar products of this type.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair</li>
            <li> Thin, light, plain.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough for daily wear</li>
            <li> Not worth sending them back.</li>
            <li> but i have heavy long hair so for those who have thinner and short hair</li>
            <li> Also, it was very loose and didn&#x27;t hold well...</li>
            <li> These are thin, flimsy, the metal bends easily, and the stretchy bands are weak.</li>
            <li> Gather the hair, slip in one comb, stretch the other comb to the other side and sort of flip under as you slide it in.  </li>
            <li> Bought same several years ago at Wall-Mart, and one of the pieces got broken (the string) in summer.</li>
            <li> One arrived already broken, and the other broke shortly after.  </li>
            <li> It would hold for a few minutes then pop out and the teeth would bend.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these combs.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a little tangly but not too thick.</li>
            <li> she said they were to hard for her to work with.  </li>
            <li> She also says the are hard to work with.</li>
            <li> It works on my hair which is thin and my daughters which if very thick.</li>
            <li> but I am really disappointed in the price.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find the package contained a Sahara Sandlewood comb instead, so I returned it for a refund!</li>

            <li> I have shoulder-length hair that&#x27;s a little tangly but not too thick. However, these things didn&#x27;t hold it well. It would hold for a few minutes then pop out and the teeth would bend. Then I realized that if I wanted to keep it in all day or for an evening event such as a banquet, I had to manually bend the teeth myself to manipulate it to stay. Then getting it out afterward was just as much of a bother.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with these EZ Combs. Each time I wear them, I get a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> I bought this at superdrug in the Uk, they break very easily and I am going to purchase the hair-zing online, I hear they are far more durable..</li>
            <li> I have bought the Scunci brand which are really nice. I love the colors with this brand but the teeth are very flimsy and the beads get tangled easily and break with very little wear</li>
            <li> I love these combs.  They are easy to use and love how many hair styles I can create them.</li>
            <li> They look great. However, the combs start to bend and don&#x27;t work as well. So, after a while, they&#x27;ll need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> I got these for my granddaughter and she has given up on them.  she said they were to hard for her to work with.  My daughter has used them a few times and they look nice.  She also says the are hard to work with.</li>
            <li> Pretty, but I really can&#x27;t use these much as they seem to require a HEAVY HEAD OF HAIR.  My long locks are fine and thin ...so the combs constantly fall out.  They will &amp;#34;hang in there&amp;#34; for a bit if I &amp;#34;rat&amp;#34; [backcomb] my hair, but who wants to ruin their hair just to use a pretty comb?</li>
            <li> It said Carmel Silver combs in both the item description and the packaging. However, there is only ONE silver comb inside! The comb looks very cheap and only good for kids.</li>
            <li> Though the picture shows TWO combs, this item is actually ONE comb.  $4.84 is still $1 cheaper than the drug store, but make note that what you&#x27;re getting is one comb, not two.</li>
            <li> I selected this item (at a higher cost than others) specifically for the Caramel Bronze comb.  I was disappointed to find the package contained a Sahara Sandlewood comb instead, so I returned it for a refund!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these combs.  One arrived already broken, and the other broke shortly after.  Not worth sending them back.</li>
            <li> Have used these since they first came out. Was done to my last one. Was so glad I found them on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Great item, just as ordered.  Works and was never used.</li>
            <li> Definitely of a cheaper construction than some of the other similar products of this type. The metal is a bit too flimsy to even attempt many of the styles shown. It works for my purposes, simply securing a pony tail tightly to my head for work safety compliance, but I do not recommend it for any truly &#x27;stylish&#x27; uses. My package also arrived damaged, not the actual envelope it was delivered I , mind you, but the actual package containing the pieces. It had been sliced open completely along one side.</li>
            <li> I have looked for these since I have let my hair grow out. Could not find them locally so ended up paying more than I would have liked, it would have been nice if they&#x27;d taken the price tag off from Bath &amp; Beyond! LOVE the function of these, I had them before but I am really disappointed in the price. If I didn&#x27;t like them so well, I would never have paid this much. SHOP AROUND!</li>
            <li> They arrived looking very pretty. One broke the second time I put it in my hair. The other is still together, but only because I rarely use it, and then only very carefully. These are thin, flimsy, the metal bends easily, and the stretchy bands are weak. Great for a special occasion, but I intended to use them daily. Not strong enough for daily wear</li>
            <li> Love em. They work very well.  I have really long hair and it works.</li>
            <li> Bought same several years ago at Wall-Mart, and one of the pieces got broken (the string) in summer. I was looking for replacement and was so happy to find exactly same thing at Amazon. Of course it&#x27;s not perfect quality and it will tear again one day -- still great price and good product</li>

            <li> I love these hair things and the two colors were great. Unfortunately, my favorite one (the silver one) fell apart after 2 months. The bronze one is still going strong however.</li>
            <li> It works on my hair which is thin and my daughters which if very thick. Keeps my hair out of my face and looks greaT</li>
            <li> Excellent product - exactly what I was looking for, only 1/2 the price of stores. Love, love, love how this holds my hair back along with it being very decorative. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how easy it was for me to use these combs. I&#x27;m not really good at a lot of hair styles but these combs give me several more possible hairstyles.</li>
            <li> My daughter is into doing her hair in different styles and these were very cure and a great price. would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This items is wonderful, the price is just right and but order plenty because some don&#x27;t last. All in all they are worth what you pay for them because you get enough use every time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these. I can do anything with them to make my hair look amazing and they are so easy to use! Highly recommend and the price is great!</li>
            <li> These are medium sized combs, with pretty good elastic.  However, they do NOT stay in my hair well.  I tried bending them more into shape, but because I have very thick, long hair they slide out after a while.  Now that isn&#x27;t to say I don&#x27;t use them, but I personally prefer the HairZing brand of comb.  Those combs come in a larger size, which works much better for my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the second set we have purchased.  We love them.</li>
            <li> i love this product it holds tight and doesnt fall down i use it for work most of the time and it holds all day i only wish after a couple months it would stay the same some of the beeds start to fall off but i have heavy long hair so for those who have thinner and short hair youre fine and for us bigger hair just purchase so more is worth the price trust me. NO MORE BUNS :)</li>
            <li> The teeth on the combs bent,  and the elastic strings broke on the brown one... Also, it was very loose and didn&#x27;t hold well... The ones in store are far better.</li>
            <li> These things are so easy to use.  And they never get tangled in my curly hair.  Easy to put in, and easy to take off.  Everyone thinks I&#x27;m doing my hair \\&quot;fancy\\&quot; when I use these.</li>
            <li> I have a bunch of these in several sizes, and I make sure I have one in all of my bags. These are just great-period. They hold my hair whether it is straight or curly, and they don&#x27;t pull out strands like ponytail bands do. I run with them, Plus they look a bit more professional at work when I need or want to wear my hair up. I get compliments all of the time.</li>
            <li> one of the best hair comes</li>
            <li> I bought these locally. Thin, light, plain. Not enough beads. Was disappointed.  Compared to other beaded combs I own, I reach for these RARELY because they just don&#x27;t hold my hair like others that I own.  I do NOT recommend them. There are better choices on amazon that hold better and offer more. I kept mine because it was too much effort to take them back.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, and these combs stay in perfectly.  I have the bronze/silver set, and I use them frequently.  They are holding up very well.  No chips on the comb or breaks in the elastic.  Very easy to use.  Gather the hair, slip in one comb, stretch the other comb to the other side and sort of flip under as you slide it in.  Make sure the comb curves towards the head, not away.  Mine stay in all day comfortably, and I love how they are flat against the head unlike the claw-clips.  I got my first set in CVS and I&#x27;m ordering more so I can leave some at work and in the purse for quick access.</li>
