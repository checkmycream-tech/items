            <li>Looks really good at the photos.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice tiara that matched my wedding dress style and added some nice sparkles to my hair.</li>
            <li>but we are going to try our best to make them work because they really are beautiful and would be a perfect accessory for wedding hairstyles or to wear on a special occassion if you need something dressy and elegant to wear in your hair</li>
            <li>and now it&#x27;s all better!</li>
            <li>It just looks nice.</li>
            <li>She really liked it and wore it well.  </li>
            <li>but again, they are beautiful if you are willing to try and make them work.</li>
            <li>It looks lovely but very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>This looks great and is very well made.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just enough sparkle and the pearls match my necklace perfectly.</li>
            <li>As Amazon is one of my favorite places to shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this piece.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s simply elegant.</li>
            <li>I looked lovely in the brides up-do for the wedding.</li>
            <li>I was very excited as it matches the beading on my wedding dress</li>
            <li>I was NOT disappointed!</li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly and was sturdier than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look or feel cheap.</li>
            <li>The picture was nice, but it is much nicer in person!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cheap looking.</li>
            <li>In fact I was hoping to be able to bend it a little so it can fit the curve of the hairstyle I plan to do for my wedding but after trying it out it looks just as good if I had been able to bend it.</li>
            <li>the hair pin came clean off like it was never attached.</li>
            <li>Falls out of hair too easily even though it is very pretty...not as secure to wear as I would like .</li>
            <li>Absolutely lovely and classic hair ornament.</li>
            <li>I was able to super glue them back on &amp; so far so good.</li>
            <li>It is so very pretty.</li>
            <li>I had to walk down the aisle without one and I wasn&#x27;t particularly happy about it.</li>
            <li>I will be more cautious when ordering certain things next time and make sure i order things WELL in advance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty sweet.  </li>
            <li>It sort of rides up on either side, and does not look right.</li>
            <li>Had to use bobby pins just to keep it at the right angle as it is long, but that&#x27;s why she liked it.</li>
            <li>Thank very pretty and fast shipment .my</li>
            <li>with purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Broke/Bent the first time I wore it.</li>
            <li>The hair piece is stunning and actually well built.</li>
            <li>Pretty but broke when I tried to use it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t return it cuz it was pretty&amp; thought I could hot glue it.</li>
            <li>I wear this for special occasions when I put my hair in a French twist, looks lovely and classy not at all gawdy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really quite beautiful, but the pearls are poorly attached.</li>
            <li>Easily find at a local Clair&#x27;s this hair piece for much cheaper.</li>
            <li>It also came with a nice little bag to keep it in.</li>
            <li>( i didnt use much force)</li>
            <li>a real keeper.</li>
            <li>Looked very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;Happy</li>
            <li>This comb turned out better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Much prittier than pictured.  </li>
            <li>If you have pearl jewelry set I highly recommend getting this tiara as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something simple, this is exactly that.</li>
            <li>There is so much junk jewelry floating around that when you find an actual quality piece that doesn&#x27;t bankrupt you</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lovely in person, however, it does not fit the head properly.  </li>
            <li>They are very pretty and elegant but larger than I thought they would be; I have had a couple of practice runs at my wedding hairstyle since getting them and my hairdresser is having a hard time trying to place them in my hair because of the large size and weight, they feel somewhat heavy (in and out of your hair) and require hairpins to support them</li>
            <li>I understand that it was very inexpensive as was the other one i ordered</li>

            <li> both pieces arrived later than expected.</li>
            <li> Every single pearl had fallen off of the hair clip when I received it.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant on purchasing this because the low price but after reading the reviews, I went ahead and bought.</li>
            <li> It arrived just a few days before we left.</li>
            <li> My hair is fairly thick, naturally wavy</li>
            <li> Simple and pretty -- just what I was looking for to add a little bit of &amp;#34;bling&amp;#34; to my hairdo, without an over-the-top sparkly tiara.</li>
            <li> I can wear my hair down</li>
            <li> but now I have to re-attach half of the pearls before my hair dresser can even try it.</li>
            <li> but I would not recommend them if you have thin, straight hair as they will probably be too heavy and be uncomfortable by pulling at your hair due to their weight.</li>
            <li> Very well made looks very expensive.</li>
            <li> the metal is thin and fragile, poorly welded metal.</li>
            <li> Came in broken in three pieces, missing pearls,  does not look like the picture at all,  looks like plastic comb for kids</li>
            <li> and when i opened the package it was completely crush and into pieces it was very disappointing to me, but what was i to do?</li>
            <li> The comb was poorly attached to the tiara and immediately broke off when i place it in my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made well,looks expensive.</li>
            <li> Not happy!!</li>

            <li> There is so much junk jewelry floating around that when you find an actual quality piece that doesn&#x27;t bankrupt you it&#x27;s the eception not the rule.  This looks great and is very well made.  It doesn&#x27;t look or feel cheap.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to wear on my wedding day.  It&#x27;s lovely in person, however, it does not fit the head properly.  It sort of rides up on either side, and does not look right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a beautiful as it is in the picture.  Only problem is that it is really long.  My sister makes jewelry so we are going to attempt to bend it which I am hoping it was made to do.  Very beautiful.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair pin for my wedding. It arrived just a few days before we left. When I went to pack it I wrapped it in some cloth and placed it in a pocket and not even 5 minutes later when I went to grab it and put it in my bridal bag the hair pin came clean off like it was never attached. I had to walk down the aisle without one and I wasn&#x27;t particularly happy about it. It&#x27;s cheap and not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something simple, this is exactly that. It&#x27;s made well,looks expensive. I was very happy with the quality of this comb. I will be using it for my simple backyard wedding in July.</li>
            <li> Falls out of hair too easily even though it is very pretty...not as secure to wear as I would like . I returned it.</li>
            <li> Loved the hair piece, it will work our nicely for my wedding coming up in a month! It&#x27;s just enough sparkle and the pearls match my necklace perfectly.</li>
            <li> Thank very pretty and fast shipment .my The comb came glued on backwards. I fix it and now it&#x27;s all better! That&#x27;s why 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Came in broken in three pieces, missing pearls,  does not look like the picture at all,  looks like plastic comb for kids</li>
            <li> The comb was poorly attached to the tiara and immediately broke off when i place it in my hair. ( i didnt use much force) the metal is thin and fragile, poorly welded metal. It just looks nice.</li>
            <li> I used this in my wedding above my veil. It was a really nice accent and it went well with my dress!</li>
            <li> I received this just in time for my wedding for my flower girl and when i opened the package it was completely crush and into pieces it was very disappointing to me, but what was i to do? i had no time to send it back for a replacement and i left on my honey moon the day after.I understand that it was very inexpensive as was the other one i ordered but i was still upset because i had no time left as it was both pieces arrived later than expected. I will be more cautious when ordering certain things next time and make sure i order things WELL in advance. As Amazon is one of my favorite places to shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bobbie</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for!!! Every single pearl had fallen off of the hair clip when I received it. I was able to super glue them back on &amp; so far so good. Good Luck!</li>
            <li> Perfect - bling without being over the top. Purchased to wear to symphony.</li>
            <li> Had a couple of beads fall out when I pulled it out of the box had to fix it myself</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice tiara that matched my wedding dress style and added some nice sparkles to my hair. Looks really good at the photos. If you have pearl jewelry set I highly recommend getting this tiara as well.</li>
            <li> good quality and well made for the price!</li>
            <li> I love this piece.&lt;br /&gt;Its the one I chose to wear.  I can wear my hair down and it&#x27;s simply elegant.</li>
            <li> It looks just like the picture, and it seems to be great quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I wear this for special occasions when I put my hair in a French twist, looks lovely and classy not at all gawdy. Very well made looks very expensive. a real keeper.</li>
            <li> Beautiful piece looks amazing in my moms hair for my wedding</li>
            <li> The picture was nice, but it is much nicer in person!&lt;br /&gt;The quality is nice and very beautiful. It will look nice on my wedding day!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to wear in my hair on my wedding day, which I did. Looked very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;Happy with purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much.</li>

            <li> Broke/Bent the first time I wore it. It looks lovely but very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> This item broke while I was trying to put it on. Not a Gud experience, morning of the wedding and no time to buy another or fix it. Not happy!!</li>
            <li> I purchased these hair combs to wear in my upcoming wedding. They are very pretty and elegant but larger than I thought they would be; I have had a couple of practice runs at my wedding hairstyle since getting them and my hairdresser is having a hard time trying to place them in my hair because of the large size and weight, they feel somewhat heavy (in and out of your hair) and require hairpins to support them but we are going to try our best to make them work because they really are beautiful and would be a perfect accessory for wedding hairstyles or to wear on a special occassion if you need something dressy and elegant to wear in your hair but I would not recommend them if you have thin, straight hair as they will probably be too heavy and be uncomfortable by pulling at your hair due to their weight. My hair is fairly thick, naturally wavy and even I am having some problems with the above mentioned issues but again, they are beautiful if you are willing to try and make them work.</li>
            <li> Much prittier than pictured.  I looked lovely in the brides up-do for the wedding.</li>
            <li> Easily find at a local Clair&#x27;s this hair piece for much cheaper. Would not recommend for wedding. Maybe prom. Cheap looking.</li>
            <li> Absolutely lovely and classic hair ornament. I can&#x27;t wait to wear it at my wedding.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter to wear at her wedding.  She really liked it and wore it well.  It&#x27;s pretty sweet.  Seemed sturdy enough to last.  Had to use bobby pins just to keep it at the right angle as it is long, but that&#x27;s why she liked it.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant on purchasing this because the low price but after reading the reviews, I went ahead and bought. I was NOT disappointed! The hair piece is stunning and actually well built. It also came with a nice little bag to keep it in. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Pretty but broke when I tried to use it. I didn&#x27;t return it cuz it was pretty&amp; thought I could hot glue it. Glue didn&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really quite beautiful, but the pearls are poorly attached. I was very excited as it matches the beading on my wedding dress but now I have to re-attach half of the pearls before my hair dresser can even try it.</li>
