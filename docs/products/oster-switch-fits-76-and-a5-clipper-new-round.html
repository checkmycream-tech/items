            <li> Worked as promised. After dropping my clippers on the floor and breaking off the switch I thought my expensive clippers was toast. Glad Amazon had the replacement part. It was a very easy installation and now works like new. Saved me from buying a new clipper.</li>
            <li> Great Product accurate description. I am very happy!</li>

            <li> Glad you carry them!  Easy to change out.</li>
            <li> Easy to replace as I just followed a tutorial on you tube. My clippers work great now as my old switch wire was broken causing my clippers to go off and on. I just wish they would have sold the o ring with it.</li>
            <li> exactly what I  needed . my oster 76  clipper fell off  my hand and the switch broke  . bought  the part from here came so fast and  in excellent condition .  thanks</li>
            <li> Just want I need to fix my clippers that I have had for 12 yrs. Now they work better than ever.</li>
            <li> This switched worked great and was very easy to replace.  We needed our clippers fixed before the fair started, so my daughter could clip her cow, shipping was very quick.</li>
            <li> I bought an Oster 76 classic fulfilled by Amazon.  This somewhat fragile switch was broken off during shipment.  After exploring all my refund and replacement options, I decided to bite the bullet, buy the switch and install it myself and at my cost.  Repair was super easy, took literally less than five minutes.  I spent more time watching youtube videos about how to do it than I did actually repairing the clippers.  I bought a spare switch just in case.  I also now try to limit my amazon purchases to those fulfilled by amazon.</li>
            <li> Worked like I thought i would. Great produce and I would buy it again in a second. Great price also.</li>
            <li> Affordable and very easy to install</li>
            <li> Perfect. Back in action. No instructions included but there are several YouTube vids on how to replace. Just search oyster switch replacement.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy a new \\&quot;Clipper\\&quot; before checking\\&quot; \\&quot;Springs and Brushes\\&quot;, \\&quot;Cord\\&quot; and \\&quot;Switch\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;In my case it was actually the \\&quot;Switch\\&quot;. I bought the \\&quot;Oster Switch Fits 76 &amp; A5 Clipper - Single Speed\\&quot; off Amazon as usual. Then I searched and found a \\&quot;Video\\&quot; on \\&quot;YouTube\\&quot;. After that It was \\&quot;Breezy\\&quot; . 15 mins. and done. Don&#x27;t forget to buy the \\&quot;Retainer Ring\\&quot; if you don&#x27;t already have one.</li>
            <li> Fits well.  If you need help putting it in look at this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;wRcS5Zr27yY&amp;noredirect&#x3D;1 .  I&#x27;m not good with my hands, so that fact that I did this in 15 min is incredible.</li>
            <li> The order was received promptly through Amazon Prime. I watched a youtube video on how to install, and the switch works like a charm with my Oster 76 clippers. FYI for the DIY people: Very easy installation. Watch the video and do it yourself to save some money.</li>
            <li> works perfectly as a replacement switch in my Oster A5 Turbo Clippers when paired with the Oster Switch Nut Replacement.</li>
            <li> perfect replacement for my clippers&#x27; broken switch. my clippers are once again in working order!</li>

            <li> Very quick to ship the item and it was as advertised</li>
            <li> it is a switch. flimsy and expensive</li>
            <li> I buy from amazon enough to not have to make a special order just for a little switch.  I really need the on/off switch fir my classic 76 clippers. . I made my last order thinking it was enough to add the add on item.. any way Im not a satisfied customer now. . Never had any problems before and now I have to spend extra for something that&#x27;s $7.. Doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me.  I need feedback or to resolve my issue.</li>
            <li> for quite a few years now and the switch recently broke.&lt;br /&gt;We purchased this replacement switch and switch nut and&lt;br /&gt;although I&#x27;m not sure he&#x27;s used them yet, seems to have done the trick!</li>
            <li> Works as it should.  Thanks</li>
            <li> This product is interchangeable and work great, however it doesn&#x27;t come with the locking screw nut to secure the switch to the unit.</li>
            <li> Thank you it fixed my clippers yahoo....</li>
