            <li> Love this mirror perfect for traveling</li>
            <li> Nice as a portable mirror with box for markup use</li>
            <li> Its a good mirror. For use in travelling i need to put elastic bands round to secure it, but thats ok. Also, it says it came with a zip case, and it didn&#x27;t have a case.</li>
            <li> Love this mirror. Easy to use when camping.</li>
            <li> Small enough to fit in my travel make-up bag. Easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> Cheap and suited my needs.</li>
            <li> It keeps falling down. If it is not set up &amp;#34;just so&amp;#34;, it will fall over.</li>
            <li> For the size and affordability this was a very good choice. It fits nicely into my shaving kit do to being the shape it is instead of a round mirror that I have been using in the past.</li>
            <li> This is great for facial riggers and animators. I always have it with me in my bag.</li>
            <li> got this so I could apply makeup back stage and to do quick checks and touch ups.  Is the perfect size to fit into a bag, light weight and I really like how the mirror case becomes the stand.  Works so well that other actors would use it when I wasn&#x27;t .For the price and what it does, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> great size, love the tray. I expect to use it on an upcoming flight, and i&#x27;ll be doing my makeup in the plane. The tray will do a good job in keeping brushes from rolling around.</li>
            <li> Perfect for traveling. Small, compact, great price. I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Good! use it as the mirror for daily check of make up. It is not heavy and can just fit into my bag, so I can bring it with me.</li>
            <li> Its just what I expected!  I travel frequently, and its perfect to hold makeup in its little tray.  I think most women know how makeup pencils just Role off the table (which is quite maddening)... but this unit keeps them ON the table! :) yay!  Its LIGHT, COMPACT and I would NOT be without it for traveling!  And also the price was right!</li>
            <li> Product is exactly like the picture and description. Excellent quality.</li>
            <li> good. A little smaller than I think.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror a lot. 5 stars!!</li>
            <li> Okay, not the normal use for a travel mirror, but I bought mine specifically to check my embouchure when playing the flute.While a clip-on base would have been better, it works great on my music stand. I can find and hold the flute position faster and easier when looking into the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I know that isn&#x27;t what it was designed for, but it&#x27;s inexpensive, well made, and works great!</li>
            <li> Small, compact, with its own stand and a neat little tray for small items.  Will be a great travel mirror.</li>
            <li> great travel mirror! i use it for speech therapy and the kids love it.</li>
            <li> I really liked the idea of this mirror. I like the fact it folds flat and can stand up when you use it. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s a bit cheap feeling (thin plastic)... but for the price, I guess that&#x27;s what you get.</li>
            <li> i use this for applying makeup on the go, works great.  it&#x27;s exactly as described and convenient that it comes with a stand.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased. Although ( from the angle of the camera) the mirror and tray look bigger than they actually are it still is a nice size tray which can fit little things and you can carry it with you in your purse or when you travel with ease. I definitely recommend this product, because for size and price it really doesn&#x27;t get any better than this!</li>
            <li> Really like it. Very practical.</li>
            <li> They serve my purpose and they arrived timely</li>
