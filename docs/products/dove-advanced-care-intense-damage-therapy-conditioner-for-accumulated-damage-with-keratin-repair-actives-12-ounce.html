            <li>For a non salon hair product that is inexpensive - i think it&#x27;s one of the best conditioners out there.</li>
            <li>but it works for the rest of my hair perfectly in the places</li>
            <li>I think it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful smell,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The scent is wonderful.</li>
            <li>So if anyone knows of a good organic conditioner that does what a conditioner is suppose to do, let me know!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this and will be using it from now on!</li>
            <li>I gave it three stars because like I said, as a conditioner it does a great job - but that smell...</li>
            <li>This is some great, great stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the Dove shampoos and conditioners to be great for the money.</li>
            <li>great scent-</li>
            <li>It is infused with Coconut and Macadamia oil which smells great.</li>
            <li>daughter says it works really good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good conditioner</li>
            <li>This conditioner is a good reminder that you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a really good product.</li>
            <li>It smells good and it has a good texture to it.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cost effective, good to my hair, and it feels like a spa treatment in a bottle.</li>
            <li>This is very surprising for me and very rare.  </li>
            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product!</li>
            <li>Loving it.</li>
            <li>This conditioner has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>This condition smells nice and she seems to like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of smells like baby powder and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>This is a nice conditioner and works well.</li>
            <li>I really liked that.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and smells lovely!</li>
            <li>The strands are very fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes scents can make me gag in the shower, but this one is nice and not too strong.  </li>
            <li>This does a pretty good job of softening and helping my hair stay nice.</li>
            <li>She likes this conditioner; it smells nice and works well with her fine hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have the experience of my hair being &amp;#34;five times silkier&amp;#34; as claimed, and it&#x27;s just okay at detangling.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny, healthy and radiant looking.  </li>
            <li>The inclusion of macadamia and coconut oil held the promise of the silky, healthy hair that has eluded me for years.</li>
            <li>I want to love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like this conditioner because I have curly kinky hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure scientists can measure all sorts of things, but all I can say is the product worked well with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>During the colder months I started using conditioner again because of static electricity.</li>
            <li>I added some smoothing serum and now it&#x27;s better, but that is a drawback to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the oil, I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would venture into uncharted territory for my hair care.</li>
            <li>You get a good value and it will likely have you feeling great about your hair.</li>
            <li>I thought the oil infusion would be great, but it really did nothing.</li>
            <li>Very happy with the product overall</li>
            <li>Curls need moisture and more moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it alone as a conditioner (without shampooing) and I was well pleased.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s most striking feature to me, though, is the coconut in its scent.</li>
            <li>So strong and potent, that I just can&#x27;t breathe when I use it.</li>
            <li>I have very dry curly hair, so I thought this would be perfect.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, easily rinsed out.</li>
            <li>It rinses easily</li>
            <li>It smells really nice, kind of like baby powder but as far as the way it conditions I was dissapointed.</li>
            <li>The conditioner has a pleasing consistency and a fairly strong perfume aroma that dissipates after use.</li>
            <li>The smell was also nice, and lasted for a few days, even after the wash, which was nice and surprising.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fairly feminine clean, floral modern scent that is nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>All in all, a fine product, but not one</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic and easily lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It applied smoothly and rinsed out with ease.</li>
            <li>This is a nice conditioner that works very well to remove tangles from my hair.  </li>
            <li>I just want my hair to be clean and easy to brush.  </li>
            <li>My hair smells very fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While the results I get aren&#x27;t quite on par with the salon shampoos, they do a pretty good job of keeping my hair soft and healthy and without any build up or residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So it does what it says it does, and a decent conditioner (with an amazing smell).</li>
            <li>It is SUPER strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more mellow than a lot of the very flowery stuff meant for women, which is a plus if you try to go easy on the perfumes or you&#x27;re just not in the mood.</li>
            <li>It has a sweet scent that lasts quite a while, lightly floral.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner works great on dry hair.</li>
            <li>Overall I would have to say that this conditioner is good, but there is nothing notably special about it.</li>
            <li>It leaves her hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I think it makes my hair feel nice, but it smells like old lady perfume.</li>
            <li>While it does a good job, especially for the price, it doesn&#x27;t seem as moisturizing as the Macadamia Oil brand conditioner.</li>
            <li>It left no greasy residue and offered good slip.</li>
            <li>It left my hair with lots of shine, bounce, and volume and my fiancee LOVED the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Not bad</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s not a bad thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is on the mild side and not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels better than it does with normal</li>
            <li>After I use this, my hair feels very smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>It feels good going on, but doesn&#x27;t moisturize as expected.</li>
            <li>the scent is pretty mild and neutral (someone compared it to baby powder)</li>
            <li>This is an affordable product good for near daily use that applies easily to the hair and readily rinses out.</li>
            <li>It left my hair soft, tangle free, and free of static electricity.</li>
            <li>It does a good job as a conditioner, leaving the hair silky but not weighted down.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It dries with a good bit less scent than when it is applied.  </li>
            <li>I have had other conditioners leave my hair feeling more silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>but at the price point you can choose something that smells better and does the same job.</li>
            <li>Turns out, that wasn&#x27;t exactly the case</li>
            <li>/&gt;You don&#x27;t get the drastic results that you would with a deep conditioner, but I was pleased with the silky shine that this gave me.</li>
            <li>I prefer the conditioners I use now because I feel the condition more deeply than this one does.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I expect from Dove.</li>
            <li>So the first thing you notice about this conditioner is the smell.</li>
            <li>My hair was nicely conditioned but on a par with other conditioners in its price point.</li>
            <li>It must have secret detangler because it leaves my hair soft, detangled and smelling absolutely awesome.</li>
            <li>(To date for my thick color-treated blonde hair Kevin Murphy&#x27;s products have worked the best.)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s at a good price point, and the ones that make my hair feel nicer is the brand that is much more expensive.</li>
            <li>I found this conditioner to be very moisturizing which was a huge plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;It left my hair feeling very silky and soft, I used it as a deep conditioner and it gave me amazing results.</li>
            <li>My hair gets GREASY quickly so I needed a conditioner that would help with the dry ends but leave my hair clean.</li>
            <li>This conditioner works as well as the Nourishing Oil Care conditioner that I normally use; however, the scent is a very strong baby powder scent which seems very different from the clean, fresh scent of all the other Dove products.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older my hair seems a bit dryer than when I was in the bloom of youth, so I was willing to try this Dove conditioner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Indeed, my very dry ends do feel better.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s thick, rinses out fairly easily, and leaves my hair better than if I didn&#x27;t use any conditioner at all, but not as nice as when I use more expensive stuff.</li>
            <li>This one works very well...</li>
            <li>the mask is too much.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m going to go cheap, then I&#x27;d stick with the regular Pantene or upgrade to Kerastase.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s much, much easier to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In my experience my hair looks softest and healthiest when I use salon brand shampoos and conditioners, especially those that are free of sulfates.</li>
            <li>It really works, and mositurizers the hair well.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to switch up your conditioner, you should really give this one a try.</li>
            <li>It is gentle, but does everything you would expect from the conditioner.</li>
            <li>It felt quite squeaky and straw-like straight from the shower.</li>
            <li>I do not use the term silky very often</li>
            <li>but this conditioner gives my hair a really silky feeling and it&#x27;s also very shiny.  </li>
            <li>I think the product coats my hair very well</li>
            <li>This conditioner is very thick,rich and creamy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfectly reasonable product for what it is.</li>
            <li>It conditions hair nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy build up.</li>
            <li>I mean that good-</li>
            <li>The scent is just ok in my opinion and I will probably stick with the Nourishing Oil Care, and other Dove shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>Generally speaking, coconut isn&#x27;t my favorite, but that&#x27;s just personal preference and not an issue with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though my daughter tends to have skin that is a bit on the oily side, her hair is fine and sometimes dry.</li>
            <li>This is a very creamy white conditioner with what is to me, a mild to moderate perfume strenth, leaning towards mild.  </li>
            <li>Dove Pure Care dry oil conditioner has a host of ingredients to moisturize the hair including a bit of sweet almond and macadamia oils.  </li>
            <li>After using this conditioner, I think it is good but seems more similar to the other Dove conditioner varieties I&#x27;ve used in the past vs. the Macadamia Oil brand shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I am slowly transitioning to organic and natural products both in my beauty routine and my diet but have yet to find a good organic conditioner that leaves hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>As to how my hair felt after I would say it is a good but not great conditioner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think this conditioner would be most helpful to person with only slightly dry hair.</li>
            <li>Dove&#x27;s other shampoo&#x27;s/conditioners have a lovely soft scent, so why did they go all &#x27;powdered old woman&#x27; scent with this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>mean really really nice.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s brand new never out of the bag or tangled once.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Gross, skip it because the scent makes it not worth it, otherwise it is fine...</li>
            <li>conditioner did nothing for my ahir except make it smell and weight down my fine hair...</li>
            <li>product does function very much like a regular conditioner.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much shine nor increased volume, but for a good all around basic conditioner, you could do a whole worse than Dove Pure Care Dry Oil Conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have really fine hair and my curls are very tight and with this product, by the second or third day, because it leaves my hair so smooth, my curls are almost beach-wavey.  </li>
            <li>However, my hair did come out fine; it wasn&#x27;t frizzy and definitely helped with the dryness (I have very dry hair).</li>
            <li>The touted ingredient here is an infusion of African Macadamia oil that lends a slightly musky and warm scent reminiscent of talcum powder.</li>
            <li>I had to do too much to put the moisture back into my fine hair before it dried or the hair would tangle.</li>
            <li>I thought this conditioner kept my hair soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling soft, but not oily.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>The conditioner didn&#x27;t have a greasy residue, but still left my hair in really moisturized.</li>
            <li>I tried it a few more times thinking maybe I didn&#x27;t rinse it well enough</li>
            <li>actually, it seemed just like any other cheap conditioner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>had such high hopes too.</li>
            <li>absolutely leaves my long hair silky to the max.  </li>
            <li>After several years of straight hair I have gone back to natural curls.</li>
            <li>and I have tried and liked other Macadamia Oil shampoos and conditioners in the past like the Macadamia Oil brand.</li>
            <li>B00HM6K6XQ Dove Pure Care Dry Oil Conditioner, 12 Ounce]]</li>
            <li>I am a convert to Doves Pure Care Dry Oil Conditioner.</li>
            <li>If you have dry hair, this really works.</li>
            <li>Most conditioners I can get my hair to be smooth and untangled in the shower, but not with this stuff :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But overall as long as you have reasonable expectations</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not a hair fiddler; I use basic products and my expectations are modest.</li>
            <li>conditioner left my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>If you like strong fragrances this is for you, but I prefer subtle.</li>
            <li>But it was a very flat soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know how consumers can give anything other than a subjective review of a product such as this.</li>
            <li>I bought this the other day at WM because I have liked other Dove products in the past.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is thick and creamy and does an adequate job of conditioning my hair.</li>

            <li> All in all, a fine product, but not one</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic and easily lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It applied smoothly and rinsed out with ease.</li>
            <li> This is a nice conditioner that works very well to remove tangles from my hair.  </li>
            <li> I just want my hair to be clean and easy to brush.  </li>
            <li> My hair smells very fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While the results I get aren&#x27;t quite on par with the salon shampoos, they do a pretty good job of keeping my hair soft and healthy and without any build up or residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So it does what it says it does, and a decent conditioner (with an amazing smell).</li>
            <li> It is SUPER strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more mellow than a lot of the very flowery stuff meant for women, which is a plus if you try to go easy on the perfumes or you&#x27;re just not in the mood.</li>
            <li> It has a sweet scent that lasts quite a while, lightly floral.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner works great on dry hair.</li>
            <li> Overall I would have to say that this conditioner is good, but there is nothing notably special about it.</li>
            <li> It leaves her hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I think it makes my hair feel nice, but it smells like old lady perfume.</li>
            <li> While it does a good job, especially for the price, it doesn&#x27;t seem as moisturizing as the Macadamia Oil brand conditioner.</li>
            <li> It left no greasy residue and offered good slip.</li>
            <li> It left my hair with lots of shine, bounce, and volume and my fiancee LOVED the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Not bad</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not a bad thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is on the mild side and not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels better than it does with normal</li>
            <li> After I use this, my hair feels very smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> It feels good going on, but doesn&#x27;t moisturize as expected.</li>
            <li> the scent is pretty mild and neutral (someone compared it to baby powder)</li>
            <li> This is an affordable product good for near daily use that applies easily to the hair and readily rinses out.</li>
            <li> It left my hair soft, tangle free, and free of static electricity.</li>
            <li> It does a good job as a conditioner, leaving the hair silky but not weighted down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It dries with a good bit less scent than when it is applied.  </li>
            <li> I have had other conditioners leave my hair feeling more silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> but at the price point you can choose something that smells better and does the same job.</li>
            <li> Turns out, that wasn&#x27;t exactly the case</li>
            <li> /&gt;You don&#x27;t get the drastic results that you would with a deep conditioner, but I was pleased with the silky shine that this gave me.</li>
            <li> I prefer the conditioners I use now because I feel the condition more deeply than this one does.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expect from Dove.</li>
            <li> So the first thing you notice about this conditioner is the smell.</li>
            <li> My hair was nicely conditioned but on a par with other conditioners in its price point.</li>
            <li> It must have secret detangler because it leaves my hair soft, detangled and smelling absolutely awesome.</li>
            <li> (To date for my thick color-treated blonde hair Kevin Murphy&#x27;s products have worked the best.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s at a good price point, and the ones that make my hair feel nicer is the brand that is much more expensive.</li>
            <li> I found this conditioner to be very moisturizing which was a huge plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;It left my hair feeling very silky and soft, I used it as a deep conditioner and it gave me amazing results.</li>
            <li> My hair gets GREASY quickly so I needed a conditioner that would help with the dry ends but leave my hair clean.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works as well as the Nourishing Oil Care conditioner that I normally use; however, the scent is a very strong baby powder scent which seems very different from the clean, fresh scent of all the other Dove products.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older my hair seems a bit dryer than when I was in the bloom of youth, so I was willing to try this Dove conditioner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Indeed, my very dry ends do feel better.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s thick, rinses out fairly easily, and leaves my hair better than if I didn&#x27;t use any conditioner at all, but not as nice as when I use more expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> This one works very well...</li>
            <li> the mask is too much.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m going to go cheap, then I&#x27;d stick with the regular Pantene or upgrade to Kerastase.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s much, much easier to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In my experience my hair looks softest and healthiest when I use salon brand shampoos and conditioners, especially those that are free of sulfates.</li>
            <li> It really works, and mositurizers the hair well.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to switch up your conditioner, you should really give this one a try.</li>
            <li> It is gentle, but does everything you would expect from the conditioner.</li>
            <li> It felt quite squeaky and straw-like straight from the shower.</li>
            <li> I do not use the term silky very often</li>
            <li> but this conditioner gives my hair a really silky feeling and it&#x27;s also very shiny.  </li>
            <li> I think the product coats my hair very well</li>
            <li> This conditioner is very thick,rich and creamy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfectly reasonable product for what it is.</li>
            <li> It conditions hair nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy build up.</li>
            <li> I mean that good-</li>
            <li> The scent is just ok in my opinion and I will probably stick with the Nourishing Oil Care, and other Dove shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> Generally speaking, coconut isn&#x27;t my favorite, but that&#x27;s just personal preference and not an issue with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though my daughter tends to have skin that is a bit on the oily side, her hair is fine and sometimes dry.</li>
            <li> This is a very creamy white conditioner with what is to me, a mild to moderate perfume strenth, leaning towards mild.  </li>
            <li> Dove Pure Care dry oil conditioner has a host of ingredients to moisturize the hair including a bit of sweet almond and macadamia oils.  </li>
            <li> After using this conditioner, I think it is good but seems more similar to the other Dove conditioner varieties I&#x27;ve used in the past vs. the Macadamia Oil brand shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I am slowly transitioning to organic and natural products both in my beauty routine and my diet but have yet to find a good organic conditioner that leaves hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> As to how my hair felt after I would say it is a good but not great conditioner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think this conditioner would be most helpful to person with only slightly dry hair.</li>
            <li> Dove&#x27;s other shampoo&#x27;s/conditioners have a lovely soft scent, so why did they go all &#x27;powdered old woman&#x27; scent with this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> mean really really nice.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s brand new never out of the bag or tangled once.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Gross, skip it because the scent makes it not worth it, otherwise it is fine...</li>
            <li> conditioner did nothing for my ahir except make it smell and weight down my fine hair...</li>
            <li> product does function very much like a regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much shine nor increased volume, but for a good all around basic conditioner, you could do a whole worse than Dove Pure Care Dry Oil Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have really fine hair and my curls are very tight and with this product, by the second or third day, because it leaves my hair so smooth, my curls are almost beach-wavey.  </li>
            <li> However, my hair did come out fine; it wasn&#x27;t frizzy and definitely helped with the dryness (I have very dry hair).</li>
            <li> The touted ingredient here is an infusion of African Macadamia oil that lends a slightly musky and warm scent reminiscent of talcum powder.</li>
            <li> I had to do too much to put the moisture back into my fine hair before it dried or the hair would tangle.</li>
            <li> I thought this conditioner kept my hair soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling soft, but not oily.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> The conditioner didn&#x27;t have a greasy residue, but still left my hair in really moisturized.</li>
            <li> I tried it a few more times thinking maybe I didn&#x27;t rinse it well enough</li>
            <li> actually, it seemed just like any other cheap conditioner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> had such high hopes too.</li>
            <li> absolutely leaves my long hair silky to the max.  </li>
            <li> After several years of straight hair I have gone back to natural curls.</li>
            <li> and I have tried and liked other Macadamia Oil shampoos and conditioners in the past like the Macadamia Oil brand.</li>
            <li> B00HM6K6XQ Dove Pure Care Dry Oil Conditioner, 12 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> I am a convert to Doves Pure Care Dry Oil Conditioner.</li>
            <li> If you have dry hair, this really works.</li>
            <li> Most conditioners I can get my hair to be smooth and untangled in the shower, but not with this stuff :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But overall as long as you have reasonable expectations</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not a hair fiddler; I use basic products and my expectations are modest.</li>
            <li> conditioner left my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> If you like strong fragrances this is for you, but I prefer subtle.</li>
            <li> But it was a very flat soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how consumers can give anything other than a subjective review of a product such as this.</li>
            <li> I bought this the other day at WM because I have liked other Dove products in the past.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is thick and creamy and does an adequate job of conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is normal, so I&#x27;m not certain how it would perform for someone that actually has dry hair, but I have since added it to my collection of conditioners.</li>
            <li> After battling dry, damaged, over processed hair for the last 2 years, I finally found a product that makes a difference!</li>
            <li> I recently have been looking for a new conditioner that will make my curly hair less dry in this California heat.  </li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t notice it, I just knew there was SOMETHING about it that was keeping me from loving this conditioner, but after using it for a few days, that got worse and worse.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still not quite enough for my dry hair</li>
            <li> Different conditioners and treatments give me different results and when I want loose shiny curls, this is where I will look!!  </li>
            <li> Nothing in particular to love about it or hate about it...</li>
            <li> (I think it is unfair to expect a drug store conditioner to work as well as a salon conditioner given the huge price difference)</li>
            <li> The journey from naturally dark brown to blonde and back again took its toll on my fine,medium length hair.</li>
            <li> ONLY complaint is that it did leave my hair with tons of frizzy fly-aways, and I normally don&#x27;t have a lot.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is lovely, and the texture is thick and cold creamy, so you really feel like it&#x27;s doing something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is a much better product and less expensive.</li>
            <li> No matter which I use the results seem very similar for me and my hair type, but obviously hair types can vary so my results may not be typical.</li>
            <li> She has tried various conditioners from Pantene and Suave, and this product from Dove worked as well as products from those other lines.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t necessarily see a discernible difference between this conditioner and other Dove conditioners I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> my hair felt just as dry on the ends as it did before I used this conditioner...</li>
            <li> (Some conditioners will make my hair take all night to dry, this one did</li>
            <li> Works well with the shampoo and Dry Oil treatment.</li>
            <li> I have rough,extremely dry ,and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> If you have extremely dry hair like mine</li>
            <li> While the Dove Dry Oil does not make my hair feel greasy, but does make it feel not feel as nourished as I would have expected.</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner about 4 times a week to prevent hair from getting dry due to repeated shampoo use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was curious to try [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t detangle with this in my hair even with my hair sopping wet.</li>
            <li> There are no instructions other than to apply to wet hair, so I made some up.  </li>
            <li> It was a little thick going on, but that is neither good nor bad, just depends on what you like.</li>
            <li> This made my hair extremely frizzy and poufy.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very careful about how I condition it.</li>
            <li> I was very curious as to how this conditioner would function.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling filmy and looking dull.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, and it leaves it with lots of volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair subject to frizz</li>
            <li> I also tried it for a co-wash without a shampoo and it was just a mess.</li>
            <li> This Dove conditioning product is targeted to those who want to add silkiness and shine to otherwise dull, dry hair.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair shiny without looking oily and it helps my dead ends.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair heavy and greasy, but also doesn&#x27;t moisturize well.</li>
            <li> After trying out a few oil products, I have come to the conclusion my hair does not like it at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s thick enough that it wont run all over the place while trying to put it on my hair but not so thick that it&#x27;s hard to spread.  </li>
            <li> so I usually use a mask conditioner</li>
            <li> Nothing hard or sticky.</li>
            <li> They all leave it dull, fimly and BLAAAH...</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing really bad about it, it just also doesn&#x27;t stand out in a big way either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s thick and creamy - it feels almost like cold cream going on.  </li>
            <li> but it is unlikely I would go out of my way to use another bottle.</li>
            <li> I was incredibly wrong.</li>
            <li> Well, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe that was bad, but he explained, &amp;#34;No,</li>
            <li> This conditioner wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I used this for about 2 weeks, but had to stop because my hair looked awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After battling dry, damaged, over processed hair for the last 2 years, I finally found a product that makes a difference! I have tried EVERYTHING! I do deep conditioning masks, oil treatments...Nothing has a lasting effect on my hair. After using this product (along with the shampoo) for a week, my hair is softer than it has been in years and feels noticeably healthier! I am very pleased with this and will be using it from now on!</li>
            <li> Love this!  For a non salon hair product that is inexpensive - i think it&#x27;s one of the best conditioners out there.</li>
            <li> I personally find the smell horrible..and it lingers in your hair...all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner did nothing for my ahir except make it smell and weight down my fine hair...my hair felt just as dry on the ends as it did before I used this conditioner...Most conditioners I can get my hair to be smooth and untangled in the shower, but not with this stuff :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had such high hopes too.</li>
            <li> This Dove conditioning product is targeted to those who want to add silkiness and shine to otherwise dull, dry hair. This is an affordable product good for near daily use that applies easily to the hair and readily rinses out. The touted ingredient here is an infusion of African Macadamia oil that lends a slightly musky and warm scent reminiscent of talcum powder.</li>
            <li> I wondered what a &amp;#34;Dry Oil&amp;#34; conditioner would feel like... actually, it seemed just like any other cheap conditioner I&#x27;ve used. Nothing in particular to love about it or hate about it... the scent is pretty mild and neutral (someone compared it to baby powder), it&#x27;s thick, rinses out fairly easily, and leaves my hair better than if I didn&#x27;t use any conditioner at all, but not as nice as when I use more expensive stuff. I didn&#x27;t have the experience of my hair being &amp;#34;five times silkier&amp;#34; as claimed, and it&#x27;s just okay at detangling. All in all, a fine product, but not one I&#x27;d go out of my way to purchase.</li>
            <li> daughter says it works really good</li>
            <li> holygrail conditioner</li>
            <li> My hair gets GREASY quickly so I needed a conditioner that would help with the dry ends but leave my hair clean. This one works very well... It keeps my hair shiny without looking oily and it helps my dead ends. It&#x27;s still not quite enough for my dry hair so I usually use a mask conditioner but it works for the rest of my hair perfectly in the places the mask is too much. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I got this to use on my daughter&#x27;s hair. I apply liberally and it never disappoints. It leaves her hair nice and soft. The smell is fantastic and easily lasts all day. If you have dry hair, this really works.</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny, healthy and radiant looking.  Loving it.</li>
            <li> The journey from naturally dark brown to blonde and back again took its toll on my fine,medium length hair. The inclusion of macadamia and coconut oil held the promise of the silky, healthy hair that has eluded me for years. The conditioner has a pleasing consistency and a fairly strong perfume aroma that dissipates after use. It applied smoothly and rinsed out with ease. My hair was nicely conditioned but on a par with other conditioners in its price point. It is an adequate, not exceptional conditioner and the addition of the exotic oils failed to elevate its performance. Not bad but it is unlikely I would go out of my way to use another bottle.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. This conditioner made my hair blonde curly hair feel (and look) like a bale of hay. If I&#x27;m going to go cheap, then I&#x27;d stick with the regular Pantene or upgrade to Kerastase.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has a nice fragrance. It is on the mild side and not too overpowering. The conditioner is thick and creamy and does an adequate job of conditioning my hair. It rinses well and does not leave my hair feeling greasy.  Overall I would have to say that this conditioner is good, but there is nothing notably special about it.</li>
            <li> I want to love this conditioner. I think it makes my hair feel nice, but it smells like old lady perfume. So strong and potent, that I just can&#x27;t breathe when I use it. I gave it three stars because like I said, as a conditioner it does a great job - but that smell...yikes. Dove&#x27;s other shampoo&#x27;s/conditioners have a lovely soft scent, so why did they go all &#x27;powdered old woman&#x27; scent with this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gross, skip it because the scent makes it not worth it, otherwise it is fine...but at the price point you can choose something that smells better and does the same job.</li>
            <li> This is a nice conditioner that works very well to remove tangles from my hair.  After I use this, my hair feels very smooth and soft.  And it&#x27;s much, much easier to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes scents can make me gag in the shower, but this one is nice and not too strong.  My hair smells very fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s thick enough that it wont run all over the place while trying to put it on my hair but not so thick that it&#x27;s hard to spread.  It&#x27;s a good conditioner and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> Though my daughter tends to have skin that is a bit on the oily side, her hair is fine and sometimes dry. She has tried various conditioners from Pantene and Suave, and this product from Dove worked as well as products from those other lines. This condition smells nice and she seems to like it. I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is a good reminder that you get what you pay for. It feels good going on, but doesn&#x27;t moisturize as expected. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair heavy and greasy, but also doesn&#x27;t moisturize well. My biggest deterrent to using this product again is the fragrance. It is SUPER strong. If you like strong fragrances this is for you, but I prefer subtle. All in all, if probably give it 2.5 stars.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like this conditioner because I have curly kinky hair and I&#x27;m very careful about how I condition it. I was incredibly wrong. This is some great, great stuff. The only thing I wish it had was a leave-in option. It must have secret detangler because it leaves my hair soft, detangled and smelling absolutely awesome. I use it as an alternative to the specialty conditioners. It&#x27;s cost effective, good to my hair, and it feels like a spa treatment in a bottle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how consumers can give anything other than a subjective review of a product such as this. I&#x27;m sure scientists can measure all sorts of things, but all I can say is the product worked well with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a hair fiddler; I use basic products and my expectations are modest. I just want my hair to be clean and easy to brush.  During the colder months I started using conditioner again because of static electricity. As I&#x27;ve gotten older my hair seems a bit dryer than when I was in the bloom of youth, so I was willing to try this Dove conditioner. I think it worked wonderfully. Easy to apply, easily rinsed out. It left my hair soft, tangle free, and free of static electricity.</li>
            <li> In my experience my hair looks softest and healthiest when I use salon brand shampoos and conditioners, especially those that are free of sulfates. (To date for my thick color-treated blonde hair Kevin Murphy&#x27;s products have worked the best.) But when I&#x27;m on a budget or convenience-minded I&#x27;ve found the Dove shampoos and conditioners to be great for the money. While the results I get aren&#x27;t quite on par with the salon shampoos, they do a pretty good job of keeping my hair soft and healthy and without any build up or residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was curious to try [[ASIN:B00HM6K6XQ Dove Pure Care Dry Oil Conditioner, 12 Ounce]] because it is said to contain African Macadamia Oil and I have tried and liked other Macadamia Oil shampoos and conditioners in the past like the Macadamia Oil brand. Dove Oxygen Moisture Conditioner.  After using this conditioner, I think it is good but seems more similar to the other Dove conditioner varieties I&#x27;ve used in the past vs. the Macadamia Oil brand shampoo.  While it does a good job, especially for the price, it doesn&#x27;t seem as moisturizing as the Macadamia Oil brand conditioner. I couldn&#x27;t necessarily see a discernible difference between this conditioner and other Dove conditioners I&#x27;ve tried. No matter which I use the results seem very similar for me and my hair type, but obviously hair types can vary so my results may not be typical. But overall as long as you have reasonable expectations (I think it is unfair to expect a drug store conditioner to work as well as a salon conditioner given the huge price difference) I think it is a solid conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is a very creamy white conditioner with what is to me, a mild to moderate perfume strenth, leaning towards mild.  It&#x27;s a fairly feminine clean, floral modern scent that is nice.&lt;br /&gt;It absolutely leaves my long hair silky to the max.  I had my son feel it and he said &amp;#34;It feels like a Halloween wig.&amp;#34;  I thought maybe that was bad, but he explained, &amp;#34;No, I mean that good- it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s brand new never out of the bag or tangled once.&amp;#34;  Yes, my hair is UBER soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s thick and creamy - it feels almost like cold cream going on.  It rinses easily and I didn&#x27;t notice any extended drying time for an air-dry.  (Some conditioners will make my hair take all night to dry, this one did NOT.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down, and it leaves it with lots of volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ONLY complaint is that it did leave my hair with tons of frizzy fly-aways, and I normally don&#x27;t have a lot.  At first I didn&#x27;t notice it, I just knew there was SOMETHING about it that was keeping me from loving this conditioner, but after using it for a few days, that got worse and worse.  I added some smoothing serum and now it&#x27;s better, but that is a drawback to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dries with a good bit less scent than when it is applied.  The fragrance lasts about a day.</li>
            <li> I thought this conditioner kept my hair soft and supple. Nothing hard or sticky. I thought it was a really good product.</li>
            <li> great scent- I use this conditioner about 4 times a week to prevent hair from getting dry due to repeated shampoo use.  It really works, and mositurizers the hair well.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I was very curious as to how this conditioner would function. With the oil, I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would venture into uncharted territory for my hair care. Turns out, that wasn&#x27;t exactly the case but that&#x27;s not a bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does function very much like a regular conditioner. It smells good and it has a good texture to it. My hair tends to be a bit frizzy from chlorine and I definitely saw results with that. My hair looks and feels better than it does with normal conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t get the drastic results that you would with a deep conditioner, but I was pleased with the silky shine that this gave me. If you&#x27;re looking to switch up your conditioner, you should really give this one a try. You get a good value and it will likely have you feeling great about your hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner wasn&#x27;t bad. If I couldn&#x27;t find my regular conditioners, then I would definitely use this one. It conditions hair nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy build up. I prefer the conditioners I use now because I feel the condition more deeply than this one does. The biggest pro on this item is the scent. I love it! It&#x27;s kind of smells like baby powder and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This is a nice conditioner and works well. It is exactly what I expect from Dove. It is gentle, but does everything you would expect from the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have kinky and coily hair like pen springs. The strands are very fine. I thought the oil infusion would be great, but it really did nothing. I couldn&#x27;t detangle with this in my hair even with my hair sopping wet. It felt quite squeaky and straw-like straight from the shower. I had to do too much to put the moisture back into my fine hair before it dried or the hair would tangle.</li>
            <li> I recently have been looking for a new conditioner that will make my curly hair less dry in this California heat.  I do not use the term silky very often but this conditioner gives my hair a really silky feeling and it&#x27;s also very shiny.  I think the product coats my hair very well and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair subject to frizz AT ALL.  This is very surprising for me and very rare.  I have really fine hair and my curls are very tight and with this product, by the second or third day, because it leaves my hair so smooth, my curls are almost beach-wavey.  I like it for that reason, but it&#x27;s not a product I will use every shower.  Different conditioners and treatments give me different results and when I want loose shiny curls, this is where I will look!!  Very happy with the product overall and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling soft, but not oily. Works well with the shampoo and Dry Oil treatment.</li>
            <li> I have very dry curly hair, so I thought this would be perfect. Well, I was wrong. This made my hair extremely frizzy and poufy.  I was very disappointed. I used this for about 2 weeks, but had to stop because my hair looked awful.</li>
            <li> I bought this the other day at WM because I have liked other Dove products in the past. It smells really nice, kind of like baby powder but as far as the way it conditions I was dissapointed. It left my hair feeling filmy and looking dull. I tried it a few more times thinking maybe I didn&#x27;t rinse it well enough but I got the same results each time. I switched back to the Sauve Humectant that I was using before and it is a much better product and less expensive. Leaves my hair soft and shiny. I am slowly transitioning to organic and natural products both in my beauty routine and my diet but have yet to find a good organic conditioner that leaves hair soft and shiny. They all leave it dull, fimly and BLAAAH... So if anyone knows of a good organic conditioner that does what a conditioner is suppose to do, let me know! Have tried Yes 2 Carrots, Burts Bees, and Shea Moisture but none of them worked for me although I do like the Yes 2 Carrots shampoo a lot.</li>
            <li> So the first thing you notice about this conditioner is the smell. It has a wonderful smell,&lt;br /&gt;I mean really really nice. I really liked that. It was a little thick going on, but that is neither good nor bad, just depends on what you like. As to how my hair felt after I would say it is a good but not great conditioner. I have had other conditioners leave my hair feeling more silky and smooth. However, my hair did come out fine; it wasn&#x27;t frizzy and definitely helped with the dryness (I have very dry hair). So it does what it says it does, and a decent conditioner (with an amazing smell). It&#x27;s at a good price point, and the ones that make my hair feel nicer is the brand that is much more expensive. So for the price, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Dove Pure Care dry oil conditioner has a host of ingredients to moisturize the hair including a bit of sweet almond and macadamia oils.  It has a sweet scent that lasts quite a while, lightly floral.  It does a good job as a conditioner, leaving the hair silky but not weighted down.</li>
            <li> I found this conditioner to be very moisturizing which was a huge plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;It left my hair feeling very silky and soft, I used it as a deep conditioner and it gave me amazing results. It is infused with Coconut and Macadamia oil which smells great. It left no greasy residue and offered good slip. I am pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> After several years of straight hair I have gone back to natural curls. Curls need moisture and more moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner left my hair feeling soft. But it was a very flat soft. It didn&#x27;t help with tangles and it smooshed my curls. It smells heavenly though. I also tried it for a co-wash without a shampoo and it was just a mess.</li>
            <li> I am a convert to Doves Pure Care Dry Oil Conditioner. I used this conditioner after using a henna treatment on my hair. The conditioner didn&#x27;t have a greasy residue, but still left my hair in really moisturized. The smell was also nice, and lasted for a few days, even after the wash, which was nice and surprising. I will purchase this in the future.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this one. I used it alone as a conditioner (without shampooing) and I was well pleased. It left my hair with lots of shine, bounce, and volume and my fiancee LOVED the fragrance. My hair is normal, so I&#x27;m not certain how it would perform for someone that actually has dry hair, but I have since added it to my collection of conditioners. This one was A#1 for me!</li>
            <li> Given to my girlfriend as a gift. She likes this conditioner; it smells nice and works well with her fine hair.</li>
            <li> There are no instructions other than to apply to wet hair, so I made some up.  I glopped about a tablespoon on the ends of my hair after shampooing, counted to thirty and then rinsed.  The fragrance is lovely, and the texture is thick and cold creamy, so you really feel like it&#x27;s doing something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indeed, my very dry ends do feel better.  I haven&#x27;t noticed much shine nor increased volume, but for a good all around basic conditioner, you could do a whole worse than Dove Pure Care Dry Oil Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this conditioner. I have rough,extremely dry ,and frizzy hair. My hair is a challenge for any conditioner.&lt;br /&gt; This conditioner is very thick,rich and creamy. The scent is wonderful. You can feel the oil in this conditioner. One would think it would leave your hair moist and well conditioned. Sadly, it only helped a bit with my dryness and was no help at all with the tangles. I felt no silkyness.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this conditioner would be most helpful to person with only slightly dry hair. If you have extremely dry hair like mine you will need to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> From my daughter: I have been using Dove shampoos, conditioners and soap for the last few years and really like using them. They never leave any build-up and my hair never seems to have any complaints when I use Dove products. This conditioner works as well as the Nourishing Oil Care conditioner that I normally use; however, the scent is a very strong baby powder scent which seems very different from the clean, fresh scent of all the other Dove products. The scent is just ok in my opinion and I will probably stick with the Nourishing Oil Care, and other Dove shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> This does a pretty good job of softening and helping my hair stay nice. It&#x27;s most striking feature to me, though, is the coconut in its scent. It&#x27;s more mellow than a lot of the very flowery stuff meant for women, which is a plus if you try to go easy on the perfumes or you&#x27;re just not in the mood. Generally speaking, coconut isn&#x27;t my favorite, but that&#x27;s just personal preference and not an issue with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing really bad about it, it just also doesn&#x27;t stand out in a big way either. It&#x27;s a perfectly reasonable product for what it is.</li>
            <li> After trying out a few oil products, I have come to the conclusion my hair does not like it at all. While the Dove Dry Oil does not make my hair feel greasy, but does make it feel not feel as nourished as I would have expected. It is not for me.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works great on dry hair. Very smooth and smells lovely!</li>
