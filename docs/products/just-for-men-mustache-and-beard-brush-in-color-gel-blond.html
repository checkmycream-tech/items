            <li>Great product at a great price</li>
            <li>I have used the scalp version for years and it worked great.  </li>

            <li>works great..</li>
            <li>, this one works great:  JUST FOR MEN Autostop Hair Color, Medium Brown (on your beard and stache).</li>
            <li>/&gt;So if you have the time and interest you can do a really great and reproducible job at home which I do not believe can matched by a professional.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;So if you have the time and interest you can do a really great and reproducible job at home which I do not believe can matched by a professional.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great, doesn&#x27;t even stain my hands when applied.</li>
            <li>Good product - GREAT service from Amazon</li>
            <li>Good stuff...used for years...</li>
            <li>It does the job &amp; is probably the best available product.  </li>
            <li>and I am good to go.  </li>
            <li>Better than shaving each day!</li>
            <li>Does the job in 5 minutes, cannot say anything more about it than that!  </li>
            <li>I get a reaction that doesn&#x27;t preclude me for using it, but it does trigger some kind of allergy.</li>
            <li>I bought this a year ago and never used it, thinking it was kind of vain to color my beard.  </li>
            <li>It handles greying hair nicely otherwise though...</li>
            <li>(I wish hair dying was this easy!).</li>
            <li>great product at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows and lashes are very light.</li>
            <li>We received this product free for an honest review.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping Great Price</li>
            <li>Sure wish the price would drop....but I purchase anyway.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to see it is now available from Amazon â€“ and at a bargain price!</li>
            <li>I use this product and I love the price.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent product that I&#x27;ve been using for several years.</li>
            <li>In most folks if you follow directions, it will work as promised</li>
            <li>The side of my head is the most gray.</li>
            <li>I use it in two ways: I&#x27;m an entertainer and before a showcase or if I&#x27;m videotaping a demo I always make sure I use the color.</li>
            <li>but all I know is that I can use this and have for more than 15 years and love it.</li>
            <li>In fact, they&#x27;re now MORE visible because of the increased darkness of the non-gray hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;JFM seemed to work ok.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use this any more.</li>
            <li>used this product for about a year and was moderately pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I trim my beard before application which is more efficient.</li>
            <li>but I can see some improvement in volume and most of all I haven&#x27;t been losing any additional hair..</li>
            <li>after all, gray can look fantastic!</li>
            <li>Perhaps if you leave it in for more than 5 minutes, it might remove more of the gray.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>But of course, you will have to use more product each</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did because the stuff will darken you beard</li>
            <li>The thing that makes this work so much better than the stuff for your hair is the consistency of it</li>
            <li>Its nothing spectacular like a full head of hair</li>
            <li>The old formula was great.  </li>
            <li>old formula was great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is supremely easy to use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Super easy to wash out, works even without shampooing afterwards like recommended.</li>
            <li>Even after the protective instructions--it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use - about 7 minutes once a week for me (2 minutes to apply, 5 minutes to wait before showering.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is an easy product to use and my husband has used it for years.  </li>
            <li>Fast and effective.</li>
            <li>just started using it to even out my beard and stash,,so far so good...</li>
            <li>(I really don&#x27;t mind looking older, but if my wife is happy, I&#x27;m happy.)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>, so I&#x27;m not taking any stars away from the 4 I originally gave it.</li>
            <li>The color looks very good and it goes on without a mess,</li>
            <li>I use this instead of the full hair rinse.</li>
            <li>I have used this product before, but until now have been paying full retail for it.</li>
            <li>and I use more of it because the goatee is much longer.</li>
            <li>This is much better than using any brow pencil as it lasts much longer and doesn&#x27;t run/fade with sweat.  </li>
            <li>tops 3 uses out of the box, it would be nice if they offered a larger size.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, easy to use, 5 minutes your done and on its way.</li>
            <li>; If you choose to send, then they have the right to freely post and use for their marketing without notifying you.</li>
            <li>Good luck explaining that to your significant other when you&#x27;re kissing and they end up with a mouthful of whiskers...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not aware of anything better, but while it definitely has a great effect and it helps a lot, it doesn&#x27;t seem to effect all the all the hair you color, which is why I&#x27;m giving it a 3, because that should be it&#x27;s primary</li>
            <li>I used Just For Men for a little over a month with great results.</li>
            <li>There is not doubt that it works well for coloring my beard, however, like many others, I developed some type of reaction.</li>
            <li>(actually, it looks more blond or light brown than gray,</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t overpower the beard hair that is brown, it just seems to be absorbed to the gray/white.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps not, if it is long hair that the color easily takes to, sure.</li>
            <li>I think 6 minutes is the right amount for me.  </li>
            <li>get one thats just right.</li>
            <li>After years of use, I am starting to develop a mild skin allergy and itching, but the product still looks good and natural in color.</li>
            <li>Works great... quick &amp; easy, would recommend you go a shade lighter than your actual hair color, looks more natural &amp; lets a little gray through</li>
            <li>It can go from light tan to inky black, but amazingly, the coloration properties of the application once you have shampooed will be identical.</li>
            <li>It can go from light tan to inky black, but amazingly, the coloration properties of the application once you have shampooed will be identical.</li>
            <li>and you have to do things in  a certain order to get the most natural results.</li>
            <li>new stuff has hugely stronger peroxide, which does sting.</li>
            <li>Great product, my beard is almost white, after using this product back to brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leave it go, and I guarantee you will walk into the kitchen at work and be able to silence the entire room, because whomever is in there will be giggling about The Mistake You Made with That Beard Dye.</li>
            <li>The color comes out MUCH DARKER than what is show on the box!</li>
            <li>At first severe itching started and then my skin began to peel like severe dandruff of the face.</li>
            <li>: I have seen some reviews of the Just for Men products that they do not color short hair well and leaves the gray hair more of a copper color.</li>
            <li>For many years I&#x27;ve been using this on my regular hair.</li>
            <li>I used the product exactly according to the directions.  </li>
            <li>Instead it looks pretty</li>
            <li>note, is absolutely wear the gloves!</li>
            <li>Consistently works well for my needs.</li>
            <li>I have used &amp;#34;Just for Men&amp;#34; for several years and am well pleased.  </li>
            <li>About four hours in, my entire face surrounding my beard is bright red and</li>
            <li>Search the internet and you will find many consumer complaints about long term damage to skin from using this product.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great product, and I do recommend, just pay attention, because even medium brown was much darker than expected</li>
            <li>Great and easy to use with little mess</li>
            <li>The 3-pack price is much better than single retail.  </li>
            <li>nice little touch up....</li>
            <li>Instructions had lots of warnings that you might be allergic to it or your skin might be very irritated by it, and that it could stain anything and everything around you.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>That hair tends to lose the coloring much faster than the rest.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is definitely a learning curve, but once you master it you can get fantastic results .</li>
            <li>when you use a portion of the tubes and re-open them , the product turns much darker.</li>
            <li>She loves it and wants me to keep using it.  </li>
            <li>From a distance now it looks like I have a real beard, not mange.  </li>
            <li>I decided that I wasn&#x27;t ready for straight-white and didn&#x27;t want to ditch the goatee.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to get the right color (I got a little lighter than I thought that I needed) and follow the directions and all will be well.  </li>
            <li>While it certainly darkened my beard, the color faded rather quickly and reapplication was necessary after about five days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of course, Just for Men says not to use this \\&quot;specially formulated\\&quot; product on your regular hair.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t use it, my hair is in parts light brown to grey.</li>
            <li>It leaves just a bit of the gray, so it looks natural, not fake.  </li>
            <li>Amazing side effect is that when I meet new people they usually guess that I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s (really 75).</li>
            <li>I am 53, and my beard is salt &amp; pepper (really, mostly gray), and from a distance it looks like half a beard.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>After initially going on as Medium Brown, the color quickly fades - particularly after exposure to sun, especially in a convertible - to a shade between Rick Astley and the leprechaun of Lucky Charms cereal fame.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s for mustache and beard it comes with a tiny brush, which I use to do my temples, sideburns them randomly on top and in the back.</li>
            <li>though that may be because of the particular way my beard grows not because of a problem with the product.</li>
            <li>The way I deal to avoid itching on my side burns and upper beard and itchy bumps at the top of my scalp is to rub in a little steroid cream such as triamcinalone or betamethasone (I have not tried cortisone OTC strength)to those areas immediately after application, or better yet, beforehand</li>
            <li>What started off as a good enough experience turned sour after something has clearly changed with their formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>6 minutes, it leaves just a little gray (more natural).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Considering the price , You can&#x27;t give feedback direct to the company cause they have legal terms &amp; conditions posted on their web site &amp;#34;We do not accept...</li>
            <li>By the next day&#x27;s shower the skin staining should be pretty much gone.</li>
            <li>It was pretty easy and I will use it again but next time for only 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE; After going through cancer treatment my skin became very sensitive and I can no longer use this product as it now causes blisters on the skin under the hair, even when I&#x27;m super careful not to touch my skin with the dye and wash thoroughly after.</li>
            <li>Does stain the skin a bit, so use it on a day where you don&#x27;t need to go out in public right away.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it looks more natural with a little gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>I used this stuff for years no problem,but the new one stinks,burns me all up</li>
            <li>The new formula feels like acid on your skin.  </li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s what I live with.  </li>
            <li>For new users, suggest 5-minutes and then wash off.</li>
            <li>Even bought the Just For Men Shampoo hoping it would last longer, but it didn&#x27;t really help much.</li>
            <li>Some reddish, some darker, some lighter, some gray- very natural looking.</li>
            <li>I finally finished my first box.</li>
            <li>some are too dark, some are too light...</li>
            <li>It sticks on your beard vs running down your face which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>Doing so, I only mix a thimble full each week and one package will last me 6 weeks or so.  </li>
            <li>new formulation probably saves them a few pennies, which is a drop in the bucket compared to the huge loss of revenue as longtime users like me abandon this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>wish there was an effective, less irritating color kit available for men.</li>
            <li>Different areas of your beard and hair are more or less sensitive to the color</li>
            <li>It looked clear going on, and I wondered if it would do anything.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have ZERO problems with it..</li>
            <li>I have used the regular comb in and shampoo products on my head, and it really does look natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then I use the beard and mustache product on the sides to complete the coloring for that shorter hair.</li>
            <li>Just a tip that really works, if anyone else has the same problem.</li>
            <li>if only the product were  not irritating.f note when you use a portion of the tubes and re-open them , the product turns much darker.</li>
            <li>if only the product were  not irritating.</li>
            <li>Since the hair on my head is mostly brown (at least for now) I decided to try the Just for Men</li>
            <li>It looked so natural that it took my wife 2 days to notice I did it.  </li>
            <li>It looks natural, yet darker.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend it for someone with sensitive skin or rosacea.</li>
            <li>I love that the product is &#x27;re-usable&#x27; meaning you only use what you need each round until it is gone.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t quite look right on short hair, like if you keep the sides of your hair trimmed low as I do.</li>
            <li>The beard and mustache product is designed to color the smaller more hard to color hair, and that is exactly what the short clipper cut hair on the side of my head is.</li>
            <li>I am a natural blonde whose normal eyebrow color doesn&#x27;t show at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically this product did the exact opposite of what I wanted it to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I used it, I read and re-read the instructions several times.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna try to point the company toward these reviews, because it&#x27;s clear to me that the public doesn&#x27;t like their new</li>
            <li>I will continue using it even if only for the benefit of retaining the little hair I have left.:)</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth it, so I shaved the beard off, and kept the mustache which I slimmed way down to a Clark Gable style.  </li>
            <li>I used it at first every 2 weeks, now in a single weekly application for both beard and hair at the same application( not a separate shampoo product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>we only used less than half to cover my husbands beard, and it was SO VERY EASY to apply and wash out.</li>
            <li>So after using it again, I woke up in the middle of the night with my face itching and burning with an oozing clear liquid leaking from my face.</li>
            <li>I have been growing my beard out for five days thinking the old regular JFM product would take cave of me--</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the bigger problem with this is after a while I developed skin irritation, and now have to stop using it.</li>
            <li>I wish I had one of those completely white beards like Kenny Rogers, or a completely brown beard (like me 10 years ago).  </li>
            <li>It gets progressively worse and the more I scratch</li>
            <li>It is a lot better than the other stuff that just touches up a little gray, which is one-use only.  </li>
            <li>just try a few to get your color right...</li>
            <li>AND it has to sit on your eyebrows for a much longer time than the other stuff.</li>
            <li>and I think it looks natural and definitely makes me look younger.</li>
            <li>This is only the second thing in my life over which I&#x27;ve ever developed an allergic reaction, if that&#x27;s what it is.</li>
            <li>the compound was changed several years ago and is definitely more irritating.</li>
            <li>I prefer to do it in the workshop with pliers to open the too- tight caps, a light and mounted mirror with a wet paper towel to wipe up unintended skin areas, rather than in bathroom</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the old formula Just for Men for a long time because I can just use a dab, put it on and wipe it</li>
            <li>I feel it blends well with my natural hair color to hide the grey.</li>
            <li>I recommend it for someone who wants less gray in their beard without looking like it was dyed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get the itching with the comb under, but my moustache is not long enough to get the comb in there.my skin.  </li>

            <li> (I wish hair dying was this easy!).</li>
            <li> great product at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows and lashes are very light.</li>
            <li> We received this product free for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping Great Price</li>
            <li> Sure wish the price would drop....but I purchase anyway.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to see it is now available from Amazon â€“ and at a bargain price!</li>
            <li> I use this product and I love the price.  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent product that I&#x27;ve been using for several years.</li>
            <li> In most folks if you follow directions, it will work as promised</li>
            <li> The side of my head is the most gray.</li>
            <li> I use it in two ways: I&#x27;m an entertainer and before a showcase or if I&#x27;m videotaping a demo I always make sure I use the color.</li>
            <li> but all I know is that I can use this and have for more than 15 years and love it.</li>
            <li> In fact, they&#x27;re now MORE visible because of the increased darkness of the non-gray hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;JFM seemed to work ok.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this any more.</li>
            <li> used this product for about a year and was moderately pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> I trim my beard before application which is more efficient.</li>
            <li> but I can see some improvement in volume and most of all I haven&#x27;t been losing any additional hair..</li>
            <li> after all, gray can look fantastic!</li>
            <li> Perhaps if you leave it in for more than 5 minutes, it might remove more of the gray.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> But of course, you will have to use more product each</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did because the stuff will darken you beard</li>
            <li> The thing that makes this work so much better than the stuff for your hair is the consistency of it</li>
            <li> Its nothing spectacular like a full head of hair</li>
            <li> The old formula was great.  </li>
            <li> old formula was great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is supremely easy to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Super easy to wash out, works even without shampooing afterwards like recommended.</li>
            <li> Even after the protective instructions--it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use - about 7 minutes once a week for me (2 minutes to apply, 5 minutes to wait before showering.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is an easy product to use and my husband has used it for years.  </li>
            <li> Fast and effective.</li>
            <li> just started using it to even out my beard and stash,,so far so good...</li>
            <li> (I really don&#x27;t mind looking older, but if my wife is happy, I&#x27;m happy.)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> , so I&#x27;m not taking any stars away from the 4 I originally gave it.</li>
            <li> The color looks very good and it goes on without a mess,</li>
            <li> I use this instead of the full hair rinse.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before, but until now have been paying full retail for it.</li>
            <li> and I use more of it because the goatee is much longer.</li>
            <li> This is much better than using any brow pencil as it lasts much longer and doesn&#x27;t run/fade with sweat.  </li>
            <li> tops 3 uses out of the box, it would be nice if they offered a larger size.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, easy to use, 5 minutes your done and on its way.</li>
            <li> ; If you choose to send, then they have the right to freely post and use for their marketing without notifying you.</li>
            <li> Good luck explaining that to your significant other when you&#x27;re kissing and they end up with a mouthful of whiskers...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not aware of anything better, but while it definitely has a great effect and it helps a lot, it doesn&#x27;t seem to effect all the all the hair you color, which is why I&#x27;m giving it a 3, because that should be it&#x27;s primary</li>
            <li> I used Just For Men for a little over a month with great results.</li>
            <li> There is not doubt that it works well for coloring my beard, however, like many others, I developed some type of reaction.</li>
            <li> (actually, it looks more blond or light brown than gray,</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t overpower the beard hair that is brown, it just seems to be absorbed to the gray/white.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps not, if it is long hair that the color easily takes to, sure.</li>
            <li> I think 6 minutes is the right amount for me.  </li>
            <li> get one thats just right.</li>
            <li> After years of use, I am starting to develop a mild skin allergy and itching, but the product still looks good and natural in color.</li>
            <li> Works great... quick &amp; easy, would recommend you go a shade lighter than your actual hair color, looks more natural &amp; lets a little gray through</li>
            <li> It can go from light tan to inky black, but amazingly, the coloration properties of the application once you have shampooed will be identical.</li>
            <li> It can go from light tan to inky black, but amazingly, the coloration properties of the application once you have shampooed will be identical.</li>
            <li> and you have to do things in  a certain order to get the most natural results.</li>
            <li> new stuff has hugely stronger peroxide, which does sting.</li>
            <li> Great product, my beard is almost white, after using this product back to brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leave it go, and I guarantee you will walk into the kitchen at work and be able to silence the entire room, because whomever is in there will be giggling about The Mistake You Made with That Beard Dye.</li>
            <li> The color comes out MUCH DARKER than what is show on the box!</li>
            <li> At first severe itching started and then my skin began to peel like severe dandruff of the face.</li>
            <li> : I have seen some reviews of the Just for Men products that they do not color short hair well and leaves the gray hair more of a copper color.</li>
            <li> For many years I&#x27;ve been using this on my regular hair.</li>
            <li> I used the product exactly according to the directions.  </li>
            <li> Instead it looks pretty</li>
            <li> note, is absolutely wear the gloves!</li>
            <li> Consistently works well for my needs.</li>
            <li> I have used &amp;#34;Just for Men&amp;#34; for several years and am well pleased.  </li>
            <li> About four hours in, my entire face surrounding my beard is bright red and</li>
            <li> Search the internet and you will find many consumer complaints about long term damage to skin from using this product.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a great product, and I do recommend, just pay attention, because even medium brown was much darker than expected</li>
            <li> Great and easy to use with little mess</li>
            <li> The 3-pack price is much better than single retail.  </li>
            <li> nice little touch up....</li>
            <li> Instructions had lots of warnings that you might be allergic to it or your skin might be very irritated by it, and that it could stain anything and everything around you.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> That hair tends to lose the coloring much faster than the rest.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is definitely a learning curve, but once you master it you can get fantastic results .</li>
            <li> when you use a portion of the tubes and re-open them , the product turns much darker.</li>
            <li> She loves it and wants me to keep using it.  </li>
            <li> From a distance now it looks like I have a real beard, not mange.  </li>
            <li> I decided that I wasn&#x27;t ready for straight-white and didn&#x27;t want to ditch the goatee.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to get the right color (I got a little lighter than I thought that I needed) and follow the directions and all will be well.  </li>
            <li> While it certainly darkened my beard, the color faded rather quickly and reapplication was necessary after about five days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of course, Just for Men says not to use this \\&quot;specially formulated\\&quot; product on your regular hair.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use it, my hair is in parts light brown to grey.</li>
            <li> It leaves just a bit of the gray, so it looks natural, not fake.  </li>
            <li> Amazing side effect is that when I meet new people they usually guess that I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s (really 75).</li>
            <li> I am 53, and my beard is salt &amp; pepper (really, mostly gray), and from a distance it looks like half a beard.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> After initially going on as Medium Brown, the color quickly fades - particularly after exposure to sun, especially in a convertible - to a shade between Rick Astley and the leprechaun of Lucky Charms cereal fame.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s for mustache and beard it comes with a tiny brush, which I use to do my temples, sideburns them randomly on top and in the back.</li>
            <li> though that may be because of the particular way my beard grows not because of a problem with the product.</li>
            <li> The way I deal to avoid itching on my side burns and upper beard and itchy bumps at the top of my scalp is to rub in a little steroid cream such as triamcinalone or betamethasone (I have not tried cortisone OTC strength)to those areas immediately after application, or better yet, beforehand</li>
            <li> What started off as a good enough experience turned sour after something has clearly changed with their formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> 6 minutes, it leaves just a little gray (more natural).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Considering the price , You can&#x27;t give feedback direct to the company cause they have legal terms &amp; conditions posted on their web site &amp;#34;We do not accept...</li>
            <li> By the next day&#x27;s shower the skin staining should be pretty much gone.</li>
            <li> It was pretty easy and I will use it again but next time for only 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE; After going through cancer treatment my skin became very sensitive and I can no longer use this product as it now causes blisters on the skin under the hair, even when I&#x27;m super careful not to touch my skin with the dye and wash thoroughly after.</li>
            <li> Does stain the skin a bit, so use it on a day where you don&#x27;t need to go out in public right away.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it looks more natural with a little gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> I used this stuff for years no problem,but the new one stinks,burns me all up</li>
            <li> The new formula feels like acid on your skin.  </li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s what I live with.  </li>
            <li> For new users, suggest 5-minutes and then wash off.</li>
            <li> Even bought the Just For Men Shampoo hoping it would last longer, but it didn&#x27;t really help much.</li>
            <li> Some reddish, some darker, some lighter, some gray- very natural looking.</li>
            <li> I finally finished my first box.</li>
            <li> some are too dark, some are too light...</li>
            <li> It sticks on your beard vs running down your face which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> Doing so, I only mix a thimble full each week and one package will last me 6 weeks or so.  </li>
            <li> new formulation probably saves them a few pennies, which is a drop in the bucket compared to the huge loss of revenue as longtime users like me abandon this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wish there was an effective, less irritating color kit available for men.</li>
            <li> Different areas of your beard and hair are more or less sensitive to the color</li>
            <li> It looked clear going on, and I wondered if it would do anything.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have ZERO problems with it..</li>
            <li> I have used the regular comb in and shampoo products on my head, and it really does look natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I use the beard and mustache product on the sides to complete the coloring for that shorter hair.</li>
            <li> Just a tip that really works, if anyone else has the same problem.</li>
            <li> if only the product were  not irritating.f note when you use a portion of the tubes and re-open them , the product turns much darker.</li>
            <li> if only the product were  not irritating.</li>
            <li> Since the hair on my head is mostly brown (at least for now) I decided to try the Just for Men</li>
            <li> It looked so natural that it took my wife 2 days to notice I did it.  </li>
            <li> It looks natural, yet darker.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend it for someone with sensitive skin or rosacea.</li>
            <li> I love that the product is &#x27;re-usable&#x27; meaning you only use what you need each round until it is gone.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t quite look right on short hair, like if you keep the sides of your hair trimmed low as I do.</li>
            <li> The beard and mustache product is designed to color the smaller more hard to color hair, and that is exactly what the short clipper cut hair on the side of my head is.</li>
            <li> I am a natural blonde whose normal eyebrow color doesn&#x27;t show at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically this product did the exact opposite of what I wanted it to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I used it, I read and re-read the instructions several times.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna try to point the company toward these reviews, because it&#x27;s clear to me that the public doesn&#x27;t like their new</li>
            <li> I will continue using it even if only for the benefit of retaining the little hair I have left.:)</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t worth it, so I shaved the beard off, and kept the mustache which I slimmed way down to a Clark Gable style.  </li>
            <li> I used it at first every 2 weeks, now in a single weekly application for both beard and hair at the same application( not a separate shampoo product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> we only used less than half to cover my husbands beard, and it was SO VERY EASY to apply and wash out.</li>
            <li> So after using it again, I woke up in the middle of the night with my face itching and burning with an oozing clear liquid leaking from my face.</li>
            <li> I have been growing my beard out for five days thinking the old regular JFM product would take cave of me--</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the bigger problem with this is after a while I developed skin irritation, and now have to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I wish I had one of those completely white beards like Kenny Rogers, or a completely brown beard (like me 10 years ago).  </li>
            <li> It gets progressively worse and the more I scratch</li>
            <li> It is a lot better than the other stuff that just touches up a little gray, which is one-use only.  </li>
            <li> just try a few to get your color right...</li>
            <li> AND it has to sit on your eyebrows for a much longer time than the other stuff.</li>
            <li> and I think it looks natural and definitely makes me look younger.</li>
            <li> This is only the second thing in my life over which I&#x27;ve ever developed an allergic reaction, if that&#x27;s what it is.</li>
            <li> the compound was changed several years ago and is definitely more irritating.</li>
            <li> I prefer to do it in the workshop with pliers to open the too- tight caps, a light and mounted mirror with a wet paper towel to wipe up unintended skin areas, rather than in bathroom</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the old formula Just for Men for a long time because I can just use a dab, put it on and wipe it</li>
            <li> I feel it blends well with my natural hair color to hide the grey.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for someone who wants less gray in their beard without looking like it was dyed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the itching with the comb under, but my moustache is not long enough to get the comb in there.my skin.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the itching with the comb under, but my moustache is not long enough to get the comb in there.</li>
            <li> that stated, after receiving my new batch of product about a month ago I quickly noticed something was wrong.  </li>
            <li> SO, rather than waste a complete shampoo treatment on my entire head just to color the short hair on the side, which it does not do well anyway, I simply use the beard and mustache product on the sides in between regular applications.</li>
            <li> I have a slight skin reaction when using it, but found out a cool trick from my hair stylist; mix in a small amount of Splenda and now no itchy reaction.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, the product claims to &amp;#34;target only the gray for a natural look.&amp;#34; That&#x27;s not true.</li>
            <li> For some strange reason when I use regular hair dye for men</li>
            <li> I would say it does not last as long as advertised, but it could just be my course beard.</li>
            <li> Just a tip that really works, if anyone else has the same problem.issue for me, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about keeping my hair short on the sides or being forced to let it grow in just to get it to hold the color.</li>
            <li> For example, I do my under chin and neck first( takes up color slowly , then my hair above the ears and scalp next, come down to chin, then side burns and moustache last.</li>
            <li> waiting to see how long it lasts</li>
            <li> darkens but does not cover the grey.</li>
            <li> This color works to get the grey out, but does irritate the skin.  </li>
            <li> /burn for about a week, which is about how long the color lasts.  </li>
            <li> Long Does it Last?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After an application, the rest of my head of hair was normal looking, but the sides looked much lighter brown and had a weird</li>
            <li> No worries of coloring your skin if you get some on it (unlike the any other brand or even the same brand hair</li>
            <li> However, We only left it on the recommended 5 minutes, and it was still very dark.</li>
            <li> It really works, seriously.</li>
            <li> Every single one of them.</li>
            <li> 5 minutes, I have some gray left, 7 minutes, too dark.  </li>
            <li> The key to not getting too dark is timing and takes some experimenting.  </li>
            <li> So, a little goes a long way and start shorter period than longer--you can always make it darker on the next go.  </li>
            <li> I keep my hair on the sides clipped low, probably a 1/4 inch or less guard on the clippers.</li>
            <li> If you use a lighter color, timing is less critical to run into the shower and shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> So, if coppery red is what you&#x27;re going for, in a few days, you&#x27;ll have it - or be forced to reapply the dye before any new gray is showing.</li>
            <li> actually I use this to take a little gray out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Yesterday I (accidentally) left it on longer than 5 minutes, and my beard is very dark, and the touch of gray is not showing through.  </li>
            <li> I recommend at least shade lighter than your natural beard color.</li>
            <li> If yo leave it in too long, it is too dark so follow the directions.</li>
            <li> Apparently, they changed the formula within the past year.  </li>
            <li> I used this product for years with no problems and then suddenly developed some serious reactions including itching, redness, and sores.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles people usually guess my age 10 to 15 years younger than I am.</li>
            <li> As a first time user of this [product I was skeptical...  </li>
            <li> The brush hairs are too long, which contributes to a lot of waste.  </li>
            <li> i spread a little of the brown cream on my goatee, then i spread a little of the white tube on my goatee, then i take the supplied brush and mix them on my beard...</li>
            <li> I ordered medium brown because I didn&#x27;t want him to have to deal with that &#x27;too dark&#x27; look again.</li>
            <li> really dark, not the medium brown they say.</li>
            <li> One kit will probably last you for at least a month.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it will be too dark or can irritate.  </li>
            <li> However, the hair on the side of my head is closer in length to someone&#x27;s average beard and does not hold the color like the longer hair on my head.</li>
            <li> average results to begin with</li>
            <li> , it is certainly not worth the allergic reaction I am now getting.  </li>
            <li> After returning to the mirror, my face looked dark brown, like when you paint a beard on a kid for Halloween.  </li>
            <li> I was worried that it would look too dark and</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not even slightly darker than they were before.</li>
            <li> and when I jumped in the shower to wash it all off, my beard and stache are BLACK.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, the product claims to &amp;#34;eliminate gray.&amp;#34; That&#x27;s not true either.</li>
            <li> Do not leave the product on too long, especially if it is a dark color.</li>
            <li> Always test hair color a little before you use it.</li>
            <li> On that little hair lip, it does not burn or irritate afterward.  </li>
            <li> Initial use works well, but after a few weeks a serious facial rash and sores appeared on mouth (similar to cold sores).  </li>
            <li> the manufacturer changed the formula, probably to save a few pennies.  </li>
            <li> stuff is messy.</li>
            <li> If you want a completely dark, gray-free beard, I&#x27;m not sure this is for you.  </li>
            <li> We discovered it is cheaper and easier to just get it from Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save program every few months.</li>
            <li> It does sting a bit after a few minutes</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only negative is the very small amount of the product as packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seriously solved the issue for me, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about keeping my hair short on the sides or being forced to let it grow in just to get it to hold the color.</li>
            <li> Upon checking this condition out on-line, it appears this is a wide spread and serious problem.  </li>
            <li> Having Medium brown hair and a gray mustache and beard is not cool!</li>
            <li> Not so crazy about the new formula</li>
            <li> This product is obviously not safe.</li>
            <li> .... leave on for no more than 8 or 9 minutes after application b4 rinsing off.</li>
            <li> I usually paint it on about 15 minutes before, jump in the shower, rinse it out while I am lathering my hair and then use some of the lather to wash out my beard.  </li>
            <li> My wife mentioned that you can hardly see it against your skin, so we talked about coloring it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t get the negative comments are all.  </li>
            <li> management IDIOT was responsible for this change?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m forced to continue buying this, but</li>
            <li> hate this new formula.</li>
            <li> it is now too late to return the product, so I am stuck with 4+ unused boxes!</li>
            <li> I tough it up once a week or so</li>
            <li> the worse it gets.  </li>
            <li> Alas, it seems I am stuck trying to find an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also avoid shaving or otherwise irritating the skin for a 1/2 day after application.</li>
            <li> It is annoying, but not enough to make me stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Very expensive and not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I got tired of people giving me crap about a gray beard a long time ago and have been using this stuff for years.  </li>
            <li> I used to hate having beards because of all the grey.  </li>
            <li> My husband was a skeptic, as he had used dyes in the past that were horrible, and stained the skin, and were way too dark.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the color in the beard is noticeably lighter after just a couple days.</li>
            <li> ( Really scary</li>
            <li> ( Really scary</li>
            <li> but I have found that it is difficult to be thorough and the chemicals may bother your skin.</li>
            <li> i gave it a chance thinking it was a bad batch but couldn&#x27;t take it anymore.  </li>
            <li> It will look bad.</li>
            <li> the skin irritation has gotten so bad that I lowered it to 4 stars.  </li>
            <li> I still recommend it, but hate the itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very bad product.</li>

            <li> ...because you&#x27;re about to become one. After initially going on as Medium Brown, the color quickly fades - particularly after exposure to sun, especially in a convertible - to a shade between Rick Astley and the leprechaun of Lucky Charms cereal fame. So, if coppery red is what you&#x27;re going for, in a few days, you&#x27;ll have it - or be forced to reapply the dye before any new gray is showing. Leave it go, and I guarantee you will walk into the kitchen at work and be able to silence the entire room, because whomever is in there will be giggling about The Mistake You Made with That Beard Dye. Not the shade you&#x27;re looking for, my friend.</li>
            <li> I would give this product no stars if I could.  Search the internet and you will find many consumer complaints about long term damage to skin from using this product.  I didn&#x27;t investigate the product before purchasing it and now I am suffering for it.  The area around my mustache and goatee is red and has a burning sensation and this has been going on for days.  AVOID THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> We received this product free for an honest review. My husband was a skeptic, as he had used dyes in the past that were horrible, and stained the skin, and were way too dark. I ordered medium brown because I didn&#x27;t want him to have to deal with that &#x27;too dark&#x27; look again. And because his beard was getting to be mostly white. However, We only left it on the recommended 5 minutes, and it was still very dark. So order accordingly. (Pictures will be included below). I love that the product is &#x27;re-usable&#x27; meaning you only use what you need each round until it is gone. we only used less than half to cover my husbands beard, and it was SO VERY EASY to apply and wash out. (I wish hair dying was this easy!). Overall, it&#x27;s a great product, and I do recommend, just pay attention, because even medium brown was much darker than expected</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have ZERO problems with it..just started using it to even out my beard and stash,,so far so good...waiting to see how long it lasts</li>
            <li> Great product, my beard is almost white, after using this product back to brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is the very small amount of the product as packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At tops 3 uses out of the box, it would be nice if they offered a larger size.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, easy to use, 5 minutes your done and on its way.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done as advertised.  I find I need to re-dye every 5-7 days.  After years of use, I am starting to develop a mild skin allergy and itching, but the product still looks good and natural in color.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping Great Price</li>
            <li> Instructions had lots of warnings that you might be allergic to it or your skin might be very irritated by it, and that it could stain anything and everything around you. I didn&#x27;t have a problem. The only problem was the 5 minutes they say to keep it on makes it come out really dark, not the medium brown they say. It was pretty easy and I will use it again but next time for only 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE; After going through cancer treatment my skin became very sensitive and I can no longer use this product as it now causes blisters on the skin under the hair, even when I&#x27;m super careful not to touch my skin with the dye and wash thoroughly after. Up until that time though it worked great, so I&#x27;m not taking any stars away from the 4 I originally gave it.</li>
            <li> Sure wish the price would drop....but I purchase anyway.  Better than shaving each day!</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband. The color comes out MUCH DARKER than what is show on the box! I recommend at least shade lighter than your natural beard color.</li>
            <li> I am a natural blonde whose normal eyebrow color doesn&#x27;t show at all. I&#x27;ve used the old formula Just for Men for a long time because I can just use a dab, put it on and wipe it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new stuff has hugely stronger peroxide, which does sting. AND it has to sit on your eyebrows for a much longer time than the other stuff. I end up looking like Groucho Marx!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate this new formula. Hope they are getting the message. I&#x27;m gonna try to point the company toward these reviews, because it&#x27;s clear to me that the public doesn&#x27;t like their new \\&quot;formulation\\&quot;--AT ALL!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for over a year on my beard and, although it says it will last until the hair grows, I have to renew it every week. The color looks very good and it goes on without a mess, just wish it would last longer. Even bought the Just For Men Shampoo hoping it would last longer, but it didn&#x27;t really help much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not aware of anything better, but while it definitely has a great effect and it helps a lot, it doesn&#x27;t seem to effect all the all the hair you color, which is why I&#x27;m giving it a 3, because that should be it&#x27;s primary point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is supremely easy to use.  No worries of coloring your skin if you get some on it (unlike the any other brand or even the same brand hair color).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super easy to wash out, works even without shampooing afterwards like recommended.</li>
            <li> I used this stuff for years no problem,but the new one stinks,burns me all up they should take it off the market,and change the product!!!!!</li>
            <li> The old formula was great.  Darkened my beard in minutes, with no smell and no skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the manufacturer changed the formula, probably to save a few pennies.  The new formula feels like acid on your skin.  It can give your skin a nasty chemical burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you contact the manufacturer, they try to dodge responsibility by blaming YOU!  \\&quot;Well, you must have extra-sensitive skin.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What management IDIOT was responsible for this change?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new formulation probably saves them a few pennies, which is a drop in the bucket compared to the huge loss of revenue as longtime users like me abandon this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old formula was great.  They should have stuck to it.  If it ain&#x27;t broke, DON&#x27;T FIX IT!</li>
            <li> I use this instead of the full hair rinse. Brush it on the parts of you hair - or all of your hair - let is set for 5-7 minutes and then rinse in the shower - shampoo well so it does not get on your pillow at night. The when I use this, I get 3-4 uses out of it, versus the one time use for the hair rinse which comes in a big bottle and even if you only use some of it, you can&#x27;t store the rest</li>
            <li> I used this product for years with no problems and then suddenly developed some serious reactions including itching, redness, and sores. After several tests, I determined it was the chemicals in the product that caused the reactions. If you use the product, watch out for allergic reactions.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before, but until now have been paying full retail for it. I&#x27;m glad to see it is now available from Amazon â€“ and at a bargain price! I wholeheartedly endorse this product. I have a slight skin reaction when using it, but found out a cool trick from my hair stylist; mix in a small amount of Splenda and now no itchy reaction. I find I do have to leave it on just a bit longer that 5 minutes to get the results I want when using the Splenda. Works great. Now if they just had something that worked on eyebrows?</li>
            <li> Great and easy to use with little mess</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I feel it blends well with my natural hair color to hide the grey. I use it regularly.</li>
            <li> I use this product and I love the price.  I will be ordering another set just as soon as I am out of this order.</li>
            <li> Does the job in 5 minutes, cannot say anything more about it than that!  One kit will probably last you for at least a month.</li>
            <li> I used Just For Men for a little over a month with great results. There is not doubt that it works well for coloring my beard, however, like many others, I developed some type of reaction. At first severe itching started and then my skin began to peel like severe dandruff of the face. I used it again after thinking that this just might be a one time incident. So after using it again, I woke up in the middle of the night with my face itching and burning with an oozing clear liquid leaking from my face. It continued to ooze for  the entire next day. This product is obviously not safe. I definitely need to find an alternative product.</li>
            <li> I get this brand each time.  Would definitely recommend to anyone!  That&#x27;s all I have to say.  That&#x27;s all I have to say.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. This comes in a 3-pack which is convenient. My husband does his beard weekly with this product and sometimes uses a bit to run through his sideburns.</li>
            <li> It does what it claims.... leave on for no more than 8 or 9 minutes after application b4 rinsing off. Otherwise it will be too dark or can irritate.  Starts washing out within 10 days and should be reapplied.</li>
            <li> I have used the scalp version for years and it worked great.  Not so crazy about the new formula but it still works.  Some girls asked me to re-grow my beard (women go figure)  so I looked into Just for Men for Beards.  I found 388 reviews from men who said that it disfigured their face with blisters oozing blood and pus.  Three hundred and eighty eight guys!  I have been growing my beard out for five days thinking the old regular JFM product would take cave of me--No I have to shave the darn thing off again.  That&#x27;s gonna hurt.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product that I&#x27;ve been using for several years. There is nothing like it that I&#x27;m ware of. Fast and effective.</li>
            <li> Even after the protective instructions--it is easy to use. Brush it on and wash it off .It darkens but does not cover the grey.But that&#x27;s enough to achieve a younger look.</li>
            <li> Always use this.  Have to keep it off the skin, could cause a rash.  If yo leave it in too long, it is too dark so follow the directions.</li>
            <li> For 12 years Just For Men has been my mainstay for hair and facial hair colour. Best coverage and lon lasting.&lt;br /&gt;A note of warning------Some folks might have a sensitivity reaction to the chemicals used. STOP using if you develop a rash, hives, etc. In most folks if you follow directions, it will work as promised</li>
            <li> This product came as ordered....great product at a very reasonable price. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have used the regular comb in and shampoo products on my head, and it really does look natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON : I have seen some reviews of the Just for Men products that they do not color short hair well and leaves the gray hair more of a copper color. It doesn&#x27;t quite look right on short hair, like if you keep the sides of your hair trimmed low as I do. I totally agree. I keep my hair on the sides clipped low, probably a 1/4 inch or less guard on the clippers. The side of my head is the most gray. After an application, the rest of my head of hair was normal looking, but the sides looked much lighter brown and had a weird tint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, I solved the issue!! I decided to try Just for Men Beard and Mustache. Of course, Just for Men says not to use this \\&quot;specially formulated\\&quot; product on your regular hair. Perhaps not, if it is long hair that the color easily takes to, sure. However, the hair on the side of my head is closer in length to someone&#x27;s average beard and does not hold the color like the longer hair on my head. So, what the heck. I tried it on the sides and it works like a charm. The beard and mustache product is designed to color the smaller more hard to color hair, and that is exactly what the short clipper cut hair on the side of my head is. It really works, seriously. PLUS, it is a multi-use product. The beard and mustache product comes with two tubes, mixing tray, and brush that are meant to be used multiple times. So when the rest of my head of hair needs a treatment, I use the regular shampoo coloring on my entire head. Then I use the beard and mustache product on the sides to complete the coloring for that shorter hair. That hair tends to lose the coloring much faster than the rest. SO, rather than waste a complete shampoo treatment on my entire head just to color the short hair on the side, which it does not do well anyway, I simply use the beard and mustache product on the sides in between regular applications. It seriously solved the issue for me, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about keeping my hair short on the sides or being forced to let it grow in just to get it to hold the color. Just a tip that really works, if anyone else has the same problem.issue for me, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about keeping my hair short on the sides or being forced to let it grow in just to get it to hold the color. Just a tip that really works, if anyone else has the same problem.</li>
            <li> For some strange reason when I use regular hair dye for men I get a reaction that doesn&#x27;t preclude me for using it, but it does trigger some kind of allergy. For many years I&#x27;ve been using this on my regular hair. It lasts almost three weeks and even my hair stylist says it looks like great color. Since it&#x27;s for mustache and beard it comes with a tiny brush, which I use to do my temples, sideburns them randomly on top and in the back. I use it in two ways: I&#x27;m an entertainer and before a showcase or if I&#x27;m videotaping a demo I always make sure I use the color. Also: I have a political weblog and have been on CNN several times as a talking head. And, again, I&#x27;ve used this color before going on TV. But since I do show for youth audiences, I use this twice a month. Also: if I buy it on amazon I get the best deal (I&#x27;m also on Amazon prime) since if you get a three pack it&#x27;s way cheaper than buying it in a store. If I don&#x27;t use it, my hair is in parts light brown to grey. Since I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles people usually guess my age 10 to 15 years younger than I am. And YES I attribute it to Just for Men Brush in Color Gel, Moustache and Beard -- even though I don&#x27;t have a beard. FOOTNOTE: This may not be the use for everyone. Always test hair color a little before you use it. I know someone who tried various hair color and broke into a severe rash. They warn you about it. My barber says moustache gel should be a bit stronger but all I know is that I can use this and have for more than 15 years and love it. I buy it often in Amazon, and if I&#x27;m traveling I can buy it in any store.</li>
            <li> I used to hate having beards because of all the grey.  I use this once a week and I think it looks natural and definitely makes me look younger.</li>
            <li> That thing was for ma wife she use it too mucho y your services are always very good, thank you</li>
            <li> actually I use this to take a little gray out of my hair. Works great. Have to re apply about every four days.</li>
            <li> Having Medium brown hair and a gray mustache and beard is not cool! The product works great...I have to use it every 2 weeks. And the price with autoship can&#x27;t be beat. Amazing side effect is that when I meet new people they usually guess that I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s (really 75). If the question is \\&quot;TO DYE OR NOT TO DYE\\&quot;...the answer is DO IT!</li>
            <li> I use this for coloring my beard and mustache. This color works to get the grey out, but does irritate the skin.  Years ago, it did not irritate my skin, but I guess they made some changes to the formula.  Now, it will cause my skin to itch/burn for about a week, which is about how long the color lasts.  Then I have to go through it all over again.  Wasn&#x27;t worth it, so I shaved the beard off, and kept the mustache which I slimmed way down to a Clark Gable style.  On that little hair lip, it does not burn or irritate afterward.  So that&#x27;s what I live with.  I guess I&#x27;m forced to continue buying this, but wish there was an effective, less irritating color kit available for men.</li>
            <li> I used this product for years without a problem (was 5 star product).  Apparently, they changed the formula within the past year.  It made my face itch (redness occured) and blisters appeared around my lips.  i gave it a chance thinking it was a bad batch but couldn&#x27;t take it anymore.  Since I was on auto delivey for years, i had a stock pile.  it is now too late to return the product, so I am stuck with 4+ unused boxes!</li>
            <li> works great..once a week</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t get the negative comments are all.  I guess I just have insensitive skin!  I have been using it every 10 days for years.  Have never had even one problem.  What gives?</li>
            <li> The only one made!!!  Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Good stuff...used for years...</li>
            <li> This product does not work as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the product claims to &amp;#34;target only the gray for a natural look.&amp;#34; That&#x27;s not true. My non-gray hairs are noticeably darker after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the product claims to &amp;#34;eliminate gray.&amp;#34; That&#x27;s not true either. My gray hairs are still there. Every single one of them. They&#x27;re not even slightly darker than they were before. In fact, they&#x27;re now MORE visible because of the increased darkness of the non-gray hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically this product did the exact opposite of what I wanted it to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I used it, I read and re-read the instructions several times.  I also watched the how-to video on the Just For Men web site.  I used the product exactly according to the directions.  With that in mind, I can only conclude that the product does not match the claims of the manufacturer, and that my experience was not the result of user error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: This stuff also makes my beard and mustache shed. Good luck explaining that to your significant other when you&#x27;re kissing and they end up with a mouthful of whiskers...</li>
            <li> It works very well. I would say it does not last as long as advertised, but it could just be my course beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50, and my beard is almost white. My wife mentioned that you can hardly see it against your skin, so we talked about coloring it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JFM seemed to work ok. Does stain the skin a bit, so use it on a day where you don&#x27;t need to go out in public right away. By the next day&#x27;s shower the skin staining should be pretty much gone. Unfortunately the color in the beard is noticeably lighter after just a couple days. I have to re-apply it weekly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the bigger problem with this is after a while I developed skin irritation, and now have to stop using it. This is only the second thing in my life over which I&#x27;ve ever developed an allergic reaction, if that&#x27;s what it is. That was after a couple months of use. I can&#x27;t use this any more.</li>
            <li> What started off as a good enough experience turned sour after something has clearly changed with their formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have used this product for about a year and was moderately pleased with the results.  While it certainly darkened my beard, the color faded rather quickly and reapplication was necessary after about five days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that stated, after receiving my new batch of product about a month ago I quickly noticed something was wrong.  About two hours following application, my beard begins to itch.  It gets progressively worse and the more I scratch the worse it gets.  About four hours in, my entire face surrounding my beard is bright red and inflamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What has changed?  I am still applying the product the same way I always have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With average results to begin with, it is certainly not worth the allergic reaction I am now getting.  I&#x27;ve reached out to the company and received no response.  Alas, it seems I am stuck trying to find an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned - don&#x27;t assume something works alright and then buy in bulk with automatic reorder.</li>
            <li> This stuff does NOT have an auto-stop.  The medium brown was on my beard and stache for 5 minutes and when I jumped in the shower to wash it all off, my beard and stache are BLACK.  Order this one instead, this one works great:  JUST FOR MEN Autostop Hair Color, Medium Brown (on your beard and stache).</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 10 years. I used it at first every 2 weeks, now in a single weekly application for both beard and hair at the same application( not a separate shampoo product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I have learned:&lt;br /&gt;There is definitely a learning curve, but once you master it you can get fantastic results . The beauty is that all hairs will not be the same color. Some reddish, some darker, some lighter, some gray- very natural looking. People tell me all the time \\&quot;You never age\\&quot;. I just smile.&lt;br /&gt;As you have seen from others the compound was changed several years ago and is definitely more irritating. The way I deal to avoid itching on my side burns and upper beard and itchy bumps at the top of my scalp is to rub in a little steroid cream such as triamcinalone or betamethasone (I have not tried cortisone OTC strength)to those areas immediately after application, or better yet, beforehand ( It does not affect the performance). This works well and avoids the skin problems. Also avoid shaving or otherwise irritating the skin for a 1/2 day after application. I trim my beard before application which is more efficient. Do not leave the product on too long, especially if it is a dark color. It will look bad. Different areas of your beard and hair are more or less sensitive to the color and you have to do things in  a certain order to get the most natural results. For example, I do my under chin and neck first( takes up color slowly , then my hair above the ears and scalp next, come down to chin, then side burns and moustache last. I use a comb to comb it in. You can leave gray temples, what ever you want. If you use a lighter color, timing is less critical to run into the shower and shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;The stuff is messy. I prefer to do it in the workshop with pliers to open the too- tight caps, a light and mounted mirror with a wet paper towel to wipe up unintended skin areas, rather than in bathroom were splatter can stain walls or grout.&lt;br /&gt;Of note when you use a portion of the tubes and re-open them , the product turns much darker. It can go from light tan to inky black, but amazingly, the coloration properties of the application once you have shampooed will be identical. ( Really scary however until you know this.)&lt;br /&gt;So if you have the time and interest you can do a really great and reproducible job at home which I do not believe can matched by a professional.&lt;br /&gt;Now if only the product were  not irritating.f note when you use a portion of the tubes and re-open them , the product turns much darker.

            <li> As a first time user of this [product I was skeptical...  However after 4 months of using it I can see some results.  Its nothing spectacular like a full head of hair but I can see some improvement in volume and most of all I haven&#x27;t been losing any additional hair.. I will continue using it even if only for the benefit of retaining the little hair I have left.:)</li>
            <li> Initial use works well, but after a few weeks a serious facial rash and sores appeared on mouth (similar to cold sores).  Upon checking this condition out on-line, it appears this is a wide spread and serious problem.  Research before use....after all, gray can look fantastic!</li>
            <li> Good product - GREAT service from Amazon</li>
            <li> About me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I bought this a year ago and never used it, thinking it was kind of vain to color my beard.  I am 53, and my beard is salt &amp; pepper (really, mostly gray), and from a distance it looks like half a beard.&lt;br /&gt;- Since the hair on my head is mostly brown (at least for now) I decided to try the Just for Men so my beard will match my head.&lt;br /&gt;- My beard is fairly short, and I trim it once or twice a week on the #4 setting of my trimmer.  I wish I had one of those completely white beards like Kenny Rogers, or a completely brown beard (like me 10 years ago).  Instead it looks pretty bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I skipped the allergy test.  I didn&#x27;t have a problem but I am guessing you should do the test.  It did not bother my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;- 1 put about 1 inch from each tube in the tray and mixed it.  Simple.&lt;br /&gt;- Brushed it into my beard.  Easy.&lt;br /&gt;- It looked clear going on, and I wondered if it would do anything.&lt;br /&gt;- Watched TV for 5 minutes&lt;br /&gt;- After returning to the mirror, my face looked dark brown, like when you paint a beard on a kid for Halloween.  I was worried that it would look too dark and unnatural.&lt;br /&gt;- I immediately went into the shower and shampooed it out, as per the directions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How Does It Look?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- In a word, great.&lt;br /&gt;- It leaves just a bit of the gray, so it looks natural, not fake.  (actually, it looks more blond or light brown than gray, I think.)&lt;br /&gt;- If you want a completely dark, gray-free beard, I&#x27;m not sure this is for you.  Perhaps if you leave it in for more than 5 minutes, it might remove more of the gray.&lt;br /&gt;- It looked so natural that it took my wife 2 days to notice I did it.  She loves it and wants me to keep using it.  I guess she gets a younger man without having to go look for another guy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How Long Does it Last?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The color is supposed to last a month.  Not for me.  I have found that I need to use it about once every week, maybe 10 days.  But remember, my beard is short, and I trim it.  If your beard is longer, then maybe it will last a month.  But of course, you will have to use more product each time.&lt;br /&gt;- I have used it 4 times now and still have some left, so I am guessing a box will last me maybe 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;- Also, I shower twice a day on days I work out, so maybe that makes it fade quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- My wife loves it, so that settles it for me.&lt;br /&gt;- From a distance now it looks like I have a real beard, not mange.  The wife says it makes me look younger.  (I really don&#x27;t mind looking older, but if my wife is happy, I&#x27;m happy.)&lt;br /&gt;- It looks natural, yet darker.  The touch of gray that remains keeps it from looking like it has been dyed.&lt;br /&gt;- I recommend it for someone who wants less gray in their beard without looking like it was dyed.&lt;br /&gt;- It is easy to use - about 7 minutes once a week for me (2 minutes to apply, 5 minutes to wait before showering.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (11/4/13)&lt;br /&gt;- Yesterday I (accidentally) left it on longer than 5 minutes, and my beard is very dark, and the touch of gray is not showing through.  So if you want zero gray, leave it in maybe 7-8 minutes.  In my opinion, it looks more natural with a little gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/21/13&lt;br /&gt;- I finally finished my first box. so it lasted for about almost 3 months.  I think I got about 10, maybe 12 applications, total.&lt;br /&gt;- I earlier said it did not affect my skin.  Now it makes my face itch for about 3 days after I use it.  It is annoying, but not enough to make me stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;- I think 6 minutes is the right amount for me.  5 minutes, I have some gray left, 7 minutes, too dark.  6 minutes, it leaves just a little gray (more natural).&lt;br /&gt;- I still recommend it, but hate the itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 3/20/14&lt;br /&gt;- the skin irritation has gotten so bad that I lowered it to 4 stars.  I now apply it with a comb under my hair against my skin to prevent the cream from touchingmy skin.  I have gotten an oozing red sore on my upper lip the last 3 times I used it.  I didn&#x27;t get the itching with the comb under, but my moustache is not long enough to get the comb in there.my skin.  I have gotten an oozing red sore on my upper lip the last 3 times I used it.

            <li> Beware of possible allergic reactions with itching and burning. I would not recommend it for someone with sensitive skin or rosacea. It handles greying hair nicely otherwise though...</li>
            <li> It does the job &amp; is probably the best available product.  It lasts appx 5 - 7 days.  The brush hairs are too long, which contributes to a lot of waste.  Considering the price , You can&#x27;t give feedback direct to the company cause they have legal terms &amp; conditions posted on their web site &amp;#34;We do not accept...suggestions.&amp;#34; If you choose to send, then they have the right to freely post and use for their marketing without notifying you. That&#x27;s kinda hostile anti-consumer.</li>
            <li> This is an easy product to use and my husband has used it for years.  We discovered it is cheaper and easier to just get it from Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save program every few months.</li>
            <li> I have a moustache and goatee that grows in very white while the hair on my head is still salt/pepper.  I decided that I wasn&#x27;t ready for straight-white and didn&#x27;t want to ditch the goatee.  Started using this two months ago.  Decided to go shorter than the five minutes and I&#x27;m glad I did because the stuff will darken you beard and I wanted to leave some white/gray in it to match the hair. It does sting a bit after a few minutes but I use that as the \\&quot;alarm clock\\&quot;--time to wash it off.  So, a little goes a long way and start shorter period than longer--you can always make it darker on the next go.  I tough it up once a week or so though that may be because of the particular way my beard grows not because of a problem with the product.</li>
            <li> Very bad product. Followed the package instructions. It stained the bathroom everywhere and only last a very short while. Very expensive and not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product acts just as advertised.  And that was the biggest surprise.  I like it, it doesn&#x27;t overpower the beard hair that is brown, it just seems to be absorbed to the gray/white.  It leaches out about 50% over about 2 weeks, but gradually.  So a 2 week regime is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;One note, is absolutely wear the gloves!</li>
            <li> Consistently works well for my needs.</li>
            <li> I got tired of people giving me crap about a gray beard a long time ago and have been using this stuff for years.  I just wear a very short trimmed goattee.  I trim it once a week and then treat it with this stuff and I am good to go.  Doing so, I only mix a thimble full each week and one package will last me 6 weeks or so.  I do recommend using it just before a shower and then washing it out with shampoo while you are in the shower.  I usually paint it on about 15 minutes before, jump in the shower, rinse it out while I am lathering my hair and then use some of the lather to wash out my beard.  You can just wash it out in the sink but I have found that it is difficult to be thorough and the chemicals may bother your skin.</li>
            <li> Be sure to get the right color (I got a little lighter than I thought that I needed) and follow the directions and all will be well.  It is a lot better than the other stuff that just touches up a little gray, which is one-use only.  This stuff is multiple-use if you squeeze the air out of the tubes and put the caps back on promptly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> This product caused my face to break out in a rash.</li>
            <li> i use this on my goatee.  there are two tubes...i spread a little of the brown cream on my goatee, then i spread a little of the white tube on my goatee, then i take the supplied brush and mix them on my beard...let it sit for 5 minutes and rinse off in the shower.  nice little touch up....just try a few to get your color right...some are too dark, some are too light...get one thats just right.</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time to maintain my color.This is the best color gel on the market</li>
            <li> Works great, doesn&#x27;t even stain my hands when applied.</li>
            <li> This works perfectly for my graying goatee. I put it on once a week or so and it works like a charm. The thing that makes this work so much better than the stuff for your hair is the consistency of it once you get it all mixed up. It sticks on your beard vs running down your face which is a huge plus. I have been using it for about 2 years now and I use more of it because the goatee is much longer.</li>
            <li> I have used &amp;#34;Just for Men&amp;#34; for several years and am well pleased.  The 3-pack price is much better than single retail.  The key to not getting too dark is timing and takes some experimenting.  For new users, suggest 5-minutes and then wash off.</li>
            <li> Works great... quick &amp; easy, would recommend you go a shade lighter than your actual hair color, looks more natural &amp; lets a little gray through</li>
            <li> My eyebrows and lashes are very light. I use this to dye my brows...(not my lashes). This is much better than using any brow pencil as it lasts much longer and doesn&#x27;t run/fade with sweat.  I&#x27;ve tried hair dye;doesnt work.</li>
