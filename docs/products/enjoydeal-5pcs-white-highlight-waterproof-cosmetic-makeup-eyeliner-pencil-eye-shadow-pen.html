            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend Buying this product what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) It didn&#x27;t come on time, it came like a week later&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) When I received it, the package it came in was ripped open&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) 4 out of the 5 tubes I got were broken&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell ur wearing  it.  Doesn&#x27;t really show up</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> They are okay, glides on smooth but not very pigmented.</li>
            <li> Save your money a crayon would work better</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are honestly very crappy and have no pigment at all! They are like trying to use crayons!</li>
            <li> To be honest, with all of the reviews praising these eyeliners, I expected better. I can draw the same line on my eyes for ten minutes and it won&#x27;t show up. The same with the inner corners or ANYWHERE on my body. It just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I love these! Everyone has been telling me to get white liner and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. So I checked and found all of these for the price their given so I purchased them and fell in love ! This liner isn&#x27;t just white but it has a shiner to it. Gorgeous ! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great especially for the price!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really see the color and when you apply the tip comes off</li>
            <li> It works as well as my name-brand pencils. I love it!</li>
            <li> Color does not last more than a few minutes on inner lid. Definitely not waterproof. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love these took a little bit too get here but came before delivery date. I use these for my water line and I think they work great!</li>
