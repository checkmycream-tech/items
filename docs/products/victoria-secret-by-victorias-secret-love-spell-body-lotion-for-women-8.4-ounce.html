            <li>Very moisturizing and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the lotion makes my body feel soft.</li>
            <li>lotion keeps my shin soft and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>by far one of my favorite lotions by VS.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice fragrance that works great as a substitute for expensive perfume.</li>
            <li>Smells very good last a long time would order again</li>
            <li>..works awsome after first few uses the taste gets to be great..very happy</li>
            <li>Such a mild refreshing fragrance.  </li>
            <li>If you really want to smell good from Victoria&#x27;s Secret, BUY ENDLESS LOVE INSTEAD, DON&#x27;T BUY THIS OVERRATED LOVE SPELL!!</li>
            <li>Hi, first of all buy this product with the greater expectation because I live in Venezuela and did not know how he was in physical, but to have it in my hands I feel satisfied because it was exactly as it was in the publication.</li>
            <li>I normally love their lotions, but find this one smells like cheap department store brands because the peach over powers the other scents.</li>
            <li>i love victoria&#x27;s secret and i&#x27;m so glad i could get it so easily instead of having to go to the crowded mall.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest buying two the first time</li>
            <li>It does moisturize pretty well.</li>
            <li>Be smart&lt;br /&gt;Shoppers ;)</li>
            <li>It has a really pretty and feminine fragrance to it.  </li>
            <li>I plan to get some more as soon as possible!!!</li>
            <li>Endless love is infinitely better, it&#x27;s smells sooooooo sweet and luxurious, it&#x27;s smells like Irish Cream coffee or a Caramel Macchiato combined with roses</li>
            <li>She loves the smell of the lotion and it makes her skin feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I love the smell but the oily feeling that is left behind is not so pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I was very well attended...</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lack of concern for me that I am Brazilian.  </li>
            <li>I am not a big fan of the heavy perfumed smells of many scented lotions today and Love Spell is anything</li>
            <li>I thought the smell was going to stay on me for the whole day</li>
            <li>Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li>It smells better than the body mist, but still not quite what I expected or what the product in the store smells like.</li>
            <li>Just as expected :) .</li>
            <li>responsible.</li>
            <li>I really did not like it.  </li>
            <li>I got it really fast</li>
            <li>Rather than reorder, though, I am testing other products to find a favorite.</li>
            <li>Hands down this is my #1 favorite scent</li>
            <li>It is a timeless classic.</li>
            <li>Great smell as usual, like most of the Victoria Secret body lotions.  </li>
            <li>So far, victoria secret is doing pretty good.</li>
            <li>Cost too high for shipping.</li>
            <li>I  would highly reccomend this product because it makes my skin look so radient.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this scent to all  </li>
            <li>Lovely scent, not too heavy.</li>
            <li>This is a scent when used with the body spray leaves me smelling fresh the entire day</li>
            <li>I have always loved this lotion by Victoria Secret.  </li>

            <li>My husband surprised me with this on valentines day...  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved this scent from Victoria&#x27;s Secret, it&#x27;s delicate but very noticeable.  </li>

            <li> If you really want to smell good from Victoria&#x27;s Secret, BUY ENDLESS LOVE INSTEAD, DON&#x27;T BUY THIS OVERRATED LOVE SPELL!!</li>
            <li> Hi, first of all buy this product with the greater expectation because I live in Venezuela and did not know how he was in physical, but to have it in my hands I feel satisfied because it was exactly as it was in the publication.</li>
            <li> I normally love their lotions, but find this one smells like cheap department store brands because the peach over powers the other scents.</li>
            <li> i love victoria&#x27;s secret and i&#x27;m so glad i could get it so easily instead of having to go to the crowded mall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest buying two the first time</li>
            <li> It does moisturize pretty well.</li>
            <li> Be smart&lt;br /&gt;Shoppers ;)</li>
            <li> It has a really pretty and feminine fragrance to it.  </li>
            <li> I plan to get some more as soon as possible!!!</li>
            <li> Endless love is infinitely better, it&#x27;s smells sooooooo sweet and luxurious, it&#x27;s smells like Irish Cream coffee or a Caramel Macchiato combined with roses</li>
            <li> She loves the smell of the lotion and it makes her skin feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I love the smell but the oily feeling that is left behind is not so pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I was very well attended...</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very lack of concern for me that I am Brazilian.  </li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of the heavy perfumed smells of many scented lotions today and Love Spell is anything</li>
            <li> I thought the smell was going to stay on me for the whole day</li>
            <li> Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li> It smells better than the body mist, but still not quite what I expected or what the product in the store smells like.</li>
            <li> Just as expected :) .</li>
            <li> responsible.</li>
            <li> I really did not like it.  </li>
            <li> I got it really fast</li>
            <li> Rather than reorder, though, I am testing other products to find a favorite.</li>
            <li> Hands down this is my #1 favorite scent</li>
            <li> It is a timeless classic.</li>
            <li> Great smell as usual, like most of the Victoria Secret body lotions.  </li>
            <li> So far, victoria secret is doing pretty good.</li>
            <li> Cost too high for shipping.</li>
            <li> I  would highly reccomend this product because it makes my skin look so radient.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this scent to all  </li>
            <li> Lovely scent, not too heavy.</li>
            <li> This is a scent when used with the body spray leaves me smelling fresh the entire day</li>
            <li> I have always loved this lotion by Victoria Secret.  </li>
            <li> Scent is great, cheaper here then at local Victoras Secret</li>
            <li> My husband surprised me with this on valentines day...  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this scent from Victoria&#x27;s Secret, it&#x27;s delicate but very noticeable.  </li>
            <li> My favorite from Victoria secret</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last long even when using the body spray with it.</li>
            <li> it last a long time...</li>
            <li> I gave it for a Christmas present with some other things.</li>
            <li> after a day had dark red spots it infected the pores</li>
            <li> It smells somewhat like a cheap petroleum product, too artificial.</li>
            <li> The product is just as expected.</li>
            <li> not good for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> As a Victoria&#x27;s Secret employee this design is atleast 5 years old.</li>
            <li> I wish the scent lasted a little longer.  </li>
            <li> It smelled bad and must be old because the bottle isn&#x27;t even shaped like this one anymore</li>
            <li> Smell reminds me of alcohol, maybe I am just sick of it after wearing it for a while and need something different.</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t impress me and I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife and she like everything from Victoria Secret, so I like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Victoria Secret user</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been her scent for years, but we don&#x27;t have a Victoria&#x27;s Secret close, and shopping at Victoria&#x27;s Secret&#x27;s website is a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> IT ACTUALLY IS ONE OF THEIR WORST SCENTS!!</li>
            <li> A gift, and can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> Smells awful and your hands will be dry in literally 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> It gives me a headache and makes me nauseated!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed because I made the purchase on 10.16.2011 we are heading for the month of December.</li>

            <li> It was in good condition.....Thanks</li>
            <li> Scent is great, cheaper here then at local Victoras Secret</li>
            <li> I did not get the product to the Pesenti date. I am very disappointed because I made the purchase on 10.16.2011 we are heading for the month of December. It&#x27;s very lack of concern for me that I am Brazilian.  Esse tamb√©m n√£o chegou</li>
            <li> I love smelling this on my girlfriend! Can&#x27;t wait to give this one to her! One thing you have to learn, is once you smell this, you will always want to keep your girl in stock! I&#x27;d suggest buying two the first time so she doesn&#x27;t run out! Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> i love victoria&#x27;s secret and i&#x27;m so glad i could get it so easily instead of having to go to the crowded mall.</li>
            <li> This is one of my all time favorite scents. It is a timeless classic. A floral smell with a hint of citrus. I am not a big fan of the heavy perfumed smells of many scented lotions today and Love Spell is anything but. It is very lightly scented with just the right amount of scent for someone to notice you as you walk by. My husband adores this on me. Maybe that&#x27;s why they call it Love Spell!  If you have found my review to be helpful at all, please click &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34; that it was helpful so that I may continue to review products and share my opinions of them with the public to assist in their choice to purchase or not purchase a product.</li>

            <li> Awesome deal, fast delivery &amp; loved the product. Very pleased, highly recommend it. Great buy for Christmas  office party or valentines day</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this scent from Victoria&#x27;s Secret, it&#x27;s delicate but very noticeable.  I couple this lotion with their \\&quot;Pink\\&quot; perfume spray and it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> This smell is great but only in the lotion.  The others are too strong and not what it should be</li>
            <li> I really love this scent! The feel of the lotion is quality also and think I will continue to keep it in my stash!</li>

            <li> Hi, first of all buy this product with the greater expectation because I live in Venezuela and did not know how he was in physical, but to have it in my hands I feel satisfied because it was exactly as it was in the publication. so I recommend it with greater security that you will be satisfied with your purchase.</li>

While the smell is great, you can go to a VS store now and get 5 of these for $30 or 7 for $35 depending on the promotion. Sometimes even 5 for $20! Be smart&lt;br /&gt;Shoppers ;)</li>

            <li> excellent. responsible. 100% recommend</li>
            <li> OVERRATED!! It pisses me off everytime I go to Victoria&#x27;s because they always say that this is their top scent but I think it&#x27;s just jive!! IT ACTUALLY IS ONE OF THEIR WORST SCENTS!! It smells way too fruity and cheap, like something you&#x27;d buy at Walmart or Sears! It gives me a headache and makes me nauseated!! Endless love is infinitely better, it&#x27;s smells sooooooo sweet and luxurious, it&#x27;s smells like Irish Cream coffee or a Caramel Macchiato combined with roses, IT&#x27;S HEAVENLY! If you really want to smell good from Victoria&#x27;s Secret, BUY ENDLESS LOVE INSTEAD, DON&#x27;T BUY THIS OVERRATED LOVE SPELL!!</li>
            <li> by far one of my favorite lotions by VS.  it smells great, not too strong or overpowering.  it goes on very smooth on your skin without leaving a residue.  one of their best!</li>
            <li> Excelente. Continuar√© comprando a este vendedor. Tienda recomendada para hacer m√°s compras internacionales. GRACIAS POR LA VENTA DEL PRODUCTO. SALUDOS</li>
            <li> The smell is okay, but too strong for me. It smells somewhat like a cheap petroleum product, too artificial. Also, the lotion feels too sticky and greasy.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend. It is a nice fragrance that works great as a substitute for expensive perfume.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this lotion by Victoria Secret.  It has a really pretty and feminine fragrance to it.  Can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Hands down the best scent that VS offers. Nothing like a pretty lady smelling like a real life love spell. Try it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> excellent item, very good quality</li>
            <li> I just love this fragrance. I use it daily at work after washing my hands and always get comments like - What is that wonderful smell?</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and smells perfect</li>
            <li> en espera del paquete por favor entregarlo en la direcci√≥n nueva de liberty express  MEDLEY FLORIDA 33178-1044** mil gracias</li>
            <li> She loves it.. Nothing but the best for my girl...</li>
            <li> Thought this was ths new bottle of love spell but was a old bottle but still smells great and stay&#x27;s on along time. Smells as good as i remember love it.</li>
            <li> I normally love their lotions, but find this one smells like cheap department store brands because the peach over powers the other scents.</li>
            <li> I love the product and the price!! It is so much more better to purchase online for a product than driving 50 miles for one thing!!</li>
            <li> I really did not like it.  It was just okay. I gave it away.  It really didn&#x27;t impress me and I was very disappointed.  The shipping was nice I got it really fast</li>
            <li> Bought this to go with the body scrub and body spray and my wife loves all three. It smells so good.</li>
            <li> I received this today and I am extremely happy üòç This is a scent when used with the body spray leaves me smelling fresh the entire day and I get lots of compliments when I have this on üòç</li>
            <li> Thid is a super awsome deal..you get two (2) micro g pens and two of everything you need, it&#x27;s an awsome cape pen..works awsome after first few uses the taste gets to be great..very happy</li>
            <li> I bought the lotion for a girl who&#x27;s attention I wanted to get and guess what I got it. She has told me it is a real nice scent and she recommends it to any woman.</li>
            <li> A gift, and can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> This is legit VS love spell. No counterfeit product here. The Ms loved this in her stocking for Christmas time, and I love the smell on her. Good buy</li>
            <li> If she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy.  She loves the smell of the lotion and it makes her skin feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Great discount on a great-smelling VS classic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, not in love with it and probably won&#x27;t order it again, but I&#x27;ll use it until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> bought for my co0workers and they loved this product and keep it at their desk for a quick pick me up.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! it smells nice, clean, frsh and sexy! I plan to get some more as soon as possible!!! After a bath, its sensational! I just wish the smell would last longer after I put it on my skin.</li>
            <li> My husband surprised me with this on valentines day...  Love it</li>
            <li> lovely aroma ,I will bay again</li>
            <li> El articulo perfecto. Me gusto bastante. Lo recomiendo 100%. Es de buena calidad. Si volver√≠a a comprarle a este vendedor.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and goes on smoothly. The fragrance is a bit too strong for my taste, however as the day wears, it gets milder and very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife. It&#x27;s been her scent for years, but we don&#x27;t have a Victoria&#x27;s Secret close, and shopping at Victoria&#x27;s Secret&#x27;s website is a bit expensive. Being able to buy it on Amazon is a great alternative. She loves it and I love the smell when she uses it. It&#x27;s a win all around!</li>
            <li> Very good attention I get the product on time, in perfect condition, very good quality is much charm I recommend them 100% on the entire community of amazon ....</li>
            <li> Great scent. My girl n I love it. Highly recommend this scent to all  just turns me into a puppy dog.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Victoria Secret user and I just love the Love Spell collection, however, I would have been better off purchasing from the store where I can get 3 of their Love Spell products for under $30...</li>
            <li> Good arrival&lt;br /&gt; Pretty good I&#x27;ll buy a different direction</li>
            <li> I like the smell of it n it last a long time...</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom and she loved it.</li>
            <li> Item came promptly and as described.</li>
