            <li>Nothing is perfect</li>
            <li>Yeah, wonderful.    </li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>If you treat it with respect, it works great.  </li>
            <li>If you want to gamble with your child&#x27;s life then this is a great buy.</li>
            <li>Great...     </li>
            <li>My patient are every happy also.</li>
            <li>The idea is great, but it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise... all good</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a good diagnostic tool</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with that one.</li>
            <li>Invest in the most well known infrared Thermometer!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be happy to spend a bit more for a better quality unit.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use one and fairly quick (8 Seconds to read) and I thought it would be great!</li>
            <li>This is the BEST thermometer I have used with her and let me be clear I have tried them all - oral, rectal, forehead, ear, armpit stickers...</li>
            <li>my wife decided to go purchase a nice thermometer that we could get more accurate readings with.  </li>
            <li>we have always had accurate results!  </li>
            <li>Okay, let me try this thing on me...   </li>
            <li>3 degrees is highly important when it gets up over 100 on a infant!</li>
            <li>so I ended up taking my temperature - 99.9 and took it one more time 99.3.</li>
            <li>These are very convenient and great while they work.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for 29.99 and have never been able to get a read out of it.  </li>
            <li>I will be returning it and will hunt for a better one.  </li>
            <li>but every time we used this, it said 98.7 or at the most, 99.  </li>
            <li>I have never had any issues with it besides the fact that sometimes it does not want to read your temperature, but other than that it works great!</li>
            <li>This one is SO EASY to use.</li>
            <li>And its measurements are easy to read.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li>The batteries are fine.  </li>
            <li>Accurate.  </li>
            <li>I have yet to get an accurate reading.   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;d be great if it actually worked.  </li>
            <li>I bought this thermometer hoping for something that was quick, easy and accurate.   </li>
            <li>I bought this hoping for a quick, easy way to measure my daughter&#x27;s temperature...</li>
            <li>In the evening it measured him 100.8, but he seemed even more hot than before</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work worth beans!</li>
            <li>Well I was not sick</li>
            <li>Super, lab type accuracy?  </li>
            <li>Quick.  </li>
            <li>Well, the first two items  (quick and easy) are exactly on.  </li>
            <li>When I bought a new Infrared one (much easier and faster for $40-WORTH IT!!!!)</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Temple Digital Thermometer\\&quot; is a very good digital thermometer for taking quick readings.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t quite as easy to use (due to all the beeps and needing to be so precise with the directions) as many thermometers</li>
            <li>I would not recommend anyone who wants an accurate temperature reading purchase this item.</li>
            <li>WAS EXCITING SHOWING FAMILY</li>
            <li>is right at or below 98.6.    </li>
            <li>Just this week, I used it right after the pediatrician took a temperature at her office</li>
            <li>I knew it wasn&#x27;t right</li>
            <li>It has been reliable and accurate over the last two years and fabulous to use on children.  </li>
            <li>But they don&#x27;t last and are built very cheaply.  </li>
            <li>We have had the most consistent results with oral electronic thermometers, which are more difficult and time consuming to use but seem to be more reliable.</li>
            <li>I actually bought two more - one for my mom (grandma) and one for her daycare -</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s much I like it!</li>
            <li>First, I LOVE the \\&quot;last reading\\</li>
            <li>&quot; that comes up when you first turn it on -</li>
            <li>I first used this thermometer when I brought our baby home for the first time and we were still learning cries.  </li>
            <li>I just tested my daughter who feels burning hot with my brother&#x27;s thermometer in her armpit at 101.5.  </li>
            <li>After first taking it out of the package, it was reading temps in the 97.3 range.   </li>
            <li>and when I&#x27;m feeling better plan to go back to the store to return it.  </li>
            <li>It read at 104 on first user -</li>
            <li>After I re-read the instructions I measured again and 3 out of 3 were exact.</li>
            <li>First is hair will have an impact so move it away.</li>
            <li>He felt SO HOT</li>
            <li>/&gt;We&#x27;ve been very satisfied with this little instrument.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how accurate it is, but it has always given us consistent readings when used multiple times.</li>
            <li>This is so easy to use, our otherwise finicky and physical preschooler likes it and even mimics the use of it.  </li>
            <li>Only buy this product if you don&#x27;t need an accurate temperature.  </li>
            <li>one degree make that much of a difference?  </li>
            <li>The only time I had a problem was when I got an error code that I couldn&#x27;t clear; but I called the company and they replaced it fast and free!  </li>
            <li>1st Manufacturer&#x27;s phone line looped and never got to real person.</li>
            <li>Practice because too much may give you an error msg.</li>
            <li>We also have an ear thermometer which is the same kind used by the doctor&#x27;s office when we bring the kids in and we experience the same variability with that.  </li>
            <li>I have a digital that&#x27;s 9 years old that work better.</li>
            <li>(okay, let&#x27;s try the other temple and hold him VERY still)  </li>
            <li>After getting the exact same temp for all of us, I dug out her old armpit thermometer, and sure enough, she had a fever (100.3) while I was normal (97.9).  </li>
            <li>I initially had the same issues as many others.</li>
            <li>So when it shows me as having a high temperature, I still don&#x27;t know what to think.</li>
            <li>This is highly unacceptable and I wish I had kept my receipt to return this product</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not sure if mine is broke but there is no light on this</li>
            <li>Normally I just power cycle it</li>
            <li>so I thought I would upgrade to this new style of temple thermometer.  </li>
            <li>We tried new batteries too.</li>
            <li>imagine the excitement when i finally got myself into a local drugstore to privately purchase something more efficient.</li>
            <li>Instead, however, it consistently gives the EXACT SAME (incorrect) TEMP for multiple people, and we were waiting the two minutes between using.  </li>
            <li>This product never worked properly on the first attempt to get a temperature reading.</li>
            <li>FIRST ONE  WON&#x27;T BE THE LAST ONE.</li>
            <li>We found that it can vary up to a half degree on either side of the head, but generaly seems to be accurate</li>
            <li>This was a brand new unit, straight out of the box (purchased from a local pharmacy).  </li>
            <li>thermomter\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t appear to very accurate as of late</li>
            <li>This brand new digital temple thermomter isn&#x27;t working when it is brand new out of the box!  </li>
            <li>Any frail patient is not able to keep it secure orally long enough for an accurate reading.   </li>
            <li>Still, in the age of technology we are all probably over sensitive to accuracy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been seeing everything from about 96 to 100 (more commonly around 97-98).</li>
            <li>Baby is 14 months old now</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see how a company like this can push out products that don&#x27;t work and put things on the box like \\&quot;PROFESSIONAL ACCURACY\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I bought it from Rite Aid near our house.</li>
            <li>So I took my old mercury thermometer and it measured him at 104.3.</li>
            <li>I was very upset, because if I had known that I would have given him his medicine much earlier and it would probably never got so</li>
            <li>My old stand by \\&quot;in ear</li>
            <li>Last the amount of pressure you apply should only be enough to securely place on temple.</li>
            <li>second is the temple location is critical to reading the right temp.</li>
            <li>I bought this thermometer when my daughter was running a high fever, and I didn&#x27;t have a digital one.</li>
            <li>It takes too long to calculate the temperature so baby moves and moves and it becomes very innacurate.</li>
            <li>That said, a thermometer which can only take a temperature every two minutes is a new one to me...</li>
            <li>My wife was pregnant  a few months ago and we were visiting our HMO pharmacy.</li>
            <li>but if the reading was too high or too low I would confirm with a traditional thermometer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li>(most imporant: accurate)  is completely off base.   </li>
            <li>As the previous reviewer said - it is very quick and easy, but without the accuracy it is basically useless.      </li>
            <li>From the first use,  following the directions carefully,  I found that I always have a fever, as do all my family members,  and so do my patients.   </li>
            <li>I got a temp of 97.5 which gave us some ease; and when the doctor came, she got the exact same read with her professional methods and thermometer, which totally calmed us down.      </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really understand the difficulties reported by some of the other reviewers.</li>
            <li>Had trouble getting this to \\&quot;boot up,\\&quot; tried changing the batteries and that at first worked.  </li>
            <li>This product certainly has killed children.</li>

            <li> That said, a thermometer which can only take a temperature every two minutes is a new one to me...</li>
            <li> My wife was pregnant  a few months ago and we were visiting our HMO pharmacy.</li>
            <li> but if the reading was too high or too low I would confirm with a traditional thermometer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> (most imporant: accurate)  is completely off base.   </li>
            <li> As the previous reviewer said - it is very quick and easy, but without the accuracy it is basically useless.      </li>
            <li> From the first use,  following the directions carefully,  I found that I always have a fever, as do all my family members,  and so do my patients.   </li>
            <li> I got a temp of 97.5 which gave us some ease; and when the doctor came, she got the exact same read with her professional methods and thermometer, which totally calmed us down.      </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really understand the difficulties reported by some of the other reviewers.</li>
            <li> Had trouble getting this to \\&quot;boot up,\\&quot; tried changing the batteries and that at first worked.  </li>
            <li> This product certainly has killed children.</li>
            <li> I have tried this thing multiple times on myself today and found it reading anywhere from 98.3 to 99.8 hardly ever giving a consistent reading.    </li>
            <li> Daughter has febrile seizures and we bought this to eas our minds when she is sleeping, Never reads the same temp twice.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary</li>
            <li> My son (3 years old) was running a fever yesterday and instead of using an oral thermometer under his armpit (which is what we had done previously)</li>
            <li> It would read like 96.3 as normal temp for my little one!</li>
            <li> We have not had any negative experiences and consider it a valuable addition to our medicine cabinet for the whole family.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had this for two years and we still use it as a backup thermometer (as long as we have</li>
            <li> We have used this since my son was an infant and as long as we use it as directed (you need to wait until it beeps to turn on, hold it in the air until it beeps again and then place it to your temple until it beeps again)</li>
            <li> for the $29 dollars it was a complete waste of money, and time (driving to the store to buy it)</li>
            <li> Looks like other reviewers had the same issue but probably didn&#x27;t read the manual.    </li>
            <li> I just took my temp, for example, and got 97.8, 97.3, 97.8, 97.2 in the span of less than a minute for the same spot on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> She spotted this little non-invasive digital thermometer.</li>
            <li> A few key points to operating it correctly.</li>
            <li> In other words, if you drop it, step on it, run over it, or etc., it will not work.</li>
            <li> Reading 2 (other temple): 99.2  </li>
            <li> On the day our doctor was due to visit us for a \\&quot;progress check\\&quot;, Baby seemed realatively \\&quot;fussy\\&quot;, even after feeding, burping and changing.  </li>
            <li> If only I could give products negative stars...    </li>
            <li> so I knock it down a star for that.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to beat down this brand and company till me dying day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I checked them against each other, it was off by 3 degrees!</li>
            <li> This product is a total failure</li>
            <li> Reading 1: 103.9 (holy cow, we might need to go to the doctor immediately!)  </li>
            <li> Children could have serious consequences by such an inaccurate device!</li>
            <li> I love that it measures the temp in a few seconds - have you ever endured the torture of trying to take the temp of a sick, fussy and squirmy toddler?!  </li>
            <li> will now get under the mouth temp readers as I don&#x27;t trust in the digital guessing game</li>
            <li> We have a sick child who is clearly burning up and we get readings from 97. 8 to 102 and back again, all in the course of 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need the stress of freaking if you child doesn&#x27;t run a normal temperature or not believe your thermometer that you bought at a expensive price!</li>
            <li> I found this product to be very flawed, extremely unreliable and a total waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Often,  an anxious child is frightened by them and will not allow it under the armpit for the needed time.</li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s going on with that?  </li>
            <li> Unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> This thing is so inaccurate I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it even for small problems.</li>
            <li> In the wrong spot I got 101 reading from 99.2 actual.</li>
            <li> If I could give a rating of negative five star, I would.</li>
            <li> When my two year old son got sick and was burning up with fever, I took his temperature - 100.9.</li>
            <li> My 3 y/o toddler daughter suffers from febrile seizures (a seizure that arises when her fever rapidly rises and/or spikes).  </li>

            <li> this is ridiculous.   </li>

            <li> Completely unreliable and therefore a worthless product.</li>
            <li> Seemed flimsy and poorly put together.  </li>

            <li> Bad, but not too bad.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Never worked properly from the moment I received it.  Will not give me a temperature readout at all.  I press power, it beeps, I press the sensor to my temple, the device beeps, I check my readout, and only &amp;#34;F&amp;#34; for Fahrenheit is displayed.  No temperature, just F.  I changed the batteries, and the device still doesn&#x27;t work.  Today, a year later, I found it in the back of a cabinet and tried to use it again.  Same results.  It&#x27;s going into the trash can.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had this for two years and we still use it as a backup thermometer (as long as we have it might as well use it).  My wife has always sworn that it reads low.  The reviews that highlight the variability in results are somewhat correct in our experience.  I just took my temp, for example, and got 97.8, 97.3, 97.8, 97.2 in the span of less than a minute for the same spot on my forehead.  Still, in the age of technology we are all probably over sensitive to accuracy. Does +/- one degree make that much of a difference?  We also have an ear thermometer which is the same kind used by the doctor&#x27;s office when we bring the kids in and we experience the same variability with that.  We have had the most consistent results with oral electronic thermometers, which are more difficult and time consuming to use but seem to be more reliable.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use, our otherwise finicky and physical preschooler likes it and even mimics the use of it.  Nonintrusive, doesn&#x27;t upset them, and can even be used when they&#x27;re asleep.  Super, lab type accuracy?  Probably not, but it will get you in the ballpark and let you know if you should go to the doc.</li>
            <li> I am a home care nurse frustrated with the slow digital thermometers provided by my agency.  Often,  an anxious child is frightened by them and will not allow it under the armpit for the needed time. Any frail patient is not able to keep it secure orally long enough for an accurate reading.   imagine the excitement when i finally got myself into a local drugstore to privately purchase something more efficient. From the first use,  following the directions carefully,  I found that I always have a fever, as do all my family members,  and so do my patients.   It does not agree to  the oral thermometers,  and I will have to discard, as i have lost the packaging materials.   I would discourage anyone from purchasing this product, and if you do, keep all the materials and receipt for when you need to  return it.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a caveat in the user manual &#x27;wait two minutes before attempting again&#x27;.  I noticed that after thinking it was inconsistent.  Looks like other reviewers had the same issue but probably didn&#x27;t read the manual.    That said, a thermometer which can only take a temperature every two minutes is a new one to me... so I knock it down a star for that.  Otherwise... all good</li>
            <li> This thermometer gives the most random readings imaginable. I&#x27;ve been seeing everything from about 96 to 100 (more commonly around 97-98). So when it shows me as having a high temperature, I still don&#x27;t know what to think. This thermometer is totally useless.</li>
            <li> My 3 y/o toddler daughter suffers from febrile seizures (a seizure that arises when her fever rapidly rises and/or spikes).  As a result I am hyper vigilant about her temperature when she is sick because I want to be prepared when a seizure may strike.  This is the BEST thermometer I have used with her and let me be clear I have tried them all - oral, rectal, forehead, ear, armpit stickers... they all suck. This one is SO EASY to use. And its measurements are easy to read. I also like that it records the last temp so that you can have a baseline of where you have been.  I think a lot of complaints come from user error - if you get two vastly different temps then you have to know you are doing something wrong.  It instructions say to wait 2 mins between temp taking to assure that the device is not measuring incorrectly. I love that it measures the temp in a few seconds - have you ever endured the torture of trying to take the temp of a sick, fussy and squirmy toddler?!  Nothing is perfect but I recommend this thermometer. I actually bought two more - one for my mom (grandma) and one for her daycare - that&#x27;s much I like it!</li>
            <li> Works great.  Easy to use.  Quick.  Accurate.  If you treat it with respect, it works great.  In other words, if you drop it, step on it, run over it, or etc., it will not work.</li>
            <li> My son (3 years old) was running a fever yesterday and instead of using an oral thermometer under his armpit (which is what we had done previously) my wife decided to go purchase a nice thermometer that we could get more accurate readings with.  We brought it home, opened it, read the instructions and then proceeded to check his temperature.    Reading 1: 103.9 (holy cow, we might need to go to the doctor immediately!)  Reading 2: 99.7 (??? maybe we did it wrong)  Reading 3: 101.3 (okay, let&#x27;s try the other temple and hold him VERY still)  Reading 4: 99.5  Reading 5: 101.8    Okay, let me try this thing on me...   Reading 1: 99.5  Reading 2 (other temple): 99.2  Not sure what&#x27;s going on with that?  I don&#x27;t feel sick and usually my temperature (oral) is right at or below 98.6.    We ended up using the oral thermometer on my son getting an armpit temperature of 99.7 (adding 1 degree for the armpit) --- 101.7.  I have tried this thing multiple times on myself today and found it reading anywhere from 98.3 to 99.8 hardly ever giving a consistent reading.    As the previous reviewer said - it is very quick and easy, but without the accuracy it is basically useless.      This was a brand new unit, straight out of the box (purchased from a local pharmacy).  Personally, I hope my wife kept the receipt.  This one is going back!</li>
            <li> First, I LOVE the \\&quot;last reading\\&quot; that comes up when you first turn it on - it&#x27;s a very big help to a concerned parent.      I first used this thermometer when I brought our baby home for the first time and we were still learning cries.  On the day our doctor was due to visit us for a \\&quot;progress check\\&quot;, Baby seemed realatively \\&quot;fussy\\&quot;, even after feeding, burping and changing.  So, I checked Baby&#x27;s temp using this thermometer in case of \\&quot;sickness\\&quot;.  I got a temp of 97.5 which gave us some ease; and when the doctor came, she got the exact same read with her professional methods and thermometer, which totally calmed us down.      The only time I had a problem was when I got an error code that I couldn&#x27;t clear; but I called the company and they replaced it fast and free!  I would recommend this for any mom.  Baby is 14 months old now and it&#x27;s still going strong.  In fact, Baby \\&quot;giggles\\&quot; and even sits still while taking temp.</li>
            <li> We have used this since my son was an infant and as long as we use it as directed (you need to wait until it beeps to turn on, hold it in the air until it beeps again and then place it to your temple until it beeps again) we have always had accurate results!  It isn&#x27;t quite as easy to use (due to all the beeps and needing to be so precise with the directions) as many thermometers but you can&#x27;t beat it for the price!</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping for a quick, easy way to measure my daughter&#x27;s temperature... It&#x27;d be great if it actually worked.  Instead, however, it consistently gives the EXACT SAME (incorrect) TEMP for multiple people, and we were waiting the two minutes between using.  I thought it didn&#x27;t seem correct for my daughter (98.9), so I tried it on myself, then my husband.  After getting the exact same temp for all of us, I dug out her old armpit thermometer, and sure enough, she had a fever (100.3) while I was normal (97.9).  It simply isn&#x27;t reliable.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!!! Thermometer read 93.6 for me, my husband, my toddler, AND my coffee. Never worked and there is no help to get it working. Don&#x27;t waste your money just to be frustrated, especially when trying to measure the temp of a sick toddler.</li>
            <li> Not practical for a baby. It takes too long to calculate the temperature so baby moves and moves and it becomes very innacurate.</li>
            <li> Only buy this product if you don&#x27;t need an accurate temperature.  I just tested my daughter who feels burning hot with my brother&#x27;s thermometer in her armpit at 101.5.  This shows 98.4.  Unbelievable.  Completely unreliable and therefore a worthless product.</li>
            <li> This thermometer only worked once and then stopped working. Now resides in my trash can.</li>
            <li> I looked this product up so I could recommend it to my sister and was somewhat shocked to see the poor reviews.  It has been reliable and accurate over the last two years and fabulous to use on children.  Just this week, I used it right after the pediatrician took a temperature at her office and this thermometer was only 3 tenths off.</li>
            <li> If you want to gamble with your child&#x27;s life then this is a great buy. It has misread temps countless times&lt;br /&gt;My Daughter has febrile seizures and we bought this to eas our minds when she is sleeping, Never reads the same temp twice. Today she was 98.7 . We said screw it took her to the emergency and guess what she was 104....This thing almost killed my daughter :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if mine is broke but there is no light on this so you can&#x27;t read it at night. I feel ripped off&lt;br /&gt;and I will continue to beat down this brand and company till me dying day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will now get under the mouth temp readers as I don&#x27;t trust in the digital guessing game</li>
            <li> My wife was pregnant  a few months ago and we were visiting our HMO pharmacy. She spotted this little non-invasive digital thermometer. She insisted that we get it for taking \\&quot;non-invasive\\&quot; temperatures of our soon-to-be-born son. We already had a couple thermometers, but I relented. We&#x27;ve now had it about 5 months. We&#x27;ve used it for the baby and for ourselves. In fact, just today I was feeling a little ill and my wife took my temperature three times (98.9 all three times).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve been very satisfied with this little instrument. It&#x27;s convenient and easy to use. I don&#x27;t know how accurate it is, but it has always given us consistent readings when used multiple times. I don&#x27;t really understand the difficulties reported by some of the other reviewers. We have not had any negative experiences and consider it a valuable addition to our medicine cabinet for the whole family. Hopefully, it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary Peterson</li>
            <li> Had trouble getting this to \\&quot;boot up,\\&quot; tried changing the batteries and that at first worked.  Then dropped it from a height of 2 feet onto a wood floor, the back came off and batteries scattered.  After reassembling it it wouldn&#x27;t work unless I left the back off.  Would not register a temperature on my 3-year-old son who I KNOW had a temp (I have six children and I know a fever).  Seemed flimsy and poorly put together.  I replaced this with the Exergen model and I am very pleased with that one.</li>
            <li> Bought mine for $30. 2 different Manufacturer listed. 1st Manufacturer&#x27;s phone line looped and never got to real person. 2nd wouldn&#x27;t even replace it for me. They just kept telling me that I wasn&#x27;t cleaning it and that I didn&#x27;t call soon enough. RRR. It was easy to use one and fairly quick (8 Seconds to read) and I thought it would be great! IT WAS HORRIBLE!!!!!!! It would read like 96.3 as normal temp for my little one! When I bought a new Infrared one (much easier and faster for $40-WORTH IT!!!!) I checked them against each other, it was off by 3 degrees! 3 degrees is highly important when it gets up over 100 on a infant! SO DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!! Invest in the most well known infrared Thermometer! You don&#x27;t need the stress of freaking if you child doesn&#x27;t run a normal temperature or not believe your thermometer that you bought at a expensive price!</li>
            <li> IF I could give this item a 0 star rating I would.  I bought this thermometer hoping for something that was quick, easy and accurate.   Well, the first two items  (quick and easy) are exactly on.  The third (most imporant: accurate)  is completely off base.   No, this thermometer has not been dropped, nor did I have any troubles putting the batteries in as the thermometer came with the batteries already in it.   I have yet to get an accurate reading.   After first taking it out of the package, it was reading temps in the 97.3 range.   Yesterday, I knew I had a fever, I used it and got a 97.3 reading.   My sister who works at a hospital recommended I take it three times in the same spot.   On her advice, I got a 101 reading followed by a 99.3 then 97.5 reading ... this is ridiculous.   All I could think is if I bought this for my child, I would NEVER know whether or not they were running a fever.  I do not trust this thing and when I&#x27;m feeling better plan to go back to the store to return it.  This is a definite do not buy ... for the $29 dollars it was a complete waste of money, and time (driving to the store to buy it)</li>
            <li> If only I could give products negative stars...    I bought this for my sister who has MONO, so she needs to have her temperature taken every once in a while. It read at 104 on first user - we freaked and did it again. 100. Great...     This thing is so inaccurate I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it even for small problems. Taking three readings in the same spot (on myself) came with 97, 96.4, and 99.3. Yeah, wonderful.    I don&#x27;t see how a company like this can push out products that don&#x27;t work and put things on the box like \\&quot;PROFESSIONAL ACCURACY\\&quot;. What a load...    This is highly unacceptable and I wish I had kept my receipt to return this product (I purchased it at Rite-AID, but decided to let the internets know of its shortcoming).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a home health nurse help to keep the germs for spreading. My patient are every happy also. No holding thermometer in their mouths with teeth or shaking hands.</li>
            <li> I purchased this thermometer on sale to use on my newborn son.  I never got 2 readings in a row that were close to the same.  after using it about 20 times I got an error 3 code and could not find a way to reset it.  I would not recommend anyone who wants an accurate temperature reading purchase this item.</li>
            <li> I bought this thermometer when my daughter was running a high fever, and I didn&#x27;t have a digital one. I bought it from Rite Aid near our house. I have never had any issues with it besides the fact that sometimes it does not want to read your temperature, but other than that it works great!</li>
            <li> If I could give a rating of negative five star, I would. When my two year old son got sick and was burning up with fever, I took his temperature - 100.9. Bad, but not too bad. I was instructed by the doctor to not give him any medication unless it was over 102. In the evening it measured him 100.8, but he seemed even more hot than before so I ended up taking my temperature - 99.9 and took it one more time 99.3. Well I was not sick so that did not make sence. So I took my old mercury thermometer and it measured him at 104.3. I was very upset, because if I had known that I would have given him his medicine much earlier and it would probably never got so high.&lt;br /&gt;THEY SHOULD TAKE THIS USELESS THING OFF OF THE MARKET!!!</li>
            <li> You have got to be kidding. This product certainly has killed children. I have a boy with a 103.5 fever using a mouth thermometer and this thing says 98.5. PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF SH$T.</li>
            <li> As a medic in remote locations, I need equipment that is simple and reliable, as I use medical products frequently. I purchased one of these thermometers and immediately had to return it as it did not work at all. The second unit that I purchased only worked about 10% of the time, and that was only after repeated attempts to get it to operate properly.This product never worked properly on the first attempt to get a temperature reading. I found this product to be very flawed, extremely unreliable and a total waste of time and money. I give this product 1 star but that my be overrated. This product is a total failure</li>
            <li> These are very convenient and great while they work.  But they don&#x27;t last and are built very cheaply.  We&#x27;ve had two, and both lasted under a year.  I&#x27;d be happy to spend a bit more for a better quality unit.</li>
            <li> If you buy this your wasting your money. Worst thermometer ever. I have a digital that&#x27;s 9 years old that work better. Be for warned.</li>
            <li> I hesitate to even give 1 star for this thermometer.  The idea is great, but it doesn&#x27;t work.  I bought it for 29.99 and have never been able to get a read out of it.  I followed the directions, took it back to the pharmacy to see if they could get it to work, but it still won&#x27;t give a read.  I tried to return it, but because I had taken it out of the package, it was mine to keep.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I just bought this thermometer from Kaiser&#x27;s pharmacy for $26.95.  My old stand by \\&quot;in ear thermomter\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t appear to very accurate as of late so I thought I would upgrade to this new style of temple thermometer.  This brand new digital temple thermomter isn&#x27;t working when it is brand new out of the box!  The batteries are fine.  I read the manual over and over again and still can&#x27;t get any temperature read out of it.  I will be returning it and will hunt for a better one.  Don&#x27;t buy this one.  It doesn&#x27;t work worth beans!</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Temple Digital Thermometer\\&quot; is a very good digital thermometer for taking quick readings. Here are my observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* We found that it can vary up to a half degree on either side of the head, but generaly seems to be accurate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It can indeed be used on sleeping children&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It is fast, taking only a few seconds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It shows the last reading when it is turned on, a helpful feature&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good diagnostic tool but if the reading was too high or too low I would confirm with a traditional thermometer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> The instructions are very specific on where to read them. I initially had the same issues as many others. Inconsistent readings and error messages. After I re-read the instructions I measured again and 3 out of 3 were exact. A few key points to operating it correctly. First is hair will have an impact so move it away. second is the temple location is critical to reading the right temp. In the wrong spot I got 101 reading from 99.2 actual. Last the amount of pressure you apply should only be enough to securely place on temple. Practice because too much may give you an error msg. Normally I just power cycle it and if that doesn&#x27;t work I take the battery out and return them to fix it.</li>
            <li> My grandson has this and he was sick over the weekend.  He felt SO HOT but every time we used this, it said 98.7 or at the most, 99.  I knew it wasn&#x27;t right and my daughter then decided to check his temp rectally and it was 102.3!!  We tried it again after the rectal temp and it was still showing around 98!  How horrible of a product if you cannot trust it when your baby is ill!  Children could have serious consequences by such an inaccurate device!</li>
            <li> FIRST ONE  WON&#x27;T BE THE LAST ONE. WAS EXCITING SHOWING FAMILY HOW IT WORKS...ALMOST LIKE&lt;br /&gt;MAGIC COMPARED TO THE ANCIENT WAY. IT&#x27;S EASY,FAST AND  POSSIBLY UNBREAKABLE(won&#x27;t try that)</li>
            <li> Do not buy this. It is horrible and inaccurate. We have a sick child who is clearly burning up and we get readings from 97. 8 to 102 and back again, all in the course of 10 minutes. We tried new batteries too.</li>
