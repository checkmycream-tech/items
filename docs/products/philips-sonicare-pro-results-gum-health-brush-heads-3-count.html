            <li>Speed, and good things.</li>
            <li>good price~&lt;br /&gt;good</li>
            <li>I just had my teeth cleaned, and my gums are very healthy.</li>
            <li>These I can say with great confidence, are better than the ones that came with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love these brush heads!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>Make sure to buy the heads with Phillips written on them!</li>
            <li>Helps to effectively reduce plak on teeth.</li>
            <li>Perfect for sensitive teeth and gums!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll wind up spending more on replacement heads than the handset over the time you own it</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll update after more time</li>
            <li>Great product great service just what I expected from Amazon&#x27;s venders</li>
            <li>Great product cleans teeth very well.</li>
            <li>Love it..always important to replace!</li>
            <li>, get the cheapest handle, then upgrade the brush refills that are mostly interchangeable.</li>
            <li>I love my sonicare, these brushes improved my checkup in a week, brushing twice a day.</li>
            <li>They seem sturdier and of better quality.</li>
            <li>But it seems it is better than the bundle one.</li>
            <li>The Diamond brushes are excellent and my dentist gave me an &amp;#34;A&amp;#34; for the first time at my cleaning thanks to SonicCare.</li>
            <li>very clean feel every brush</li>
            <li>The goods:&lt;br /&gt;- Great for sensitive gums &amp; teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are after market but seem to be fine.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know which replacement head to buy, but these are fine.</li>
            <li>the original head though.</li>
            <li>After just two weeks, there was a significant increase in the health of the gums.</li>
            <li>They seem to clean</li>
            <li>These are so much better than the stock and the sensitive brush heads if you&#x27;re looking for more scrubbing.</li>
            <li>Very good, very professional and equal to the Philips product.</li>
            <li>My sensitive teeth are feeling better already</li>
            <li>Looks &amp; feels authentic, I do not think they are a knockoff like so many other products on amazon.</li>
            <li>--it seems to get to the back areas of the teeth better.</li>
            <li>Exactly as they claim.</li>
            <li>The dentist really thought we had been to the specialist when he saw the results!</li>
            <li>Got it quick and they are soft on my gums.</li>
            <li>I had the older version of these when I first bought my Sonicare.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a real bargain</li>
            <li>The brushes fit my &amp;#34;diamond clean&amp;#34; and husband&#x27;s regular &amp;#34;pro results&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Very good~!Fit</li>
            <li>my philips HX6730 very well.</li>
            <li>Compared with the traditional toothbrush significantly improved</li>
            <li>Same quality as the original.</li>
            <li>The lower-end Sonicare came with the regular (Simply Clean?)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soooo fast to ship to China!So surprised!</li>
            <li>This was a last-ditch effort to help the onset of Gingivitis while trying to avoid the high cost involved with seeing a specialist.</li>
            <li>They were a little hard on my teeth for the first couple of brushes but they relaxed on the bristles and have been working great.</li>
            <li>photo left to right is Sonicare Sensitive, Gum Health, and Compact).</li>
            <li>all you need is a basic Sonicare and don&#x27;t use the fancy settings on the handle (sensitive, clean and white, etc...)</li>
            <li>It works well, but you can get the same thing, at a discount, at Costco, for much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Costco offers a six-pack.</li>
            <li>The ones with no writing on the heads are useless knockoffs that don&#x27;t fit properly and have cheap brushes.</li>

            <li> great value...fast shipping...</li>
            <li> Bought to accompany the Sonicare purchased on Amazon for my son for Christmas.  The shipped timely and were just as expected and advertised.</li>
            <li> I love these brush heads!  I just had my teeth cleaned, and my gums are very healthy.</li>
            <li> Does not do as well as my former brush.</li>
            <li> The product I was looking for.</li>
            <li> very good price,very good service!</li>
            <li> Great brush heads to go with the sonic are brushes</li>
            <li> Got it quick and they are soft on my gums.</li>
            <li> Used these for a couple weeks now and they seem good. I&#x27;m often told by dentists that I brush too hard, and these brush heads are very gentle. They seem to clean well but I&#x27;ll update after more time (that&#x27;s why I gave 4/5 stars). I was concerned about the size because I prefer compact. These are larger than Sonicare compact but smaller than standard brush heads (photo left to right is Sonicare Sensitive, Gum Health, and Compact). I will buy the Gum Health brush heads again.</li>
            <li> My item was delivered on time, it was as described, I recommend this fantastic item and perfect seller</li>
            <li> Great product great service just what I expected from Amazon&#x27;s venders</li>
            <li> hmm.. these are supposed to be softer but it&#x27;s still quite hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;beats the original head though.</li>
            <li> Compared with the traditional toothbrush significantly improved</li>
            <li> These are absolutely not the brushes I received. There were two separate types included in the package. Additionally, the brushes are very hard (harder than the ones which came with the handle), and have done major damage to my gums to the point I cannot even brush my gums until they heal. It is difficult to eat. The picture does not even vaguely  resemble what was received.</li>
            <li> Came in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> The packaging was good and the brush heads work great!</li>
            <li> Dentist recommended it for my gums. Used for 3 months went back to dentist and they were very happy with my gums. Great price and on time delivery. Will buy again form this vendor.</li>
            <li> Great product cleans teeth very well. Removes plac.</li>
            <li> good price and good quality</li>
            <li> Love this product!  My sensitive teeth are feeling better already</li>
            <li> Love it..always important to replace!</li>
            <li> They are after market but seem to be fine.</li>
            <li> Have used a sonic care for years and have recently had to replace the unit. These are perfect fit. I like the smaller head--it seems to get to the back areas of the teeth better. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used yet but it&#x27;s a real bargain</li>
            <li> The goods:&lt;br /&gt;- Great for sensitive gums &amp; teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bads:&lt;br /&gt;- Not cheap. You&#x27;ll wind up spending more on replacement heads than the handset over the time you own it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The uglys:&lt;br /&gt;- None.</li>
            <li> I have a lower-end Sonicare and a higher-end Sonicare. The lower-end Sonicare came with the regular (Simply Clean?) stock brush heads, and the higher-end one came with these, which is how I discovered them. These are so much better than the stock and the sensitive brush heads if you&#x27;re looking for more scrubbing. Who knows what these are doing to the enamel or my gumline, but my teeth feel cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If all you need is a basic Sonicare and don&#x27;t use the fancy settings on the handle (sensitive, clean and white, etc...), get the cheapest handle, then upgrade the brush refills that are mostly interchangeable.</li>
            <li> The Diamond brushes are excellent and my dentist gave me an &amp;#34;A&amp;#34; for the first time at my cleaning thanks to SonicCare. For best results, I change brushes every 2-3 months.</li>
            <li> Same quality as the original. Make sure to buy the heads with Phillips written on them! The ones with no writing on the heads are useless knockoffs that don&#x27;t fit properly and have cheap brushes. (I made this mistake myself twice on Amazon by not paying attention.)</li>
            <li> Good product. Looks &amp; feels authentic, I do not think they are a knockoff like so many other products on amazon. The brushes fit my &amp;#34;diamond clean&amp;#34; and husband&#x27;s regular &amp;#34;pro results&amp;#34;. I wish it came in a 4 pack, but these are great nonetheless.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Exactly as they claim. very clean feel every brush</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know which replacement head to buy, but these are fine.</li>
            <li> Very good~!Fit my philips HX6730 very well.So who has the philips HX6730 wanna buy them can do it!</li>
            <li> I like this, but think this is a little pricey for replacement toothbrush heads.  It works well, but you can get the same thing, at a discount, at Costco, for much cheaper.  Costco offers a six-pack.</li>
            <li> Very good, very professional and equal to the Philips product. Seems to be working as it promised.</li>
            <li> I love my sonicare, these brushes improved my checkup in a week, brushing twice a day.</li>
            <li> Very good～  It can be used for HX6730～</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell if it&#x27;s any easier on my receding gums than the standard Sonicare brush heads</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soooo fast to ship to China!So surprised!</li>
            <li> a little hard and small</li>
            <li> I had the older version of these when I first bought my Sonicare. These I can say with great confidence, are better than the ones that came with the toothbrush. They seem sturdier and of better quality. They were a little hard on my teeth for the first couple of brushes but they relaxed on the bristles and have been working great.</li>
            <li> Speed, and good things.</li>
            <li> good price~&lt;br /&gt;good item~</li>
            <li> Great product.  Helps to effectively reduce plak on teeth.</li>
            <li> Well. I do not use this product yet. But it seems it is better than the bundle one.</li>
            <li> Perfect for sensitive teeth and gums!</li>
            <li> Next time I have to buy</li>
            <li> This was a last-ditch effort to help the onset of Gingivitis while trying to avoid the high cost involved with seeing a specialist. After just two weeks, there was a significant increase in the health of the gums. This brush along-side a daily peroxide &amp;#34;swish&amp;#34; saved us hundreds. The dentist really thought we had been to the specialist when he saw the results!</li>
