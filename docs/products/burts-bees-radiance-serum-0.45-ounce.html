            <li>Save your money and use vitamin E oil or olive oil, cheaper and smells better.</li>
            <li>many rashes, prone to acne)</li>
            <li>My complexion looked healthy and glowing.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my chest and neck where there is more sun exposure as well</li>
            <li>Seems to keep me hydrated and looking healthy. :)</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t even sure</li>
            <li>My over all skin tone was more even, and it did seem to...glow.</li>
            <li>Even under moisturizer and primer this products does not make my skinner any more greasy or clogged, and it has made a difference to the redness of my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am going to repurchase this product though I wish it were a bit cheaper and available in stores!</li>
            <li>My makeup went on smoother and stayed on better.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff for healing, moisturizing and toning my skin.</li>
            <li>I use Burts Bees radiance face lotion, and I love it, so</li>
            <li>I love love love this product.  </li>
            <li>It goes on nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more of this when the time comes.  </li>
            <li>One of the top ingredients is alcohol which I don&#x27;t know how I over looked that part</li>
            <li>Avocado oil they will work better than this.</li>
            <li>So far I can only find it online, but I&#x27;m happy to keep purchasing it here, the best price I&#x27;ve found thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-JR-</li>
            <li>but this almost tightened up everything, as a nice quick fix, and with continued use</li>
            <li>This is a great natural product!  </li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t write product reviews but this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>It helps the moisturizer and foundation go on more smoothly.</li>
            <li>I doubt about that the serum really has any funtion to do something good on the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it something I use sparingly, but every now and then when I have to pull an all nighter, or be up to go to work, it quickly makes my face look smooth and better than I have ever seen on my face.  </li>
            <li>Good for sensitive skin too - I break out with rashes easily.</li>
            <li>I mostly use this in the wrinkle prone areas (eyes, smile lines, etc.).  </li>

            <li>Readily available on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s my free advice besides not buying this.</li>
            <li>and I feel it has done good things for my thirty year old skin.</li>
            <li>and more as I go)- if you&#x27;re interested it&#x27;s at PostCancerHippie.com or facebook/postcancerhippie</li>
            <li>Thanks!  :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;After MUCH research, trial and error - the natural beauty products I have happily settled on that are&lt;br /&gt;1)Low</li>
            <li>If you need more than what natural can provide then that&#x27;s when you spend the money on better quality products or treatments.</li>
            <li>Very nice product - soothes my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I tend to add it to my morning moisturizer so that I&#x27;m not putting oil right on my face, but I have at times for a quick glow!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice my skin looking any more... \\&quot;radiant\\&quot;, but it feels a lot smoother and fresher.</li>
            <li>I wish they had a full body size.</li>
            <li>But overall the serum is really good.</li>
            <li>Outlast All Day Lipcolor (Toxin score: 4, not bad and</li>
            <li>Not a bad product, by any means, but maybe not a &amp;#34;Wow&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and most serums</li>
            <li>the performance is worth it to me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was also wanting to transition my skin care to something more natural, and family</li>
            <li>This product did not make me break out, nor did it irritate even my most sensitive spots.</li>
            <li>As far as serums go, I like this one, but it could be better.</li>
            <li>The other products in this line have been somewhat good.</li>
            <li>(Toxin score: 2, the blue, green, rose and pearl are all pearlescent, but the coffee, olive and white are more matte; the rose, white and pearl are good for highlighting.)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>I realized that most of the glowing reviews I read were apparently BEFORE they CHANGED the formula.</li>
            <li>I have 58yo dry skin and use this before my moisturizer as a kind of toner.</li>
            <li>I wanted this product to work, because it seems natural and healthy, but no matter how I tried, this particular product seemed to do nothing but bother my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s just normal serum wnothing special</li>
            <li>For such a low price the results are amazing!</li>
            <li>and more as I go)- if you&#x27;re interested it&#x27;s at PostCancerHippie.com or facebook/postcancerhippieul for others with the same intention.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it is pretty damn</li>
            <li>I use a toner first.</li>
            <li>It does not work miracles, possibly from not regularly using it, but I still have my scars, but the pigment in the &#x27;pits&#x27; has faded a good deal</li>
            <li>The first three times of use the formula seemed so watery, and my skin sucked it up so fast</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin, and I break out easy from new products, and I have never broken out from this Oil.</li>
            <li>And when the \\&quot;serum\\&quot; evaporates, there in absolutely nothing noticeable on the skin at all.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight on my combination skin</li>
            <li>While it hasn&#x27;t really solved my acne and allergy issues, I do find that it seems to be helping in the aging department by plumping  and hydrating my skin.  </li>
            <li>It was an opened item and was not the real product.</li>
            <li>I really like Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li>Once you really start looking at the ingredients list of products...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much this helps my skinâ€¦but i use it all the time.  </li>
            <li>Soaks in fast.  </li>
            <li>The thing i didn&#x27;t love as much is the value, it is kind of expensive for the amount you get.</li>
            <li>The dry oil has helped my combination skin to be more normal and breakouts are gone.</li>
            <li>I came across this Oil when it was originally at Target (before it became an on-line purchase only product) and I fell in love!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was wanting a hydrating formula that would help reduce fine wrinkles, and over all help brightening my skin without irritating it, or make it break out or become more oily.</li>
            <li>I took the time to read many reviews on this product which were good, bad</li>
            <li>This stuff is the opposite of greasy - super lightweight mineral serum that leaves my face refreshed.</li>
            <li>I thought I might as well expand on that particular line, so I bought the serum.</li>
            <li>I have used \\&quot;high end\\&quot; skin care products since I was still in my twenties and have found these products to work better than some of the more expensive products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>This product was highly recommended by a professional make up artist.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, combination skin.</li>
            <li>The absolute best skin care will come from your lifestyle, the foods you eat, avoiding unnecessary sun exposure, water hydration, proper sleep and less stress.</li>
            <li>And these are natural!</li>
            <li>Maybe better for extreme dry skin.</li>
            <li>all natural</li>
            <li>and since using this serum I&#x27;ve found that my skin is baby soft.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft and the dryness caused by chlorine is gone.</li>
            <li>If you skin is sensitive, this product will cause irritation.  </li>
            <li>SAVE your money and use at home all natural products like Coconut oil, Vitamin E,</li>
            <li>I am a mature lady</li>
            <li>love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural and I&#x27;m not applying petrochemicals to delicate skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First, I want to mention that smell does not matter to me usually, if it works I will tough it out, but this serum smells very nice, almost like honeysuckle.  </li>
            <li>What I have not found to be any usually different are my fine lines, such as small crows feet and smile lines.</li>
            <li>One of the main ingredients is alcohol which actually dries out your skin.</li>
            <li>I like Burt&#x27;s Bees and their natural approach to personal care products.</li>
            <li>a downside, it is very runny, and you have to be careful when applying it, or you might lose some when it rolls off your fingers.</li>
            <li>I am 50 years old, a grandmother, and I am regularly mistaken for the kids mother instead of their grandmother.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t see any change on my skin even though I put it on my face whole bottle for almost a month and half.</li>
            <li>I swim, and the chlorine was playing havoc with my mature, sensitive skin until I started using a drop or two of Radiance Serum after my post-swim shower, and after I spritzed a little toner on my face.</li>

            <li> I use a toner first.</li>
            <li> It does not work miracles, possibly from not regularly using it, but I still have my scars, but the pigment in the &#x27;pits&#x27; has faded a good deal</li>
            <li> The first three times of use the formula seemed so watery, and my skin sucked it up so fast</li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin, and I break out easy from new products, and I have never broken out from this Oil.</li>
            <li> And when the \\&quot;serum\\&quot; evaporates, there in absolutely nothing noticeable on the skin at all.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight on my combination skin</li>
            <li> While it hasn&#x27;t really solved my acne and allergy issues, I do find that it seems to be helping in the aging department by plumping  and hydrating my skin.  </li>
            <li> It was an opened item and was not the real product.</li>
            <li> I really like Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li> Once you really start looking at the ingredients list of products...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much this helps my skinâ€¦but i use it all the time.  </li>
            <li> Soaks in fast.  </li>
            <li> The thing i didn&#x27;t love as much is the value, it is kind of expensive for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> The dry oil has helped my combination skin to be more normal and breakouts are gone.</li>
            <li> I came across this Oil when it was originally at Target (before it became an on-line purchase only product) and I fell in love!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was wanting a hydrating formula that would help reduce fine wrinkles, and over all help brightening my skin without irritating it, or make it break out or become more oily.</li>
            <li> I took the time to read many reviews on this product which were good, bad</li>
            <li> This stuff is the opposite of greasy - super lightweight mineral serum that leaves my face refreshed.</li>
            <li> I thought I might as well expand on that particular line, so I bought the serum.</li>
            <li> I have used \\&quot;high end\\&quot; skin care products since I was still in my twenties and have found these products to work better than some of the more expensive products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> This product was highly recommended by a professional make up artist.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, combination skin.</li>
            <li> The absolute best skin care will come from your lifestyle, the foods you eat, avoiding unnecessary sun exposure, water hydration, proper sleep and less stress.</li>
            <li> And these are natural!</li>
            <li> Maybe better for extreme dry skin.</li>
            <li> all natural</li>
            <li> and since using this serum I&#x27;ve found that my skin is baby soft.  </li>
            <li> My skin is soft and the dryness caused by chlorine is gone.</li>
            <li> If you skin is sensitive, this product will cause irritation.  </li>
            <li> SAVE your money and use at home all natural products like Coconut oil, Vitamin E,</li>
            <li> I am a mature lady</li>
            <li> love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural and I&#x27;m not applying petrochemicals to delicate skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First, I want to mention that smell does not matter to me usually, if it works I will tough it out, but this serum smells very nice, almost like honeysuckle.  </li>
            <li> What I have not found to be any usually different are my fine lines, such as small crows feet and smile lines.</li>
            <li> One of the main ingredients is alcohol which actually dries out your skin.</li>
            <li> I like Burt&#x27;s Bees and their natural approach to personal care products.</li>
            <li> a downside, it is very runny, and you have to be careful when applying it, or you might lose some when it rolls off your fingers.</li>
            <li> I am 50 years old, a grandmother, and I am regularly mistaken for the kids mother instead of their grandmother.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see any change on my skin even though I put it on my face whole bottle for almost a month and half.</li>
            <li> I swim, and the chlorine was playing havoc with my mature, sensitive skin until I started using a drop or two of Radiance Serum after my post-swim shower, and after I spritzed a little toner on my face.</li>
            <li> I mean, really radiant and clear.</li>
            <li> I have pretty dry skin, so this allows me to add moisture to my skin without feeling greasy, or looking greasy (once dried)</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, 24 yo female, and I occasionally have acne as well as dry skin and acne scars.  </li>
            <li> I will say that it does not last as long as they suggest.  </li>
            <li> When I first applied it to my face, it felt sticky and tight, but I was seeing results after a few days, overall improved skin complexion.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time, and it&#x27;s soo moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Never will order again because of not natural smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot less expensive than most serums on the market.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in lines one way or the other, but I feel naked without it!</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin from getting dry in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I also always felt that my face was naturally saggy, chubby cheeks, no prominent bone structure....</li>
            <li> After just a few days your skin is left glowing.</li>
            <li> Money well spent.</li>
            <li> I use the EWG skindeep database and try for only products that score a 2 or below, but have a few that are 3 or 4.</li>
            <li> Amazon had the cheapest price for it compared to other websites that sold it, so I will continue to buy it from here.</li>
            <li> I have not had any peeling or redness, as with some other serums I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the skin around my eyes is looking any younger, but it does feel smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Apparently some of the reviewers here don&#x27;t like them, but I wish I had the bottle that the negative reviewer threw away because they have worked well for me.</li>
            <li> I do use it with the other Radiance products [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Its not uncommon for my cheeks to seem very red, and any treatment of my skin leaves it a bit red afterwards.</li>
            <li> Tried this product but it left my skin feeling oily and a little sticky feeling, usually like Burts Bee&#x27;s products but not this one.</li>
            <li> I am 57 years old and these products have decreased lines and also made my skin \\&quot;glow\\&quot; again.  </li>
            <li> I had not realized how dull my skin had become after only a few days.  </li>
            <li> It is an odd texture&lt;br /&gt;Left</li>
            <li> Lines less visible, I wear it here in fl with no othermakeup but blush</li>
            <li> When I do this it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or tight,</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and hardly ever break out.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin after a few applications.  </li>
            <li> This dried my face out.</li>
            <li> But this is a waste of your money.</li>
            <li> As much as my pale, freckled pinky self can.</li>
            <li> It smells pretty bad</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would had I not used this and Burt&#x27;s moisturizer at night</li>
            <li> I use this in the morning and the evening, two drops each time and follow with my usual moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand some of the negative reviews for this product, unless people think a few drops of serum will eliminate wrinkles and reverse years of sun damage.</li>
            <li> No more dryness.</li>
            <li> I will occasionally use a little on my hands when I&#x27;m desperate.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> but since it&#x27;s so water-like, you need at least 10-20 drops to cover your face.</li>
            <li> After a week a use I have noticed my skin is subtly brighter, but my skin has broken out a bit.</li>
            <li> I like some of Burt Bees products, however, I am not happy with this one.</li>
            <li> not 5 stars because it is soooo expensive</li>
            <li> so nothing bad in this stuff!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was not too impressed by it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t love it like I wanted to. I found it too sticky</li>
            <li> This serum doesn&#x27;t do anything at all, you might as well put water on your face. It states that you should put one or two drops but since it&#x27;s so water-like, you need at least 10-20 drops to cover your face. And when the \\&quot;serum\\&quot; evaporates, there in absolutely nothing noticeable on the skin at all. As if, water evaporated from your face. Do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> What is this serum for? I doubt about that the serum really has any funtion to do something good on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just normal serum wnothing special and I don&#x27;t see any change on my skin even though I put it on my face whole bottle for almost a month and half. I won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and hardly ever break out.  This radiance serum was recommended for my skin type by the burts bees website so I purchased it.  But I threw it away after a couple weeks because it was making me break out.  And it didn&#x27;t make my skin feel moisturized like a good serum should.  One of the main ingredients is alcohol which actually dries out your skin.</li>
            <li> All the products made by BURTS BEES&lt;br /&gt;ARE WONDERFUL.</li>
            <li> I mostly use this in the wrinkle prone areas (eyes, smile lines, etc.).  It&#x27;s a nice light boost of moisture.  It&#x27;s not oily so doesn&#x27;t leave my already oil prone face too shiny.  I like Burt&#x27;s Bees and their natural approach to personal care products.</li>
            <li> Great product...all natural</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write product reviews but this stuff is amazing! I have sensitive skin and most serums cause me to break out but not this one! After just a few days your skin is left glowing. For such a low price the results are amazing! Money well spent.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time, and it&#x27;s soo moisturizing. I don&#x27;t really notice my skin looking any more... \\&quot;radiant\\&quot;, but it feels a lot smoother and fresher.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, 24 yo female, and I occasionally have acne as well as dry skin and acne scars.  I really love this product. First, I want to mention that smell does not matter to me usually, if it works I will tough it out, but this serum smells very nice, almost like honeysuckle.  My pores always seem smaller, and I do not need a moisturizer after putting it on.... it is awwwesome in the winter.  I will say that it does not last as long as they suggest.  I cannot only use 2 drops to sufficiently cover my face.  So it something I use sparingly, but every now and then when I have to pull an all nighter, or be up to go to work, it quickly makes my face look smooth and better than I have ever seen on my face.  It does not work miracles, possibly from not regularly using it, but I still have my scars, but the pigment in the &#x27;pits&#x27; has faded a good deal, it took me a while to notice, but it has definitely improved.  I also always felt that my face was naturally saggy, chubby cheeks, no prominent bone structure.... but this almost tightened up everything, as a nice quick fix, and with continued use I did get results..... not 5 stars because it is soooo expensive</li>
            <li> I came across this Oil when it was originally at Target (before it became an on-line purchase only product) and I fell in love!&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin, and I break out easy from new products, and I have never broken out from this Oil. I have pretty dry skin, so this allows me to add moisture to my skin without feeling greasy, or looking greasy (once dried) It gives you a beautiful glow under your make-up; it stands by the \\&quot;Radiance\\&quot; label. I tend to add it to my morning moisturizer so that I&#x27;m not putting oil right on my face, but I have at times for a quick glow! Love the product- will continue to buy! BTW- Amazon had the cheapest price for it compared to other websites that sold it, so I will continue to buy it from here.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and I feel it has done good things for my thirty year old skin. I use it at night as it is basically oil.</li>
            <li> This is a great natural product!  It&#x27;s expensive, but it lasts a long time.  It keeps my skin from getting dry in the winter.  I will occasionally use a little on my hands when I&#x27;m desperate.  I think it prevents wrinkles, too</li>
            <li> There is nothing better than this to put on in the morning. I wish they had a full body size. lol</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find these in stores, its a bit sticky and haven&#x27;t felt or seen a difference. I can just say is okay.</li>
            <li> I actually liked the product. Very lightweight on my combination skin and i felt it improved my skin texture too. The thing i didn&#x27;t love as much is the value, it is kind of expensive for the amount you get. Don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;ll buy again because of that. But overall the serum is really good.</li>
            <li> Tried this product but it left my skin feeling oily and a little sticky feeling, usually like Burts Bee&#x27;s products but not this one. Maybe better for extreme dry skin.</li>
            <li> love it.  5 drops.  face and neck.  no break outs</li>
            <li> 2 thums up grate product will order again soon</li>
            <li> This stuff is the opposite of greasy - super lightweight mineral serum that leaves my face refreshed. A+ will buy again!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. It is light and airy and feels like you have nothing on, but leaves your skin moisturized. I have not had any peeling or redness, as with some other serums I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m not sure if the skin around my eyes is looking any younger, but it does feel smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural and I&#x27;m not applying petrochemicals to delicate skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a downside, it is very runny, and you have to be careful when applying it, or you might lose some when it rolls off your fingers. Do keep in mind, that at 2-3 drops per day, it will last 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> I like some of Burt Bees products, however, I am not happy with this one. It smells pretty bad and I have not noticed any difference in skin or complexion. Save your money and use vitamin E oil or olive oil, cheaper and smells better.</li>
            <li> Very nice product - soothes my dry skin. Good for sensitive skin too - I break out with rashes easily. This produce is easy on my skin and a nice boost to my moisturizer. I put it on my hands as well. Not too greasy.</li>
            <li> My skin is problematic (aging, food allergies &#x3D; many rashes, prone to acne) and since using this serum I&#x27;ve found that my skin is baby soft.  While it hasn&#x27;t really solved my acne and allergy issues, I do find that it seems to be helping in the aging department by plumping  and hydrating my skin.  I use it twice daily - in the morning under my moisturizing sunscreen, and at night with Argan oil before bed.</li>
            <li> Over 50 and I have no lines or dryness under my eyes - have used this product for years.  Nothing else even comes close to hydrating as well and a bottle lasts for months.</li>
            <li> I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Ageless serum and Radiance serum for about three weeks and can tell an amazing difference in my skin.  I am 57 years old and these products have decreased lines and also made my skin \\&quot;glow\\&quot; again.  Apparently some of the reviewers here don&#x27;t like them, but I wish I had the bottle that the negative reviewer threw away because they have worked well for me. I have used \\&quot;high end\\&quot; skin care products since I was still in my twenties and have found these products to work better than some of the more expensive products I&#x27;ve used.  And these are natural!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any diffetence since using</li>
            <li> It was an opened item and was not the real product. I threw it away immediately.</li>
            <li> Just to change things up, I stopped using this for a couple of days, then went back to it.  I could see the difference in my skin.  My complexion looked healthy and glowing.  I had not realized how dull my skin had become after only a few days.  My wrinkles were plumped out and the color was improved.  Won&#x27;t go without it again.  I do use it with the other Radiance products [[ASIN:B002DPUY5G Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Day Creme, 2-Ounce Jar]] and [[ASIN:B002DPUY5Q Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Eye Cr&amp;egrave;me, .5-Ounce Jar]]</li>
            <li> After a week a use I have noticed my skin is subtly brighter, but my skin has broken out a bit. It&#x27;s good for the price.</li>
            <li> I applied this to my face after washing and it does make your skin appear brighter in about a week after daily use. Made with essential oils so nothing bad in this stuff! Doesn&#x27;t do anything for the wrinkles so go for the repairing serum if you&#x27;re after that effect.</li>
            <li> I use this during the day and the ageless night creme at night.  I can see a difference.  My face feels softer and looks really good.  I really like Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li> Having finished chemo and radiation treatments I have become quite a &#x27;post cancer hippie&#x27; with regards to all of my personal products. I don&#x27;t want anything with a bunch of toxic ingredients. Once you really start looking at the ingredients list of products... well, it&#x27;s more disturbing that I ever realized. I use the EWG skindeep database and try for only products that score a 2 or below, but have a few that are 3 or 4. ([...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the serum for about 4 months now and I LOVE IT! I use it on my chest and neck where there is more sun exposure as well and I couldn&#x27;t be happier, it&#x27;s like a drink of water for my skin and every time I go for a facial now they comment how hydrated my skin is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After MUCH research, trial and error - the natural beauty products I have happily settled on that are&lt;br /&gt;1)Low in toxic ingredients&lt;br /&gt;2)Still quality products that work well and&lt;br /&gt;3) Readily available on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001GIOV8M Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Serum]] (Toxin score: 1)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003TC5SM6 Juice Beauty Refining Finishing Powder]] (Toxin score: 2)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000Z61VVQ Juice Beauty SPF 30 Tinted Mineral Moisturizer]] (Toxin score: 3)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000E3C024 Larenim Blush]] (Toxin score: 2)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0049QV3KC SANTE All-Natural Eyeshadow Stick]] (Toxin score: 2, the blue, green, rose and pearl are all pearlescent, but the coffee, olive and white are more matte; the rose, white and pearl are good for highlighting.)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000US0804 Ecco Bella Mascara]] (Toxin score: 1)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0013OXEFU Lavilin Deodorant]] (Custom toxin score: ~3)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00015XAQ0 Avalon Organics Vitamin C Cleansing Gel]] (Toxin Score 3)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0063I3RNA EO Everyone Soap Lavender and Aloe]] (Toxin Score: 3)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003EUR1D2 Kiss My Face Whenever Shampoo and Conditioner]] (Toxin score: 2)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CoverGirl Outlast All Day Lipcolor (Toxin score: 4, not bad and the performance is worth it to me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this is helpful for others with the same intention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/30 update - I decided to start a blog with all of this (and more as I go)- if you&#x27;re interested it&#x27;s at PostCancerHippie.com or facebook/postcancerhippieul for others with the same intention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/30 update - I decided to start a blog with all of this (and more as I go)- if you&#x27;re interested it&#x27;s at PostCancerHippie.com or facebook/postcancerhippie</li>
            <li> This product was highly recommended by a professional make up artist.  I have been using since it arrived...skin is feeling and looking great!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much this helps my skinâ€¦but i use it all the time.  I&#x27;m just 30 and have used it the last 5 years and don&#x27;t have any wrinkles.  Not sure if I would had I not used this and Burt&#x27;s moisturizer at night but anyway.  I wear sunblock, oil washing, this and moisturizer.  I exfoliate with a wash cloth, baking soda and vinegar sometimes.  Seems to keep me hydrated and looking healthy. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to say that this product is a miracle in a jar. But it is pretty damn impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For background I have very sensitive, combination skin. I am extremely fair, with lots of freckles. Its not uncommon for my cheeks to seem very red, and any treatment of my skin leaves it a bit red afterwards. I was wanting a hydrating formula that would help reduce fine wrinkles, and over all help brightening my skin without irritating it, or make it break out or become more oily. I was also wanting to transition my skin care to something more natural, and family friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tiny bottle has a removable glass dropper with a rubber tip. Trust the directions -- two drops does the job! The first three times of use the formula seemed so watery, and my skin sucked it up so fast I wasn&#x27;t even sure if I&#x27;d gotten anything on my skin! But within a week I noticed a distinctive difference. Smoother skin, and when I woke up in the morning my face wasn&#x27;t as puffy, discolored and sleepy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within three weeks I had extremely happy skin. My over all skin tone was more even, and it did seem to...glow. As much as my pale, freckled pinky self can. This product did not make me break out, nor did it irritate even my most sensitive spots. I use this in the morning and the evening, two drops each time and follow with my usual moisturizer. Even under moisturizer and primer this products does not make my skinner any more greasy or clogged, and it has made a difference to the redness of my skin. What I have not found to be any usually different are my fine lines, such as small crows feet and smile lines. These are just as before, but because the rest of face and neck is so hugely happy I shall continue using this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to repurchase this product though I wish it were a bit cheaper and available in stores! So far I can only find it online, but I&#x27;m happy to keep purchasing it here, the best price I&#x27;ve found thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-JR-</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand some of the negative reviews for this product, unless people think a few drops of serum will eliminate wrinkles and reverse years of sun damage. I swim, and the chlorine was playing havoc with my mature, sensitive skin until I started using a drop or two of Radiance Serum after my post-swim shower, and after I spritzed a little toner on my face. The results were great. No more dryness. My skin is soft and the dryness caused by chlorine is gone. It&#x27;s a lot less expensive than most serums on the market. I hope they keep making this product, because I depend on it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have oily skin and it does not make it feel oilier.  I noticed a difference in my skin after a few applications.  My makeup went on smoother and stayed on better.</li>
            <li> Very happy makes face feel very soft and smooth</li>
            <li> Not a bad product, by any means, but maybe not a &amp;#34;Wow&amp;#34; product. I do like how it feels on my skin. Very light</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for healing, moisturizing and toning my skin.</li>
            <li> The dry oil has helped my combination skin to be more normal and breakouts are gone. 2-4 drops are all it takes. I use a toner first.</li>
            <li> As far as serums go, I like this one, but it could be better. I use Burts Bees radiance face lotion, and I love it, so I thought I might as well expand on that particular line, so I bought the serum. When I first applied it to my face, it felt sticky and tight, but I was seeing results after a few days, overall improved skin complexion. But the trick is to mix it in with your daily moisturizer! I pump my moisturizer into my fingertips, then I add about 3 drops of the serum, mix it, and then apply to my face. When I do this it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or tight, just feels like my regular moisturizer!</li>
            <li> It is an odd texture&lt;br /&gt;Left my skin feeling sticky or tacky.  Seemed like good ingredients, but I couldn&#x27;t get over he texture.</li>
            <li> I have 58yo dry skin and use this before my moisturizer as a kind of toner. It helps the moisturizer and foundation go on more smoothly. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in lines one way or the other, but I feel naked without it! Subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I can&#x27;t find it in the stores.  Can only find it on Amazon.  I am 50 years old, a grandmother, and I am regularly mistaken for the kids mother instead of their grandmother.  I believe that this helps my skin stay youthful, although I also avoid the sun and I do not smoke.</li>
            <li> I mix 2 or 3 drops of this Burts Bees Radiance Serum in with my regular serum every morning and night, and my skin has improved drastically. I mean, really radiant and clear. Even toned and glowy. Love it! I use the Burts Bees Rosewater Toner too, which has also been wonderful for my skin. Thanks!  :)</li>
            <li> This dried my face out. I wanted this product to work, because it seems natural and healthy, but no matter how I tried, this particular product seemed to do nothing but bother my skin.</li>
            <li> If you skin is sensitive, this product will cause irritation.  The other products in this line have been somewhat good.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product.  It goes on nice and smooth.  Soaks in fast.  Smells great.  I will be ordering more of this when the time comes.  My skin has never felt smoother.</li>
            <li> Ick - I did not feel the radiance.</li>
            <li> everything Burts Bees is the best for my skin</li>
            <li> I took the time to read many reviews on this product which were good, bad and I decided to try this out. As a health care provider I do my best based on knowledge and experience to limit chemical ingestion into my body.  But this is a waste of your money. One of the top ingredients is alcohol which I don&#x27;t know how I over looked that part but it happens sometimes. If you know any chemistry then you know that alcohol dries the skin. I realized that most of the glowing reviews I read were apparently BEFORE they CHANGED the formula. SAVE your money and use at home all natural products like Coconut oil, Vitamin E, Avocado oil they will work better than this. The absolute best skin care will come from your lifestyle, the foods you eat, avoiding unnecessary sun exposure, water hydration, proper sleep and less stress. If you need more than what natural can provide then that&#x27;s when you spend the money on better quality products or treatments. That&#x27;s my free advice besides not buying this. Hope it helps you.</li>
            <li> Not oily at all, it feels like I&#x27;m putting water on my face but it works like moisturizer, I love it!  And my skin definitely shows improvement.</li>
            <li> Never will order again because of not natural smell.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of skin . Products but this doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or oily.  I am a mature lady and it actually  makes the wrinkles, . Lines less visible, I wear it here in fl with no othermakeup but blush, I get a bottle a month.</li>
