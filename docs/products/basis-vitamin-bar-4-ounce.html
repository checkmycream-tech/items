            <li>Love love love!</li>

            <li>sure what is going on.....seem like this item is being discontinued....</li>
            <li>Great soap, no fragrance, gentle on skin</li>

            <li>Love these soaps.</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful daily cleanser that moisturizes and nourishes your face.</li>
            <li>Love - Love - Love this soap....  </li>
            <li>I have suffered with eczema most of my life.  </li>
            <li>But have not been able to find it again.  </li>
            <li>that is until i remembered my favorite shopping place-- AMAZON.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product that works!</li>
            <li>Having tried the sensitive-skin type before, I ordered a pack of these after seeing that the sensitive-skin type was sold out, and have to say that I prefer these much more.</li>
            <li>This product is a favorite of Sharon, Don&#x27;s spouse.</li>
            <li>My husband and I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I am prone to have more oily skin</li>
            <li>I love this soap for washing my face in the morning.  </li>
            <li>So, I was glad to find it on-line.  </li>
            <li>I love this soap.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see in time if it helps my psoriasis, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not hurting it any.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of the vitamin bar.</li>
            <li>I am 55 and react to many type of additives in soaps.</li>
            <li>The soap lathers up well and has a nice light scent.  </li>
            <li>but I like this product a bit better.  </li>
            <li>However, I buy this soap at a better price from Meijer&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Excellent clean soap for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>have given away the rest of my Basis Vitamin bar to my friends, but I continue to use the regular Basis bar every day and love it!!!</li>
            <li>I never itch after walking out of a hot shower and my skin feels good.</li>
            <li>On top of that, it has a very pleasant, very mild scent that is absent from the sensitive-skin bar and one bar of this seems to last quite a bit longer as well.</li>
            <li>And, it gets you clean!  </li>
            <li>the fragrance isn&#x27;t to strong but does have a nice mild scent to it which makes it pleasing when taking a shower.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin like mine and is non-irritating.  </li>
            <li>I loved it so much I ordered another pack for a friend of mine who had been looking for this product also.  </li>
            <li>but the value is fairly good for what you get (really good-looking skin).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really that good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so very mild and has just the faintest scent.  </li>
            <li>bar of soap around easy.</li>
            <li>(Yes, some soaps are WAY too strong for me.)  </li>
            <li>Hands down the BEST SOAP I have ever found in my 29yrs of life!</li>
            <li>This soap makes the skin feel smooth and can be used as a body bar.  </li>
            <li>I does have a light fragrance</li>
            <li>My dad has a skin condition and I started using it to take care of some light acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years, very fresh (non-axe-body-sprayish) scent, lasts a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This soap is uniquely silky but fully cleansing.</li>
            <li>love the scent, I love the clean feeling without drying and my sensitive skin doesn&#x27;t itch.  </li>
            <li>Basis soaps have such a mild yet pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li>On the up-side, they both lather up very well and rinse very cleanly.</li>
            <li>A perfect inexpensive daily facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>I first used these bars 13 years ago when they were available in drug stores.  </li>
            <li>It has a mild, fresh smell and it moisturizes instead of dries your skin.  </li>
            <li>This soap is great year round.  </li>
            <li>My wife has sensitive skin, and this really was amazing for her, she had no rashes or reactions.</li>
            <li>Love this soap, I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now to help clear up my eczema.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no harsh perfumes or oils, so it&#x27;s appropriate for men, women, and children.</li>
            <li>They sure don&#x27;t seem to be made for sensitive skin to me and I would proceed with caution using them.</li>
            <li>Basis is the best of both worlds for me as far as having a good quality bar and at affordable price whenyou compare it to other high end soaps and some other boutique brands.</li>
            <li>It lathers very well , feels silky on my skin and leaves me feeling really clean.</li>
            <li>I love this bar, it lathers like no other.</li>
            <li>I bought and tried several non familiar brands and eventually came across Basis mostly because of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Great as usual have been using Basis for 45 years and counting.  </li>
            <li>and it does a decent job of balancing it without drying it out while someone else in the house has very dry skin and says it softens his skin better than most moisture bars he has used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m prone to the occasional red bumps here and there, not for a lack of great hygiene either.</li>
            <li>I love this face soap but had difficulty finding it in stock locally.</li>
            <li>And sure enough, there it was.  </li>
            <li>The interesting thing is, we both have different skin types.  </li>
            <li>After using this soap my skin became incredibly oily and broken out.  </li>
            <li>Love this simple soap.  </li>
            <li>I still love the original Basis soap and will continue to use it at my sinks, but the Vitamin Bar is my new shower soap.</li>
            <li>Their OTHER soap is designed for cleaning facial dirt and is also a great product.</li>
            <li>Avene Tolerance Extreme Cream is great stuff and was recommended after my recent face lift by the surgeon.  </li>
            <li>I certainly hope not.</li>
            <li>and I had to stay away from certain bars growing up.</li>
            <li>It leaves your face feeling clean and fresh and doesnt dry it out.</li>
            <li>This soap is gentle, but lathers up and cleans, and it washes off without a lot of effort.  </li>
            <li>After checking around, Walgreens.com has it for $2.30 a bar (ordering 12 bars resulted in free shipping) which is a big savings.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gently cleanses the skin without leaving a film.</li>
            <li>Thanks again to Amazon</li>
            <li>It is only available on the internet.</li>
            <li>She has used basis bars for years and loves its gentle and thorough cleaning with no drying or greasy result.</li>
            <li>I have been using this cleansing bar for years and really like it.  </li>
            <li>I have oily/acne prone skin and this soap cleanses very well.  </li>
            <li>It cleans gently and without fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I use this on my oily, sensitive skin and it rinses off completely, and cleanly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found a soap that was so luxurious but left me feeling as clean as when I use this soap.</li>
            <li>Not only does this type have a cleaner feeling, my skin has never looked better since using this and it has pretty much eliminated the need to use a moisturizer after washing due to the dried-out appearance that you get with so many other types of soap.</li>
            <li>This is the only soap that keeps both of my teenagers skin clear and acne free.  </li>
            <li>This is a gentle soap (I use it as my face soap) and it has a pleasant, but very subtle scent.</li>
            <li>I like the Vitamin bar variant even more than the standard white bar.</li>
            <li>but this product is so mild and has such a soothing effect that I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>When I was in high school someone in my shop class put nails in my deodorant.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommended this product.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time, it lathers well and my skin feels clean afterwards, without all the perfumes and chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I came back to this soap and my skin returned to both clean and clear</li>
            <li>It naturally brightens/tones skin while providing a deep clean.</li>
            <li>This soap is considerably cheaper and is just as gentle, but does the job.</li>
            <li>While the sensitive-skin bar doesnt necessarily leave you with dry skin, this type does a better job of moisturizing from my experience.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended basis soap several years ago because it is very mild and I have used it twice daily on my face since then.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many many many other brands that have left my sensitive skin dull dry and itchy.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin so soft especially during the winter when your skin is more dry.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, I highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li>you have very sensitive skin, try this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This soap Does the face and skin well, especially for sensitive skin like mine!!!!</li>
            <li>All the other reviews are true.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a replacement because basis quit making the all clear bar.</li>
            <li>Clearly a moisturizing bar without being like Dove or Caress.</li>
            <li>I have skin that reacts to nearly everything, and it doesn&#x27;t react to this.  </li>
            <li>It lathers well yet leaves the skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>this caused breakouts and is not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I switched to Dove sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, oily, and I also have rosacea.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes the skin and works well for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Does wonders for my eczema and all together my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft and releaves the dryness.</li>
            <li>One of the only products that seems to really get the smell of chlorine off your skin, without making you smell like a fruit basket...</li>
            <li>It works so well for me and my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have used Tom&#x27;s for Sensitive Skin</li>
            <li>that when I travel, I always pack a bar with me, where as before I would enjoy using the boutique hotel brand bars of soap that I even took a few of them with me home.</li>
            <li>I had been using the Basis Sensitive Skin bar for years and, because the store was out of stock on that item, I tried the vitamin bar</li>
            <li>Originally used &amp;#34;Basis Sensitive Soap&amp;#34; when lack of estrogen caused severe vulva pain that required plain soap.  </li>
            <li>I used to use the white Basis bar in high school.</li>
            <li>(both the bar and liquid) cleanser is the only one I&#x27;ve found that leaves my skin oil free for the entire day, and totally removes the itching, flaky red spots from my skin.</li>
            <li>The big problem for me is, this soap can&#x27;t be purchased anywhere in the New Orleans area.  </li>
            <li>As a result, I can only use this type of soap and anti-perspirants instead of deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the free shipping and saved a few pennies on each bar from the \\&quot;in store cost.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a light skin Hispanic and unlike my mother who is slightly darker, I&#x27;ve always had dry skin problems like my father from my face, arms and every</li>
            <li>Use it for several months and you may also have clear skin.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive facial skin and this soap does not irritate it at all.  </li>
            <li>I have used the Basis regular bar almost every day for the past year after I swim at the Y, and I really love the bar because it seems to help with the chlorine itch and dry skin I have.</li>
            <li>I love using this soap with cold water for a refreshing deep down facial cleanse.  </li>
            <li>No dry soapy residue and no oily feeling either.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and rosacea and this soap doesn&#x27;t dry me out or irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>Does not dry the skin with daily use.</li>

            <li> I love this soap for washing my face in the morning.  </li>
            <li> So, I was glad to find it on-line.  </li>
            <li> I love this soap.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see in time if it helps my psoriasis, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not hurting it any.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of the vitamin bar.</li>
            <li> I am 55 and react to many type of additives in soaps.</li>
            <li> The soap lathers up well and has a nice light scent.  </li>
            <li> but I like this product a bit better.  </li>
            <li> However, I buy this soap at a better price from Meijer&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Excellent clean soap for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> have given away the rest of my Basis Vitamin bar to my friends, but I continue to use the regular Basis bar every day and love it!!!</li>
            <li> I never itch after walking out of a hot shower and my skin feels good.</li>
            <li> On top of that, it has a very pleasant, very mild scent that is absent from the sensitive-skin bar and one bar of this seems to last quite a bit longer as well.</li>
            <li> And, it gets you clean!  </li>
            <li> the fragrance isn&#x27;t to strong but does have a nice mild scent to it which makes it pleasing when taking a shower.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin like mine and is non-irritating.  </li>
            <li> I loved it so much I ordered another pack for a friend of mine who had been looking for this product also.  </li>
            <li> but the value is fairly good for what you get (really good-looking skin).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really that good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so very mild and has just the faintest scent.  </li>
            <li> bar of soap around easy.</li>
            <li> (Yes, some soaps are WAY too strong for me.)  </li>
            <li> Hands down the BEST SOAP I have ever found in my 29yrs of life!</li>
            <li> This soap makes the skin feel smooth and can be used as a body bar.  </li>
            <li> I does have a light fragrance</li>
            <li> My dad has a skin condition and I started using it to take care of some light acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years, very fresh (non-axe-body-sprayish) scent, lasts a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This soap is uniquely silky but fully cleansing.</li>
            <li> love the scent, I love the clean feeling without drying and my sensitive skin doesn&#x27;t itch.  </li>
            <li> Basis soaps have such a mild yet pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> On the up-side, they both lather up very well and rinse very cleanly.</li>
            <li> A perfect inexpensive daily facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I first used these bars 13 years ago when they were available in drug stores.  </li>
            <li> It has a mild, fresh smell and it moisturizes instead of dries your skin.  </li>
            <li> This soap is great year round.  </li>
            <li> My wife has sensitive skin, and this really was amazing for her, she had no rashes or reactions.</li>
            <li> Love this soap, I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now to help clear up my eczema.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no harsh perfumes or oils, so it&#x27;s appropriate for men, women, and children.</li>
            <li> They sure don&#x27;t seem to be made for sensitive skin to me and I would proceed with caution using them.</li>
            <li> Basis is the best of both worlds for me as far as having a good quality bar and at affordable price whenyou compare it to other high end soaps and some other boutique brands.</li>
            <li> It lathers very well , feels silky on my skin and leaves me feeling really clean.</li>
            <li> I love this bar, it lathers like no other.</li>
            <li> I bought and tried several non familiar brands and eventually came across Basis mostly because of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Great as usual have been using Basis for 45 years and counting.  </li>
            <li> and it does a decent job of balancing it without drying it out while someone else in the house has very dry skin and says it softens his skin better than most moisture bars he has used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m prone to the occasional red bumps here and there, not for a lack of great hygiene either.</li>
            <li> I love this face soap but had difficulty finding it in stock locally.</li>
            <li> And sure enough, there it was.  </li>
            <li> The interesting thing is, we both have different skin types.  </li>
            <li> After using this soap my skin became incredibly oily and broken out.  </li>
            <li> Love this simple soap.  </li>
            <li> I still love the original Basis soap and will continue to use it at my sinks, but the Vitamin Bar is my new shower soap.</li>
            <li> Their OTHER soap is designed for cleaning facial dirt and is also a great product.</li>
            <li> Avene Tolerance Extreme Cream is great stuff and was recommended after my recent face lift by the surgeon.  </li>
            <li> I certainly hope not.</li>
            <li> and I had to stay away from certain bars growing up.</li>
            <li> It leaves your face feeling clean and fresh and doesnt dry it out.</li>
            <li> This soap is gentle, but lathers up and cleans, and it washes off without a lot of effort.  </li>
            <li> After checking around, Walgreens.com has it for $2.30 a bar (ordering 12 bars resulted in free shipping) which is a big savings.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gently cleanses the skin without leaving a film.</li>
            <li> Thanks again to Amazon</li>
            <li> It is only available on the internet.</li>
            <li> She has used basis bars for years and loves its gentle and thorough cleaning with no drying or greasy result.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleansing bar for years and really like it.  </li>
            <li> I have oily/acne prone skin and this soap cleanses very well.  </li>
            <li> It cleans gently and without fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I use this on my oily, sensitive skin and it rinses off completely, and cleanly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found a soap that was so luxurious but left me feeling as clean as when I use this soap.</li>
            <li> Not only does this type have a cleaner feeling, my skin has never looked better since using this and it has pretty much eliminated the need to use a moisturizer after washing due to the dried-out appearance that you get with so many other types of soap.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap that keeps both of my teenagers skin clear and acne free.  </li>
            <li> This is a gentle soap (I use it as my face soap) and it has a pleasant, but very subtle scent.</li>
            <li> I like the Vitamin bar variant even more than the standard white bar.</li>
            <li> but this product is so mild and has such a soothing effect that I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> When I was in high school someone in my shop class put nails in my deodorant.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommended this product.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time, it lathers well and my skin feels clean afterwards, without all the perfumes and chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I came back to this soap and my skin returned to both clean and clear</li>
            <li> It naturally brightens/tones skin while providing a deep clean.</li>
            <li> This soap is considerably cheaper and is just as gentle, but does the job.</li>
            <li> While the sensitive-skin bar doesnt necessarily leave you with dry skin, this type does a better job of moisturizing from my experience.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended basis soap several years ago because it is very mild and I have used it twice daily on my face since then.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many many other brands that have left my sensitive skin dull dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin so soft especially during the winter when your skin is more dry.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, I highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> you have very sensitive skin, try this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This soap Does the face and skin well, especially for sensitive skin like mine!!!!</li>
            <li> All the other reviews are true.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a replacement because basis quit making the all clear bar.</li>
            <li> Clearly a moisturizing bar without being like Dove or Caress.</li>
            <li> I have skin that reacts to nearly everything, and it doesn&#x27;t react to this.  </li>
            <li> It lathers well yet leaves the skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> this caused breakouts and is not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I switched to Dove sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, oily, and I also have rosacea.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes the skin and works well for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Does wonders for my eczema and all together my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft and releaves the dryness.</li>
            <li> One of the only products that seems to really get the smell of chlorine off your skin, without making you smell like a fruit basket...</li>
            <li> It works so well for me and my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have used Tom&#x27;s for Sensitive Skin</li>
            <li> that when I travel, I always pack a bar with me, where as before I would enjoy using the boutique hotel brand bars of soap that I even took a few of them with me home.</li>
            <li> I had been using the Basis Sensitive Skin bar for years and, because the store was out of stock on that item, I tried the vitamin bar</li>
            <li> Originally used &amp;#34;Basis Sensitive Soap&amp;#34; when lack of estrogen caused severe vulva pain that required plain soap.  </li>
            <li> I used to use the white Basis bar in high school.</li>
            <li> (both the bar and liquid) cleanser is the only one I&#x27;ve found that leaves my skin oil free for the entire day, and totally removes the itching, flaky red spots from my skin.</li>
            <li> The big problem for me is, this soap can&#x27;t be purchased anywhere in the New Orleans area.  </li>
            <li> As a result, I can only use this type of soap and anti-perspirants instead of deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the free shipping and saved a few pennies on each bar from the \\&quot;in store cost.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a light skin Hispanic and unlike my mother who is slightly darker, I&#x27;ve always had dry skin problems like my father from my face, arms and every</li>
            <li> Use it for several months and you may also have clear skin.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive facial skin and this soap does not irritate it at all.  </li>
            <li> I have used the Basis regular bar almost every day for the past year after I swim at the Y, and I really love the bar because it seems to help with the chlorine itch and dry skin I have.</li>
            <li> I love using this soap with cold water for a refreshing deep down facial cleanse.  </li>
            <li> No dry soapy residue and no oily feeling either.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and rosacea and this soap doesn&#x27;t dry me out or irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> Does not dry the skin with daily use.</li>
            <li> The only other soap we will use is Melaleuca old bars.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, Walmart no longer offers this product and other sellers (including Amazon)</li>
            <li> I use this bath bar due to sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years, and found it really moisturizes my skin, critical both in the summer due to time spent tanning and in chlorinated or salt water, and in the winter when the air is so dry.</li>
            <li> and I have finally found something that suits me without leaving my skin dry and irritated.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin with patches of eczema and psoriasis and spend a LOT of time outdoors in the sun and wind and this soap definitely helps.</li>
            <li> It has eliminated the need to use several other products which is a big plus, not to mention the pain relief!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> little background, since a child, I have had sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for at least 10 years - my whole family loves this soap.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully this product will be around for a long time.</li>
            <li> and she has neither dry nor oily skin.  </li>
            <li> It never leaves my skin dry.</li>
            <li> it does so much better than the other Basis soaps, i was distraught --</li>
            <li> The white bar used to leave my skin a little dry but this one leaves it feel moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It helps with my husband&#x27;s very dry skin from diabetes.  </li>
            <li> my husband had trouble with acne on his back for years.</li>
            <li> So a few years ago I decided to shop else where to find brands I couldn&#x27;t find locally, which lead me to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I ordered some of these Basis Vitamin Bars on the premise they would be less-drying than the Basis Sensitive Skin Bar I had been using for approximately the prior 4-5 days.</li>
            <li> You do have to be a little careful about putting it where water is constantly on it (like the shower) because it does melt away faster than some other soaps.</li>
            <li> After cleansing it leaves skin feeling clean..not tight, oily, or dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to almost every other soap known to man.</li>
            <li> My daughter would not use any other soap and we both have problem skin.</li>
            <li> As of now I cant see myself using any other bar.</li>
            <li> When I travel or go on vacation a worn down bar of this soap travels with me.  </li>
            <li> is to change soaps to one with less perfumes and chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Been using Basis for over a year and a half already, that I have to hide it from family.  </li>
            <li> My skin cannot handle heavy perfume or deoderent ...</li>
            <li> I got 12 bars at once, so I am stocked up on soap for a few months.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I found the Vitamin Bar to be even more-drying than the Sensitive Skin ones.</li>
            <li> I recommend this soap for anyone with acne trouble.</li>
            <li> Through trial and error, I&#x27;ve found this soap works wonders for my pale, furry, prone to breakouts skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little excessive and wasteful.</li>
            <li> Her skin became dry and broken out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what is in these bars</li>
            <li> my skin is a dried-out, broken-out mess and it has never looked worse.</li>
            <li> It is hard on the eyes though, but if you use the bar awhile your eyes get used to it.</li>
            <li> It has become increasingly hard to find.  </li>
            <li> it is hard to find on the shelf in reg stores.</li>
            <li> Its always been uncomfortable experience as I had to heavily rely on moisturizer</li>
            <li> You can do alot worse.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t not leave behind soap residue</li>
            <li> So I wasted my money on 6 bars that got thrown out &#x3D;/  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it a 5-star if they weren&#x27;t as expensive</li>
            <li> yet I have nothing bad to say about H2O and their products except that buying from them is extremely expensive.</li>
            <li> I guess &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> My guests hated it, too.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This soap is wonderful for your face.  I have used it for many years and my skin looks and feels great. I would not use anything else. Hopefully this product will be around for a long time. I am so happy I can still find this product</li>
            <li> I first used these bars 13 years ago when they were available in drug stores.  They smell good and don&#x27;t irritate my skin.  It&#x27;s great to get these online too.</li>
            <li> This soap is great year round.  My skin cannot handle heavy perfume or deoderent ... my skin will itch until I wash it off with something else.  This soap is gentle, but lathers up and cleans, and it washes off without a lot of effort.  The fragrance is light and pleasant, so both me and my husband use it.  The price is affordable too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to almost every other soap known to man. When I was in high school someone in my shop class put nails in my deodorant. This scratched my underarms and caused me to react with an itchy rash to most soaps and deodorants. As a result, I can only use this type of soap and anti-perspirants instead of deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the free shipping and saved a few pennies on each bar from the \\&quot;in store cost.\\&quot; I got 12 bars at once, so I am stocked up on soap for a few months. I consider this to be a GREAT deal!</li>
            <li> I have been using \\&quot;Basis\\&quot; soap for years.  For some reason, the drug store I use to purchase from stopped selling it, which resulted in me not using the soap for about a 2 years.  I took a chance and queried Amazon recently and there it was.  Thank you Amazon for carrying this quality soap.  I can see a difference in my skin already after using it for about 3 weeks.  If you suffer from oily skin, I suggest you try it, you will be amazed over time.</li>
            <li> This is the world&#x27;s best soap. No beef fat (sodium Tallowate) like most soaps! My hair was falling out from shampoo and now I also use this soap as a shampoo and MY HAIR IS GROWING BACK!!! All the other reviews are true.</li>
            <li> Ulta 3 stopped carrying this variety, so I used the ShopSavvy app and found that Amazon carried it.  I&#x27;ve used this for years, very fresh (non-axe-body-sprayish) scent, lasts a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Signed up for Amazon to send me a pack ever 5 or 6 months.  It&#x27;s finally happened--I&#x27;m buying soap online.</li>
            <li> I love this face soap but had difficulty finding it in stock locally. Problem solved now.</li>
            <li> Originally used &amp;#34;Basis Sensitive Soap&amp;#34; when lack of estrogen caused severe vulva pain that required plain soap.  Then Walmart offered &amp;#34;Basis Vitamin Soap&amp;#34; ($1.97 to $2.05) per bar) and I tried it with phenomenal results.  It has eliminated the need to use several other products which is a big plus, not to mention the pain relief!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Walmart no longer offers this product and other sellers (including Amazon) are asking $3 to $4 per bar by the time you add shipping.  After checking around, Walgreens.com has it for $2.30 a bar (ordering 12 bars resulted in free shipping) which is a big savings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what is going on.....seem like this item is being discontinued....I certainly hope not.</li>
            <li> Great soap, no fragrance, gentle on skin</li>
            <li> This is what my dermatologist recommended.  I have skin that reacts to nearly everything, and it doesn&#x27;t react to this.  I like it well enough to buy it online because I can&#x27;t get it locally.</li>
            <li> I love this bar, it lathers like no other. I love the lather it makes, great for shaving, nothing else I have used has come close. Works great at exfoliating without leaving a film or residue. Has a great scent. It is hard on the eyes though, but if you use the bar awhile your eyes get used to it.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this soap.  It lathers well yet leaves the skin feeling soft.  Just what he has wanted to combat chlorine as he swims for exercise!</li>
            <li> Love these soaps. Gently cleanses the skin without leaving a film.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for at least 10 years - my whole family loves this soap.  It has become increasingly hard to find.  Basis used to also make a moisturizing lotion with the same vitamins and scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent, I love the clean feeling without drying and my sensitive skin doesn&#x27;t itch.  I have tried anti-itch soaps that don&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep buying this product so it doesn&#x27;t disappear.</li>
            <li> Great, compares well in value to any glycerin soap available through Amazon.  You can do alot worse.</li>
            <li> but soooooo thrilled I found it on Amazon....and in a 6 pack. It is a wonderful daily cleanser that moisturizes and nourishes your face. No dry soapy residue and no oily feeling either. A perfect inexpensive daily facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> Love - Love - Love this soap....  Leaves my skin so soft especially during the winter when your skin is more dry.</li>
            <li> Best smelling soap ever. I use this on my oily, sensitive skin and it rinses off completely, and cleanly. I can only find this on Amazon, so I buy it in bulk.  I never break out and it doesn&#x27;t burn on any area of my body (Yes, some soaps are WAY too strong for me.)  If you have sensitive skin, I highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> I had been searching for a bar that would be good for my skin. I have suffered with eczema most of my life.  A friend of mine recommended it to me and I have finally found something that suits me without leaving my skin dry and irritated.  I loved it so much I ordered another pack for a friend of mine who had been looking for this product also.  I would highly recommended this product.</li>
            <li> this soap is just what the doctor order. I will order again later I hope with the same satisfaction plus</li>
            <li> I was looking for a replacement because basis quit making the all clear bar. this caused breakouts and is not for sensitive skin. I switched to Dove sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best soaps I&#x27;ve tried. It has a really nice, not overpowering smell, and it leaves my skin nice and clean. It moisturizes nicely and rinses well. I don&#x27;t like how it&#x27;s packaged though; the soap is in a bag, that&#x27;s in a box, that&#x27;s shrink wrapped. It&#x27;s a little excessive and wasteful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years, and found it really moisturizes my skin, critical both in the summer due to time spent tanning and in chlorinated or salt water, and in the winter when the air is so dry.</li>
            <li> Everyone in my house loves this.  I have oily skin and it does a decent job of balancing it without drying it out while someone else in the house has very dry skin and says it softens his skin better than most moisture bars he has used.</li>
            <li> i happened to find one bar of this in a store somewhere in my travels.  But have not been able to find it again.  it does so much better than the other Basis soaps, i was distraught -- that is until i remembered my favorite shopping place-- AMAZON.  And sure enough, there it was.  Thanks again to Amazon</li>
            <li> I was told by my dermatologist 20 years ago that I was allergic to soap and I should use Basis soap.  I have used it ever since.  The Vitamin Bar, however, is the cr&amp;egrave;me of the crop of the Basis soap line.  It has a mild, fresh smell and it moisturizes instead of dries your skin.  The big problem for me is, this soap can&#x27;t be purchased anywhere in the New Orleans area.  It is only available on the internet.</li>
            <li> Love this soap, I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now to help clear up my eczema. It lathers very well , feels silky on my skin and leaves me feeling really clean. I can&#x27;t believe I hadn&#x27;t found it before now because I&#x27;ve tried just about every thing else. This is what I will use from now on, my itching has just about gone away. It lathers well enough that I wash my hair with it.</li>
            <li> Through trial and error, I&#x27;ve found this soap works wonders for my pale, furry, prone to breakouts skin. I&#x27;ll only rate a product after placebo, after cycling on and off it. This is a must have for me! I&#x27;m prone to the occasional red bumps here and there, not for a lack of great hygiene either. I&#x27;ve seen my dermatologist who recommended dial, and anti bacterial but this is much too harsh for my skin. I immediately break out. I came back to this soap and my skin returned to both clean and clear (I do not use on my face or hair though). Lathers great with a poof. Fantastic product that works!</li>
            <li> Having tried the sensitive-skin type before, I ordered a pack of these after seeing that the sensitive-skin type was sold out, and have to say that I prefer these much more. Not only does this type have a cleaner feeling, my skin has never looked better since using this and it has pretty much eliminated the need to use a moisturizer after washing due to the dried-out appearance that you get with so many other types of soap. While the sensitive-skin bar doesnt necessarily leave you with dry skin, this type does a better job of moisturizing from my experience. On top of that, it has a very pleasant, very mild scent that is absent from the sensitive-skin bar and one bar of this seems to last quite a bit longer as well. I&#x27;d give it a 5-star if they weren&#x27;t as expensive but the value is fairly good for what you get (really good-looking skin).</li>
            <li> We use this in the shower every time we take a shower.  It helps with my husband&#x27;s very dry skin from diabetes.  It&#x27;s so very mild and has just the faintest scent.  My husband doesn&#x27;t like fragranced soaps and this is just perfect.  And, it gets you clean!  :-&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> Will definitely  continue to buy this product!!!  This soap Does the face and skin well, especially for sensitive skin like mine!!!!</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful, smooth and creamy and gentle to the skin! I can never find it in the stores but of course Amazon has it!  Most Basis products are excellent and an excellent value.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this soap! I have extremely sensitive skin, oily, and I also have rosacea. This is the only cleanser that I have ever used that doesnt cause me to react to it.&lt;br /&gt;If you have very sensitive skin, try this cleanser. It leaves your face feeling clean and fresh and doesnt dry it out.</li>
            <li> This product is a favorite of Sharon, Don&#x27;s spouse. She has used basis bars for years and loves its gentle and thorough cleaning with no drying or greasy result.</li>
            <li> Terrific soap. Does not dry the skin with daily use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this soap. Moisturizes the skin and works well for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very gentle, smells great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found a soap that was so luxurious but left me feeling as clean as when I use this soap. I still love the original Basis soap and will continue to use it at my sinks, but the Vitamin Bar is my new shower soap. Basis soaps have such a mild yet pleasant aroma. There&#x27;s no harsh perfumes or oils, so it&#x27;s appropriate for men, women, and children.</li>
            <li> I have used the Basis regular bar almost every day for the past year after I swim at the Y, and I really love the bar because it seems to help with the chlorine itch and dry skin I have. So I thought to give this Vitamin bar a try to see how it works. My experience is that this bar doesn&#x27;t work as well as the regular Basis bar, I don&#x27;t know why but I want to share my personal experience for those who try to determine which one to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have given away the rest of my Basis Vitamin bar to my friends, but I continue to use the regular Basis bar every day and love it!!!</li>
            <li> This cleansing bar exceeded my expectations. I have very sensitive skin and I have no problems when I use this bar soap.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this product.  Been using this for years as well as the regular Basis (white) soap.</li>
            <li> Love love love! This is THE ONLY soap that actually does what it says. I&#x27;ve tried many many many other brands that have left my sensitive skin dull dry and itchy. It doesn&#x27;t not leave behind soap residue it&#x27;s hydrating and it&#x27;s a great price for the wonderful results it gives you. Does wonders for my eczema and all together my sensitive skin. Hands down the BEST SOAP I have ever found in my 29yrs of life!</li>
            <li> I bought these and gave 3 to my sister and kept 3 for myself.  Both of us had the same problem with breakouts after using this soap!  The interesting thing is, we both have different skin types.  I am prone to have more oily skin and she has neither dry nor oily skin.  After using this soap my skin became incredibly oily and broken out.  Her skin became dry and broken out.  I&#x27;m not sure what is in these bars but it doesn&#x27;t seem to jive with a lot of skin types from what I can tell.  I threw mine away and got out another to use as hand soap in the bathroom.  My guests hated it, too.  So I wasted my money on 6 bars that got thrown out &#x3D;/  Buy at your own risk I guess &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> Great as usual have been using Basis for 45 years and counting.  Great moisturizers and even better value! Thank you</li>
            <li> This is the only soap that keeps both of my teenagers skin clear and acne free.  Have used Basis Vitamin Bar for years.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleansing bar for years and really like it.  Leaves my skin soft and releaves the dryness.</li>
            <li> I use this bath bar due to sensitive skin.  I try to stock up on them every now and then.  Your prices are very fair and reasonable.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I ordered some of these Basis Vitamin Bars on the premise they would be less-drying than the Basis Sensitive Skin Bar I had been using for approximately the prior 4-5 days. Unfortunately I found the Vitamin Bar to be even more-drying than the Sensitive Skin ones. After 3 days of them I had to discontinue use and return the remainder. Thank goodness for Amazon&#x27;s return policy. Between the two Basis products (used only once AM/once PM) my skin is a dried-out, broken-out mess and it has never looked worse. They sure don&#x27;t seem to be made for sensitive skin to me and I would proceed with caution using them. On the up-side, they both lather up very well and rinse very cleanly.</li>
            <li> This is a gentle soap (I use it as my face soap) and it has a pleasant, but very subtle scent. You do have to be a little careful about putting it where water is constantly on it (like the shower) because it does melt away faster than some other soaps.</li>
            <li> This soap is uniquely silky but fully cleansing. It never leaves my skin dry. The vitamin E must do the trick. bravo, Basis! I&#x27;ve been using this soap for 10 yrs. it is hard to find on the shelf in reg stores. Amazon has the best price!!</li>
            <li> my husband had trouble with acne on his back for years. I switched his soap for this one and he has not had any problem since. I recommend this soap for anyone with acne trouble. Use it for several months and you may also have clear skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very very good soap. I bought the 6 pack and gave a couple each to my wife, mom and sister in law. They all loved it. My wife has sensitive skin, and this really was amazing for her, she had no rashes or reactions. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Perfect for me. I have dry skin with patches of eczema and psoriasis and spend a LOT of time outdoors in the sun and wind and this soap definitely helps.</li>
            <li> I love this soap for washing my face in the morning.  I use a makeup remover at night and wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to replace a makeup remover.  But for washing your face it is perfect.  Great for men and women.  I have very sensitive skin and rosacea and this soap doesn&#x27;t dry me out or irritate my skin.  Lather is great!</li>
            <li> I used to have buy this soap when I was out of town (3 hours away); it&#x27;s not sold in my home-town.  So, I was glad to find it on-line.  I have extremely sensitive facial skin and this soap does not irritate it at all.  Also have rosacea and rosacea acne.  This soap has both calmed my skin and helped heal it.</li>
            <li> One of the only products that seems to really get the smell of chlorine off your skin, without making you smell like a fruit basket... This is a must have for swimmers....</li>
            <li> This soap is awesome! The only other soap we will use is Melaleuca old bars. This soap is considerably cheaper and is just as gentle, but does the job.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  I&#x27;m a psoriasis sufferer and have been told the best thing is to change soaps to one with less perfumes and chemicals.  Basis was recommended so I made the switch.  It lasts a long time, it lathers well and my skin feels clean afterwards, without all the perfumes and chemicals.  We&#x27;ll see in time if it helps my psoriasis, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not hurting it any.</li>
            <li> Excellent clean soap for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended basis soap several years ago because it is very mild and I have used it twice daily on my face since then.  I love the scent of the vitamin bar.</li>
            <li> Love this simple soap.  It works so well for me and my sensitive skin.  I am 55 and react to many type of additives in soaps.</li>
            <li> The soap lathers up well and has a nice light scent.  I have sensitive skin and have used Tom&#x27;s for Sensitive Skin but I like this product a bit better.  Skin just feels softer.</li>
            <li> Clearly a moisturizing bar without being like Dove or Caress. Mild scent and great feel on my skin after use.  Their OTHER soap is designed for cleaning facial dirt and is also a great product.</li>
            <li> Avene Tolerance Extreme Cream is great stuff and was recommended after my recent face lift by the surgeon.  It helped and continues to help the healing process.</li>
            <li> My daughter would not use any other soap and we both have problem skin.</li>
            <li> Been using Basis for over a year and a half already, that I have to hide it from family.  I think I have reviewed this product before about a year ago and I continue to pack this 6 pack about once a month to replenish my stockpile of the soap.&lt;br /&gt;A little background, since a child, I have had sensitive skin. I&#x27;m a light skin Hispanic and unlike my mother who is slightly darker, I&#x27;ve always had dry skin problems like my father from my face, arms and every where else. Its always been uncomfortable experience as I had to heavily rely on moisturizer and I had to stay away from certain bars growing up. So a few years ago I decided to shop else where to find brands I couldn&#x27;t find locally, which lead me to Amazon. I bought and tried several non familiar brands and eventually came across Basis mostly because of the positive reviews. For me, Basis has been a blessing for my skin. the fragrance isn&#x27;t to strong but does have a nice mild scent to it which makes it pleasing when taking a shower. I never feel like I have a lot of residue yet it lathers excellently on my skin. I never itch after walking out of a hot shower and my skin feels good. I use to rely on Men&#x27;s Dove when it hit the market about 4 years ago, give or take but it was still drying out my skin and I always felt a residue on my skin afterwards. not with Basis vitamin bar. As of now I cant see myself using any other bar. Its to the point that when I travel, I always pack a bar with me, where as before I would enjoy using the boutique hotel brand bars of soap that I even took a few of them with me home. The only one besides this soap bar that I still use actually from a hotel (like Neutrogena does for Hilton Hotels) is H2O products when I traveled and stayed a in Florida at the Disneyworld Resorts yet I have nothing bad to say about H2O and their products except that buying from them is extremely expensive. Basis is the best of both worlds for me as far as having a good quality bar and at affordable price whenyou compare it to other high end soaps and some other boutique brands.</li>
            <li> I have oily/acne prone skin and this soap cleanses very well.  It naturally brightens/tones skin while providing a deep clean. After cleansing it leaves skin feeling clean..not tight, oily, or dry.  The scent is nice like citrus or an orange and smells really good.  I love using this soap with cold water for a refreshing deep down facial cleanse.  This soap makes the skin feel smooth and can be used as a body bar.  Great for sensitive skin like mine and is non-irritating.  However, I buy this soap at a better price from Meijer&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a soap and water (on my face) gal.  Very nice product; non-drying, with a light pleasing fragrance.  Can&#x27;t find it anymore at my local big chain pharmacies.  Cleans thoroughly, doesn&#x27;t leave a film.</li>
            <li> I had been using the Basis Sensitive Skin bar for years and, because the store was out of stock on that item, I tried the vitamin bar and I love it.  I does have a light fragrance so mau not be suitable for those with allergies but I react to everything it seems but this product is so mild and has such a soothing effect that I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My wife got me started on this soap years ago.  It cleans gently and without fragrance.  When I travel or go on vacation a worn down bar of this soap travels with me.  It&#x27;s really that good.</li>
            <li> I used to use the white Basis bar in high school. My dad has a skin condition and I started using it to take care of some light acne. It helped then and I hoped it would help now with some acne that had begun to accumulate on my thighs and chest. This product once again worked wonders. I like the Vitamin bar variant even more than the standard white bar. The white bar used to leave my skin a little dry but this one leaves it feel moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best bar of soap around easy.</li>
            <li> My skin at age 50 has become oily, with scaly red patches around my eyes and mouth. I have tried all kinds of cleansers, including Obagi and more expensive physician prescribed programs through dermatologists. Basis (both the bar and liquid) cleanser is the only one I&#x27;ve found that leaves my skin oil free for the entire day, and totally removes the itching, flaky red spots from my skin.</li>
