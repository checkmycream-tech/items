            <li>and I&#x27;ve never had a Conair product that wasn&#x27;t awesome!</li>
            <li>but theyre awesome!</li>
            <li>they are the perfect color and never try to \\&quot;eat\\&quot; my hair!</li>
            <li>This is the best and cheapest way to keep them in stock.</li>
            <li>BRILLIANT!</li>
            <li>These are the best quality I have found yet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a salon owner/hairdresser and these are the best bobby pins I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>and they work perfectly.</li>
            <li>I bought the bobby pins because it was a very good price.</li>
            <li>Great price</li>
            <li>Great.</li>
            <li>With three daughters this was a great investment üòÅ</li>
            <li>THis is amazing!</li>
            <li>Will purchase again if I lose them all :P</li>
            <li>This was a good buy for me as a hair stylist doing up</li>
            <li>didnt think they would work wonderful since theyre cheap.</li>
            <li>they are good quality like you would expect from Conair.</li>
            <li>Good packaging</li>
            <li>and I still have most of the pack!</li>
            <li>And at the end is a nice comfy ball that doesnt hurt.</li>
            <li>They also have rubber around the tips, I assume so that you dont hurt yourself placing them, but they are kind of obnoxious</li>
            <li>pin very easily twists in your hand.</li>
            <li>I wish I had saved the money and put it towards better quality bobby pins.</li>
            <li>These bobby pins are okay, but they don&#x27;t hold too well</li>
            <li>Perfect if you&#x27;re like me and lose bobby pins constantly and are always out.  </li>
            <li>A paper clip would&#x27;ve worked better</li>
            <li>These are pretty good.</li>
            <li>They work well and the coated ends don&#x27;t come off easily.</li>
            <li>While organizing my quilting fabric, I wrap the fabric on bolts and secure the ends with bobby pins.</li>
            <li>However these bobby pins are more of a golden color.</li>
            <li>these bobby pins are cheap and do not stay in your hair all.</li>
            <li>Quantity is fantastic...</li>
            <li>Now I have 500 wire scraps to clean my bong with.</li>
            <li>I wanted a large package of bobby pins to be able to organize all of my fabrics.</li>
            <li>but i decided to settle for the brown ones instead because you get so much for such a great price.</li>
            <li>Easy to open without using your teeth! :)</li>
            <li>Figured if I buy a huge pack, I won&#x27;t run out so fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li>They slide right off.</li>
            <li>Returned them right away.</li>
            <li>If you have long hair, these are handy.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for large Bobby Pins and thought these were the larger kind.</li>
            <li>When they arrived I was very happy, but as soon as I used one it bent  from  the middle and would not go back to the middle.</li>
            <li>These are pricey at local stores, and you don&#x27;t get as many.</li>
            <li>Exactly what it pictures</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I finally bought these.</li>
            <li>Please be more specific in the product info.</li>
            <li>I never thought I would have a problem with Conair bobby pins, seemed like a safe enough bet.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I was SO excited to find SO many bobby pins for such a low price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how to give it 0 stars and this is my real rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks, Conair.</li>
            <li>Very flimsy.</li>
            <li>They are not very strong and often you cant really use them more than once.</li>
            <li>more expensive secure hold</li>
            <li>I always lose my bobby pins, so this 500 pack is really nice! and not too expensive either.</li>
            <li>With five young daughters and myself we go through a lot of bobby pins.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my hair which is thick, I was hoping that I wouldnt have to keeping going to the store to buy more</li>
            <li>Not a tight bobby pin.</li>
            <li>I do have fairly thick hair, but I have had bobby pins that held just fine in the past, and I also have used bobby pins while organizing my quilt fabric that hold fine, too.</li>
            <li>Research other options first.</li>
            <li>o_O</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please bring the old fashioned pins back!!!</li>
            <li>These are barely even one time use.</li>
            <li>Ive boughten NICE expensive brands and they have it pokie.</li>
            <li>I feel as though I have been on an endless search for a large quantity of bobby pins, and I finally found it!</li>
            <li>I wear my very long hair up quite frequently and pins never seem to last around here.</li>

            <li> And, when they came off, they were stretched out...</li>
            <li> cheaply done - very thin, no tension and no hold</li>
            <li> No good for actual pinning, but if this is for an art project or another, probably acceptable, in it&#x27;s own mediocre manner.</li>
            <li> A total waste of money.</li>
            <li> It is a pity that in the&lt;br /&gt;effort to produce big mass of inexpensive, nonfunctional product human&lt;br /&gt;labor and material were wasted.</li>
            <li> I did read the other reviews, and it was about 50/50 on liking them or not.</li>
            <li> The pins are EXTREMELY flimsy, do not hold their shape at all, and get off-center without holding the hair.</li>
            <li> I regularly wear styles where I need Bobby pins, but by the time I got on campus,had to start over with a small stash of the ones I keep in my purse.</li>
            <li> I used them recently to hold my wig in place for my costume (the wig was actually wayy to small for me), and the wig stayed on ALL NIGHT!!</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and not in any way do these pins &amp;#34;blend in&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> quality ruins it.</li>
            <li> but these are really quite useless.</li>
            <li> I was trying to find black ones</li>
            <li> These little gems are the prefect gift for any woman..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> , I use these for updo&#x27;s to pin small portions of hair where the pins will be hidden.</li>
            <li> Apparently the level 5 wizards over at Conair thought it would be neat to make bobby pins that are basically useless bits of wire that may dangle off a few strands of hair all day, but will probably just fall off your head.</li>
            <li> the tips come off of the bobby pins extremely easy which caused the product to be really painful!</li>
            <li> They have very little hold.</li>
            <li> I guess the only bad thing about this product is that it&#x27;s not completely brown.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they are the smaller ones.</li>
            <li> At least my daughter can use them but I am still on the lookout.</li>
            <li> They dont hold in my hair not even in my six yr old hair which is THIN!!!</li>
            <li> Would not recommend especially for someone with smoother hair :(</li>
            <li> NOT good!!</li>
            <li> Just a terrible waste of money, time and effort.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this product and have learned sometimes cheaper is not better.</li>
            <li> This product was awful it pulls out my hair when i take them out</li>
            <li> they were awful</li>
            <li> I bought them and tried them and they are horrible!</li>
            <li> Disappointed!!</li>

            <li> 500 bobby pins for that price is a GREAT deal! plus they dont fall out of my hair at all. And at the end is a nice comfy ball that doesnt hurt. Ive boughten NICE expensive brands and they have it pokie. THis is amazing!</li>
            <li> So many bobby pins!!!!!!!!!!! o_O I was trying to find black ones but i decided to settle for the brown ones instead because you get so much for such a great price. I guess the only bad thing about this product is that it&#x27;s not completely brown. It has a \\&quot;clear\\&quot; tip that is totally noticeable -__-&#x27;</li>
            <li> I actually bought this big package of bobby pins to use for quilt fabric. While organizing my quilting fabric, I wrap the fabric on bolts and secure the ends with bobby pins. I wanted a large package of bobby pins to be able to organize all of my fabrics. These bobby pins don&#x27;t hold at all...when I tried to secure the fabric, the pins slid off sideways, twisted, and fell off. And, when they came off, they were stretched out...after 1 try! I tried it on my hair to see if there was any difference; there wasn&#x27;t, same thing. I do have fairly thick hair, but I have had bobby pins that held just fine in the past, and I also have used bobby pins while organizing my quilt fabric that hold fine, too. I did read the other reviews, and it was about 50/50 on liking them or not. I just thought for the amount I would get, the price, and what I was using them for, I would give them a shot. I wish I had saved the money and put it towards better quality bobby pins. A lesson learned for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to give it 0 stars and this is my real rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very cheaply done - very thin, no tension and no hold whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;The pin very easily twists in your hand. It is a pity that in the&lt;br /&gt;effort to produce big mass of inexpensive, nonfunctional product human&lt;br /&gt;labor and material were wasted. This product should be rejected&lt;br /&gt;by quality control, before being put out on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please bring the old fashioned pins back!!!</li>
            <li> These are pretty good. It&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li> This tub of bobby pins is perfect! For such a low cost. I&#x27;ve had the tub for over two years now, and haven&#x27;t had to buy since!</li>
            <li> I purchased this big pack of bobby pins because I am constantly losing mine! Figured if I buy a huge pack, I won&#x27;t run out so fast. Over a year later and I still have most of the pack! Great price and I&#x27;ve never had a Conair product that wasn&#x27;t awesome! Will purchase again if I lose them all :P</li>
            <li> I bought these for my hair which is thick, I was hoping that I wouldnt have to keeping going to the store to buy more which is why I bought this big PACK! They suck! They dont hold in my hair not even in my six yr old hair which is THIN!!! NOT good!!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no hold with these pins-- the quantity does not justify their lack in quality! Just a terrible waste of money, time and effort. No good for actual pinning, but if this is for an art project or another, probably acceptable, in it&#x27;s own mediocre manner. You&#x27;ve been warned.</li>
            <li> These bobby pins are okay, but they don&#x27;t hold too well, I use these for updo&#x27;s to pin small portions of hair where the pins will be hidden. They also have rubber around the tips, I assume so that you dont hurt yourself placing them, but they are kind of obnoxious, you definately can&#x27;t use them anywhere they will be seen. This was a good buy for me as a hair stylist doing up-do&#x27;s but I had to use them along with more expensive secure hold bobby pins to hold the actual style up.</li>
            <li> These little gems are the prefect gift for any woman.. I bought these for my Daughter and she uses them all the time.</li>
            <li> didnt think they would work wonderful since theyre cheap. but theyre awesome!</li>
            <li> They simply do not work</li>
            <li> I bought the bobby pins because it was a very good price. When they arrived I was very happy, but as soon as I used one it bent  from  the middle and would not go back to the middle. I am very disappointed with this product and have learned sometimes cheaper is not better.</li>
            <li> I was SO excited to find SO many bobby pins for such a low price. They will last me so long. they are good quality like you would expect from Conair.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair, these are handy.  These are pricey at local stores, and you don&#x27;t get as many.</li>
            <li> They do their job as bobby pins. You receive a lot of pins for the price paid. However these bobby pins are more of a golden color. I have dark brown hair and not in any way do these pins &amp;#34;blend in&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> If I could give these zero stars I would. These bobby pins such and have literally no grip even if I use like 6. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> Exactly what it pictures</li>
            <li> I feel as though I have been on an endless search for a large quantity of bobby pins, and I finally found it! (of course, it was on amazon). they are the perfect color and never try to \\&quot;eat\\&quot; my hair!</li>
            <li> these bobby pins are cheap and do not stay in your hair all. even all the hairspray that i used did not hold them in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I finally bought these. I always lose my bobby pins, so this 500 pack is really nice! and not too expensive either. I used them recently to hold my wig in place for my costume (the wig was actually wayy to small for me), and the wig stayed on ALL NIGHT!!</li>
            <li> Quantity is fantastic...quality ruins it. These guys don&#x27;t hold anything. Would not recommend especially for someone with smoother hair :(</li>
            <li> I go through a ton of hair pins with face painting. This is the best and cheapest way to keep them in stock. I got 500 for the price of 50 from a retail store.</li>
            <li> This product was awful it pulls out my hair when i take them out they were awful do not buy this product!</li>
            <li> Giant box of bobby pins.  Perfect if you&#x27;re like me and lose bobby pins constantly and are always out.  Great.</li>
            <li> I was looking for large Bobby Pins and thought these were the larger kind. Unfortunately they are the smaller ones. At least my daughter can use them but I am still on the lookout. I wear my very long hair up quite frequently and pins never seem to last around here. Please be more specific in the product info.</li>
            <li> SUCK SUCK SUCK SUCK SUCK SUCK!!!! They hold nothing! I mistakenly thought all bobby pins were similar....NO, people of Amazon. They are f&amp;*king not! Apparently the level 5 wizards over at Conair thought it would be neat to make bobby pins that are basically useless bits of wire that may dangle off a few strands of hair all day, but will probably just fall off your head. BRILLIANT! Now I have 500 wire scraps to clean my bong with. Thanks, Conair.</li>
            <li> These are barely even one time use. They have very little hold. Research other options first. I never thought I would have a problem with Conair bobby pins, seemed like a safe enough bet.</li>
            <li> the tips come off of the bobby pins extremely easy which caused the product to be really painful!</li>
            <li> With five young daughters and myself we go through a lot of bobby pins. These are the best quality I have found yet. They work well and the coated ends don&#x27;t come off easily. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering these again once we&#x27;ve lost all the others! ;)</li>
            <li> With three daughters this was a great investment üòÅ</li>
            <li> Do not buy these!! I was attracted to them because hey what girl doesn&#x27;t need 500 bobby pins? I bought them and tried them and they are horrible! They have no grip! They slide right off. Returned them right away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a salon owner/hairdresser and these are the best bobby pins I&#x27;ve ever tried. Easy to open without using your teeth! :)</li>
            <li> I have never had a problem with bobby pins staying in my hair. These did not stay in my hair at all. Very flimsy.</li>
            <li> Momma loves these for her hair.</li>
            <li> Not a tight bobby pin. Disappointed!!</li>
            <li> They are not very strong and often you cant really use them more than once.</li>
            <li> A paper clip would&#x27;ve worked better</li>
            <li> I thought I would she some money by buying in bulk but these are really quite useless. The pins are EXTREMELY flimsy, do not hold their shape at all, and get off-center without holding the hair. I regularly wear styles where I need Bobby pins, but by the time I got on campus,had to start over with a small stash of the ones I keep in my purse. A total waste of money. Will not order again.</li>
            <li> Good packaging and they work perfectly.</li>
