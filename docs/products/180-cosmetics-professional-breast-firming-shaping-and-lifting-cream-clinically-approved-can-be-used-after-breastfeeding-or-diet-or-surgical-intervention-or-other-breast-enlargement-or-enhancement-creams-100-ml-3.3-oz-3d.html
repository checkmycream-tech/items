            <li>gave it four stars because the smell is a bit strong and the texture is okay.</li>
            <li>and here is what I&#x27;ve experienced so far</li>
            <li>: My breast are feeling more full-</li>
            <li>so it doesnt go on smoothly</li>
            <li>I use it once a day since I don&#x27;t want to much gain just better shape and fullness.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a good product.</li>
            <li>If I continue to use it for a couple months I&#x27;m sure it will make a major difference.</li>
            <li>I was pretty bummed</li>
            <li>You have to shop for yourself and be willing to take the risk.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I felt like I was putting something on that just made my skin smell funny.</li>
            <li>and I am a consistent user</li>
            <li>and if the product doesnt work for you, its because you aren&#x27;t consistent.</li>
            <li>shaping and has an incredible long lasting smell, it actually does work</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s like I have so much cleavage</li>
            <li>But it really really works.</li>
            <li>I am very please with this product.</li>
            <li>; and I really did not see any change on my breast....</li>
            <li>so I switched back and noticed a significant difference after using it again.</li>
            <li>and I can actually notice the significant improvement.</li>
            <li>I wouldnt recommend this product, aside from being very sticky and not absorbing very quickly</li>
            <li>Its kind of hard to explain.</li>

            <li>You don&#x27;t need much, that&#x27;s for sure, it&#x27;s thick.  </li>
            <li>I started using your product to make myself feel better with very little hope of achieving that goal.</li>
            <li>FINALLY a product that really workes!</li>
            <li>I use the buttock cream on my bust as well as rear and it works much better than this product AND is about half the price!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start by stating that I NEVER write reviews, so the fact that I&#x27;m doing this is a testament to the results I&#x27;ve achieved so far.</li>
            <li>I have been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually gotten an inch and a half bigger plus I&#x27;m perkier and it actually increased my libido :)</li>

            <li> So I wanted to firm them up a little.</li>
            <li> and I did not even get firm at all or lift, nothing happened.</li>
            <li> I have had two boys in the past two years and dropped down two cup sizes.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet, may need to use longer nothing happens overnight.</li>

            <li> when i received it, the box was opened and broken, it seems not to be brand new.~haven&#x27;t used it, hope it work well</li>
            <li> The smell is very weird and not sure why this product is on the market.</li>
            <li> I HATED my breast because since breastfeeding, stretchmarks came as a result of my poor little tissue bags trying to touch my toes.</li>
            <li> : (If you don&#x27;t want the details, skip to the summary)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have had two boys in the past two years and dropped down two cup sizes. I was pretty bummed so I wanted to try something to get them back. I&#x27;ve been using it for close to a month now and I&#x27;ve already gone up a cup size! I love it!! I use it after my hower in the morning every day and I still have enough for probably another month. Will continue to buy it until I get to the size I want. Give it a try...you wont be dissapointed, I know I&#x27;m not!</li>
            <li> i m regularly using but i did not find any difference or saw any difference....but may be it ll take more time</li>
            <li> does not work was not happy package was opened and when reported they wanted me to pay to send items back very bad customer service</li>
            <li> Will not buy this product again i hate creams more likely gars gets under my nails the cream is thick so it doesnt go on smoothly i will be buying breast extract drops.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while and I am VERY pleased with it, I love the sensation and the texture and how my skin feel after using it - more refreshed and energized. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by stating that I NEVER write reviews, so the fact that I&#x27;m doing this is a testament to the results I&#x27;ve achieved so far. I&#x27;ve been using the product for about a month and here is what I&#x27;ve experienced so far: (If you don&#x27;t want the details, skip to the summary)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1: My breast are feeling more full- when I cup them, they feel a bit heavier and it is clear that they are filling out my bras a little better.&lt;br /&gt;Which leads me to&lt;br /&gt;#2: I&#x27;m finding myself staring at my breast a lot more and when I work out I&#x27;m always looking at them in the mirror- they&#x27;re so noticeable now. I wear the same types of clothes and it&#x27;s like I have so much cleavage all of a sudden. (BTW- I was a 36C before breastfeeding almost 10 years ago, then even though I kept wearing 36c&#x27;s I was clearly a 36B due to the lack of fullness) Now, it is the 36C that I&#x27;m filling out again.&lt;br /&gt;#3: Less visible stretchmarks. I HATED my breast because since breastfeeding, stretchmarks came as a result of my poor little tissue bags trying to touch my toes. Now, although the stretchmarks are still there, they are less visible because it seems that I have some lift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to summarize:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One month + fullness+ lift+ vain obsession&#x3D; REORDER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is different, I look forward to month 2 and beyond. I&#x27;m giving 4 stars because I&#x27;m being realistic, not because I have a complaint. You have to shop for yourself and be willing to take the risk. Worst case it just doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> I have been using it since I got it (almost 2 months) have seen no change in anyway.  Will not purchase again</li>
            <li> when i received it, the box was opened and broken, it seems not to be brand new.~haven&#x27;t used it, hope it work well</li>
            <li> I wouldnt recommend this product, aside from being very sticky and not absorbing very quickly it just doesnt work well. I would however advise trying one of the slim extreme products, they have a range from bust scuplting to buttocks shaping and has an incredible long lasting smell, it actually does work I use the buttock cream on my bust as well as rear and it works much better than this product AND is about half the price!!</li>
            <li> It really works! I used it for a month and switched to another brand which I didn&#x27;t like so I switched back and noticed a significant difference after using it again. I literally looked fuller by the next day! The scent is rather unpleasant and the texture is kind of gritty feeling, but it goes away. I use it once a day since I don&#x27;t want to much gain just better shape and fullness. I&#x27;ve definitely noticed improved shape and evened volume. I&#x27;ve actually gotten an inch and a half bigger plus I&#x27;m perkier and it actually increased my libido :)&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars because the smell is a bit strong and the texture is okay. But it really really works.</li>
            <li> I am very please with this product. I am already well endowed (44DD) but I need lifting and firming. This product does not disappoint. My breasts are getting more firm and rounded. and I am starting to notice some lift after only 3 to 4 weeks. I only use it about 2 to 3 times per week because I don&#x27;t want to increase in size. Try it you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> you I bought this like a year a go maybe; and I really did not see any change on my breast....&lt;br /&gt;it still sagging(LOL)....</li>
            <li> FINALLY a product that really workes! one of the best investments I ever made...makes my wife feel great and both her and I can actually notice the significant improvement. Both of us are BIG fans now.</li>
            <li> I put this product on twice a day and I did not even get firm at all or lift, nothing happened. I felt like I was putting something on that just made my skin smell funny. The smell is very weird and not sure why this product is on the market.</li>
            <li> I had a son 5 years ago and the \\&quot;girls\\&quot; just aren&#x27;t as perky as they use to be. :( So I wanted to firm them up a little. Lol. I have been using this product twice a day for 9 days. I have noticed a subtle difference. I know its not a miracle cream. If I continue to use it for a couple months I&#x27;m sure it will make a major difference. The only issue I have with this cream is the texture. Its kind of hard to explain. I guess I was expecting a lotion. Overall, this is a good product. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> On the down side, not sure if I&#x27;ve seen much improvement, but I&#x27;m a double D so it might take some time.  On the up side, I&#x27;ve used less than half the jar. You don&#x27;t need much, that&#x27;s for sure, it&#x27;s thick.  I put on breasts, from underneath, across under armpits, over the top and across my chest.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost two months still no change. But I&#x27;m going keep using it because I paid for it.</li>
            <li> hi&lt;br /&gt;Removed expiration date on the product&lt;br /&gt;How can I be sure of the validity of their use.&lt;br /&gt;thanks ,,</li>
            <li> I have been using for almost a month and it provides some lift once you put it on but after taking a shower ther doesn&#x27;t seem to be any change. Not sure yet, may need to use longer nothing happens overnight.</li>
            <li> I am 51 years old and recently widowed. I started using your product to make myself feel better with very little hope of achieving that goal. I have been pleasantly surprised. It not only lifted my spirits but everything else too! I will definitely continue to buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;A FLGrandma</li>
            <li> Not for older breast but extremely great on my face and neck. Not some minor changes in the past week.</li>
            <li> I give it 5 stars this product works and I am a consistent user and if the product doesnt work for you, its because you aren&#x27;t consistent. Its just wonderful and you actually notice a different.</li>
