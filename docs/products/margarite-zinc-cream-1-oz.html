            <li>/&gt;Just remember to wash your face good if you put a bunch on cause you&#x27;ll smell like zinc if not.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years, and it is very effective for skin problems and a healthy cover up.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>(I love that it&#x27;s tinted so it helps hide the issue!)</li>
            <li>Works better than anything else always!</li>
            <li>My skin has drastically improved since I found this; LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased!</li>
            <li>it is utterly amazing how my skin looks now.  </li>
            <li>This cream is tinted too, which is nice.</li>
            <li>but feels like it dries out existing pimples a bit, and the fleshtone is a nice touch</li>
            <li>nice priduct for skin</li>
            <li>i liked the color in the cream.used as foundation just applied powder plus the benefit of the zink for healing.</li>
            <li>Its goes on almost like a concealer since its kind of think (paste-like).</li>
            <li>Nice looking under make up.</li>
            <li>Seller is good, and the cream is even better.</li>
            <li>It shipped quickly and at a great price.</li>
            <li>this product worked great with my acne, thank you very much!</li>
            <li>Very quick delivery!</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and the color matches pretty nicely.</li>
            <li>I have tried soo many ointments, creams and whatnot over the years and nothing helped.  </li>
            <li>Great for the skin, and it blends fairly well despite its deep color.</li>
            <li>I tried many anti-acne products and none of them worked.</li>
            <li>and once they would I would get more spots.  </li>
            <li>Overall a good buy and a great alternative to b. peroxide which I can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li>So glad I was able to find it here.</li>
            <li>so glad it is now available on Amazon!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be able to go a day without this.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, I use it either once or twice daily as needed.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, &amp; have used it for years.  </li>
            <li>I works for a variety of skin conditions - better (and cheaper) than anything any dermatologist has ever prescribed or recommended.  </li>
            <li>I do see more control of problem areas but</li>
            <li>If I used the sulfur more than 3 times a week, my skin would be fried.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use it more than 3</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t, you probably will have to buy these online and pay more for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Keeps me looking better on my no make up days.</li>
            <li>I love the tint.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more of it.</li>
            <li>Gotta love this stuff as a cover up (coming from a dude</li>
            <li>and I will be buying more once this runs</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will start by saying that this product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>[do not take more than that</li>
            <li>I was very happy to purchase this zinc cream for my occasional acne.</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream about once a week and have noticed that it dries up my pimples better than most products.  </li>
            <li>and I like the fact that it is tinted so it also works as a healthy version of coverup</li>
            <li>This has worked for many and people have praised this</li>
            <li>Ideal for those looking not to only cover but get rid of blemishes.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin, and for masking redness.</li>
            <li>I found blending it with some fragrance free lotion is a good way to keep from drying out the skin too much.</li>
            <li>Way, way too strong for me.</li>
            <li>It dries even the nastiest of them out within a couple of days, can&#x27;t leave without it, but my husband complains about strong zinc smell in the mornings as I put it on before bed time.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even found it works pretty amazing with bug bites.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job of drying out blemishes, and helping to prevent new ones, but I&#x27;d say it works best for healing a scab or lightening pigmentation since it helps the dead skin flake off.</li>
            <li>It works better than the acne medicines I&#x27;ve been prescribed by the dermatologist and much cheaper!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see it making a huge difference</li>
            <li>This great when you want to go without makeup but have things to hide and can treat your skin at the same time.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fabulous if you have problem skin.</li>
            <li>purchased mine for $11.99 with Amazon Prime, so the shipping was free.</li>
            <li>The sulphur &amp; zinc calms the inflammation &amp; the light tint</li>
            <li>It works great with red spots/pimples and hell</li>
            <li>After my second term I found a great dermatologist (Skin PC, in Elkhorn, NE - Chad Hilyer, P.A.) who worked with me on an accutane maintenance cycle where I took one pill per week.</li>
            <li>So far so good, this product fights cystic acne on adults</li>
            <li>If I am going to apply makeup, I&#x27;ve found this product useful to apply first as a kind of cover-up and blemish treatment all in one.  </li>
            <li>This really works, but is very strong.</li>
            <li>Works great on acne and on minor skin abrasions.</li>
            <li>If you have an issue, it&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>So for those of you who are contemplating this, it is worth it!</li>
            <li>love love loveed it second time i use it and easy on the skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m probably using my 10th tube right now!  </li>
            <li>It would be great if they had light, medium, and dark choices..</li>
            <li>Zinc Cream is wonderful for clearing up minor irritations on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Great for covering blemishes without makeup, which usually clogs pores even more.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>It covers any redness from blemishes and clears up bumps before they become full blown pimples.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d say my results are good enough to review now.</li>
            <li>Love the Zinc Cream,  it really does what it advertises</li>
            <li>This is true even of rhodium coated silver jewelry that is supposed to resist tarnishing.</li>
            <li>I would truely recommend this product to anyone that has skin issues.</li>
            <li>Works like magic, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really hope it doesn&#x27;t stop working like most acne products.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and get a rash very easily, but I&#x27;ve had no problems-- not even any discomfort--from this product.  </li>
            <li>( I use Obaji Vitamin C moisturizer, or there is any other Obaji moisturizer will work great for your skin).</li>
            <li>I like that it is tinted - luckily it matches my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>As a cover up, it dries quickly and makes a blemish look like a raisin.</li>
            <li>Wish it did not have the tint, but would still recommend this product as a quick fix.</li>
            <li>I was told many times it was just my hormones returning to normal.</li>
            <li>It has a slight color to hide blemishes which is great if you aren&#x27;t wearing makeup.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very creamy, so it spreads easily on the face.</li>
            <li>Well worth it</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, but this product inspired me to write one for fellow acne sufferers.</li>
            <li>: It can really dry your skin out, so be sure and put on a light moisturizer, let it dry good</li>
            <li>I have tried several other treatments and this one works best for me.</li>
            <li>Also found that it works great to keep skin clear and trouble free.</li>
            <li>It sinks right into my skin and feels much better!</li>
            <li>It really worked, however, I wanted to try and maintain my skin on my own while I still had some of the pills left</li>
            <li>the other hand, if you like to make jewelry, the De La Cruz Pomada de Azufre is a very cheap antiquing solution for silver jewelry!</li>
            <li>It is flesh-colored, so I sometimes use it very lightly just to cover up a specific blemish, if I am not intending to wear makeup that day.  </li>
            <li>Quite literally after the first application I saw results.</li>
            <li>It works the same as always :)</li>
            <li>So be aware of that and take off any silver/sterling silver rings before using any sulfur products with your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>think if you only buy these online, you&#x27;re going to pay a lot more.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The best part of this procedure is that the zinc cream acts as a cover-up but also treats the blemish, as well, helping to dry the pimple out a little bit like a mud mask</li>
            <li>This is a very useful product, if you have any kind of facial lesions, especially acne.  </li>
            <li>It is mild but one of the best creams to help dry up cystic or large canes or even small pimples.</li>
            <li>I found a &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; related product at Whole Foods for a better price with higher Zinc content.  </li>
            <li>Since I am in the medical field, and I know most medications and supplements take some time to really take effect</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too drying as long as you remember to moisturize with an appropriate lotion.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this cream and the instant results it offers!</li>
            <li>I have been off accutane for about two months now and so far so good, but I will really know in a year and a half if it is an alternative to taking an accutane maintenance cycle.</li>
            <li>It really helps me when I get huge breakouts, it calms it down pretty quickly too.</li>
            <li>I use it morning and night after witch hazel toner, and my face is pretty clear!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for blemish treatment!</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s really working?</li>
            <li>I received my product and although it came in fast</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.</li>
            <li>Works fast, and I&#x27;ve never had an issue with it over-drying my skin.</li>
            <li>and it really helps rid a blemish over night and can go under makeup</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear much make up</li>
            <li>But it also has a very calming effect on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>I think this product works very well for problem skin</li>
            <li>I originally found this product in a local surplus store &amp; had been using it for all kinds of skin issues</li>
            <li>If I use it more often than every other day, it dries my skin out.</li>
            <li>I think It&#x27;s better working than other acne creams for my daughter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but I am still looking other alternatives</li>
            <li>It is quite drying though, so I use a green tea cream first, then just a dab on top.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that the product is less drying and just as effective.</li>
            <li>but it is tinted which I didn&#x27;t know and anything that sort of works and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out is fine with me</li>
            <li>so when I heard that there was going to be a new formula I was very nervous.</li>
            <li>The cream is mainly for my Daughter</li>
            <li>Zinc does a far better job of do what other creams claim to.</li>
            <li>It will not help a big cyst/zit that has already gotten to the peak or near-peak of being engorged and inflamed (but in my experience, pretty much NOTHING can help a zit at that stage except Gunilla of Sweden&#x27;s Lerosett mask).</li>
            <li>Light and goes on easy, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I am thankful that I found it on Amazon, because the stores don&#x27;t carry it where I live.</li>
            <li>But continued use of Margarite Zinc Cream over time seems to prevent new cysts/zits from forming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live in a humid, hot, Southern state.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hopefully this helps others, as previous reviews on Amazon always help me out tremendously!</li>
            <li>It will dry up the blemish in 1 day, but if put on healthy skin, it will dry and irritate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it can be successfully watered down by mixing with another lotion or ointment.</li>
            <li>Then I have to rub the makeup very lightly over those spots, so as not to rearrange the zinc cream, but if I do it delicately, it works like a charm.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t clear up any of my acne.</li>
            <li>I also struggle with adult acne, and this has done wonders clearing up my face.</li>
            <li>I use it as a spot treatment since it can be very drying and cause irritation in used too frequently especially without the use of a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>she is 15 years old and uses it for her pimples.</li>
            <li>This is the second tube ordered and it really does seem to be helping my acne.</li>
            <li>Myself, I make sure I have at least two tubes: one in my purse and one in my makeup kit at home.  </li>
            <li>At any rate, if I use the Clearasil Adult Tinted daily/more often than 2-3 x week, it dries my skin a lot</li>
            <li>I use it twice every day and it helps me with oil control (I have very oily skin) and also with my acne flaring back up.</li>
            <li>yea that&#x27;s weird) because it blends it oddly good with my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>As a life long sufferer from acne and oily skin, this cream really works wonders.</li>
            <li>like all creams, hard to say if it works but it definitely makes me feel better.</li>
            <li>All of that having been said, I still think this product works to prevent and reduce new breakouts, even if it can&#x27;t cure/shrink a currently inflamed cyst/zit at it&#x27;s peak</li>
            <li>I wish it was just white or something, but since I only use it before bed it doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li>You can make the tube last a long time if you use a little to start and add more as you need.</li>
            <li>That was also where I first bought Grisi Sulfur and Lanolin soap, a lot cheaper than you&#x27;ll see it here or on other web</li>
            <li>But buying it from a store presumes that you live in a large (and diverse) enough urban or suburban area for drugstores and grocery stores to have a \\&quot;Mexican products\\&quot; section.</li>
            <li>this cream actually helps clear up as well as treating the acne.</li>
            <li>unless it&#x27;s old super-thick pancake makeup, because that&#x27;s about the only thing that might hide the chalky streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I have been on two full terms of accutane in the past 6 (almost 7) years.</li>
            <li>My problem is that, although I have adult cystic acne (so do all my sisters to varying degrees), my skin is also extremely sensitive and generally dry unless I&#x27;m PMSing.</li>
            <li>So this isn&#x27;t a very scientific self-experiment, because I have no blinding (let alone double-blinding), no placebo, and I&#x27;m not controlling for effects of other products by using Margarite Zinc Cream all by itself.</li>
            <li>As a very fair/sensitive skinned individual this is my new go to product if I decide I need a little help.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m told that this product also helps dry out Morgellon&#x27;s lesions, as well, which is no small feat.  </li>
            <li>It is tinted a light pinkish color so might want to put some makeup over it if U are not fair skinned.  </li>
            <li>Not good for a pretty high price product.</li>
            <li>Vitamin B complex (with all B vitamins), The Acne supplement (with Zinc and other vitamins in it), and slow release Pentatonic Acid --- All of this I found on Amazon for a great price.</li>
            <li>I use this product to sooth and clear up shaving rashes and the occasional bumps one might get from wet shaving.</li>

            <li> They coverage isn&#x27;t that great</li>

            <li> great product to use</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Very effective cover up and healing cream for acne.</li>
            <li> My teenagers have discovered how effective this stuff is, and now I have to share it with them!</li>
            <li> Excellent and healthy for the skin without resorting to harmful cortisones.</li>
            <li> , it works, it is good quality, I will buy it again</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> good product..arrived on time</li>
            <li> /&gt;Just remember to wash your face good if you put a bunch on cause you&#x27;ll smell like zinc if not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years, and it is very effective for skin problems and a healthy cover up.  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> (I love that it&#x27;s tinted so it helps hide the issue!)</li>
            <li> Works better than anything else always!</li>
            <li> My skin has drastically improved since I found this; LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased!</li>
            <li> it is utterly amazing how my skin looks now.  </li>
            <li> This cream is tinted too, which is nice.</li>
            <li> but feels like it dries out existing pimples a bit, and the fleshtone is a nice touch</li>
            <li> nice priduct for skin</li>
            <li> i liked the color in the cream.used as foundation just applied powder plus the benefit of the zink for healing.</li>
            <li> Its goes on almost like a concealer since its kind of think (paste-like).</li>
            <li> Nice looking under make up.</li>
            <li> Seller is good, and the cream is even better.</li>
            <li> It shipped quickly and at a great price.</li>
            <li> this product worked great with my acne, thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and the color matches pretty nicely.</li>
            <li> I have tried soo many ointments, creams and whatnot over the years and nothing helped.  </li>
            <li> Great for the skin, and it blends fairly well despite its deep color.</li>
            <li> I tried many anti-acne products and none of them worked.</li>
            <li> and once they would I would get more spots.  </li>
            <li> Overall a good buy and a great alternative to b. peroxide which I can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> So glad I was able to find it here.</li>
            <li> so glad it is now available on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be able to go a day without this.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I use it either once or twice daily as needed.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, &amp; have used it for years.  </li>
            <li> I works for a variety of skin conditions - better (and cheaper) than anything any dermatologist has ever prescribed or recommended.  </li>
            <li> I do see more control of problem areas but</li>
            <li> If I used the sulfur more than 3 times a week, my skin would be fried.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it more than 3</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t, you probably will have to buy these online and pay more for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Keeps me looking better on my no make up days.</li>
            <li> I love the tint.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more of it.</li>
            <li> Gotta love this stuff as a cover up (coming from a dude</li>
            <li> and I will be buying more once this runs</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will start by saying that this product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> [do not take more than that</li>
            <li> I was very happy to purchase this zinc cream for my occasional acne.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream about once a week and have noticed that it dries up my pimples better than most products.  </li>
            <li> and I like the fact that it is tinted so it also works as a healthy version of coverup</li>
            <li> This has worked for many and people have praised this</li>
            <li> Ideal for those looking not to only cover but get rid of blemishes.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin, and for masking redness.</li>
            <li> I found blending it with some fragrance free lotion is a good way to keep from drying out the skin too much.</li>
            <li> Way, way too strong for me.</li>
            <li> It dries even the nastiest of them out within a couple of days, can&#x27;t leave without it, but my husband complains about strong zinc smell in the mornings as I put it on before bed time.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even found it works pretty amazing with bug bites.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job of drying out blemishes, and helping to prevent new ones, but I&#x27;d say it works best for healing a scab or lightening pigmentation since it helps the dead skin flake off.</li>
            <li> It works better than the acne medicines I&#x27;ve been prescribed by the dermatologist and much cheaper!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see it making a huge difference</li>
            <li> This great when you want to go without makeup but have things to hide and can treat your skin at the same time.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fabulous if you have problem skin.</li>
            <li> purchased mine for $11.99 with Amazon Prime, so the shipping was free.</li>
            <li> The sulphur &amp; zinc calms the inflammation &amp; the light tint</li>
            <li> It works great with red spots/pimples and hell</li>
            <li> After my second term I found a great dermatologist (Skin PC, in Elkhorn, NE - Chad Hilyer, P.A.) who worked with me on an accutane maintenance cycle where I took one pill per week.</li>
            <li> So far so good, this product fights cystic acne on adults</li>
            <li> If I am going to apply makeup, I&#x27;ve found this product useful to apply first as a kind of cover-up and blemish treatment all in one.  </li>
            <li> This really works, but is very strong.</li>
            <li> Works great on acne and on minor skin abrasions.</li>
            <li> If you have an issue, it&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> So for those of you who are contemplating this, it is worth it!</li>
            <li> love love loveed it second time i use it and easy on the skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably using my 10th tube right now!  </li>
            <li> It would be great if they had light, medium, and dark choices..</li>
            <li> Zinc Cream is wonderful for clearing up minor irritations on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Great for covering blemishes without makeup, which usually clogs pores even more.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> It covers any redness from blemishes and clears up bumps before they become full blown pimples.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d say my results are good enough to review now.</li>
            <li> Love the Zinc Cream,  it really does what it advertises</li>
            <li> This is true even of rhodium coated silver jewelry that is supposed to resist tarnishing.</li>
            <li> I would truely recommend this product to anyone that has skin issues.</li>
            <li> Works like magic, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really hope it doesn&#x27;t stop working like most acne products.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and get a rash very easily, but I&#x27;ve had no problems-- not even any discomfort--from this product.  </li>
            <li> ( I use Obaji Vitamin C moisturizer, or there is any other Obaji moisturizer will work great for your skin).</li>
            <li> I like that it is tinted - luckily it matches my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> As a cover up, it dries quickly and makes a blemish look like a raisin.</li>
            <li> Wish it did not have the tint, but would still recommend this product as a quick fix.</li>
            <li> I was told many times it was just my hormones returning to normal.</li>
            <li> It has a slight color to hide blemishes which is great if you aren&#x27;t wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very creamy, so it spreads easily on the face.</li>
            <li> Well worth it</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but this product inspired me to write one for fellow acne sufferers.</li>
            <li> : It can really dry your skin out, so be sure and put on a light moisturizer, let it dry good</li>
            <li> I have tried several other treatments and this one works best for me.</li>
            <li> Also found that it works great to keep skin clear and trouble free.</li>
            <li> It sinks right into my skin and feels much better!</li>
            <li> It really worked, however, I wanted to try and maintain my skin on my own while I still had some of the pills left</li>
            <li> the other hand, if you like to make jewelry, the De La Cruz Pomada de Azufre is a very cheap antiquing solution for silver jewelry!</li>
            <li> It is flesh-colored, so I sometimes use it very lightly just to cover up a specific blemish, if I am not intending to wear makeup that day.  </li>
            <li> Quite literally after the first application I saw results.</li>
            <li> It works the same as always :)</li>
            <li> So be aware of that and take off any silver/sterling silver rings before using any sulfur products with your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> think if you only buy these online, you&#x27;re going to pay a lot more.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The best part of this procedure is that the zinc cream acts as a cover-up but also treats the blemish, as well, helping to dry the pimple out a little bit like a mud mask</li>
            <li> This is a very useful product, if you have any kind of facial lesions, especially acne.  </li>
            <li> It is mild but one of the best creams to help dry up cystic or large canes or even small pimples.</li>
            <li> I found a &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; related product at Whole Foods for a better price with higher Zinc content.  </li>
            <li> Since I am in the medical field, and I know most medications and supplements take some time to really take effect</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too drying as long as you remember to moisturize with an appropriate lotion.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this cream and the instant results it offers!</li>
            <li> I have been off accutane for about two months now and so far so good, but I will really know in a year and a half if it is an alternative to taking an accutane maintenance cycle.</li>
            <li> It really helps me when I get huge breakouts, it calms it down pretty quickly too.</li>
            <li> I use it morning and night after witch hazel toner, and my face is pretty clear!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for blemish treatment!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s really working?</li>
            <li> I received my product and although it came in fast</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.</li>
            <li> Works fast, and I&#x27;ve never had an issue with it over-drying my skin.</li>
            <li> and it really helps rid a blemish over night and can go under makeup</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear much make up</li>
            <li> But it also has a very calming effect on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> I think this product works very well for problem skin</li>
            <li> I originally found this product in a local surplus store &amp; had been using it for all kinds of skin issues</li>
            <li> If I use it more often than every other day, it dries my skin out.</li>
            <li> I think It&#x27;s better working than other acne creams for my daughter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but I am still looking other alternatives</li>
            <li> It is quite drying though, so I use a green tea cream first, then just a dab on top.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that the product is less drying and just as effective.</li>
            <li> but it is tinted which I didn&#x27;t know and anything that sort of works and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out is fine with me</li>
            <li> so when I heard that there was going to be a new formula I was very nervous.</li>
            <li> The cream is mainly for my Daughter</li>
            <li> Zinc does a far better job of do what other creams claim to.</li>
            <li> It will not help a big cyst/zit that has already gotten to the peak or near-peak of being engorged and inflamed (but in my experience, pretty much NOTHING can help a zit at that stage except Gunilla of Sweden&#x27;s Lerosett mask).</li>
            <li> Light and goes on easy, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am thankful that I found it on Amazon, because the stores don&#x27;t carry it where I live.</li>
            <li> But continued use of Margarite Zinc Cream over time seems to prevent new cysts/zits from forming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live in a humid, hot, Southern state.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hopefully this helps others, as previous reviews on Amazon always help me out tremendously!</li>
            <li> It will dry up the blemish in 1 day, but if put on healthy skin, it will dry and irritate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it can be successfully watered down by mixing with another lotion or ointment.</li>
            <li> Then I have to rub the makeup very lightly over those spots, so as not to rearrange the zinc cream, but if I do it delicately, it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t clear up any of my acne.</li>
            <li> I also struggle with adult acne, and this has done wonders clearing up my face.</li>
            <li> I use it as a spot treatment since it can be very drying and cause irritation in used too frequently especially without the use of a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> she is 15 years old and uses it for her pimples.</li>
            <li> This is the second tube ordered and it really does seem to be helping my acne.</li>
            <li> Myself, I make sure I have at least two tubes: one in my purse and one in my makeup kit at home.  </li>
            <li> At any rate, if I use the Clearasil Adult Tinted daily/more often than 2-3 x week, it dries my skin a lot</li>
            <li> I use it twice every day and it helps me with oil control (I have very oily skin) and also with my acne flaring back up.</li>
            <li> yea that&#x27;s weird) because it blends it oddly good with my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> As a life long sufferer from acne and oily skin, this cream really works wonders.</li>
            <li> like all creams, hard to say if it works but it definitely makes me feel better.</li>
            <li> All of that having been said, I still think this product works to prevent and reduce new breakouts, even if it can&#x27;t cure/shrink a currently inflamed cyst/zit at it&#x27;s peak</li>
            <li> I wish it was just white or something, but since I only use it before bed it doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> You can make the tube last a long time if you use a little to start and add more as you need.</li>
            <li> That was also where I first bought Grisi Sulfur and Lanolin soap, a lot cheaper than you&#x27;ll see it here or on other web</li>
            <li> But buying it from a store presumes that you live in a large (and diverse) enough urban or suburban area for drugstores and grocery stores to have a \\&quot;Mexican products\\&quot; section.</li>
            <li> this cream actually helps clear up as well as treating the acne.</li>
            <li> unless it&#x27;s old super-thick pancake makeup, because that&#x27;s about the only thing that might hide the chalky streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I have been on two full terms of accutane in the past 6 (almost 7) years.</li>
            <li> My problem is that, although I have adult cystic acne (so do all my sisters to varying degrees), my skin is also extremely sensitive and generally dry unless I&#x27;m PMSing.</li>
            <li> So this isn&#x27;t a very scientific self-experiment, because I have no blinding (let alone double-blinding), no placebo, and I&#x27;m not controlling for effects of other products by using Margarite Zinc Cream all by itself.</li>
            <li> As a very fair/sensitive skinned individual this is my new go to product if I decide I need a little help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m told that this product also helps dry out Morgellon&#x27;s lesions, as well, which is no small feat.  </li>
            <li> It is tinted a light pinkish color so might want to put some makeup over it if U are not fair skinned.  </li>
            <li> Not good for a pretty high price product.</li>
            <li> Vitamin B complex (with all B vitamins), The Acne supplement (with Zinc and other vitamins in it), and slow release Pentatonic Acid --- All of this I found on Amazon for a great price.</li>
            <li> I use this product to sooth and clear up shaving rashes and the occasional bumps one might get from wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I can say this for a fact, I&#x27;m a adult fighting acne and other medicines</li>
            <li> It comes out of the tube creamy, and you can apply it in a very thin layer that dries and bonds pretty well with the skin, so when I apply it as a cover under makeup, I have to let it dry first before applying makeup.</li>
            <li> As for the long term benefits it espouses I cannot comment any further.</li>
            <li> Should last a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thick and does have a smell.  </li>
            <li> It will dry your skin out a tiny bit, but nothing drastic.  </li>
            <li> It does dry out my skin sometimes, and when it does I skip an application and just use my moisturizer only.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s difficult to find a sulfur product that is effective yet not too harsh and drying on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost every topical acne cream, from drugstore brands (they don&#x27;t work and contain cheap, dangerous chemicals) to more expensive brands (some work</li>
            <li> Especially when you consider what you&#x27;ll pay for Liver of Sulfur or for Silver Black in the tiny amounts sold by online jewelry-making supply sellers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always get pimples constantly on my chin due to hormonal imbalance.</li>
            <li> But in searching on the &#x27;net, I found two other places selling it for $6.99 /tube.</li>
            <li> I have been battling adult acne for the past year and spent a lot of money trying numerous creams, etc.</li>
            <li> and you can put moisturizer after, so your skin wont be dry.</li>
            <li> It can dry your skin a bit, but I just used moisturizer during the day.</li>
            <li> But if I have one, it helps to dry it out and works well under a concealer.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t improve or dry out or change anything with my acne.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had a single breakout</li>
            <li> the past I have tried Clearasil Adult Treatment Cream Tinted, which has 8% sulfur and 2% resorcinol.</li>
            <li> I had back acne due to hormone imbalance and this cream worked wonders!</li>
            <li> I have to be careful not to over-do it, however because it does make the skin dry if used too often.  </li>
            <li> , my face was all red like I got windburn, and within a few days it had a sunburned texture and was flaking off.</li>
            <li> Do not wear any neck jewelry if you use the cream for your back, zinc will turn it black!</li>
            <li> Other products were not helping but after only a few applications of this zinc cream, the bumps are dramatically reduced.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;d buy the Margarite Zinc Cream again, but a little seems to go a long way for me, probably because of my sensitive/dry skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use much of it, just a tiny amount only on the bad spots.</li>
            <li> Works for other types of acne as well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for one month now and notice small changes in overall condition to my skin in relation to its revitalizing smoothness as some skin sloughing occurs - which I like.  </li>
            <li> I have tried various sulfur products for acne in the past.</li>
            <li> This product, and every other sulfur product I&#x27;ve used, will tarnish silver jewelry if it is in extended contact with the jewelry.</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with other products sometimes.</li>
            <li> 2: A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Yes, the smell is important, when it smells this bad and you can&#x27;t even use it, it matters.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin and who knows, maybe it will help down the line.</li>
            <li> Just a small dot on your blemish to dry it up.</li>
            <li> The cream&#x27;s color will be too dark for someone with pale skin, but I&#x27;d recommend this cream anyway for use at night.</li>
            <li> This stuff is my little face saver.</li>
            <li> I am unfortunately a 27 year old woman dealing with acne and until this product, I had no control over the redness/bumps.</li>
            <li> I have had a few inflamed bumps on my face for a while.</li>
            <li> Terribly, it smelled a little like sulfur... not very pleasant for getting &amp;#34;up close&amp;#34; but Thank you Margarite for changing the formulation to smell better!</li>
            <li> You also can&#x27;t even use it under plain liquid foundation; it changes the texture of the makeup and makes the make up application streak, which then streaks the Zinc Cream.</li>
            <li> I was anxious to try it</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it works as well.</li>
            <li> Works on small pimples drying them up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it needed resorcinol; 8% of sulfur is plenty by itself.</li>
            <li> usually within the day.</li>
            <li> it made my rosacea worse and flared up my skin and made it very dry, maybe not for me !</li>
            <li> That is literary the only cure for my blind and other annoying spots..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this for acne cause it will not work (at least it did not work for me)</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t (at least I can&#x27;t) put on a stays-on-for-24-hour foundation with this underneath.</li>
            <li> and it was so thick it didn&#x27;t spread and flaked up and fell off my skin.</li>
            <li> It is a thick cream and goes on a bit chalky.</li>
            <li> An Estatishen of mine recommended it to me a few years ago to help with my random pimples I&#x27;d get.</li>
            <li> 3: After doing A LOT of research on accutane alternatives I use this product in combination with Vitamin A (Crude fish oil - 75,000 IU&#x27;s in the am and then 75,000 IU&#x27;s at night - 300,000 is the daily max for humans</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super crazy about the tint since it doesn&#x27;t match my skin tone at all.</li>
            <li> My pimples have dramatically decreased.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with product, it is as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just mad</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible, and now it&#x27;s too late to return it.</li>
            <li> It was very difficult to get the smell out of my pjs..........</li>
            <li> If I knew it smells this bad</li>
            <li> I had some bad spots and areas</li>
            <li> , it is bad for your liver}),</li>
            <li> Grrrr</li>
            <li> Regardless, this cream has rapidly reduced a horrible cystic acne breakout on my chin that has for weeks been getting worse.</li>
            <li> just didn&#x27;t fight the evil cystic acne</li>
            <li> In fact, it got worst.</li>
            <li> I broke out terribly!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. As a life long sufferer from acne and oily skin, this cream really works wonders. Quite literally after the first application I saw results. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now and I haven&#x27;t had a single breakout, my skin isn&#x27;t oily and I don&#x27;t need to use foundation!  I have tried soo many ointments, creams and whatnot over the years and nothing helped.  This cream is tinted too, which is nice. I use it both night and morning but sparingly. It will dry your skin out a tiny bit, but nothing drastic.  I am in love with this cream and the instant results it offers!</li>
            <li> Great for the skin, and it blends fairly well despite its deep color. Heals and conceals. Highly recommended for blemish treatment!</li>
            <li> This provides some temporary cover-up similar to the color of one&#x27;s skin. As for the long term benefits it espouses I cannot comment any further.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s really working? but feels like it dries out existing pimples a bit, and the fleshtone is a nice touch</li>
            <li> On the bright side the color of the cream matches my skin tone! It works great on the skin and didn&#x27;t create any inflammation or rashes.</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery! This great when you want to go without makeup but have things to hide and can treat your skin at the same time. It is tinted and makes you look flawless if a bit too tan. It would be great if they had light, medium, and dark choices..</li>
            <li> I use this cream to cover when Rosacea breakouts occur. The best thing about this cream is that it soothes and heals as it covers. It&#x27;s not too drying as long as you remember to moisturize with an appropriate lotion. It&#x27;s a marvel for those afflicted with Rosacea.</li>
            <li> I received my product and although it came in fast I didn&#x27;t like it at all. I was anxious to try it and when I opened the box the cap immediately fell off and the hole wasn&#x27;t sealed. I tried it anyway and it was so thick it didn&#x27;t spread and flaked up and fell off my skin.</li>
            <li> I tried many anti-acne products and none of them worked. This is the only anti-acne cream that did the job.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with perioral dermatitis for years now and have found nothing that works to heal the itchy red rash until now. I also struggle with adult acne, and this has done wonders clearing up my face. My teenagers have discovered how effective this stuff is, and now I have to share it with them! Great product, and I will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> Not good for a pretty high price product.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything I could find and afford to get rid of my acne.  I had deep sore spots that would appear and would not go away for over a month and once they would I would get more spots.  I started using zinc cream it is utterly amazing how my skin looks now.  I recommend it to EVERYONE battling acne.  I wish I had found it sooner and could have avoided some scarring.  I have had two pimples since I have been using the product (4 months).  It does dry out my skin sometimes, and when it does I skip an application and just use my moisturizer only.  Once again, great product!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years. I&#x27;m not super crazy about the tint since it doesn&#x27;t match my skin tone at all. I wish it was just white or something, but since I only use it before bed it doesn&#x27;t really matter. It does a good job of drying out blemishes, and helping to prevent new ones, but I&#x27;d say it works best for healing a scab or lightening pigmentation since it helps the dead skin flake off. I use it as a spot treatment since it can be very drying and cause irritation in used too frequently especially without the use of a moisturizer. Overall a good buy and a great alternative to b. peroxide which I can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> nice priduct for skin</li>
            <li> this product worked great with my acne, thank you very much! I will definitely purchase it again and let my friends know!</li>
            <li> So far so good, this product fights cystic acne on adults I can say this for a fact, I&#x27;m a adult fighting acne and other medicines just didn&#x27;t fight the evil cystic acne but this stuff does</li>
            <li> Fast shipment. works well for the teen girl</li>
            <li> This product is my go to for acne, rashes, and even skin discoloration issues. A little goes a long way. Works fast, and I&#x27;ve never had an issue with it over-drying my skin. This arrived promptly. So glad I was able to find it here. My only local supplier is somewhat of a pain to drive to.</li>
            <li> what can you say about zinc cream/ It arrived, it works, it is good quality, I will buy it again</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! Even got the in-laws hooked on this stuff. Works great on acne and on minor skin abrasions.</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible, and now it&#x27;s too late to return it. If I knew it smells this bad I&#x27;d never, ever purchase it. It was very difficult to get the smell out of my pjs..........Yes, the smell is important, when it smells this bad and you can&#x27;t even use it, it matters. It doesn&#x27;t even deserve 1 star.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it works as well. It brings out the pimples in your face after using it</li>
            <li> I get the cystic acne, and nothing helps shrink the cysts and acts as a cover up at the same time.  Works for other types of acne as well.  Have been using it for years, so glad it is now available on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I like the drying effect it had but it didn&#x27;t clear up any of my acne. In fact, it got worst.</li>
            <li> It works as described, and I am statisfied with the results. I would recommend this product to others. The end</li>
            <li> I am unfortunately a 27 year old woman dealing with acne and until this product, I had no control over the redness/bumps. I am not allowed to wear makeup at work so the tinted zinc cream is perfect. It covers any redness from blemishes and clears up bumps before they become full blown pimples. I wouldn&#x27;t be able to go a day without this. I also wear it under my makeup on non-work days. I found blending it with some fragrance free lotion is a good way to keep from drying out the skin too much. Love it!</li>
            <li> The cream is mainly for my Daughter she is 15 years old and uses it for her pimples. Works wonders and blends it with her makeup​.</li>
            <li> a friend put me on to this and it really helps rid a blemish over night and can go under makeup</li>
            <li> i liked the color in the cream.used as foundation just applied powder plus the benefit of the zink for healing.</li>
            <li> I use this product to sooth and clear up shaving rashes and the occasional bumps one might get from wet shaving. Also found that it works great to keep skin clear and trouble free. Excellent product, I use it either once or twice daily as needed. It works.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year so when I heard that there was going to be a new formula I was very nervous. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the product is less drying and just as effective. It shipped quickly and at a great price. I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I always get pimples constantly on my chin due to hormonal imbalance. I started taking zinc tablets in addition to using this zinc cream day and night. My pimples have dramatically decreased. Its goes on almost like a concealer since its kind of think (paste-like). I use it as a concealer/cover-up.</li>
            <li> This cream is great  for problem skin. Just a small dot on your blemish to dry it up. I have tried several other treatments and this one works best for me.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for years, even on my face. Terribly, it smelled a little like sulfur... not very pleasant for getting &amp;#34;up close&amp;#34; but Thank you Margarite for changing the formulation to smell better! It works the same as always :)</li>
            <li> Works well with problems on the skin.  I had some bad spots and areas I did not like and this zinc cream works well.  It is tinted a light pinkish color so might want to put some makeup over it if U are not fair skinned.  I bought a second tube and will continue using it.  It can be a tad drying but I only use it on the areas that need the cream.  Good product</li>
            <li> This is the second tube ordered and it really does seem to be helping my acne. I use it every night and sometimes under my make-up.</li>
            <li> this cream actually helps clear up as well as treating the acne. It is definitely a two-in-one cream.</li>
            <li> Since I am in the medical field, and I know most medications and supplements take some time to really take effect, I decided I would try this for 90 days before reviewing. I&#x27;m halfway through my 3rd bottle and I&#x27;d say my results are good enough to review now. I NEVER had acne during puberty. After I had my child at 21 (I&#x27;m 28 now) I broke out terribly! I was told many times it was just my hormones returning to normal.NOPE. I have since been diagnosed with PCOS and this is the only product that has worked at all for me. I&#x27;ve tried everything you can think of. This is wonderful at healing acne scars as well! I still have my pms breakouts, but totally tolerable. Give this a shot!</li>
            <li> This is a creamy skin tone color product with zinc properties. I&#x27;ve used it for one month now and notice small changes in overall condition to my skin in relation to its revitalizing smoothness as some skin sloughing occurs - which I like.  I used it in the T-zone as is the oily zone. I live in a humid, hot, Southern state. Product works for me.</li>
            <li> Zinc cream is wonderful!  Our family uses it for blemishes, irritated skin, and razor burn!</li>
            <li> Excellent product -- combines skin tone coverage with healing zinc.</li>
            <li> I originally found this product in a local surplus store &amp; had been using it for all kinds of skin issues (I love that it&#x27;s tinted so it helps hide the issue!) until my husband somehow lost it!!!! Grrrr I thought it was gone forever so I was soooo happy I found it on Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Zinc Cream is wonderful for clearing up minor irritations on my sensitive skin.  I have recommended this product to others and will definitely order it again in the future.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works on small pimples drying them up. Perfect to cover up some imperfections. Nice looking under make up.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this for acne cause it will not work (at least it did not work for me)</li>
            <li> Love the Zinc Cream,  it really does what it advertises</li>
            <li> I like this cream, it&#x27;s brown color, so when you put it on face, it covered all red spots, acne and etc. and you can put moisturizer after, so your skin wont be dry.</li>
            <li> this zinc oxide is a cosmetic form that allows a degree of cover-up while your skin heals. Excellent for beach</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, &amp; have used it for years.  I works for a variety of skin conditions - better (and cheaper) than anything any dermatologist has ever prescribed or recommended.  I am thankful that I found it on Amazon, because the stores don&#x27;t carry it where I live.</li>
            <li> Very effective cover up and healing cream for acne. Light and goes on easy, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fabulous if you have problem skin. I wish I had discovered it when I was a teenager.  It soothes and heals acne and gets rid of blackheads.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff is my little face saver. I keep a tube at home and in my purse. An Estatishen of mine recommended it to me a few years ago to help with my random pimples I&#x27;d get. So I bought it and have been using it ever since. I don&#x27;t wear much make up, I don&#x27;t like the way it feels on my face, so this stuff is perfect bc it helps cover up the redness while healing it. I even put it on my t zone when I&#x27;m out to help with oil. It sinks right into my skin and feels much better!</li>
            <li> Great blend that it does work as described</li>
            <li> It really helps me when I get huge breakouts, it calms it down pretty quickly too. I wear it to bed though not throughout the day</li>
            <li> Excellent and healthy for the skin without resorting to harmful cortisones.</li>
            <li> Great product! I had back acne due to hormone imbalance and this cream worked wonders! It can dry your skin a bit, but I just used moisturizer during the day. My acne were gone in a week! I also use it as a spot treatment for my face and it works wonders.  Do not wear any neck jewelry if you use the cream for your back, zinc will turn it black!</li>
            <li> Always great to have this on hand!  Works better than anything else always!</li>
            <li> it made my rosacea worse and flared up my skin and made it very dry, maybe not for me !</li>
            <li> This is a very useful product, if you have any kind of facial lesions, especially acne.  It is flesh-colored, so I sometimes use it very lightly just to cover up a specific blemish, if I am not intending to wear makeup that day.  If I am going to apply makeup, I&#x27;ve found this product useful to apply first as a kind of cover-up and blemish treatment all in one.  It comes out of the tube creamy, and you can apply it in a very thin layer that dries and bonds pretty well with the skin, so when I apply it as a cover under makeup, I have to let it dry first before applying makeup. Then I have to rub the makeup very lightly over those spots, so as not to rearrange the zinc cream, but if I do it delicately, it works like a charm. If not, sometimes applying a bit of zinc cream over the makeup can work. The best part of this procedure is that the zinc cream acts as a cover-up but also treats the blemish, as well, helping to dry the pimple out a little bit like a mud mask does, except that you can wear this cream all day or all night. I have very sensitive skin and get a rash very easily, but I&#x27;ve had no problems-- not even any discomfort--from this product.  I&#x27;m told that this product also helps dry out Morgellon&#x27;s lesions, as well, which is no small feat.  Myself, I make sure I have at least two tubes: one in my purse and one in my makeup kit at home.  It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> good product..arrived on time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years, and it is very effective for skin problems and a healthy cover up.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great- looking shirt!&lt;br /&gt;I gave this shirt to my son for a gift.  He loves it!</li>
            <li> like all creams, hard to say if it works but it definitely makes me feel better. I do see more control of problem areas but obviously its no cure to all my cosmetic ailments.</li>
            <li> I found a &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; related product at Whole Foods for a better price with higher Zinc content.  Nothing wrong with product, it is as described.</li>
            <li> I have tried various sulfur products for acne in the past. My problem is that, although I have adult cystic acne (so do all my sisters to varying degrees), my skin is also extremely sensitive and generally dry unless I&#x27;m PMSing. So it&#x27;s difficult to find a sulfur product that is effective yet not too harsh and drying on my skin. This and the odor of sulfur products is the only reason why I use benzoyl peroxide 2.5% on a daily or every-other-day basis. If I used the sulfur more than 3 times a week, my skin would be fried. With some sulfur products, it was fried from one application!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past I have tried Clearasil Adult Treatment Cream Tinted, which has 8% sulfur and 2% resorcinol. I&#x27;m not sure why it needed resorcinol; 8% of sulfur is plenty by itself. At any rate, if I use the Clearasil Adult Tinted daily/more often than 2-3 x week, it dries my skin a lot and I can&#x27;t moisturize enough to keep up with how it dries it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;De La Cruz Pomada de Azufre Sulfur ointment has 10% sulfur and it is the product that fried my skin in one night -- by the next morning, my face was all red like I got windburn, and within a few days it had a sunburned texture and was flaking off. Way, way too strong for me. I&#x27;m not sure if it can be successfully watered down by mixing with another lotion or ointment. I guess that would lower the percentage of sulfur by volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Grisi Sulfur Soap with lanolin helps -- this is a bar soap. If I use it more often than every other day, it dries my skin out. But it also has a very calming effect on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the Margarite Zinc Cream. With only 4% sulfur and 10% zinc, it seems to be skewed in favor of skin protection rather than acne prevention. But maybe that&#x27;s why it seems to help. I can&#x27;t use it more than 3 x week. But it definitely does seem to help. It will not help a big cyst/zit that has already gotten to the peak or near-peak of being engorged and inflamed (but in my experience, pretty much NOTHING can help a zit at that stage except Gunilla of Sweden&#x27;s Lerosett mask). But continued use of Margarite Zinc Cream over time seems to prevent new cysts/zits from forming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again, it could be the Lerosett I&#x27;m using, too. So this isn&#x27;t a very scientific self-experiment, because I have no blinding (let alone double-blinding), no placebo, and I&#x27;m not controlling for effects of other products by using Margarite Zinc Cream all by itself. All of that having been said, I still think this product works to prevent and reduce new breakouts, even if it can&#x27;t cure/shrink a currently inflamed cyst/zit at it&#x27;s peak \\&quot;ripeness\\&quot; or peak engorgement/inflammation, much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased mine for $11.99 with Amazon Prime, so the shipping was free. $11.99 per ounce? that would make it $191.84 per pound! But in searching on the &#x27;net, I found two other places selling it for $6.99 /tube. However, those web sites that sold it for only $6.99 also charged either $4.99 or $4.95 for shipping. So Amazon&#x27;s price without shipping -- which is what I paid as an Amazon Prime member -- was about the same when you do the math.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two caveats:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) the package and the tube of Margarite Zinc Cream say you can wear it under makeup. I wouldn&#x27;t. It is a thick cream and goes on a bit chalky. It dries even chalkier. You can&#x27;t (at least I can&#x27;t) put on a stays-on-for-24-hour foundation with this underneath. You also can&#x27;t even use it under plain liquid foundation; it changes the texture of the makeup and makes the make up application streak, which then streaks the Zinc Cream. So -- no, don&#x27;t wear this under makeup... unless it&#x27;s old super-thick pancake makeup, because that&#x27;s about the only thing that might hide the chalky streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. This product, and every other sulfur product I&#x27;ve used, will tarnish silver jewelry if it is in extended contact with the jewelry. This is true even of rhodium coated silver jewelry that is supposed to resist tarnishing. So be aware of that and take off any silver/sterling silver rings before using any sulfur products with your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, if you like to make jewelry, the De La Cruz Pomada de Azufre is a very cheap antiquing solution for silver jewelry! Especially when you consider what you&#x27;ll pay for Liver of Sulfur or for Silver Black in the tiny amounts sold by online jewelry-making supply sellers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t buy the De La Cruz Pomada de Azufre Sulfur Ointment or Grisi Sulfur and Lanolin bar soap online when I bought it. I got both at a local drugstore (Walgreens), in the Mexican products/Mexican personal hygiene products section. It was like $3.50. I&#x27;ve seen it in local grocery stores that have a Mexican products section. That was also where I first bought Grisi Sulfur and Lanolin soap, a lot cheaper than you&#x27;ll see it here or on other web sites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if you only buy these online, you&#x27;re going to pay a lot more. But buying it from a store presumes that you live in a large (and diverse) enough urban or suburban area for drugstores and grocery stores to have a \\&quot;Mexican products\\&quot; section. If you don&#x27;t, you probably will have to buy these online and pay more for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;d buy the Margarite Zinc Cream again, but a little seems to go a long way for me, probably because of my sensitive/dry skin.</li>
            <li> I think It&#x27;s better working than other acne creams for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Excellent cream to heal &amp; hid your blemishes.  I have used this before &amp; had to order again.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been having issues with my skin. Well not anymore. I would truely recommend this product to anyone that has skin issues.</li>
            <li> That is literary the only cure for my blind and other annoying spots.. It dries even the nastiest of them out within a couple of days, can&#x27;t leave without it, but my husband complains about strong zinc smell in the mornings as I put it on before bed time. The fact that it has concealing properties is beyond great. Ideal for those looking not to only cover but get rid of blemishes.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty amazing. It covers your blemish like a concealer while it dries it out. I am fair skinned and the color matches pretty nicely. I don&#x27;t use much of it, just a tiny amount only on the bad spots. Keeps me looking better on my no make up days. Should last a long time.</li>
            <li> This cream is great! I&#x27;m just mad I didn&#x27;t find it sooner! It&#x27;s very creamy, so it spreads easily on the face. It has a slight color to hide blemishes which is great if you aren&#x27;t wearing makeup. It only has 4% sulfur, so it&#x27;s not too drying. I use it morning and night after witch hazel toner, and my face is pretty clear!! It works better than the acne medicines I&#x27;ve been prescribed by the dermatologist and much cheaper!!</li>
            <li> I use a tiny dot of this when my rosacea flares. The sulphur &amp; zinc calms the inflammation &amp; the light tint helps too. It is quite drying though, so I use a green tea cream first, then just a dab on top.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years...I&#x27;m probably using my 10th tube right now!  I use it as a blemish cream; I pat just a bit on anything I want to hide, and it&#x27;s camouflaged.  BONUS...the zinc dries up the offending blemish....usually within the day.</li>
            <li> I have been battling adult acne for the past year and spent a lot of money trying numerous creams, etc. to no avail.  Thankfully this cream drastically reduced the acne within 24 hours!  I have to be careful not to over-do it, however because it does make the skin dry if used too often.  I like that it is tinted - luckily it matches my skin tone.  Now I apply just a teensy tiny bit in problem areas once a day to keep it under control.  My acne cleared up by 90% within 3 days - it is such a relief!!  If you have an issue, it&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. This can be used over or under moisturizer. I love the tint. Zinc does a far better job of do what other creams claim to. Back yo basics. Will order again!!!</li>
            <li> My skin has drastically improved since I found this; LOVE IT!  They coverage isn&#x27;t that great but it evens things out a smidge.</li>
            <li> Great product, I use it when I have cysts or a break out. But it is tinted which means that it&#x27;s not white cream, it has coloring added to it so it doesn&#x27;t disappear when you rub it in. You need to blend it in to your skin. I mix it with face lotion and rub it evenly.</li>
            <li> This product definitely helps to speed up of the process of clearing acne. It is a tinted cream that acts almost like makeup at the same time. Definitely a great buy. Use with moisturizer though</li>
            <li> Works well. The color helps to cover. I use it in combination with other products sometimes. It isn&#x27;t too drying.</li>
            <li> Great for covering blemishes without makeup, which usually clogs pores even more. This cream is soothing on rashes, hives or irritated skin. Great for sensitive skin, and for masking redness. A tiny bit is all you need. One tube lasts me months. I have been using this for years.</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for years! It is mild but one of the best creams to help dry up cystic or large canes or even small pimples. I like that it also cover them at the same time.</li>
            <li> This cream works wonders for the purpose that I use it.  I will be ordering more of it.</li>
            <li> Gotta love this stuff as a cover up (coming from a dude yea that&#x27;s weird) because it blends it oddly good with my skin tone.  It works great with red spots/pimples and hell I&#x27;ve even found it works pretty amazing with bug bites.  Well worth it and I will be buying more once this runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember to wash your face good if you put a bunch on cause you&#x27;ll smell like zinc if not.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years to curb the acne caused by Rosacea! It&#x27;s been such a blessing! Thank you, Margarite!</li>
            <li> I have been on two full terms of accutane in the past 6 (almost 7) years. After my second term I found a great dermatologist (Skin PC, in Elkhorn, NE - Chad Hilyer, P.A.) who worked with me on an accutane maintenance cycle where I took one pill per week. It really worked, however, I wanted to try and maintain my skin on my own while I still had some of the pills left (in case it didn&#x27;t work) and this cream was one of the products I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will start by saying that this product is fantastic! I use it twice every day and it helps me with oil control (I have very oily skin) and also with my acne flaring back up. I have been off accutane for about two months now and so far so good, but I will really know in a year and a half if it is an alternative to taking an accutane maintenance cycle. So for those of you who are contemplating this, it is worth it! Seller is good, and the cream is even better. I will never order another acne cream again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note 1: It can really dry your skin out, so be sure and put on a light moisturizer, let it dry good and then put the product on. ( I use Obaji Vitamin C moisturizer, or there is any other Obaji moisturizer will work great for your skin). If you don&#x27;t your skin will peal and you will look wrinkly because it is a matt textured cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note 2: A little goes a long way! You can make the tube last a long time if you use a little to start and add more as you need. I use it all over my face and even on my chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note 3: After doing A LOT of research on accutane alternatives I use this product in combination with Vitamin A (Crude fish oil - 75,000 IU&#x27;s in the am and then 75,000 IU&#x27;s at night - 300,000 is the daily max for humans [do not take more than that, it is bad for your liver}), Vitamin B complex (with all B vitamins), The Acne supplement (with Zinc and other vitamins in it), and slow release Pentatonic Acid --- All of this I found on Amazon for a great price. I will be adding Vitamin E toit when I make my next order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this helps others, as previous reviews on Amazon always help me out tremendously! --- Good Luck!</li>
            <li> I was very happy to purchase this zinc cream for my occasional acne. I don&#x27;t see it making a huge difference but it is tinted which I didn&#x27;t know and anything that sort of works and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out is fine with me, then again, it doesn&#x27;t cover that well either! It doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin and who knows, maybe it will help down the line. It&#x27;s a lot of product for the price, so I&#x27;ll keep using this up.</li>
            <li> As a very fair/sensitive skinned individual this is my new go to product if I decide I need a little help. Really like it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t help with reducing pimples for me.  But if I have one, it helps to dry it out and works well under a concealer.</li>
            <li> It stayed on my skin and would not rub in. It did not help my acne.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream about once a week and have noticed that it dries up my pimples better than most products.  I will be adding this to my beauty arsenal.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best!! It clears my skin up almost immediately and can be used in place of makeup since it&#x27;s tinted. Works like magic, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have had a few inflamed bumps on my face for a while. Other products were not helping but after only a few applications of this zinc cream, the bumps are dramatically reduced. I am extremely pleased! I almost did not purchase this product because it is tinted, but the tint actually masks the redness of the bumps while still looking natural.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but I am still looking other alternatives</li>
            <li> I think this product works very well for problem skin and I like the fact that it is tinted so it also works as a healthy version of coverup</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and decided to try. It didn&#x27;t make a difference for me. It didn&#x27;t improve or dry out or change anything with my acne. It&#x27;s like I rubbed lotion on. It does have a tint to it which made me look clown-like so I decided to only wear at night while home. This has worked for many and people have praised this but it just didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but this product inspired me to write one for fellow acne sufferers. I&#x27;ve tried almost every topical acne cream, from drugstore brands (they don&#x27;t work and contain cheap, dangerous chemicals) to more expensive brands (some work but then stop working). The two ingredients, zinc and sulfur, in this product seem relatively harmless and are known to help with acne. I&#x27;ve take zinc in pill form, though, and it hasn&#x27;t helped. Regardless, this cream has rapidly reduced a horrible cystic acne breakout on my chin that has for weeks been getting worse. The color of the cream blends in with my skin and works as a type of concealer. The cream&#x27;s color will be too dark for someone with pale skin, but I&#x27;d recommend this cream anyway for use at night. I really hope it doesn&#x27;t stop working like most acne products. I&#x27;ll keep you updated.</li>
            <li> Perfect for healing while it conceals my blemishes. My teenaged boys use it too!</li>
            <li> It has worked awesome for our daughter&#x27;s acne!</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Thank you! A+</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thick and does have a smell.  As a cover up, it dries quickly and makes a blemish look like a raisin.</li>
            <li> love love loveed it second time i use it and easy on the skin no dryness great product to use</li>
            <li> This really works, but is very strong. Only place on blemish. It will dry up the blemish in 1 day, but if put on healthy skin, it will dry and irritate. Wish it did not have the tint, but would still recommend this product as a quick fix.</li>
