            <li>I gave this product 3 of 5 stars because it&#x27;s a great product but does work as promised.</li>
            <li>Although this is a very beautiful color, and goes on nicely, I was expecting to get the orange-ish color as pictured, instead, it was, in fact, the bluebell 235 (which looks blue/purple).  </li>
            <li>Great for any DIY nail artist or beginner.  </li>
            <li>Great item.</li>

            <li>This looks like a great color</li>
            <li>I am buying more ASAP!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bright bright pink/purple with a gold/green glittery shimmer.</li>
            <li>Not as good by itself</li>
            <li>but it looks good over any color darker than the glitter itself.</li>
            <li>i guess its good</li>
            <li>I have nothing much good to say about this product..</li>
            <li>This nail polish is good quality.</li>
            <li>It is a gorgeous topcoat over good polish.</li>
            <li>It dries fairly quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Color is awesome, and really fun!</li>
            <li>When I got the polish, it looked more purple in the bottle, but it was still beautiful.  </li>

            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>i still love it!</li>

            <li>Awesome, thanks again!</li>
            <li>I love this color!  </li>
            <li>The light plays on the iridescence and it sparkles and shines so beautifully.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Kind of disapointed.</li>
            <li>It is a nice color</li>
            <li>Nice color</li>
            <li>I liked the colors, but the glitter isn&#x27;t dense.</li>
            <li>the price is super duper great as i can&#x27;t find this in my area anywhere...</li>
            <li>ALL of the KLEANCOLOR polishes are beautiful, bright and fast drying :)</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own manicures for years, and I love these products.</li>
            <li>I recently wrote a review on this polish and i wasnt happy at first there must have been an error,but Eye Candy Cosmetics were wonderful and helped me and worked with me, they were amazing</li>
            <li>My granddaughters just love it though.</li>
            <li>it is a top coat with some sparkle to it, not what you see in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Coats, more coats of nail polish than any one needs.</li>
            <li>I put more then one layer on too see if it will resemble but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I was going to return it, but I would have to pay for return shipping, which would be more than the product, so I am just going to throw away.</li>
            <li>I did check the label on the bottle to make sure the correct color was shipped and the label says Chunky Holo Bluebell.</li>
            <li>polish does go on smooth and nice..</li>
            <li>but had to apply many coats to get it to appear somewhat darker.</li>
            <li>i have to say that i absolutely love this polish....</li>
            <li>I would buy more if you get combined shipping.</li>
            <li>but, I love there chunky holo line.</li>
            <li>Love these nail polishes.</li>
            <li>It does take a couple of coats to achieve the look in the picture though, but I still love it.  </li>
            <li>it is more of a top coat than a color to be worn alone.  </li>
            <li>who&#x27;s daughter loves glitter. :)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with this polish, and I love the holographic effect</li>
            <li>The product picture suggests this is more of a rainbow type holographic polish.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s an OK polish for the price I paid.  </li>
            <li>the color is beautiful but even after putting a topcoat it is very sticky and easily smudged.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good SOTT (Essie&#x27;s Shine of the times) dupe</li>
            <li>their products are great and worth it, i will be buying more from them, Thank you Eye Candy Cosmetics for your patience and kindness, and great product i love my two other kleancolor nail polishes i got from you.</li>
            <li>but I would have been more happy with the big chunky pieces</li>
            <li>But this line of polishes are a great top coat, especially for outdoors..</li>
            <li>The company is easy to order from</li>
            <li>It smells so strong.</li>
            <li>Thanks for shipping quickly, but i would have been happy if the nail polish worked as great as it looks in the picture, I put on 4 coats and it only has a shimmer of purple color and some sparkles...  </li>
            <li>Perfect over a dark color.</li>
            <li>its not bad but could be better.</li>
            <li>Still a very pretty color and can be added as a top coat</li>
            <li>The photo used is not at all accurate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wondering if it had those ingredients others say they are free of...(sp) formaldehyde, etc.</li>
            <li>Blue looks great.</li>
            <li>I was cheap I should have known</li>
            <li>I payed $3.99 and free S&amp;H when I purchased this item.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But won&#x27;t return because it was cheap.</li>
            <li>It is a light magenta color not with the blue/green color you see.</li>
            <li>I recommend this for anyone who wants an amazing holo in her collection.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the most gorgeous blue shimmery/semi-glittery color I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>Nice on its own, but even better when used as a topcoat over other colors.</li>
            <li>Really good cover color for pretty much any color you choose to put it on and</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive it.</li>
            <li>It is however pretty in the bottle and maybe if you spend the time to put more than 4 coats on because I have 4 coats and still see no results..</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li>It is very sheer, and will be a nice topcoat, but I was hoping for a more opaque polish.</li>
            <li>by itself it is very sheer but still looks nice, I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really hoping it looks better over polish</li>
            <li>like the cool color in the pic.</li>
            <li>It dries quick.</li>
            <li>Very pretty color.</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>However, it was still very pretty and purpleish.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>This color is so pretty!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got very light pink in it when the light hits it!</li>
            <li>The bottle I got was a bright pink holo glitter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it dries pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>the bottle I received is a bright pink!</li>
            <li>but you would literally have to put on 6-8 coats to see the color right.</li>
            <li>As I have used the black holo polish before, the more coats you apply, the better the effect.</li>
            <li>This polish looks great on top of bright polishes in the &amp;#34;cool colors&amp;#34; (green, blue, purple), and black.</li>
            <li>DRIES FAST, very high gloss, very sparkly!!!</li>
            <li>I was very gentle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That being said, this IS still a pretty neat polish--</li>
            <li>This polish looked so pretty in the picture</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s on top of another solid color.</li>
            <li>but it would be too much hassle!</li>
            <li>The first picture is what I assumed the color was.</li>
            <li>when I notified the seller I did not get the product pictured or described they contacted me with every attempt to satisfy my complaint which I greatly appreciate.</li>
            <li>Pretty but not what I ordered.</li>
            <li>The actual product is ok...</li>
            <li>The actual product is more fuschia.  </li>
            <li>That is a very deceptive picture posted and that is just not the right thing to do.</li>
            <li>And yes it does smell, but lets be honest ALL nail polish smells, it didn&#x27;t smell worst/better than any other nail polish I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I have nothing positive to say about this polish....</li>
            <li>would take the whole bottle to make it that exact color...</li>
            <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this unless you see it in person first and decide that is what you really want.</li>
            <li>It takes 5 or 6 coats to get anywhere near full coverage.</li>
            <li>It also does have a noticeable smell that is rather strong, but not enough to linger after I cap the polish.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t at all it&#x27;s more like a clear top coat polish with very few sprinkles</li>
            <li>it very light with more blue than anything and wheres the green and gold?</li>
            <li>Most of all the nail polishes I have bought from this line are colors that you really do not see much in drug stores.</li>
            <li>None of the chunky holos are really meant to be worn alone.</li>
            <li>so much I will be oder</li>
            <li>It is absolutely nothing like what I ordered.</li>
            <li>they are very pigmented and does not chip allot.</li>
            <li>...bs really</li>
            <li>The seller should really change the product picture, though.</li>
            <li>Although it is not very blue (not anywhere near the color pictured, imagine more of a orange color).  </li>
            <li>I just got this polish the other day the package was very secure Indian</li>
            <li>Color was no where near color in picture and peeled right off</li>
            <li>so you only need a couple coats, and it is well worth the time and the money!</li>
            <li>Peeled off way to easily after it was dry.</li>
            <li>There IS a second picture that more accurately shows the polish, sheer blue with holo glitter.</li>
            <li>The holo flecks in it are nice, but they only really shine with the red-orange-yellow hues, and not much else.</li>
            <li>It looks great in the bottle, but even with 3-4 coats on top of a base color, I didn&#x27;t get a whole lot in the way of color spectrum with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i love to wear it over black.</li>
            <li>When you put it on, it looks like a clear polish with some light blue sparkles.</li>
            <li>I am highly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>a couple other reviewers mentioned, it does have a strong \\&quot;nail salon\\&quot; odor to it.  </li>
            <li>Like looking at sparkling jewels under deep blue water, exotic and wild to wear for a party out on the town.</li>
            <li>not as described, a waste of money unless you plan on using it on top of a color....</li>
            <li>but I can say it&#x27;s a nice color over a dark blue or purple but</li>
            <li>I love the color and KleanColor polishes always last a long time.</li>
            <li>The actual color is a light blue sparkle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a gray-blue with some glitter and very little</li>
            <li>Looking forward into buying more, fast shipping too bad we pay more for shipping than for the polish.....</li>
            <li>; - but only AFTERWARDS I get it, am I made aware that this is a type of polish collection KleanColor</li>
            <li>Not thick and old.</li>
            <li>They were fast and very friendly even when i was being ridiculous.</li>
            <li>Perhaps fine for others, not fine for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clear purplish color with glitter.</li>
            <li>However, on my nails, it&#x27;s just rainbow sparkles in clear polish.</li>
            <li>polish goes on clear, with pinkish-red flecks.  </li>
            <li>Completely bogus.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to know why they are doing the old bait and switch to customers and wasting our time and money.</li>
            <li>I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to look like the picture - I actually google search real pictures of polish on nails before I go and buy it.</li>
            <li>in the unopened bottles, the chunky black holo looks more &amp;#34;chunky&amp;#34;...as in the blue has smaller glitter, as it appears in the bottle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disappointing, though it&#x27;ll probably make for a decent accent for a solid color.</li>
            <li>I took it off the next day because the smell lingered so bad even with a healthy top coat.</li>
            <li>The smell is awful, but most nail polishes don&#x27;t smell good anyway...</li>
            <li>i bought this to go on top of black, brown dark color polishes...to bring out the colors.</li>
            <li>It is a very sheer light blue with little glitter in it.</li>
            <li>At least it was cheap.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a solid coat color, it&#x27;s just clear nail polish with glitter.</li>
            <li>The picture leads you to believe this is a soild covering multi- colored product when it is only clear polish with glitter.</li>
            <li>It is very pastel pink if you do not wear it over another color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not green or gold or blue like it shows.</li>
            <li>to get that effect you&#x27;ll have to use a dark polish first.</li>
            <li>(It looks red, orange, yellow, or green depending on the light).</li>
            <li>Believe when I say this is abnormal, I personally own 300+ NPs and the amount of smell is just absurd.</li>
            <li>They dry time is about normal.</li>
            <li>the holo glitter is small and goes on pretty consistently, and the light blue suspension is subtle, making it all right for most colors as a base.</li>
            <li>Bluebell and the purple color are nearly indistinguishable, but dont buy this expecting a solid blue.</li>
            <li>if you really want the black in the pic, get it from somewhere else.</li>

            <li> who&#x27;s daughter loves glitter. :)</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with this polish, and I love the holographic effect</li>
            <li> The product picture suggests this is more of a rainbow type holographic polish.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s an OK polish for the price I paid.  </li>
            <li> the color is beautiful but even after putting a topcoat it is very sticky and easily smudged.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good SOTT (Essie&#x27;s Shine of the times) dupe</li>
            <li> their products are great and worth it, i will be buying more from them, Thank you Eye Candy Cosmetics for your patience and kindness, and great product i love my two other kleancolor nail polishes i got from you.</li>
            <li> but I would have been more happy with the big chunky pieces</li>
            <li> But this line of polishes are a great top coat, especially for outdoors..</li>
            <li> The company is easy to order from</li>
            <li> It smells so strong.</li>
            <li> Thanks for shipping quickly, but i would have been happy if the nail polish worked as great as it looks in the picture, I put on 4 coats and it only has a shimmer of purple color and some sparkles...  </li>
            <li> Perfect over a dark color.</li>
            <li> its not bad but could be better.</li>
            <li> Still a very pretty color and can be added as a top coat</li>
            <li> The photo used is not at all accurate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if it had those ingredients others say they are free of...(sp) formaldehyde, etc.</li>
            <li> Blue looks great.</li>
            <li> I was cheap I should have known</li>
            <li> I payed $3.99 and free S&amp;H when I purchased this item.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But won&#x27;t return because it was cheap.</li>
            <li> It is a light magenta color not with the blue/green color you see.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for anyone who wants an amazing holo in her collection.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the most gorgeous blue shimmery/semi-glittery color I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Nice on its own, but even better when used as a topcoat over other colors.</li>
            <li> Really good cover color for pretty much any color you choose to put it on and</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive it.</li>
            <li> It is however pretty in the bottle and maybe if you spend the time to put more than 4 coats on because I have 4 coats and still see no results..</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li> It is very sheer, and will be a nice topcoat, but I was hoping for a more opaque polish.</li>
            <li> by itself it is very sheer but still looks nice, I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really hoping it looks better over polish</li>
            <li> like the cool color in the pic.</li>
            <li> It dries quick.</li>
            <li> Very pretty color.</li>
            <li> Very pretty.</li>
            <li> However, it was still very pretty and purpleish.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> This color is so pretty!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got very light pink in it when the light hits it!</li>
            <li> The bottle I got was a bright pink holo glitter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it dries pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> the bottle I received is a bright pink!</li>
            <li> but you would literally have to put on 6-8 coats to see the color right.</li>
            <li> As I have used the black holo polish before, the more coats you apply, the better the effect.</li>
            <li> This polish looks great on top of bright polishes in the &amp;#34;cool colors&amp;#34; (green, blue, purple), and black.</li>
            <li> DRIES FAST, very high gloss, very sparkly!!!</li>
            <li> I was very gentle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That being said, this IS still a pretty neat polish--</li>
            <li> This polish looked so pretty in the picture</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s on top of another solid color.</li>
            <li> but it would be too much hassle!</li>
            <li> The first picture is what I assumed the color was.</li>
            <li> when I notified the seller I did not get the product pictured or described they contacted me with every attempt to satisfy my complaint which I greatly appreciate.</li>
            <li> Pretty but not what I ordered.</li>
            <li> The actual product is ok...</li>
            <li> The actual product is more fuschia.  </li>
            <li> That is a very deceptive picture posted and that is just not the right thing to do.</li>
            <li> And yes it does smell, but lets be honest ALL nail polish smells, it didn&#x27;t smell worst/better than any other nail polish I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I have nothing positive to say about this polish....</li>
            <li> would take the whole bottle to make it that exact color...</li>
            <li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this unless you see it in person first and decide that is what you really want.</li>
            <li> It takes 5 or 6 coats to get anywhere near full coverage.</li>
            <li> It also does have a noticeable smell that is rather strong, but not enough to linger after I cap the polish.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t at all it&#x27;s more like a clear top coat polish with very few sprinkles</li>
            <li> it very light with more blue than anything and wheres the green and gold?</li>
            <li> Most of all the nail polishes I have bought from this line are colors that you really do not see much in drug stores.</li>
            <li> None of the chunky holos are really meant to be worn alone.</li>
            <li> so much I will be oder</li>
            <li> It is absolutely nothing like what I ordered.</li>
            <li> they are very pigmented and does not chip allot.</li>
            <li> ...bs really</li>
            <li> The seller should really change the product picture, though.</li>
            <li> Although it is not very blue (not anywhere near the color pictured, imagine more of a orange color).  </li>
            <li> I just got this polish the other day the package was very secure Indian</li>
            <li> Color was no where near color in picture and peeled right off</li>
            <li> so you only need a couple coats, and it is well worth the time and the money!</li>
            <li> Peeled off way to easily after it was dry.</li>
            <li> There IS a second picture that more accurately shows the polish, sheer blue with holo glitter.</li>
            <li> The holo flecks in it are nice, but they only really shine with the red-orange-yellow hues, and not much else.</li>
            <li> It looks great in the bottle, but even with 3-4 coats on top of a base color, I didn&#x27;t get a whole lot in the way of color spectrum with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i love to wear it over black.</li>
            <li> When you put it on, it looks like a clear polish with some light blue sparkles.</li>
            <li> I am highly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> a couple other reviewers mentioned, it does have a strong \\&quot;nail salon\\&quot; odor to it.  </li>
            <li> Like looking at sparkling jewels under deep blue water, exotic and wild to wear for a party out on the town.</li>
            <li> not as described, a waste of money unless you plan on using it on top of a color....</li>
            <li> but I can say it&#x27;s a nice color over a dark blue or purple but</li>
            <li> I love the color and KleanColor polishes always last a long time.</li>
            <li> The actual color is a light blue sparkle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a gray-blue with some glitter and very little</li>
            <li> Looking forward into buying more, fast shipping too bad we pay more for shipping than for the polish.....</li>
            <li> ; - but only AFTERWARDS I get it, am I made aware that this is a type of polish collection KleanColor</li>
            <li> Not thick and old.</li>
            <li> They were fast and very friendly even when i was being ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Perhaps fine for others, not fine for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clear purplish color with glitter.</li>
            <li> However, on my nails, it&#x27;s just rainbow sparkles in clear polish.</li>
            <li> polish goes on clear, with pinkish-red flecks.  </li>
            <li> Completely bogus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to know why they are doing the old bait and switch to customers and wasting our time and money.</li>
            <li> I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to look like the picture - I actually google search real pictures of polish on nails before I go and buy it.</li>
            <li> in the unopened bottles, the chunky black holo looks more &amp;#34;chunky&amp;#34;...as in the blue has smaller glitter, as it appears in the bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disappointing, though it&#x27;ll probably make for a decent accent for a solid color.</li>
            <li> I took it off the next day because the smell lingered so bad even with a healthy top coat.</li>
            <li> The smell is awful, but most nail polishes don&#x27;t smell good anyway...</li>
            <li> i bought this to go on top of black, brown dark color polishes...to bring out the colors.</li>
            <li> It is a very sheer light blue with little glitter in it.</li>
            <li> At least it was cheap.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a solid coat color, it&#x27;s just clear nail polish with glitter.</li>
            <li> The picture leads you to believe this is a soild covering multi- colored product when it is only clear polish with glitter.</li>
            <li> It is very pastel pink if you do not wear it over another color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not green or gold or blue like it shows.</li>
            <li> to get that effect you&#x27;ll have to use a dark polish first.</li>
            <li> (It looks red, orange, yellow, or green depending on the light).</li>
            <li> Believe when I say this is abnormal, I personally own 300+ NPs and the amount of smell is just absurd.</li>
            <li> They dry time is about normal.</li>
            <li> the holo glitter is small and goes on pretty consistently, and the light blue suspension is subtle, making it all right for most colors as a base.</li>
            <li> Bluebell and the purple color are nearly indistinguishable, but dont buy this expecting a solid blue.</li>
            <li> if you really want the black in the pic, get it from somewhere else.</li>
            <li> I usually have at east something positive to say about a of my polishes</li>
            <li> This item in the picture was not the same as the one i received, also ontop of that the polish was very watery and had very little color</li>
            <li> No polish last long on my hands.</li>
            <li> The only results I got was pink glitter over the blue polish.</li>
            <li> It stays on for a long time without chipping.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this purchase something named blue bell shouldn&#x27;t be a rose color.  </li>
            <li> I can get that at the Dollar General Store down the road.</li>
            <li> It woukd be great for halloween because it looked orange on the black base.</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> I wanted it to come out just like the picture shown and after reading all the reviews I put a dark color of blue underneath.</li>
            <li> What I got was dark red.</li>
            <li> It looks particularly good over a black or very dark base coat, but I also like a subtler look with one or two coats over bare nails.</li>
            <li> This polish is more just a sparkly overcoat, but i still feel like I didn&#x27;t get the same look even when I used a dark blue base.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little different but not way out there.</li>
            <li> This has to be the worst polish i have seen the seller was great</li>
            <li> not really what I thought the picture looked like.</li>
            <li> i like pink but was looking forward to getting the color on picutre</li>
            <li> what came to my house...was pink</li>
            <li> But I really do not like this polish I wont be buying it again</li>
            <li> goopy, not as opaque as expected, also the &amp;#34;holo&amp;#34; title is misleading.</li>
            <li> Not much odor</li>
            <li> (which is 236 Black over a black solid)</li>
            <li> I would please like to get the exact polish if possible and let you know that I was unhappy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have not tried it alone yet or over any other color.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews people had made.</li>
            <li> The product I got was very pink.</li>
            <li> The cap twisted clear off of the brush when I attempted to open it.</li>
            <li> First off unless you use  a dark base color you have to add many coats for it to appear on your nail, and it looks nothing like it does in the picture, I was sad when I received this nail polish.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was smelled stronger than other polishes, but, my husband said it was pretty bad when he came home two hours later.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I might have is that sometimes their bottles can be hard to open.</li>
            <li> but it is NOT worth it.</li>
            <li> thought it would b green but what i got is pink</li>
            <li> I love this even though you need a base coat with it</li>
            <li> I used it with a dark blue/purple (almost black).</li>
            <li> I have previously ordered the black holo polish, and I just ordered another bottle of the chunky black holo and</li>
            <li> sorry maybe advertise, clear nail polish with glitter in it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> just missing balls to mix .</li>
            <li> arrived in a few days.</li>
            <li> Was a waste of money</li>
            <li> I received this polish a few days ago, and can&#x27;t stop admiring it on my nails.</li>
            <li> I am currently waiting for the arrival of some other Holo colors, I hope they don&#x27;t all turn out to be this lame.</li>
            <li> it is not at all what is in the pic u have to use a black or white fake nails or polish..</li>
            <li> When I got this the lid was open and the nail polish was useless.</li>
            <li> im not satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> A small problem with chipping,but I do a lot in the yard and dishes.</li>
            <li> You have to put at LEAST 3 thick coats</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to chip or get too thick.</li>
            <li> and I mean nothing like this picture.</li>
            <li> but this polish absolutely stinks to high heaven of weird chemicals.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, its low quality crap.</li>
            <li> But the smell that smacks you in the face the second you open the bottle is awful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy at all.</li>
            <li> I had no leaks all broken bottle</li>
            <li> I used a black base &amp; it still looked nothing like picture.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed want to send it back</li>
            <li> wrong name&lt;</li>
            <li> it is very thin liquid</li>
            <li> I was expecting glitter and holo suspended in a clear base, but it still looks terrible.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s crazy...</li>
            <li> the smell i am not too crazy about BUT will endure it for the look.</li>
            <li> Crazy, I know, to expect to get what is pictured.</li>
            <li> it stinks.</li>
            <li> buy this if you want a headache from the smell and a disappointing manicure.</li>
            <li> So bad, that went</li>
            <li> so toxic the smell made my daughter sick and didnt look anything like photo</li>
            <li> I was rather disappointed in what I</li>
            <li> I guess when you order this, its a crap shoot.</li>
            <li> I hate KleanColor polish</li>
            <li> for the smell, it is bad!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> very disappointed in this product...</li>
            <li> very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed to get this and find it is nothing</li>
            <li> I am going to assume that my bottle is mislabeled because it is a pink/fushia color which should be called Raspberry something not &amp;#34;Bluebell&amp;#34;  very disappointed learned my lesson with this seller.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the polish.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed!</li>
            <li> No matter what base coat you use with this, just the flakes show up!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> The smell is TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> there is no way you could ever get the look they have pictured here with the crap they send you!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought KleanColor Nail Polish Lacquer Chunky Holo Bluebell while searching for a reasonably-priced holo polish. This polish looks great on top of bright polishes in the &amp;#34;cool colors&amp;#34; (green, blue, purple), and black. The holo flecks in it are nice, but they only really shine with the red-orange-yellow hues, and not much else. It looks great in the bottle, but even with 3-4 coats on top of a base color, I didn&#x27;t get a whole lot in the way of color spectrum with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this IS still a pretty neat polish--the holo glitter is small and goes on pretty consistently, and the light blue suspension is subtle, making it all right for most colors as a base. For the money I paid, the product fits.</li>
            <li> the color is beautiful but even after putting a topcoat it is very sticky and easily smudged. it may be different with another topcoat but it didnt work for me. i love to wear it over black.</li>
            <li> When I got this the lid was open and the nail polish was useless.</li>
            <li> I brought the fingernail polish because I simply wondered what it was going to look like. I figured if I didn&#x27;t like it my granddaughters would . It&#x27;s a little different but not way out there. My granddaughters just love it though.</li>
            <li> Perfect gift for Xmas for teenager</li>
            <li> Why would you buy nail polish? The color! The color of this product is blue/purple. The photo shows orange. Fix the color and all would be well. humm</li>
            <li> the color in the image is not what it is like. would take the whole bottle to make it that exact color...</li>
            <li> I thought it would look the way it does in the bottle, but it does not. It is very sheer, and will be a nice topcoat, but I was hoping for a more opaque polish.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product. I wanted it to come out just like the picture shown and after reading all the reviews I put a dark color of blue underneath. Well even after shaking for ten minutes it did not even come close to the picture. The only results I got was pink glitter over the blue polish. I have not tried it alone yet or over any other color. I bought this for 99 cents so not a big loss and figured I would try it. Now I know and do not plan to ever buy this brand of polish again. Also as I peeled the bottom sticker I saw it was from China and had I known I would not have bought it. Ever since my dog almost died after eating a treat made in China I vowed to never buy from that country ever again. So hence, I threw this product in the trash! My advice? Don&#x27;t buy it!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the smell, it is bad! I&#x27;m wondering if it had those ingredients others say they are free of...(sp) formaldehyde, etc. Scary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we are all spending 99 cents for this product and are all throwing it away...they win. 99 cents is 99 cents out of our pocket.</li>
            <li> Color is awesome, and really fun! Really good cover color for pretty much any color you choose to put it on and the sparkles come out different depending on the color under it</li>
            <li> People are complaining that the polish doesn&#x27;t match the picture... It does, its layered over a blue polish. None of the chunky holos are really meant to be worn alone. There IS a second picture that more accurately shows the polish, sheer blue with holo glitter. Bluebell and the purple color are nearly indistinguishable, but dont buy this expecting a solid blue.</li>
            <li> Perfect over a dark color. Not as good by itself but it looks good over any color darker than the glitter itself. Blue looks great.</li>
            <li> very disappointed in this product...it is a top coat with some sparkle to it, not what you see in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;I will not be buying anything else from kleancolor..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy at all. The polish I received is nothing like what is pictured. I understand that it needs to go over another polish for this effect, but even the color in the bottle is entirely different than what I received. This looks blueish-purple and the bottle I received is a bright pink! Not even close!</li>
            <li> Item came in a bubble wrapped envelope with bubble wtapping around the bottle within the stayed time frame. The pic doesn&#x27;t do this polish justice.  It&#x27;s gorgeous on!</li>
            <li> Coats, more coats of nail polish than any one needs. But it&#x27;s aight</li>
            <li> This nail Polish was a bit pricey. I could&#x27;ve purchased something very similar at Walmart, Walgreens, or beauty supply store. It was a Christmas gift for my daughter. She enjoys painting her nails.</li>
            <li> the nail polish states it is a laquer...maybew not in the us sense...it looks nothing like the pic after applied; very disappointed. sorry maybe advertise, clear nail polish with glitter in it.</li>
            <li> Its not the color it shows in the picture. I was very disappointed! I was cheap I should have known</li>
            <li> No matter what base coat you use with this, just the flakes show up! Not at all as pictured! I hoping I can get a refund soon!</li>
            <li> I was not chucky it was just glitter polish not really what I thought the picture looked like. Kind of disapointed. But I will still use it. It is a nice color but I would have been more happy with the big chunky pieces not just glitter I can get that at the Dollar General Store down the road.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really hoping it looks better over polish</li>
            <li> It is very pastel pink if you do not wear it over another color. I used it with a dark blue/purple (almost black). I didn&#x27;t think it was smelled stronger than other polishes, but, my husband said it was pretty bad when he came home two hours later.</li>
            <li> VERY sheer, must be put over another color. When it is, it is beautiful. NOT a stand alone color.</li>
            <li> Very pretty color. It was not what it seemed in the picture. It looks as tho it would have a metallic color but it was purple. Still a very pretty color and can be added as a top coat</li>
            <li> Like looking at sparkling jewels under deep blue water, exotic and wild to wear for a party out on the town.</li>
            <li> its not bad but could be better. The color is very sheer! in the photo that model has a navy blue under and the holo bluebell over it. so you will always need a solid color under then use the sheer color over it it get an iridescent effect.</li>
            <li> thought it would b green but what i got is pink i guess its good i like pink but was looking forward to getting the color on picutre</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews people had made. And yes it does smell, but lets be honest ALL nail polish smells, it didn&#x27;t smell worst/better than any other nail polish I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely NOT like in the picture. They definitely used a blue basecoat. This polish is more just a sparkly overcoat, but i still feel like I didn&#x27;t get the same look even when I used a dark blue base. I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this unless you see it in person first and decide that is what you really want.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this purchase something named blue bell shouldn&#x27;t be a rose color.  I don&#x27;t plan to buy any further nail polish on line, I think I need to see the colors.</li>
            <li> I love this polish! Nice on its own, but even better when used as a topcoat over other colors. If you&#x27;re considering getting this color, DO IT! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> im not satisfied with this product, what i got looks nothing like it does in the picture. It&#x27;s not green or gold or blue like it shows. It&#x27;s a clear purplish color with glitter. I put more then one layer on too see if it will resemble but it doesn&#x27;t. I would please like to get the exact polish if possible and let you know that I was unhappy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is nothing like the pictures shown. When you put it on, it looks like a clear polish with some light blue sparkles. You could get it at the 99 cent store. I was going to return it, but I would have to pay for return shipping, which would be more than the product, so I am just going to throw away. Note: I did check the label on the bottle to make sure the correct color was shipped and the label says Chunky Holo Bluebell. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> picture shows..bottle  purple&lt;br /&gt;the nails are are blue to me&lt;br /&gt;and what came to my house...was pink&lt;br /&gt;the name.. holo bluebell....wrong name&lt;br /&gt;nail polish does go on smooth and nice..though</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed to get this and find it is nothing and I mean nothing like this picture. It is a very sheer light blue with little glitter in it. That is a very deceptive picture posted and that is just not the right thing to do. Completely bogus. I am currently waiting for the arrival of some other Holo colors, I hope they don&#x27;t all turn out to be this lame.</li>
            <li> thank you! love it! just missing balls to mix . had to buy balls to add to polish bottel</li>
            <li> This has to be the worst polish i have seen the seller was great i would recommend but the polish is Aweful  so toxic the smell made my daughter sick and didnt look anything like photo i cant recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> This polish looked so pretty in the picture I was so excited to receive it. we I have nothing much good to say about this product.. First off unless you use  a dark base color you have to add many coats for it to appear on your nail, and it looks nothing like it does in the picture, I was sad when I received this nail polish. it is very thin liquid and I was actually saddened because I like Kleancolors polishes. But I really do not like this polish I wont be buying it again I usually have at east something positive to say about a of my polishes but I have nothing positive to say about this polish....It is however pretty in the bottle and maybe if you spend the time to put more than 4 coats on because I have 4 coats and still see no results..</li>
            <li> I thought that the color was going to come out like shown on the picture and it didn&#x27;t at all it&#x27;s more like a clear top coat polish with very few sprinkles maybe I do not know how to apply it</li>
            <li> it is not at all what is in the pic u have to use a black or white fake nails or polish..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good and it&#x27;s transparent!</li>
            <li> The picture used to represent this color is not at all close to what was received.  I am going to assume that my bottle is mislabeled because it is a pink/fushia color which should be called Raspberry something not &amp;#34;Bluebell&amp;#34;  very disappointed learned my lesson with this seller.</li>
            <li> I love this even though you need a base coat with it i still love it! i&#x27;ll buy more when i run out!</li>
            <li> Nice color but had to apply many coats to get it to appear somewhat darker. Peeled off way to easily after it was dry. Did not last at all!!</li>
            <li> Did work like it was suppose to put on a royal blue polish but didn&#x27;t look like what picture does won&#x27;t but again looks are decieving</li>
            <li> Thanks for shipping quickly, but i would have been happy if the nail polish worked as great as it looks in the picture, I put on 4 coats and it only has a shimmer of purple color and some sparkles...  not as described, a waste of money unless you plan on using it on top of a color....</li>
            <li> I just got this polish the other day the package was very secure Indian I had no leaks all broken bottle and I luv this color so much I will be oder this polish again</li>
            <li> I was expecting a solid coat color, it&#x27;s just clear nail polish with glitter. to get that effect you&#x27;ll have to use a dark polish first. arrived in a few days.</li>
            <li> Color not as described ! After writing to the seller, he did offer to take it back and reimburse me.</li>
            <li> Looks nothing like picture. I used a black base &amp; it still looked nothing like picture. It woukd be great for halloween because it looked orange on the black base. I won&#x27;t buy KleanColor nail polish again</li>
            <li> Definitely not like the picture! You have to put at LEAST 3 thick coats and that&#x27;s on top of another solid color. Takes a long time to dry. Also has a funky smell. If I knew it couldn&#x27;t be used as is, wouldn&#x27;t have bothered. Very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> When I got the polish, it looked more purple in the bottle, but it was still beautiful.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good SOTT (Essie&#x27;s Shine of the times) dupe but it is NOT worth it. Sure, it&#x27;s pretty but this polish absolutely stinks to high heaven of weird chemicals. I took it off the next day because the smell lingered so bad even with a healthy top coat. Believe when I say this is abnormal, I personally own 300+ NPs and the amount of smell is just absurd. Don&#x27;t waste your money, its low quality crap.</li>
            <li> Just got this today in the mail, the color looks NOTHING like the bottle shown. It&#x27;s a bright bright pink/purple with a gold/green glittery shimmer. Perhaps fine for others, not fine for me. I won&#x27;t wear it. At least it was cheap.</li>
            <li> i have to say that i absolutely love this polish....it&#x27;s so holographic it&#x27;s crazy...the smell i am not too crazy about BUT will endure it for the look. the price is super duper great as i can&#x27;t find this in my area anywhere...i bought this to go on top of black, brown dark color polishes...to bring out the colors.</li>
            <li> This polish is definitely a topcoat. It takes 5 or 6 coats to get anywhere near full coverage. The smell is TERRIBLE. They dry time is about normal. I gave this product 3 of 5 stars because it&#x27;s a great product but does work as promised. I would buy this product again. I would recommend this product to others. I payed $3.99 and free S&amp;H when I purchased this item.</li>
            <li> The picture leads you to believe this is a soild covering multi- colored product when it is only clear polish with glitter. You will only get the pic effect if you use several others colors of undercoat.</li>
            <li> This color is so pretty! I wish I could get it to look like the pic, but I have no idea how, but it&#x27;s the most gorgeous blue shimmery/semi-glittery color I&#x27;ve ever used! It&#x27;s got very light pink in it when the light hits it! Love it! Best when used over another color!</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own manicures for years, and I love these products. This is an extremely beautiful color! It covers well so you only need a couple coats, and it is well worth the time and the money!</li>
            <li> Very pretty. Goes on well.</li>
            <li> What you see is not what you&#x27;re going to get. It comes out to be some type of blue color what you think your ordering is orange! Very disappointed want to send it back but it would be too much hassle! I know next time</li>
            <li> I have previously ordered the black holo polish, and I just ordered another bottle of the chunky black holo and the bluebell holo- in the unopened bottles, the chunky black holo looks more &amp;#34;chunky&amp;#34;...as in the blue has smaller glitter, as it appears in the bottle. As I have used the black holo polish before, the more coats you apply, the better the effect. It doesn&#x27;t seem to chip or get too thick. The smell is awful, but most nail polishes don&#x27;t smell good anyway... But this line of polishes are a great top coat, especially for outdoors..</li>
            <li> goopy, not as opaque as expected, also the &amp;#34;holo&amp;#34; title is misleading. I liked the colors, but the glitter isn&#x27;t dense.</li>
            <li> The first picture is what I assumed the color was. Crazy, I know, to expect to get what is pictured. The actual color is a light blue sparkle. It is absolutely nothing like what I ordered. I will never buy from this company again, and I buy a LOT of nail polish. I&#x27;d like to know why they are doing the old bait and switch to customers and wasting our time and money.</li>
            <li> Yes, the nail polish is called &amp;#34;Chunky Holo Bluebell&amp;#34; - but only AFTERWARDS I get it, am I made aware that this is a type of polish collection KleanColor makes, not the actual color name.&lt;br /&gt;So I guess when you order this, its a crap shoot. The bottle I got was a bright pink holo glitter.&lt;br /&gt;I received the 230 Fuchsia.&lt;br /&gt;NOTHING like the cool color in the pic. (which is 236 Black over a black solid) I am highly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But won&#x27;t return because it was cheap. That&#x27;s how they get you!!&lt;br /&gt;Well, if you are a gamblin&#x27; man or lady, get it....if you really want the black in the pic, get it from somewhere else.</li>
            <li> I ordered a gold colored polish and instead got thi bluish colored one that I will not use. when I notified the seller I did not get the product pictured or described they contacted me with every attempt to satisfy my complaint which I greatly appreciate. I have not used this polish but would possibly order from again in hopes that the service and products are properly labeled and shipped as described. thank you to this seller for reaching out to me.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is good quality. Not thick and old. Thank you, it&#x27;s a beautiful glitter color. Looking forward into buying more, fast shipping too bad we pay more for shipping than for the polish.....I would buy more if you get combined shipping. Thank you!! Oh, and they wrap it up in a ton of bubble wrap guarantee not to break! Awesome, thanks again!</li>
            <li> I hate KleanColor polish but, I love there chunky holo line. It is a gorgeous topcoat over good polish.</li>
            <li> Love these nail polishes. they are very pigmented and does not chip allot. It dries quick. I always get compliments on my nail colors. Most of all the nail polishes I have bought from this line are colors that you really do not see much in drug stores.</li>
            <li> color is much much much different that you see. Sitting in bag and waiting to be given away</li>
            <li> Although this is a very beautiful color, and goes on nicely, I was expecting to get the orange-ish color as pictured, instead, it was, in fact, the bluebell 235 (which looks blue/purple).  Now, I just need to find out what the orange one in the photo is called so I can buy it!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t turn out like the picture AT ALL. Very disappointed with the polish. Was a waste of money bc I&#x27;ll never wear it.</li>
            <li> I love this color!  It reminds me of the night sky and the cosmos.  The light plays on the iridescence and it sparkles and shines so beautifully.  It does take a couple of coats to achieve the look in the picture though, but I still love it.  Not much odor and it dries pretty quickly.  Great for any DIY nail artist or beginner.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> DRIES FAST, very high gloss, very sparkly!!! LOVE IT! I am buying more ASAP!! ALL of the KLEANCOLOR polishes are beautiful, bright and fast drying :)</li>
            <li> The color is slightly different from the picture but I can say it&#x27;s a nice color over a dark blue or purple but by itself it is very sheer but still looks nice, I love it.</li>
            <li> Bottle says it&#x27;s the color I ordered but looks nothing like the pic, different bottle and the color is red with glitter</li>
            <li> This color is not what you see.  It is a light magenta color not with the blue/green color you see.</li>
            <li> but the color is not as shown  it is actually the purple color so i got two of the same color.  it is more of a top coat than a color to be worn alone.  since i got two of the same color, i will be giving one to my cowroker who&#x27;s daughter loves glitter. :)</li>
            <li> Color was no where near color in picture and peeled right off</li>
            <li> Love it. I love the color and KleanColor polishes always last a long time. The only complaint I might have is that sometimes their bottles can be hard to open.</li>
            <li> The company is easy to order from however you got to watch product codes, I went off of pictures and ended up with two of the same bottles of polish but they were eager to help correct the mistake even though it was a bit my fault.</li>
            <li> there is no way you could ever get the look they have pictured here with the crap they send you!!! this nail polish looks NOTHING LIKE THIS PICTURE AT ALL!!! it very light with more blue than anything and wheres the green and gold? they forgot to add them, thats where...bs really.....save your money! wish i could give NO STARS</li>
            <li> This item in the picture was not the same as the one i received, also ontop of that the polish was very watery and had very little color i was dissatisfied with this product</li>
            <li> I received this polish a few days ago, and can&#x27;t stop admiring it on my nails. It looks particularly good over a black or very dark base coat, but I also like a subtler look with one or two coats over bare nails. It looks GORGEOUS with a mattifying topcoat, too! Some things you should know about the product is that, when you get it, it does not look blue AT ALL. I had actually thought that I had been sent the violet version of the polish, not the bluebell. However, on my nails, it&#x27;s just rainbow sparkles in clear polish. It also does have a noticeable smell that is rather strong, but not enough to linger after I cap the polish. I&#x27;m really pleased with this polish, and I love the holographic effect (It looks red, orange, yellow, or green depending on the light). I recommend this for anyone who wants an amazing holo in her collection.</li>
            <li> The product I got was very pink. The photo used is not at all accurate. The cap twisted clear off of the brush when I attempted to open it. I was very gentle.</li>
            <li> The photo shows purple glitter. What I got was dark red. Pretty but not what I ordered. Checked the sticker and it said Bluebell so go figure.</li>
            <li> Just opened the package.&lt;br /&gt;1. I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to look like the picture - I actually google search real pictures of polish on nails before I go and buy it. However, it was still very pretty and purpleish.&lt;br /&gt;2. The bottle I received looks nothing like any of the swatches. It&#x27;s more of a gray-blue with some glitter and very little holo effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing, though it&#x27;ll probably make for a decent accent for a solid color.</li>
            <li> I did not get this but i order this &amp; i got something different that why you see one star</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this polish. It stays on for a long time without chipping.</li>
            <li> I recently wrote a review on this polish and i wasnt happy at first there must have been an error,but Eye Candy Cosmetics were wonderful and helped me and worked with me, they were amazing and i recommend anyone and everyone shopping from them. They were fast and very friendly even when i was being ridiculous. their products are great and worth it, i will be buying more from them, Thank you Eye Candy Cosmetics for your patience and kindness, and great product i love my two other kleancolor nail polishes i got from you. They were beautiful!!!!</li>
            <li> May review nether receiver this call and talk a people on the phone he will work it</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look anything like the photos. I was expecting glitter and holo suspended in a clear base, but it still looks terrible. It&#x27;s just pink.&lt;br /&gt;And it stinks. It smells so strong. Like nail polish from the 90&#x27;s did.&lt;br /&gt;Only buy this if you want a headache from the smell and a disappointing manicure.</li>
            <li> Great item.Beautiful color.Would buy again.KleanColor is a great Polish.Would tell anyone to buy this polish.Goes on beautiful.A small problem with chipping,but I do a lot in the yard and dishes.No polish last long on my hands.</li>
            <li> The actual product is ok... Although it is not very blue (not anywhere near the color pictured, imagine more of a orange color).  I will say the \\&quot;flakies\\&quot; have a blue hue. But the smell that smacks you in the face the second you open the bottle is awful.  I will not be purchasing anymore polish from Kleancolor.</li>
            <li> This looks like a great color but you would literally have to put on 6-8 coats to see the color right.</li>
            <li> The product picture suggests this is more of a rainbow type holographic polish.  The actual product is more fuschia.  I&#x27;ll upload a picture of it.  I was rather disappointed in what I received.&lt;br /&gt;As a couple other reviewers mentioned, it does have a strong \\&quot;nail salon\\&quot; odor to it.  So bad, that went I opened the bottle... my cat smelled it and literally ran from the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The polish goes on clear, with pinkish-red flecks.  It dries fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s an OK polish for the price I paid.  The seller should really change the product picture, though.</li>
