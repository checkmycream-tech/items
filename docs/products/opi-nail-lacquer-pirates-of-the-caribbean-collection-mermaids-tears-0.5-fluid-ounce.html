            <li>Im sure she will.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lovely.</li>

            <li>The color and quality is fantastic (well, its OPI, so of course its fabulous!).</li>
            <li>I love opi and its a real pretty color.</li>
            <li>I love the creamy colors, and they look great on my yellow toned skin.  </li>
            <li>This color is absolutely magnificent and this review is coming from someone who doesn&#x27;t like green nail polishes.</li>
            <li>so happy I finally put my hand on it!</li>
            <li>Really unique color teal that I get loads of compliments on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bold, durable and super cool color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I received my product (ordered from Nail Polish and More) I noticed that the color was a bit more blue than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>i totally recommend these for presents there are so many colors that all girls will love.</li>
            <li>It looks very pretty on my toes in the spring.  </li>
            <li>so pretty!</li>
            <li>In two coats it was thick and beautiful, in true OPI fashion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful Bianchi celeste green, not the new color of celeste but the older more sedate color of celeste.  </li>
            <li>it was the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>but it really does!</li>
            <li>I really like OPI nail polish a lot!</li>
            <li>This color is so pretty.</li>
            <li>is for the bold and fashion forward girl that is ok with having a little fun and won&#x27;t mind getting scared for two days or so, when a glimpse of your nails register.</li>
            <li>The color is WAY more grey than pictured, but applying a UV topcoat brightens it up.</li>
            <li>But I was super excited (and surprised) when it finally arrived.  </li>
            <li>5 STAR  SELLER  fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It goes on very opaque and you could probably get away with just one coat.  </li>
            <li>The color and consistency was incorrect and I was very unsatisfied for my product.</li>
            <li>like the title, this was beautiful nail polish but slightly blue..very slight just not as minty.</li>
            <li>Decent from OPI.</li>
            <li>I little bit more aqua-marine colored than the picture</li>
            <li>I love the shade of green.</li>
            <li>even the nail tech told me this color is pretty and different.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for something more green, but the color matches really well with several articles of clothing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a pretty color</li>
            <li>They only work on certain skin tones, as I&#x27;ve discovered.  </li>
            <li>This color on Mermaids Tears is almost a Mint or Light green turquoise color..</li>
            <li>So far I have painted</li>
            <li>I was in search for a light green color.</li>
            <li>After using it a few more times I noticed that it chipped much easier than any of my other OPI polishes.</li>
            <li>Mermaid&#x27;s tears looks a little more green on screen, and in person is a little more teal.</li>
            <li>lame but honest.</li>
            <li>This is a very dependable brand, always has smooth creamy colors with nice brushes that are wide so it doesnt get all cruddy.</li>
            <li>It my first time to buy a green polish.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Very long lasting color-</li>
            <li> I used the color again and it came out as a dark teal, much different than the blue</li>
            <li> Very watery either opi formula has change or this is not good quality</li>
            <li> Furthermore there was only one metallic ball instead of the usual two that opi uses.</li>

            <li> the bottle I received from Nail Polish and More was a fake and when I complained they were extremely rude and told me to never buy from them again.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I have to say about this polish is that it took literally 2 months to get shipped to me since I ordered it.  </li>
            <li> However, this shade of green was a little darker than i hoped.</li>
            <li> It almost came out to look like a forest green.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time andnaan all year round color.</li>
            <li> I wish it had eco-friendly ingredients :/ but its so pretty that I will be a bad person for this brand.</li>
            <li> Not good at all.</li>
            <li> This nail polish in not for the weak and discrete.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Poor animals......</li>
            <li> The application isn&#x27;t streaky, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

            <li> Very watery either opi formula has change or this is not good quality</li>
            <li> It my first time to buy a green polish. It is amazing!   I wear it to the beach. It makes me shining!</li>
            <li> The Pirated of the Caribbean colors are great.. This color on Mermaids Tears is almost a Mint or Light green turquoise color.. Really nice summer color!!! also the product was fresh!!  5 STAR  SELLER  fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this color and its much more versatile than I thought it would be.  It goes on very opaque and you could probably get away with just one coat.  The color and quality is fantastic (well, its OPI, so of course its fabulous!).</li>
            <li> I purchased this color because I thought it was beautiful. When I received my product (ordered from Nail Polish and More) I noticed that the color was a bit more blue than I thought it would be. After using it a few more times I noticed that it chipped much easier than any of my other OPI polishes. I used the color again and it came out as a dark teal, much different than the blue it was the first time I used it. After researching I found that there are many companies that sell knock-offs and I believe that I received one. For one thing there was no serial number (which they claim they remove by request of OPI). Furthermore there was only one metallic ball instead of the usual two that opi uses. The color and consistency was incorrect and I was very unsatisfied for my product. I cannot speak for other companies selling this product but the bottle I received from Nail Polish and More was a fake and when I complained they were extremely rude and told me to never buy from them again. Trust me I won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I am a big mermaid freak and plus a pirates of the caribbean fan too! I was scared that it wouldn&#x27;t go with any outfits but it really does! It will not clash with anything. I love this colour and will keep using it forever!</li>
            <li> Beautiful jade or seafoam color. Looks just like the picture. In two coats it was thick and beautiful, in true OPI fashion.</li>
            <li> Just got a mani and pedi yesterday. I love this color even the nail tech told me this color is pretty and different.</li>
            <li> I really like OPI nail polish a lot! However, this shade of green was a little darker than i hoped. It almost came out to look like a forest green. (yuck)</li>
            <li> This color is so pretty. i also got another pirates themed color i totally recommend these for presents there are so many colors that all girls will love.</li>
            <li> The color is WAY more grey than pictured, but applying a UV topcoat brightens it up. I love it and would wear it regardless just because of the name!</li>
            <li> like the title, this was beautiful nail polish but slightly blue..very slight just not as minty. This is a very dependable brand, always has smooth creamy colors with nice brushes that are wide so it doesnt get all cruddy. I wish it had eco-friendly ingredients :/ but its so pretty that I will be a bad person for this brand. lame but honest.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I have to say about this polish is that it took literally 2 months to get shipped to me since I ordered it.  But I was super excited (and surprised) when it finally arrived.  I applied it immediately.  The color is AMAZING.  I little bit more aqua-marine colored than the picture (it looks mint colored in the photos).  Also, I have a ton of OPI colors, but this one especially will make you feel like a pro when you are applying the polish because it goes on so perfectly. And you could get away with 1 coat for a lighter color, but two coats is perfect.</li>
            <li> Oh my, this is a beautiful color!  The OPI products have yet to disappoint me.  This is creamy, smooth and gorgeous!</li>
            <li> I like it, as always OPI nail polish are the best! I thought the color was going to be stronger than it actually is, though. But I like it anyway!</li>
            <li> Love opi and the color is great!! Bought for me and family members to wear on a beach vacation we are going on. Perfect.</li>
            <li> Great shade.  It looks very pretty on my toes in the spring.  It chips on my&lt;br /&gt;Nails.  I give it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Good for one day only.&lt;br /&gt;And OPI test this product on animals. Not good at all. Poor animals......&lt;br /&gt;So never again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful Bianchi celeste green, not the new color of celeste but the older more sedate color of celeste.  It is passable for chip repair on my bike and works great on nails too.</li>
            <li> This color is absolutely magnificent and this review is coming from someone who doesn&#x27;t like green nail polishes. It&#x27;s slightly similar to China Glaze&#x27;s For Audrey but without the blue undertone. It is opaque in 2 coats and it&#x27;s oh so pretty!</li>
            <li> This nail polish in not for the weak and discrete.&lt;br /&gt;This is for the bold and fashion forward girl that is ok with having a little fun and won&#x27;t mind getting scared for two days or so, when a glimpse of your nails register. It&#x27;s a bold, durable and super cool color.&lt;br /&gt;OPI quality (Which means long lasting and no chipping) and guaranteed fun.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend.</li>
            <li> Mermaid&#x27;s tears looks a little more green on screen, and in person is a little more teal. I was hoping for something more green, but the color matches really well with several articles of clothing. I do have to use about 3 coats though, for it to be opaque.</li>
            <li> Really unique color teal that I get loads of compliments on. Really love O.P.I. nail colors. Delivered on time andnaan all year round color.</li>
            <li> Great color. Love O.P.I products and this will be a hit this summer. Mermaid Tears is a great color to be worn by anyone.</li>
            <li> So far I have painted \\&quot;Sparrow me the Drama\\&quot; and \\&quot;Mermaid&#x27;s Tears\\&quot;.  I&#x27;ll add photos as I remember to take them.  I love the creamy colors, and they look great on my yellow toned skin.  Two coats is sufficient, but it looks great at three.  Very long lasting color- I think the best formula since they dropped the big 3!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They look beautiful!  I loved the mauvey Sparrow Me The Drama, it was feminine but still current.  Mermaid&#x27;s tears is just amazing- so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> OPI is a great brand and for the price it a great quality. The color is spot on!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite color in my collection!!! Ive been looking for it everywhere and Im so happy I finally put my hand on it! Catch it as soon as you can! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> This color is GORGEOUS! Its essentially seafoam green, and it goes on very well. The application isn&#x27;t streaky, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this color. It&#x27;s such a pretty color and I get compliments every time I wear it. It lasts quite a while as well.</li>
            <li> Like the Pirates of the Caribbean polishes.  They only work on certain skin tones, as I&#x27;ve discovered.  Decent from OPI.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking for this particular color and it is perfect! I love the shade of green. It looks great in the bottle and on you! Great buy!</li>
            <li> I got this for a friend of mine in france I hope she likes it.  Im sure she will.  I love opi and its a real pretty color.</li>
            <li> Great color with the quality you expect from OPI. I was in search for a light green color. It&#x27;s lovely.</li>
