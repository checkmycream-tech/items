            <li>It really is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>No scent, which is nice -</li>
            <li>If it has good smell, it is much better.</li>
            <li>Feels so nice on my skin, but doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy at all.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful and keeps my skin feeling soft all day!</li>
            <li>I received this as a free product sample with one of my DHC orders and surprisingly loved it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using DHC Olive Virgin Oil for years and it is clearly the best moisturizing treatment I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>Very light and moisturizing, use every morning and every night.</li>
            <li>I love this product - very light, not oily with no added perfumes.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love DHC products, but this one is my holy grail.</li>
            <li>Any DHC products is top of the line for beauty.</li>
            <li>I wake up in the morning and think my face looks better.  </li>
            <li>Will be better if non of those happened.</li>
            <li>Some oils just mimic the molecule structure of skin much better than olive, in my experience.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and, recently, my sister told me my skin has been looking great!  </li>
            <li>It just sits on top of your skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>but now at 57 I need to use more oily lotion or cream.  </li>
            <li>This is the best olive oil for facial skin on the market.</li>
            <li>My all time favorite.</li>
            <li>I love the product, but seller sent me TWO (2 days apart) and charged for two.  </li>
            <li>My face looks so much better as a senior.</li>
            <li>I love DHC and started using this product a week ago.</li>
            <li>So glad it is available at amazon and prime!</li>
            <li>Have used this before and love</li>
            <li>It is particularly wonderful during the winter when chapped, dry skin is an issue.</li>
            <li>We all have great, young looking skin.</li>
            <li>This is as incredible as the Deep Cleansing Oil.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the most amazing stuff</li>
            <li>I have had a good normal skin</li>
            <li>The fine lines were no longer visible.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve use this as an all purpose night time moisturizer in the winter and it works fine.</li>
            <li>I take extremely great care of my facial skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Sometimes simple, natural things are the best, and this is one of those times.  </li>
            <li>It goes on clean and scent-free.</li>
            <li>It has very very light scent, nearly undetectable, but is it pleasant and natural.</li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s so pure.</li>
            <li>give it 3 lippies for its non-reactiveness, pure ingredients (just 100% oil), and marketing premise (no crazy claims or data, just a pure, good, face oil of wholesome origin).</li>
            <li>My skin does not feel right without it!</li>
            <li>The oil is always consistent in being light and scent free.</li>
            <li>It smells good and  definitely makes my skin feel smoother.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin so much softer and more hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Other than like, great product.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick also.</li>
            <li>I also use their mild lotion toner.</li>
            <li>This product is light and pure.</li>
            <li>My skin is FINALLY calm.</li>
            <li>This has kept my skin incredibly calm</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a greasy look, just fresh and not overly moisturized.</li>
            <li>and I look dewey and fresh all day.  </li>
            <li>I read that pure virgin olive oil has anti-inflammatory properties - whatever it has, I like it!  </li>
            <li>I looked more youthful with a natural glow and got so much compliments.</li>
            <li>It gives me that glow, great looking skin from my late teens/early 20s.</li>
            <li>Have been using this product in addition to Olive Oil Cleanser for several years and love them both.  </li>
            <li>However, this is my first time purchasing a US version and the item I received</li>
            <li>Vaseline actually worked better to maintain a barrier than the oil.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day either by itself or with another moisturizer on top (especially at night time).  </li>
            <li>I will be back to order more when I run out.</li>
            <li>This moisturer is really good for a dry mature skin.  </li>
            <li>They leave your skin feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>The price seems high, but I have to say this is something I think is worth it</li>
            <li>but I was really amazed by how well and quickly this worked to heal normally stubborn acne lesions.</li>
            <li>and I should see or feel something positive immediately.  </li>
            <li>It is not greasy, and one application in the am lasts pretty much all day.  </li>
            <li>:  it really works to eliminate dry skin, smooth out wrinkles, and keep that fresh feeling all day.  </li>
            <li>So I tried it and have loved it for years, hardly ever use anything else</li>
            <li>I have tried every moisturizer under the sun to resolve this and nothing ever really works until now.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Fast service-good price.</li>
            <li>Thanks, hormones.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much either - 1-2 pumps, just press it in (no need to rub).  </li>
            <li>Two winters in a row i&#x27;ve used this oil, and it really didn&#x27;t make much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>but your skin absorb it, really work for me because I do not use foundation and have permanent make up in my eye brown and eye linear.  </li>
            <li>Gentle, soothing.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t using this much in the summer</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>and it really does work.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned that not all natural products work for me though - too many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; things in a facial product, and I can have an allergic reaction around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>See, my skin is fair, thin/translucent, and SUPER tight and dry, esp.</li>
            <li>Its a good natural product, but I have not yet used it long enough to see the effects of it on my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is like new!</li>
            <li>I like most of the DHC products I have tried, and I especially like simple, natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Helps with dry winter skin - Love the way it makes my skin feel; would definitely make it part of my skin regimine.  </li>
            <li>I also figure you only want to put on your skin things you&#x27;d eat, right?</li>
            <li>I live by it.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It would be hard to find a better moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft and does not cause me to break out.  </li>
            <li>I get this directly from DHC.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin soft and dewy.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this oil for 3 years now and my skin is so soft and youthful looking that I will never stop using it for my nightime application.</li>
            <li>so I ordered direct from DHC this time.</li>
            <li>My skin has a tendency to be dry and, so far, this is the only face product I&#x27;ve had success with in terms of keeping my skin soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>but for you, maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dosage on the pump is delivers too much product, but that&#x27;s a minor qualm --at</li>
            <li>Does not moisture my dry skin much</li>
            <li>No other cream has done that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a male, have combination, olive tone skin that isn&#x27;t sensitive or acne prone.</li>
            <li>The effects were two visible lines (glabellar lines) in the middle of my eyebrows by 27 years old.</li>
            <li>Women all over the world use oils on their face, unfortunately the US is only now getting in on the amazing benefits.  </li>
            <li>I live in a very dry and cold climate and this is the only product that keeps my skin looking good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 66 and have developed dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t bother the sensitive skin around my eyes, melts away the dry patches, and get this - you put a spot of it on a breakout, and it helps HEAL it!  </li>

            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> but your skin absorb it, really work for me because I do not use foundation and have permanent make up in my eye brown and eye linear.  </li>
            <li> Gentle, soothing.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t using this much in the summer</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> and it really does work.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned that not all natural products work for me though - too many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; things in a facial product, and I can have an allergic reaction around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> See, my skin is fair, thin/translucent, and SUPER tight and dry, esp.</li>
            <li> Its a good natural product, but I have not yet used it long enough to see the effects of it on my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is like new!</li>
            <li> I like most of the DHC products I have tried, and I especially like simple, natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Helps with dry winter skin - Love the way it makes my skin feel; would definitely make it part of my skin regimine.  </li>
            <li> I also figure you only want to put on your skin things you&#x27;d eat, right?</li>
            <li> I live by it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It would be hard to find a better moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my skin soft and does not cause me to break out.  </li>
            <li> I get this directly from DHC.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin soft and dewy.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for 3 years now and my skin is so soft and youthful looking that I will never stop using it for my nightime application.</li>
            <li> so I ordered direct from DHC this time.</li>
            <li> My skin has a tendency to be dry and, so far, this is the only face product I&#x27;ve had success with in terms of keeping my skin soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> but for you, maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dosage on the pump is delivers too much product, but that&#x27;s a minor qualm --at</li>
            <li> Does not moisture my dry skin much</li>
            <li> No other cream has done that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male, have combination, olive tone skin that isn&#x27;t sensitive or acne prone.</li>
            <li> The effects were two visible lines (glabellar lines) in the middle of my eyebrows by 27 years old.</li>
            <li> Women all over the world use oils on their face, unfortunately the US is only now getting in on the amazing benefits.  </li>
            <li> I live in a very dry and cold climate and this is the only product that keeps my skin looking good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 66 and have developed dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t bother the sensitive skin around my eyes, melts away the dry patches, and get this - you put a spot of it on a breakout, and it helps HEAL it!  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had some ridiculously hot, dry, windy days this spring in LA and my skin was dry and flaking and painfully tight (not the retinA as I&#x27;ve been on it forever).</li>
            <li> I only use it at night, because it&#x27;s just a tad too oily for me in the daytime (but I&#x27;ll use it in a pinch - especially on really dry days).</li>
            <li> It soften lines and kinda gives a slight glow to my extremely mature complexion...  </li>
            <li> Another day of application and both healed without leaving the usual red spot on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> However, it did not react with my skin, and did what i expected a basic face oil to do</li>
            <li> A bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I double cleanse with deep cleansing oil (i use it twice instead of second cleanse with soap) and then apply a few drops of DHC olive oil.</li>
            <li> I live in Minnesota, which is extremely cold/dry over half the year and hot/humid during summer.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t absorb completely --see, when your skin is parched and tight, it&#x27;s closed to receiving oil all the way, so a residue forms.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and tend to get dry patches around my nose.</li>
            <li> It helps to prevent that dry taunt look of winter skin.</li>
            <li> In fact, given how small the bottle is, I am surprised how long it lasts.    </li>
            <li> Constantly telling me to use drying products has made my skin worse my whole life - we NEED some oil in our skin.  </li>
            <li> You use such a small amount that it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It is too oily for my face, does not get absorb as I expected.</li>
            <li> but it is an oil that sinks immediately into the skin.</li>
            <li> Kinda expensive, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I admit it - I was extremely nervous at the idea of leaving oil on my face as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Sounds strange, but I haven&#x27;t had a breakout since I started using it a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> Shipped and delivered before the estimated due date.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin and have used DHC Olive Virgin Oil for a few years.</li>
            <li> Use it for both mother and a baby, it is expensive, but it is pure and refined oil without any additives.</li>
            <li> It seems to me that the olive oil has less skin affinity than other oils i&#x27;ve tried ( jojoba, almond, argan).</li>
            <li> and folks tell me I look at least 10 years younger than I am.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using DHC olive virgin oil for a number of years and it hasn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li> I liberally applied this olive oil and almost overnight the lesions had calmed down.</li>
            <li> I use it at night and wake up not feeling the least bit dry.</li>
            <li> I found that there&#x27;s a little part that&#x27;s cut off underneath the \\&quot;made in Japan\\&quot; from the box.</li>
            <li> Also, I believe  that heal acne because I had little and is almost gone.</li>
            <li> A few drops of this product</li>
            <li> I put a drop on each cheekbone and then a few in my hand.</li>
            <li> Seems to be heavy</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t put on makeup for a few minutes while it soaks in.</li>
            <li> and I use it year round.  </li>
            <li> Hooray for the small victories.</li>
            <li> least it&#x27;s not a dropper (messy and prone to contamination)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pricey item but for me the bottle usually lasts upwards of six months, so it&#x27;s well-worth it.</li>
            <li> I have tried all the super expensive lotions, VERY expensive and this is the one I perfer.</li>
            <li> I kept both although it is expensive and each lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Hard to believe,</li>
            <li> It took me awhile to justify the price, I mean, it&#x27;s olive oil....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not a good customer to ask, but there it is...</li>
            <li> OO is the secret.</li>
            <li> I am using it on my body, and it is too expensive for that.</li>
            <li> but recently after traveling I returned home with two nasty bleeding inflamed acne lesions that weren&#x27;t healing with benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> and then isn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It keeps my skin soft and does not cause me to break out.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of this oil, nothing I&#x27;ve tried has even come close to moisturizing as well as this. It took me awhile to justify the price, I mean, it&#x27;s olive oil....BUT my skin has never looked or felt smoother or softer. I put it on after I wash my face at night and apply my serums. This stuff locks it in and I wake up with glowing skin. I love DHC products, but this one is my holy grail.</li>
            <li> Came as promised.  Quick delivery and great product!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and tend to get dry patches around my nose. I have tried every moisturizer under the sun to resolve this and nothing ever really works until now. A few drops of this product and I&#x27;m good to go! It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy or shiny either which is wonderful. I also use DHC&#x27;s oil face wash to remove my makeup and absolutely love it! It&#x27;s the best product out there!</li>
            <li> My Italian family swears by OO for the skin. We all have great, young looking skin. OO is the secret. This product is light and pure. Love it!</li>
            <li> It would be hard to find a better moisturizer.  I also figure you only want to put on your skin things you&#x27;d eat, right? because it absorbs into your body.  This is olive oil but it doesn&#x27;t smell like that AT ALL.  Sometimes simple, natural things are the best, and this is one of those times.  It is not greasy, and one application in the am lasts pretty much all day.  In fact, given how small the bottle is, I am surprised how long it lasts.    The price seems high, but I have to say this is something I think is worth it (at a time when every penny matters).  Bottom line:  it really works to eliminate dry skin, smooth out wrinkles, and keep that fresh feeling all day.  I think it&#x27;s a great product and that&#x27;s why I take the time to recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reviewing this for the product but have not purchased from Amazon. I get this directly from DHC. I&#x27;m a male, have combination, olive tone skin that isn&#x27;t sensitive or acne prone. I live in Minnesota, which is extremely cold/dry over half the year and hot/humid during summer. I do tan about 3 times/month and smoke 5 cigarettes/day. I take extremely great care of my facial skin.  I received this as a free product sample with one of my DHC orders and surprisingly loved it. I put a drop on each cheekbone and then a few in my hand. I then rub my hands together and press into my skin, including neck. It gives me that glow, great looking skin from my late teens/early 20s. It&#x27;s fantastic. I try to only do this twice/week during the winter bc it seems to give the best glow. But I often just do it daily in the winter. It&#x27;s not a greasy look, just fresh and not overly moisturized. I love this!</li>
            <li> I read somewhere that Sophia Loren used olive oil on her skin, and who wouldn&#x27;t want to look like that!  So I tried it and have loved it for years, hardly ever use anything else and folks tell me I look at least 10 years younger than I am.  Hooray for the small victories.</li>
            <li> I love this product - very light, not oily with no added perfumes. Any DHC products is top of the line for beauty.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!! It makes your skin soft and dewy.  It is a great product to use in the winter. It helps to prevent that dry taunt look of winter skin.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.  Delivery was quick also.</li>
            <li> A staple for me. Very light and moisturizing, use every morning and every night.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product in addition to Olive Oil Cleanser for several years and love them both.  They leave your skin feeling clean and soft.  Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Fast service-good price.</li>
            <li> I admit it - I was extremely nervous at the idea of leaving oil on my face as a moisturizer.  I use the oil-cleansing method to remove make-up occasionally, so I understand the benefits to oil, but that always gets washed off.  Not this.  I like most of the DHC products I have tried, and I especially like simple, natural ingredients.  I&#x27;ve learned that not all natural products work for me though - too many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; things in a facial product, and I can have an allergic reaction around my eyes.  I&#x27;m in my mid-30s with combination skin, currently trying to get used to Retin A, so I go back and forth from oily break-outs to reptilian-dry.  Thanks, hormones.  THIS product is wonderful, either way.  I only use it at night, because it&#x27;s just a tad too oily for me in the daytime (but I&#x27;ll use it in a pinch - especially on really dry days). It soaks in well by the time I go to bed.  It doesn&#x27;t take much either - 1-2 pumps, just press it in (no need to rub).  Doesn&#x27;t bother the sensitive skin around my eyes, melts away the dry patches, and get this - you put a spot of it on a breakout, and it helps HEAL it!  Hard to believe, but that&#x27;s the experience I am having. I read that pure virgin olive oil has anti-inflammatory properties - whatever it has, I like it!  I wake up in the morning and think my face looks better.  I have a feeling I&#x27;ll be using this product for years and years to come.  No scent, which is nice - I don&#x27;t mind fragrance for some things, but a break from it now and then isn&#x27;t bad.  So...why don&#x27;t dermatologists get this? Constantly telling me to use drying products has made my skin worse my whole life - we NEED some oil in our skin.  I had to figure this out myself.</li>
            <li> The product is undoubtably good. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. However, this is my first time purchasing a US version and the item I received I found that there&#x27;s a little part that&#x27;s cut off underneath the \\&quot;made in Japan\\&quot; from the box. Not liking it cuz it feels like someone&#x27;s trying to hide something from the customers. And there&#x27;s no expiration date on the item as well. Will be better if non of those happened. Other than like, great product.</li>
            <li> It is too oily for my face, does not get absorb as I expected. My face get too red from it. I am using it on my body, and it is too expensive for that. I am not likely to order it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for 3 years now and my skin is so soft and youthful looking that I will never stop using it for my nightime application.</li>
            <li> See, my skin is fair, thin/translucent, and SUPER tight and dry, esp. during the winter. Two winters in a row i&#x27;ve used this oil, and it really didn&#x27;t make much of a difference. It didn&#x27;t absorb completely --see, when your skin is parched and tight, it&#x27;s closed to receiving oil all the way, so a residue forms. It seems to me that the olive oil has less skin affinity than other oils i&#x27;ve tried ( jojoba, almond, argan). Some oils just mimic the molecule structure of skin much better than olive, in my experience.  Vaseline actually worked better to maintain a barrier than the oil. However, it did not react with my skin, and did what i expected a basic face oil to do --help seal in moisture and prevent evaporation. It did not create miracles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 3 lippies for its non-reactiveness, pure ingredients (just 100% oil), and marketing premise (no crazy claims or data, just a pure, good, face oil of wholesome origin). it is for me? no. but for you, maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dosage on the pump is delivers too much product, but that&#x27;s a minor qualm --at least it&#x27;s not a dropper (messy and prone to contamination)</li>
            <li> I use this product at night and believe it makes a difference in the quality of my skin.  My skin has a tendency to be dry and, so far, this is the only face product I&#x27;ve had success with in terms of keeping my skin soft and supple.  I really like it.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and, recently, my sister told me my skin has been looking great!  I&#x27;ve been using DHC olive virgin oil for a number of years and it hasn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li> I used to do a lot of facial movement. The effects were two visible lines (glabellar lines) in the middle of my eyebrows by 27 years old. I tried the DHC Olive Virgin oil, and it soften my skin. The fine lines were no longer visible. I looked more youthful with a natural glow and got so much compliments. No other cream has done that. I used it twice a day.The bottle lasted over a year.  I wash my face with the deep cleansing oil, and apply the olive oil. It&#x27;s the best. My skin does not feel right without it!</li>
            <li> Unlike the reviews I read this is just oil.  It just sits on top of your skin.</li>
            <li> This product is a gem in the sea of thousands of skincare products.. Perfect if you are looking for a product that acts like moisturizer for all skin types.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 66 and have developed dry skin.  I love this product.  I use it at night and wake up not feeling the least bit dry.</li>
            <li> Helps with dry winter skin - Love the way it makes my skin feel; would definitely make it part of my skin regimine.  Will order it again.  A bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Its a good natural product, but I have not yet used it long enough to see the effects of it on my skin.</li>
            <li> Every day, I use this oil on my face. It is so good to my skin. If it has good smell, it is much better.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and have used DHC Olive Virgin Oil for a few years. It is wonderful and keeps my skin feeling soft all day! I also use their mild lotion toner. Both are great.</li>
            <li> I have aging skin which I have taken very good care of.  I have tried almost everything out there before I have bought it and I have three requirements.  I like the fragrance of the product.  It does not break my skin out and I should see or feel something positive immediately.  I have read olive oil is a great aging preventative for your skin.  Since this is a recent purchase I can&#x27;t claim it diminishes wrinkles but it is an oil that sinks immediately into the skin. It smells good and  definitely makes my skin feel smoother.  I like it a lot .&lt;br /&gt;At this price point I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and love it.  It is particularly wonderful during the winter when chapped, dry skin is an issue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using DHC Olive Virgin Oil for years and it is clearly the best moisturizing treatment I&#x27;ve found.  I receive lots of compliments on my complexion.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry and cold climate and this is the only product that keeps my skin looking good. I live by it. It goes on clean and scent-free. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel oily. I&#x27;ve used it for years - it&#x27;s worth every penny! I&#x27;m excited to see it here on Amazon. It&#x27;s a bit cheaper here but the shipping takes longer. I&#x27;m currently out of it so I ordered direct from DHC this time. I&#x27;d rather pay more and get it quicker!</li>
            <li> This moisturer is really good for a dry mature skin.  I have had a good normal skin but now at 57 I need to use more oily lotion or cream.  Seems to be heavy but your skin absorb it, really work for me because I do not use foundation and have permanent make up in my eye brown and eye linear.  Also, I believe  that heal acne because I had little and is almost gone.</li>
            <li> This is the best olive oil for facial skin on the market. Gentle, soothing. Encourages softness and will bring a glow to your skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best night care thing to put on your face. I just ran out, so I went to get something until I got this back in stock. It really is amazing. Kinda expensive, but it is worth it. You can tell the difference in about 1 week. I have tried all the super expensive lotions, VERY expensive and this is the one I perfer.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> Does not moisture my dry skin much</li>
            <li> My all time favorite. The oil is always consistent in being light and scent free. Never oily. My skin appreciate their value in excellent quality</li>
            <li> Very good stuff. Use it for both mother and a baby, it is expensive, but it is pure and refined oil without any additives. It has very very light scent, nearly undetectable, but is it pleasant and natural.</li>
            <li> This is as incredible as the Deep Cleansing Oil. I double cleanse with deep cleansing oil (i use it twice instead of second cleanse with soap) and then apply a few drops of DHC olive oil. My skin is FINALLY calm. I use tretinoin and hydroquinone so my skin often has red fits after getting off and back on routine. This has kept my skin incredibly calm and I love that it&#x27;s so pure. My face is thanking me.</li>
            <li> Olive oil on my face?!?  Sounds strange, but I haven&#x27;t had a breakout since I started using it a few years ago.  It keeps my skin moisturized without making it oily.  Just don&#x27;t put on makeup for a few minutes while it soaks in.</li>
            <li> Amazing moisturizer.  I use it under sunscreen and I look dewey and fresh all day.  Women all over the world use oils on their face, unfortunately the US is only now getting in on the amazing benefits.  Give it a try--you wont regret it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use this as an all purpose night time moisturizer in the winter and it works fine. I wasn&#x27;t using this much in the summer but recently after traveling I returned home with two nasty bleeding inflamed acne lesions that weren&#x27;t healing with benzoyl peroxide. I liberally applied this olive oil and almost overnight the lesions had calmed down. Another day of application and both healed without leaving the usual red spot on my sensitive skin. Olive oil is known to have anti-inflammation properties but I was really amazed by how well and quickly this worked to heal normally stubborn acne lesions. It&#x27;s a pricey item but for me the bottle usually lasts upwards of six months, so it&#x27;s well-worth it.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but seller sent me TWO (2 days apart) and charged for two.  I kept both although it is expensive and each lasts a long time, I will eventually use it...Next order will be from DHC...</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the most amazing stuff and I use it year round.  I started using DHC about 10 years ago and won&#x27;t go without my olive oil!  I use it twice a day either by itself or with another moisturizer on top (especially at night time).  I wear it under sunscreen and it doesn&#x27;t interact with it in any way.  It&#x27;s just the best stuff ever and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Excellent, the best for aging face and neck skin.</li>
            <li> It soften lines and kinda gives a slight glow to my extremely mature complexion...  I&#x27;m really not a good customer to ask, but there it is...</li>
            <li> Best product I ever used and get into your pores. My face looks so much better as a senior.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and I&#x27;m a retinA user in my thirties. We&#x27;ve had some ridiculously hot, dry, windy days this spring in LA and my skin was dry and flaking and painfully tight (not the retinA as I&#x27;ve been on it forever). I love DHC and started using this product a week ago. My skin is like new! It is not greasy at all, no breakouts, no sensitivities at all. You use such a small amount that it will last a long time. So glad it is available at amazon and prime!</li>
            <li> Wonderful light moisture. Feels so nice on my skin, but doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Have used this before and love it&#x27;s moisturizing feel. I apply this in the evening under makeup.</li>
            <li> I got this olive oil to combat winter skin dryness and it really does work.  Makes my skin so much softer and more hydrated.  And absorbs into skin without feeling greasy.  All around a great product.  Shipped and delivered before the estimated due date.  I will be back to order more when I run out.</li>
