            <li>This is the best self tan I have found for a realistic looking tan.  </li>

            <li>one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you where the gloves or the mitt and you put moisturizer on before you start.</li>
            <li>Overall awesome product!</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>the lotion - far superior!</li>
            <li>It looks great on, really natural.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE St. Tropez and was so happy to find this larger bottle existed on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Super value!</li>
            <li>Has a green tint when you put it on, but once you wash it off it looks great!</li>
            <li>Great stuff, go for the big 16.9 oz bottle</li>
            <li>Great deep color.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about it is you can see what color your getting right when you apply it; No waiting for it to develop.</li>
            <li>Better price than QVC which I ordered from the first time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely pale and this stuff gives me the perfect bronze glow, not fake looking!</li>
            <li>It seems a bit costly compared to others on the market but because it lasts so long it is really more cost effective.  </li>
            <li>Love this self tanning.so natural and so easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>easy to apply... and fast drying!</li>
            <li>this never makes me orange and the smell is mild.</li>
            <li>Really natural color, super easy to apply!  </li>
            <li>This does leave a very natural look, unlike many on the market.</li>
            <li>I think even some of the standard drug store self tanners are better than this!</li>
            <li>I am naturally quite pale and I love having a nice golden tan without risking skin cancer.</li>
            <li>It goes on quickly, dries quickly and looks natural.  </li>
            <li>Is not an orange color and looks totally real!</li>
            <li>thanks, Kate Middleton!</li>
            <li>As promised &amp; fast shipping!</li>
            <li>you get way more for the a lesser price.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other tanners and this one WINS hands</li>
            <li>Provides a quick, natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li>Goes on like a dark green color, but the results are flawless, after application I use baby powder</li>
            <li>With as much product that had rubbed off on my clothes, I was even more surprised to see how much came off on the regular wash cloth (not an exfoliator) in the shower</li>
            <li>but I have never had a problem with the lotion version rubbing off on my clothes &amp; certainly never turned a light colored wash cloth dingy brown in the shower!</li>
            <li>It gives a true tan, that darkens instantly.</li>
            <li>This stuff looks so natural and pretty.  </li>
            <li>Much to my surprise when I received my new bottle of tanning mousse and unwrapped the shrink wrap</li>
            <li>The large size also lasts a very long time so this makes the price very reasonable.</li>
            <li>(so it was new)</li>
            <li>Make sure to purchase the large mitt (and small for face) because you&#x27;ll need it!</li>
            <li>However, like most on the market streaks are inevitable if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li>No streaks and the tan is very natural looking.</li>
            <li>As all tanning/bronzing agents do, the results are very natural.</li>
            <li>i usually buy this from Sephora but this is a much better deal.</li>
            <li>My advice to anyone looking for a healthy and natural summer glow, try St. Tropez and invest in this larger bottle of it because it will last you a very long time.</li>
            <li>Natural tan color....</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for those looking for an instant natural looking tan!</li>
            <li>Daughter loves this product, usually pay much more for smaller bottles per ounce!</li>
            <li>so I ensured the product was fully dry before dressing &amp; exfoliated before using.... hope &amp; pray you don&#x27;t get the least bit warm after you have use this...</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, stays on for a few days, and does not leave streaks!</li>
            <li>So surprised to open package and realize what a bargain I had ordered!</li>
            <li>No streaks nice color does not look fake.  </li>
            <li>Extremely easy to apply and looks completely natural without streaks or weird colors.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Extremely easy to apply and looks completely natural without streaks or weird colors.</li>
            <li> So my brand new bottle was a total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Initially just turned skin greenish grey.</li>
            <li> The only problem is when it gets old it turns green.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, I am not a new user to self tan products</li>
            <li> but I do recommend the small mitts if you&#x27;re just covering the face - the larger mitt for other parts of the body).</li>
            <li> and I threw out all my other self tanning products.</li>
            <li> Works just as described, turns brown instead of orange like other products!</li>
            <li> But, I still like a little glow.</li>
            <li> and I got a bottle that wasn&#x27;t green.  </li>
            <li> I pump some out on the applicator mitt and it was green!  </li>
            <li> I ordered St Tropez self Tan Bronzing Mousse and paid $ 32.00; however I received 2 small fans.</li>
            <li> I have used St Tropez auto bronze lotion in the past &amp; decided to try the mousse out this</li>
            <li> Not sure if I got a defective product &amp;/or a knock off</li>
            <li> THE CAN IS ALL BEAT UP AND FILTHY ON THE OUTSIDE COVERED WITH TANNER</li>
            <li> so my hands don&#x27;t look dirty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is horrible!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it, gave it to my daughter who uses it already. I was streaky the next day. I know others who like the mousse application but it dried too fast for me.</li>
            <li> Has a green tint when you put it on, but once you wash it off it looks great!</li>
            <li> THE CAN IS ALL BEAT UP AND FILTHY ON THE OUTSIDE COVERED WITH TANNER AND LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE HAS ALREADY USED IT!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some skin issues over the years and I have to stay out of the sun as much as possible.  This is the best self tan I have found for a realistic looking tan.  I bought the 8 oz size and it has lasted for about 4 months using it two times a week.  It seems a bit costly compared to others on the market but because it lasts so long it is really more cost effective.  I have just reordered the larger size 16.9 oz bottle and it is an even better deal.  I highly recommend this product for those looking for an instant natural looking tan!</li>
            <li> I have tried many other tanners and this one WINS hands down.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply. Is not an orange color and looks totally real!</li>
            <li> Ive only used 2 self tanning products ever but I love this one. My favorite thing about it is you can see what color your getting right when you apply it; No waiting for it to develop. I am naturally quite pale and I love having a nice golden tan without risking skin cancer. I recommend moisturizing and exfoliating in the shower before applying it. I would defiantly buy this again!</li>
            <li> Love this self tanning.so natural and so easy to apply.  Better price than QVC which I ordered from the first time. Thank you. JW</li>
            <li> I love St. Tropez tanning mousse.  It looks great on, really natural.  The only problem is when it gets old it turns green.  Much to my surprise when I received my new bottle of tanning mousse and unwrapped the shrink wrap (so it was new) I pump some out on the applicator mitt and it was green!  So my brand new bottle was a total waste of money.  I don&#x27;t really want a green tan.  So I recommend buying this tanning mousse just don&#x27;t buy it from this retailer.  I went to the store and asked when their tanning mousse had arrived and I got a bottle that wasn&#x27;t green.  Beware!</li>
            <li> I ordered St Tropez self Tan Bronzing Mousse and paid $ 32.00; however I received 2 small fans. When I returned the fans with a note about what happen they credit my account $ 5.97. What a rip off!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used St Tropez auto bronze lotion in the past &amp; decided to try the mousse out this time.&lt;br /&gt;It is horrible! Not sure if I got a defective product &amp;/or a knock off but I have never had a problem with the lotion version rubbing off on my clothes &amp; certainly never turned a light colored wash cloth dingy brown in the shower! The mousse did both!&lt;br /&gt;Again, I am not a new user to self tan products so I ensured the product was fully dry before dressing &amp; exfoliated before using.... hope &amp; pray you don&#x27;t get the least bit warm after you have use this... the stinch is horrendous! And another not so nice surprise to see the inside of my clothing turned brown as well! With as much product that had rubbed off on my clothes, I was even more surprised to see how much came off on the regular wash cloth (not an exfoliator) in the shower (a day later). Would not recommend this product at all - get the lotion - far superior! I think even some of the standard drug store self tanners are better than this!</li>
            <li> Super value! Will last for months! So surprised to open package and realize what a bargain I had ordered! Def would buy again!</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved it!! Really natural color, super easy to apply!  (but be sure to use gloves!!) thanks, Kate Middleton! Ox</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE St. Tropez and was so happy to find this larger bottle existed on Amazon. My advice to anyone looking for a healthy and natural summer glow, try St. Tropez and invest in this larger bottle of it because it will last you a very long time. Make sure to purchase the large mitt (and small for face) because you&#x27;ll need it! Happy sunless tanning :)</li>
            <li> Initially just turned skin greenish grey. Eventually ( several hours later) had bronzing effect but nothing as a self tanner.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, go for the big 16.9 oz bottle it is a much better deal.  Extremely easy to apply and looks completely natural without streaks or weird colors.</li>
            <li> Provides a quick, natural looking tan.  I used this before I went to Vegas.  It goes on quickly, dries quickly and looks natural.  It&#x27;s easy to see where you&#x27;ve applied the mousse, which is great.  I suggest to either nitrile gloves or the applicator mitt because it will stain your hands before you can wash them.</li>
            <li> This is THE best self tanner I have ever used. No streaks and the tan is very natural looking.</li>
            <li> Works just as described, turns brown instead of orange like other products!</li>
            <li> awesome. best sunless tanner on the market by far</li>
            <li> Goes on like a dark green color, but the results are flawless, after application I use baby powder so I don&#x27;t get streaks, and it drys faster, Hugh bottle and great buy!</li>
            <li> As all tanning/bronzing agents do, the results are very natural. However, like most on the market streaks are inevitable if you aren&#x27;t careful. This does leave a very natural look, unlike many on the market. This doesn&#x27;t make you look orange at all. It gives a true tan, that darkens instantly. Great to use if you need color fast!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried may bronzers over the years and this is by far the best.  Perfect shade - no orange tint - and easy to apply (but I do recommend the small mitts if you&#x27;re just covering the face - the larger mitt for other parts of the body). The large size also lasts a very long time so this makes the price very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I purchase St. Tropez after readung all the reviews online.  It works GREAT!!!!!  Natural tan color....easy to apply... and fast drying!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff . This will last me all year! For the price you can&#x27;t find anything else out there that makes you look tan and not orange. I&#x27;m extremely pale and this stuff gives me the perfect bronze glow, not fake looking!</li>
            <li> Love it.  As promised &amp; fast shipping!</li>
            <li> i usually buy this from Sephora but this is a much better deal. you get way more for the a lesser price. this never makes me orange and the smell is mild. one of my favorite products. i use the mitt to apply the mousse, takes 2-3 minutes to do my entire body.</li>
            <li> I found this to be one of the best self tanner around.  No streaks nice color does not look fake.  Just make sure you where the gloves or the mitt and you put moisturizer on before you start.</li>
            <li> I have to wear rubber gloves so my hands don&#x27;t look dirty. I&#x27;m still getting streaky and smelly! But, I still like a little glow. Can&#x27;t use it too often.</li>
            <li> Great deep color. Goes on smooth, stays on for a few days, and does not leave streaks! Overall awesome product!</li>
            <li> This stuff looks so natural and pretty.  I love it and I threw out all my other self tanning products.</li>
