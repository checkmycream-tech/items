            <li>/&gt;Interesting to note also that Ylang Ylang is one of the ingredients in the pricey perfume, Chanel No. 5, which has been very popular for about 60 years.  </li>
            <li>Antiseptic, aphrodisiac, antidepressant, how much better do you want to feel, this will do you great, burn it  and your house smells awesome.</li>

            <li>Great strong scent, will buy again</li>
            <li>Plant therapy has pure oils for a great price!!</li>
            <li>keep in mind that Ylang Ylang is a very strong smell, it&#x27;s incredibly beautiful and has a floral quality that is incomparable.</li>
            <li>It has a bright, floral aroma that I just love.</li>
            <li>Since it is &amp;#34;sought after&amp;#34; for perfume I thought it would be this amazing scent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just I don&#x27;t like the smell, good side is this time the bottle seals better.</li>
            <li>It should blend nicely.</li>
            <li>Its a nice smell.</li>
            <li>but it is nice in a massage too</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also bought the peppermint and lavender oils from this seller, which are equally as good, and I plan on buying more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super great smell.  </li>
            <li>Nice but not my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love to mix it with lavender and chamomile to make my own relaxing aromatherapy bath salts, of mix with a carrier oil and wear it as a fragrant floral perfume.</li>
            <li>Nice product, came exactly how is shown and has gone great in my massage oil blend.  </li>
            <li>These are great oils, very pure.</li>
            <li>This oil smells nice and has several great uses!</li>
            <li>Plant therapy is one of my favorite essenaital oil companies.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>This has got to be my favorite all time scent.</li>
            <li>I have had others but this seems to be better quality.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with the quality of the oils and would order again.</li>
            <li>but I personally just think it smells awesome and relaxes me.</li>
            <li>I diffuse it more as an air freshner than anything else.</li>
            <li>This has become one of my favorite oils to diffuse in the living room.</li>
            <li>I assume that best smell in any essential oil.  </li>
            <li>The price was fantastic too!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>Also love the scent.</li>
            <li>This is my all-time favorite oil to use in my diffuser at bed time.</li>
            <li>love it and I will order some more</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the blended oil that I purchased (Citrus Burst), so I think that if I make more purchases I&#x27;ll stick to the mixes that Plant Therapy makes.</li>
            <li>love ylang ylang</li>
            <li>I adore Plant Therapy Essential Oils &amp; will never stop raving about how great they are!!!</li>
            <li>Its more a musky/dirty smell.</li>
            <li>Love ylang ylang</li>
            <li>Not my favorite smell, but i need to look up more uses and benefits for this oil.</li>
            <li>It arrived several days after ordering and smelled wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it much yet, but it does smell really good.</li>
            <li>wonderful and can b  put on the&lt;br /&gt;skin&lt;br /&gt;does not even smell like the other oil i use</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like strong floral scents, you won&#x27;t like this.  </li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s okay, I&#x27;ll go back to purchasing from MRH, NAN, and BHH for a more superior oil.</li>
            <li>and I like it fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pleasant enough but more of a citrus scent</li>
            <li>One little drop on the pulse points also make a wonderful perfume!  </li>
            <li>This smells amazing and is very high quality.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy having this in the diffuser in my home.</li>
            <li>I use it in my bath and enjoy it alot.</li>
            <li>some of you might enjoy:</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t familiar with ylang ylang</li>
            <li>I have been a very happy with the essential oils I have purchased so far.</li>
            <li>Great for people who need to control high blood pressure naturally.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say enough good things about this company.</li>
            <li>Ylang Ylang has a intensely sweet, heady floral scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received the ylang ylang eo quickly and unharmed.</li>
            <li>Just as described and quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>quick recipe</li>
            <li>Plant Therapy is a reputable company that sells high quality oils.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the aroma of the ylang ylang essential oil.</li>
            <li>Not as floral as I expected which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>and this bottle was no disappointment.</li>
            <li>My Ylang Ylang from another generic company smells nice.  </li>
            <li>was surprised to be able to find everything in one place...</li>
            <li>Arrived in good time and was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>To me, this bottle of Ylang Ylang from Plant Therapy was sweet euphoria right out of the bottle~and much cheaper than Chanel No. 5.  </li>
            <li>Properly using essential oils are a great way for people to maintain their health using the bounties of mother nature.</li>
            <li>Ylang Ylang itself has a strong scent of wild flowers - -</li>
            <li>I have ordered other oils also from Plant Therapy and have been very satisfied, will buy again.</li>
            <li>I use this when I take bath and very very relaxing.</li>
            <li>I first starte using oils.</li>
            <li>Makes my home remedy hair conditioner( yogurt, coconut oil, aloe vera) smell pretty.</li>
            <li>I love essential oils and have been waiting to buy this one.</li>
            <li>Love them...will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>Love Plant Therapy essential oils.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave 4 stars is b/c of this not being my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>I am totally satisfied with the quality of this essential oil.  </li>
            <li>, I personally don&#x27;t use it in the bath because it&#x27;s an oil I love</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can read more about using essential oils here</li>
            <li>I am new to essential oils, and to be fair, perhaps I&#x27;m just not yet comfortable with the strength of the individual scents like the Ylang Ylang.</li>
            <li>As for it being open, I&#x27;m willing to forgive that since Amazon has such a good returns policy.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality and the price is right.</li>
            <li>use to 100% pure therepudic oils&lt;br /&gt;smell</li>
            <li>Tried this in my diffuser and it creates a beautiful aroma and a very calming atmosphere, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>However this product blended with others seems to not bother me as much.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>After much research I have made Plant Therapy</li>
            <li>/&gt;Plant Therapy Essential Oils company has been attentive and has followed up on my orders.</li>
            <li>I really didnt like this product.</li>
            <li>I still have moments when it&#x27;s a bit much</li>
            <li>Product was received in a timely matter and it was a really quality oil.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Plant therapy oils are high quality, reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>While not my favorite essential oil because it needs to be used sparingly so as not to cause a headache, if used in the proper dose can be very relaxing.</li>
            <li>I have ordered three different essential oils from this retailer and I am completely satisfied with all of them.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more essential oils from Plant Therapy!!!</li>
            <li>This is my very first try with an essential oil, so testing the waters.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As always with Plant Therapy oils, it is high quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>However, for those of you that do, I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>As some of the other reviewers have noted, much of whether you enjoy this product or not rests on your opinion of ylang-ylang.  </li>
            <li>b/c all the other PT EO&#x27;s I have seem to be top quality as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>I normally mix my oils up</li>
            <li>I have to be honest and say, I have used it only a few times but it seems to be working</li>
            <li>I received the first four today, and it was a mixed bag...</li>
            <li>I really like this Ylang Ylang essential oil.  </li>
            <li>Using product to blend with a natural home made hair gel.</li>
            <li>natural floral scent but</li>
            <li>Ylang Ylang Complete is most commonly known as an aphrodisiac.</li>
            <li>Pure oil that lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to essential oils and want them for room fragrance.</li>
            <li>Very similar to my (yl) ylang-ylang only much much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Essential oils do different things to people, but for me this one was very soothing and relaxing.</li>
            <li>I just use a drop at temples and behind ears before I head out to work, and I feel so much more centered.  </li>
            <li>well with:  Bergamot, Black pepper, Cedarwood (all types), Copaiba balsam, Geranium, Grapefruit, Jasmine absolute, Mandarin, Neroli, Peppermint, Petitgrain, Sandalwood,</li>

            <li> Plant Therapy is a reputable company that sells high quality oils.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the aroma of the ylang ylang essential oil.</li>
            <li> Not as floral as I expected which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> and this bottle was no disappointment.</li>
            <li> My Ylang Ylang from another generic company smells nice.  </li>
            <li> was surprised to be able to find everything in one place...</li>
            <li> Arrived in good time and was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> To me, this bottle of Ylang Ylang from Plant Therapy was sweet euphoria right out of the bottle~and much cheaper than Chanel No. 5.  </li>
            <li> Properly using essential oils are a great way for people to maintain their health using the bounties of mother nature.</li>
            <li> Ylang Ylang itself has a strong scent of wild flowers - -</li>
            <li> I have ordered other oils also from Plant Therapy and have been very satisfied, will buy again.</li>
            <li> I use this when I take bath and very very relaxing.</li>
            <li> I first starte using oils.</li>
            <li> Makes my home remedy hair conditioner( yogurt, coconut oil, aloe vera) smell pretty.</li>
            <li> I love essential oils and have been waiting to buy this one.</li>
            <li> Love them...will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Love Plant Therapy essential oils.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave 4 stars is b/c of this not being my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> I am totally satisfied with the quality of this essential oil.  </li>
            <li> , I personally don&#x27;t use it in the bath because it&#x27;s an oil I love</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can read more about using essential oils here</li>
            <li> I am new to essential oils, and to be fair, perhaps I&#x27;m just not yet comfortable with the strength of the individual scents like the Ylang Ylang.</li>
            <li> As for it being open, I&#x27;m willing to forgive that since Amazon has such a good returns policy.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality and the price is right.</li>
            <li> use to 100% pure therepudic oils&lt;br /&gt;smell</li>
            <li> Tried this in my diffuser and it creates a beautiful aroma and a very calming atmosphere, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> However this product blended with others seems to not bother me as much.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> After much research I have made Plant Therapy</li>
            <li> /&gt;Plant Therapy Essential Oils company has been attentive and has followed up on my orders.</li>
            <li> I really didnt like this product.</li>
            <li> I still have moments when it&#x27;s a bit much</li>
            <li> Product was received in a timely matter and it was a really quality oil.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Plant therapy oils are high quality, reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> While not my favorite essential oil because it needs to be used sparingly so as not to cause a headache, if used in the proper dose can be very relaxing.</li>
            <li> I have ordered three different essential oils from this retailer and I am completely satisfied with all of them.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more essential oils from Plant Therapy!!!</li>
            <li> This is my very first try with an essential oil, so testing the waters.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As always with Plant Therapy oils, it is high quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> However, for those of you that do, I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> As some of the other reviewers have noted, much of whether you enjoy this product or not rests on your opinion of ylang-ylang.  </li>
            <li> b/c all the other PT EO&#x27;s I have seem to be top quality as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> I normally mix my oils up</li>
            <li> I have to be honest and say, I have used it only a few times but it seems to be working</li>
            <li> I received the first four today, and it was a mixed bag...</li>
            <li> I really like this Ylang Ylang essential oil.  </li>
            <li> Using product to blend with a natural home made hair gel.</li>
            <li> natural floral scent but</li>
            <li> Ylang Ylang Complete is most commonly known as an aphrodisiac.</li>
            <li> Pure oil that lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to essential oils and want them for room fragrance.</li>
            <li> Very similar to my (yl) ylang-ylang only much much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Essential oils do different things to people, but for me this one was very soothing and relaxing.</li>
            <li> I just use a drop at temples and behind ears before I head out to work, and I feel so much more centered.  </li>
            <li> well with:  Bergamot, Black pepper, Cedarwood (all types), Copaiba balsam, Geranium, Grapefruit, Jasmine absolute, Mandarin, Neroli, Peppermint, Petitgrain, Sandalwood,</li>
            <li> Not only do I use it with the horses I care for (who really like it), I also use it for myself when I&#x27;m feeling anxious.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t help much with mood :/</li>
            <li> mix 5 drops of this essential oil (add 1 or 2 of lavender if you have it) with half an ounce of almond or jojoba oil.  </li>
            <li> a few drops of essential oil and a diffuser.</li>
            <li> Came as expected.</li>
            <li> It came as expected.</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s lasted longer than I expected it to each time.  </li>
            <li> The bottle doesn&#x27;t seem to dispense correctly but other than that all is well.</li>
            <li> I mix it with Patchouli sometimes other things</li>
            <li> i use this sometimes with other oils in baths.</li>
            <li> I have to disagree with the previous reviews.</li>
            <li> A little goes along way.</li>
            <li> this oil bears little resemblance to it.</li>
            <li> Ylang ylang and I have not always agreed in the past.</li>
            <li> but, in small quantities it does the trick.</li>
            <li> I usually like this companies oils, but the Ylang Ylang stinketh.  </li>
            <li> I wonder if Plant Therapy&#x27;s is old or a bad batch or something.</li>
            <li> I have some floral allergies, so going slowly.</li>
            <li> Horrible smell and sent does not last long.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately yilang yilang gives me a migraine.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but I just don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> It also happened to smell terrible; it had an almost caustic aroma.</li>
            <li> It is uplifting and helps a lot of anxiety or any sort of grief.</li>

            <li> Antiseptic, aphrodisiac, antidepressant, how much better do you want to feel, this will do you great, burn it  and your house smells awesome.</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this company. I would give it a 10! Great products &amp; customer service you could ever ask for. Will buy again &amp; again.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately yilang yilang gives me a migraine. I I&#x27;d not know this she I first starte using oils. But it does that for a lot of people. Especially if you&#x27;re probe to migraines. However this product blended with others seems to not bother me as much. Plant therapy is one of my favorite essenaital oil companies. They are affordable and good quality.</li>
            <li> Good concentrated oil</li>
            <li> Nice but not my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> The bottle doesn&#x27;t seem to dispense correctly but other than that all is well. But the product seems to do the job. Thanks</li>
            <li> Great oil! Very similar to my (yl) ylang-ylang only much much cheaper.</li>
            <li> This oil is immediately uplifting and the fragrance is simply wonderful - love it!</li>
            <li> Very happy with my oil!</li>
            <li> Excellent value for the money paid. Pure oil that lasts for a long time. Product arrived quickly and I was very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Multiply use EO. Either around the house, blended with others for an oil diffuser, or diluted for personal scent. This is my favorite scent. The quality is superb.</li>
            <li> This has got to be my favorite all time scent. It is uplifting and helps a lot of anxiety or any sort of grief. Plant therapy&#x27;s ylang ylang of the highest quality and comparable to leading essential oil brands.</li>
            <li> I really like this Ylang Ylang essential oil.  I have had others but this seems to be better quality.  Plant Therapy is a reputable company that sells high quality oils.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the quality of the oils and would order again.</li>
            <li> While not my favorite essential oil because it needs to be used sparingly so as not to cause a headache, if used in the proper dose can be very relaxing.</li>
            <li> Makes my home remedy hair conditioner( yogurt, coconut oil, aloe vera) smell pretty. I add a drop to my unscented lotion (then I won&#x27;t need to spray perfume on). Will use this scent in my car diffuser.</li>
            <li> Nice product, came exactly how is shown and has gone great in my massage oil blend.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Essential oils do different things to people, but for me this one was very soothing and relaxing. I guess it is an aphrodisiac but I personally just think it smells awesome and relaxes me.</li>
            <li> I love essential oils and have been waiting to buy this one. So happy it is in my collection.</li>
            <li> Smells great. A little goes along way. I diffuse it more as an air freshner than anything else. It doesn&#x27;t help much with mood :/</li>
            <li> I use this diluted in coconut oil and massage into my abdomen during my cycle. It is amazing the difference it makes for my crams and PMS!</li>
            <li> I wanted to save money, so I thought I&#x27;d try this brand.  While it&#x27;s okay, I&#x27;ll go back to purchasing from MRH, NAN, and BHH for a more superior oil.</li>
            <li> This has become one of my favorite oils to diffuse in the living room. It has a bright, floral aroma that I just love. I have already ordered a second bottle so that I will not be without!</li>
            <li> Plant therapy oils are high quality, reasonable cost. Love them...will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it is supposed to boost mood. I really enjoy having this in the diffuser in my home. It is very pleasant and I believe it promotes cheeriness and peace.</li>
            <li> Super great smell.  I assume that best smell in any essential oil.  I use this when I take bath and very very relaxing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just I don&#x27;t like the smell, good side is this time the bottle seals better.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using essential oils again for my health and well being.  A wonderful oil  to use in handmade creams and lotions and to diffuse.  One little drop on the pulse points also make a wonderful perfume!  The price was fantastic too!  I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Not as floral as I expected which is a good thing. Since it is &amp;#34;sought after&amp;#34; for perfume I thought it would be this amazing scent but to me it&#x27;s just ok. Look forward to using it to experiment with my oil concoctions. It should blend nicely.</li>
            <li> Good blending product. Like it with lavender and rosemary. Its a nice smell. Using it in my hair and deod​orant.</li>
            <li> Smells great. I mix it with Patchouli sometimes other things and it is wonderful mood setting experience. I would try it if you haven&#x27;t before. Almond oil a few drops of essential oil and a diffuser.</li>
            <li> this has a wonderful fragrance, very sweet and calming. As always with Plant Therapy oils, it is high quality. I will continue to purchase from this company</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this stuff works, but it does.  I just use a drop at temples and behind ears before I head out to work, and I feel so much more centered.  Also love the scent.</li>
            <li> These are great quality oils at a great price. This company does a lot of testing to guarantee the quality of their oils. I have researched extensively to decide which oils to use and I trust this company.</li>
            <li> Quality oil i&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite oil to use in my diffuser at bed time. This is a high quality and the price is right.</li>

I have yet to put it in anything yet but I&#x27;m looking forward to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plant Therapy Essential Oils company has been attentive and has followed up on my orders.

            <li> I was very pleased with the aroma of the ylang ylang essential oil. I use it in my bath and enjoy it alot.</li>
            <li> use to 100% pure therepudic oils&lt;br /&gt;smell wonderful and can b  put on the&lt;br /&gt;skin&lt;br /&gt;does not even smell like the other oil i use</li>
            <li> Just as described and quick delivery.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Great smell...seems to be a good e &amp; o</li>
            <li> I have to be honest and say, I have used it only a few times but it seems to be working and I like it fine. This is my very first try with an essential oil, so testing the waters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ylang Ylang itself has a strong scent of wild flowers - - that&#x27;s how I describe it. I have some floral allergies, so going slowly.</li>
            <li> I did not know what this was supposed to smell like b/c I&#x27;d never had any before. While the smell is pleasant, it isn&#x27;t my favorite, but  I feel the quality is very good b/c all the other PT EO&#x27;s I have seem to be top quality as far as I can tell. The only reason I gave 4 stars is b/c of this not being my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant and mixes beautifully with jojoba for my home made blends.  I will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> I really didnt like this product. It wasn&#x27;t what I thought it was gonna b. I normally mix my oils up but this one did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I have ordered three different essential oils from this retailer and I am completely satisfied with all of them. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I am totally satisfied with the quality of this essential oil.  Not only do I use it with the horses I care for (who really like it), I also use it for myself when I&#x27;m feeling anxious.  I will definitely buy more essential oils from Plant Therapy!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered five oils from this company. I received the first four today, and it was a mixed bag...The Ylang Ylang oil arrived with the seal already opened (my Lemongrass oil had the same issue), which concerns me from a safety/hygiene perspective, so I returned it. It also happened to smell terrible; it had an almost caustic aroma. I was pleased with the blended oil that I purchased (Citrus Burst), so I think that if I make more purchases I&#x27;ll stick to the mixes that Plant Therapy makes. I am new to essential oils, and to be fair, perhaps I&#x27;m just not yet comfortable with the strength of the individual scents like the Ylang Ylang. As for it being open, I&#x27;m willing to forgive that since Amazon has such a good returns policy.</li>
            <li> Ylang ylang and I have not always agreed in the past. I wanted it for a blend for my hair as well as to diffuse. I still have moments when it&#x27;s a bit much but, in small quantities it does the trick.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it much yet, but it does smell really good. It arrived earlier than anticipated which is always a plus</li>
            <li> I have been a very happy with the essential oils I have purchased so far. This one is no exception. Great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil to add to my shampoo for hair growth. Also to help with insomnia. Plant therapy has pure oils for a great price!!</li>
            <li> keep in mind that Ylang Ylang is a very strong smell, it&#x27;s incredibly beautiful and has a floral quality that is incomparable.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Botanical Name: Cananga odorata&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Origin: Madagascar&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extraction Method: Steam distilled&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plant Part: Flowers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strength of Aroma: Medium&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aromatic Scent: Ylang Ylang has a intensely sweet, heady floral scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blends well with:  Bergamot, Black pepper, Cedarwood (all types), Copaiba balsam, Geranium, Grapefruit, Jasmine absolute, Mandarin, Neroli, Peppermint, Petitgrain, Sandalwood, Vetiver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggested Uses: Ylang Ylang Complete is most commonly known as an aphrodisiac. When diffused it can help reduce stress, depression and anxiety, and help uplift mood. Add to a carrier oil for a romantic massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cautions: Possible skin sensitization. We recommend a maximum dilution of 0.8% for topical applications. &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love ylang ylang and this bottle was no disappointment. If you aren&#x27;t familiar with ylang ylang it is a floral scent I use it in blends but it is nice in a massage too, I personally don&#x27;t use it in the bath because it&#x27;s an oil I love and I don&#x27;t want sensitization to occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can read more about using essential oils here&lt;br /&gt;http://www.learningabouteos.com/</li>
            <li> I use several oils from this company and have used oils all of my life. These are great oils, very pure. I have to disagree with the previous reviews. This oil smells nice and has several great uses!</li>
            <li> This is an AWESOME quality oil for the price. The smell is intoxicating! I love to mix it with lavender and chamomile to make my own relaxing aromatherapy bath salts, of mix with a carrier oil and wear it as a fragrant floral perfume. It&#x27;s so versatile! I adore Plant Therapy Essential Oils &amp; will never stop raving about how great they are!!!</li>
            <li> This smells amazing and is very high quality.</li>
            <li> Great strong scent, will buy again</li>
            <li> Arrived in good time and was exactly what I expected.  I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> It came as expected. well pleased with product!</li>
            <li> Using product to blend with a natural home made hair gel. Smells great.</li>
            <li> I was told this was to add fragrance to soaps and lotions. No thanks. Its not a floral smell as I was expecting. Its more a musky/dirty smell. Something I dont want on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to essential oils and want them for room fragrance. Love ylang ylang natural floral scent but this oil bears little resemblance to it. It&#x27;s pleasant enough but more of a citrus scent</li>
            <li> Loving my oils and family loves them too!</li>
            <li> Horrible smell and sent does not last long.</li>
            <li> packaged well, and with bubble wrap to ensure intact. i use this sometimes with other oils in baths. Not my favorite smell, but i need to look up more uses and benefits for this oil. Still learning.</li>
            <li> Product was received in a timely matter and it was a really quality oil. Thanks</li>
            <li> I usually like this companies oils, but the Ylang Ylang stinketh.  It works though, if you can get over the smell.  My Ylang Ylang from another generic company smells nice.  I wonder if Plant Therapy&#x27;s is old or a bad batch or something.</li>
            <li> I have read in several aromatherapy books that Ylang Ylang is an essential oil that a person is either drawn to or not.  This seems to be the case just from reading the reviews here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interesting to note also that Ylang Ylang is one of the ingredients in the pricey perfume, Chanel No. 5, which has been very popular for about 60 years.  To me, this bottle of Ylang Ylang from Plant Therapy was sweet euphoria right out of the bottle~and much cheaper than Chanel No. 5.  It also made my tension headache go away instantly!  I have ordered other oils also from Plant Therapy and have been very satisfied, will buy again.</li>
            <li> will recommend this site to friends and family to order products. was surprised to be able to find everything in one place...that was really great.</li>
            <li> As some of the other reviewers have noted, much of whether you enjoy this product or not rests on your opinion of ylang-ylang.  If you don&#x27;t like strong floral scents, you won&#x27;t like this.  However, for those of you that do, I highly recommend this product.  It arrived several days after ordering and smelled wonderful.  I&#x27;ve tried it several different ways (as a linen mist, a bath oil, in an oil burner) and it&#x27;s lasted longer than I expected it to each time.  I&#x27;ve also bought the peppermint and lavender oils from this seller, which are equally as good, and I plan on buying more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quick recipe some of you might enjoy: mix 5 drops of this essential oil (add 1 or 2 of lavender if you have it) with half an ounce of almond or jojoba oil.  Shake well and add to your bathwater.  Fragrant and relaxing.</li>
