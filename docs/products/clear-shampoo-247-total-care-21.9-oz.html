    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>so I&#x27;m very happy that amazon carries it.</li>
            <li>I use it with a leave-in treatment and am very happy with the results I have gotten.</li>
            <li>and it advertises that you see the best results by using both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s probably the BEST smelling shampoo i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The best shampoo I ever tried!</li>
            <li>Great!</li>
            <li>Best choice I ever made!</li>
            <li>I have been using it with the volumizing conditioner, and my hair looks great!!</li>
            <li>It is wonderful to find an inexpensive shampoo that does what it says!  </li>
            <li>It smelled awesome, but that&#x27;s not what my mailbox is supposed to smell like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not convinced that it&#x27;s the best online purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve added it to my list of products to look for when comparing best price on shampoo.</li>
            <li>The scent is very nice too!</li>
            <li>This shampoo is very good.</li>
            <li>I always get complements for smelling good because of this!</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful lather and smells so good.</li>
            <li>Very pleased!</li>
            <li>Works great and smells great too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Makes hair smell great even through blow drying and styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product is working great.  </li>
            <li>LOL.</li>
            <li>The price is great.</li>
            <li>Plus it works great on dandruff</li>
            <li>Tried this shampoo and it is very effective in clearing dandruff.  </li>
            <li>; it works Great but doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance you would consider pleasant.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is amazing!</li>
            <li>I like this product line because the company has done a good job of creating a product that is pleasant to use without being overbearing about trying to endear itself to you.</li>
            <li>Smells good on the hair, too.</li>
            <li>I save the coupons for the conditioner (not dandruff) which is just as good, but easier to find.</li>
            <li>Good to find this product as stores are no longer carrying it.</li>
            <li>This shampoo does a good job at cleansing the hair.</li>
            <li>Amazon does a good job of taping them up in an effort to prevent anything from spilling out.</li>
            <li>Smells so good</li>
            <li>Works good on dandruff.</li>
            <li>Smells soooooo good too.</li>
            <li>It smells good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a good anti-dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li>it smells good, but i still have dandruff.  </li>
            <li>For a dandruff shampoo, it is mild and has a pleasant smell, an issue with the best shampoos out there like tar based ones.  </li>
            <li>Like we all need more shampoo brands/varieties, but this one is a good one!</li>
            <li>It also smells good and it looks great; my hair is shinier for sure.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent and nice packaging.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>This product seems to work almost, but not quite, as good and has a much more pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>and I love how it makes my hair look and feel after washing with it!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have that dandruff shampoo smell but works effectively.</li>
            <li>Really works and smells great too!!</li>
            <li>The bottle is a nice shape and can be turned over so you can get all of the product out.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo smells really nice</li>
            <li>, and it works about as effectively -- which is not at all for me.</li>
            <li>I believe it would be a good choice for most people.  </li>
            <li>As for applying, it is nice.</li>
            <li>It seems to do the job of cleaning my hair and leaving it nice without any residue.</li>
            <li>This shampoo comes in a nicely designed bottle.</li>
            <li>so effective.</li>
            <li>Zinc pyrithione is regarded as an effective treatment against dandruff.  </li>
            <li>As a person who has struggled to find the perfect dandruff shampoo, I&#x27;m pretty sure the search is over.</li>
            <li>Very surprised, very happy!</li>
            <li>This is so clean smelling and cleans your hair so nice!</li>
            <li>So far, the best anti-dandruff shampoo that I tried.  </li>
            <li>So far this is the best that I have found.  </li>
            <li>The Clear Scalp dandruff shampoo has worked great!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a new product that will be the latest and greatest</li>
            <li>With so many of the dandruff shampoos having an offensive odor, I was glad to see this one smells nice.  </li>
            <li>To be fair, I do not have dandruff, but mild psoriasis.</li>
            <li>It does have a mild scent and seems to do a good job on my hair.</li>
            <li>But after reading the reviews I cannot believe that there are so many people that are having this issue and these products remain on the market.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I bought the shampoo because I wanted another subscribe and save for the 15% off, and needed more shampoo anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It turns out that the more I used it, the better my scalp felt.</li>
            <li>So love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>, while I love the shampoo, the conditioner for me leaves a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li>literally magic.</li>
            <li>but i love it.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still working its magic.</li>
            <li>lather is phenomenal ...</li>
            <li>some of the best later I have ever encountered.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It was a shame that I could not find it in the stores anymore, but I am glad that I was able to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The way this shampoo works reminds me of Head and Shoulders, just in a more feminine bottle and with a more appealing fragrance.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Gets the job done, but it makes my hair feel more oily...</li>
            <li>Most dandruff shampoos have a medicinal smell that&#x27;s off-putting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with dandruff for many, many years</li>
            <li>It does, however, smell much better than most dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li>It also isn&#x27;t overpowering like many products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>liked it very much, works for me, smell is nice as well.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>Even though I don&#x27;t have flakes anymore I will continue to purchase it and use it a couple times a week because it does a nice job getting my hair and scalp clean.</li>
            <li>It just gets you nice and clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise it is a pretty good shampoo</li>
            <li>This Clear Anti-Dandruff Shampoo works well at controlling dandruff, leaves hair feeling clean, and has a very pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>The scent is also great - fresh, clean, almost like the original Herbal Essence scent.</li>
            <li>It is fine, but not any better than Head and shoulders.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a pleasant scent and did a good job of getting rid of the flakes my dry scalp produces.  </li>
            <li>As far as I am concerned that is working great.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my hair feeling soft and shiny and smelling great.</li>
            <li>course I cannot say that this will ring true for everyone, but if you are at the end of your rope with nothing to lose, go ahead and give this a try!</li>
            <li>It has helps keep my scalp clean and healthy.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers up well and rinses easily and thoroughly from the hair.</li>
            <li>On days that I needed to dry and style my hair, I used the shampoo and the matching conditioner with very good results.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have dandruff, but figured - fine</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s fine for me or</li>
            <li>Like the Clear brand conditioners that I have tried, this shampoo is lightly scented and the scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li>Every time I took a bath there was a huge pile of hair in the drain.</li>
            <li>Fantastic budget shampoo.</li>
            <li>They also list animal testing or animal testing free information, if that is known.</li>
            <li>free smelling good soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li>why it&#x27;s so cheap</li>
            <li>It also smelled better than most of H&amp;S&#x27;s variety, though my friend has thicker hair and thus she found she had to use more of the product in order to achieve the results she wanted (and thus it lasted a far shorter amount of time than is</li>
            <li>It also rinses out very quickly and leaves the hair squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>I stumbled upon this shampoo by accident because the store was having a sale, buy the shampoo and get the conditioner free.</li>
            <li>I do not get that gritty dullness to my hair that some dandruff shampoos leave, and the smell is great.  </li>
            <li>Clear Scalp and Hair Therapy Complete Care is absolutely perfect!</li>
            <li>My scalp was clean, light, and not itchy.</li>
            <li>My hair looks so clean, bouncy and dandruff free.</li>
            <li>This shampoo really doesn&#x27;t smell pleasant, it smells very chemically to me.</li>
            <li>This shampoo cleared my dandruff, and it actually smells nice!  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got dandruff please try it, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s salon quality at $5 &amp; I have seen significant improvement in my scalp.</li>
            <li>Okay, I bought this at the drugstore first, but I have ordered it off Amazon when I needed it and was pacing an order anyway.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I often used Head and Shoulders because it worked for the dandruff, but it didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling clean the way I wanted it to.</li>
            <li>My hair feels and looks clean, and I haven&#x27;t felt the urge to itch my scalp at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clean fragrance</li>
            <li>I have needed to use a dandruff shampoo for a long time, they have never been very effective over a span of time.</li>
            <li>Also seems like a good price compared to similar products.</li>
            <li>It has really changed my hair for the better.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find a scalp shampoo with a nice smell.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li>but it was so cheap it was worth a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i will stick with it for longer, just to make sure that it really doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>If zinc pyrithione has worked for you in the past, but you want to try a nice smelling shampoo that leaves your hair looking good, this may be for you.</li>
            <li>Smells great, unlike other dandruff shampoos</li>
            <li>The scent of this shampoo is really nice and it has good soaping power in hard water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair and scalp felt clean and fresh afterwards.</li>
            <li>Again, this allows for the scalp to be fully covered in the product.&lt;br /&gt;-It washes clean and leaves the hair feeling fresh ...</li>
            <li>I thought the scent was mild and the shampoo lathered and rinsed off well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a white, creamy shampoo with a nice light scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Actually feels like a normal shampoo consistency and lathers so much more than Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
            <li>While the fragrance is nice, it doesn&#x27;t really stick with your hair the way a normal perfumed shampoo would.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the  Dry Scalp Shampoo and Conditioner</li>
            <li>It is good for dry scalps, but without making your scalp oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>moisturizing, yet still safe for oily scalps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has restored my damaged hair to a very soft and manageable state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>one scent available for dandruff control for women, but I do not find this to be too much of an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not glamorous and certainly isn&#x27;t as fun as the salon shampoos I&#x27;d prefer to buy, but it&#x27;s treated my scalp well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one, by far, is my favorite.</li>
            <li>but maybe it works better in a soft water environment</li>
            <li>It was a success after just one wash.</li>
            <li>So, I rarely have issues with dandruff.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth a $5 experiment.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While I have personally not found Head and Shoulders to be very effective, if it works for you, the Clear shampoo should also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I see other people love this too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The itching seemed to stop right away.</li>
            <li>Seems like a pretty good antidandruff shampoo ... and is generally the right type  .. keeps hair soft also...</li>
            <li>So while it is a good shampoo, something about how these bottles are designed causes them to be more likely than other brands to leak during shipping.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shampoo, cleans well and makes the scalp fresh for several days.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is very much like the others from this company in that it is an anti-dandruff shampoo</li>
            <li>i love this shampoo, it&#x27;s the only one i will ever use.</li>
            <li>My daughters love this shampoo -- it is the only one they will use!</li>
            <li>For most of the time since then, I have used different products in the search for relief.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried more than one conditioner in their line and had the same experience with both.  </li>
            <li>Recommended in a magazine article in First Magazine.  </li>
            <li>Tried every shampoo under the sun to stop the flaking, came across Clear Scalp &amp; Hair (the light blue color code) and it was like magic after the first use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if my flakes have become more resistant or if the conditioner added the extra my head needed (I&#x27;m on the hunt).</li>
            <li>However, once I applied it to my hair, I instantly understood why it was thinner than most shampoos.</li>
            <li>I cannot rate it as excellent because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see how it will actually control my issues, but I would say that this shampoo is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>With in the first week of using this shampoo, the dandruff disappeared.</li>
            <li>My wife and daughter have tested several of the Clear varieties of the shampoos and, for the most part, have been pleased with the results when compared to our normal brand, Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li>This one not only helps my scalp but my hair remains shinning and healthy looking as well.</li>
            <li>After the first use, I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>You definitely have to make sure you rinse</li>
            <li>I tried many shampoos, even prescription ones that would help, but not totally alleviate the problem.  </li>
            <li>And my scalp had never itched so much in my life!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have dandruff or any particular hair/scalp issues I&#x27;ve been aware of, but I&#x27;m starting to wonder if my &#x27;normal&#x27; wasn&#x27;t so normal, because I&#x27;ve never been able to have my hair smell so good for so long or feel so clean in-between washings.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo has a nice clean fragrance and makes a lot of lather using a small amount.  </li>
            <li>I suffer from occassional mild dandruff, and this product is respectable in its place among other anti-dandruff shampoos.  </li>
            <li>Wish me luck in my findings for a clear and clean scalp.</li>
            <li>The itching stopped and it made my hair feel so soft and really clean.</li>
            <li>This product is one that pretty much anyone in your house can use.</li>
            <li>After trying so many products for dandruff and very itchy scalp like Selsun, head and shoulders and Proactiv shampoo I found that after just one use Clear Scalp and Hair Therapy Complete Care really helped me out.</li>
            <li>I suffer from extremely dry scalp and this works even better than Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li>I have tried clear shampoo for dry damaged hair and I really liked it.</li>
            <li>I have very short, fine, highlighted but growing out hair.</li>
            <li>Now I know not everyone likes the other Clear hair products, but as of yet I&#x27;ve been very pleased with their selection of shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, not only it cleared my dandruff, it also leaved hair soft!</li>
            <li>and I will be honest that I see little result from using any of the OTC shampoos that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>actually saw a difference THE VERY FIRST TIME!</li>
            <li>My hair gets really greasy fast using this.</li>
            <li>really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, all of the Clear products I have tried have had a mild clean scent and seem to work well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very floral and not that</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not the type of person to write reviews, but I had to hop on my husbands account and tell you how much I ADORE this</li>
            <li>I see the light blue label, my night in shining armor.</li>
            <li>I have psoriasis and it really helped to reduce the plaques on my scalp.</li>
            <li>and I really think it helps.</li>
            <li>however I really do think that it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s become very frizzy, damaged</li>
            <li>I realize that packaging and shipping shouldn&#x27;t really be part of the product review, but I have to point out that this product really didn&#x27;t ship well.</li>
            <li>Over-the-counter products used sporadically whenever I have an outbreak are all I really need to keep my dandruff under control.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast .</li>
            <li>It left my hair shiny, soft, dandruff free and smelling heavenly!</li>
            <li>If nothing else, it&#x27;s worth the low price to give it a try, right?</li>
            <li>It’s actually better than the other shampoo I was using</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers of this product, I had embarrassing flakes and itching for many years.  </li>
            <li>While this smells way, way better than Head &amp; Shoulders in my opinion, I think it&#x27;s a little less effective.</li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m using T-Gel and then using the Clear Scalp and still have a decent amount of flakes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a decent dandruff shampoo that works well and is reasonably prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a general shampoo it is a step up from Head &amp; Shoulders -- my hair felt healthier overall, with good body but no major build-up -- but given that the dandruff component doesn&#x27;t work at all for me, I might as well be using [[ASIN:B007RTR898</li>
            <li>Head &amp; Shoulders Classic Clean Dandruff Shampoo with Pump 33.8 Fluid ounce]]</li>
            <li>She hasn&#x27;t been having any problems with a dry scalp and she likes this shampoo far better than some of the others I&#x27;ve bought for her to help with the dandruff.</li>
            <li>This typically seems to run at a higher price in the stores around us, but also seems to be on sale far more often.</li>
            <li>It looks much better than the standard Selsun Blue or Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
            <li>Takes a few shampoos for the flakes to completely disappear but the itching was better after the first wash.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t the only one that had done exactly that!</li>
            <li>I tend to have problems with products drying my hair out, but this left it soft and clean without stripping it.  </li>
            <li>Nearly the whole time I have used Dawn Dish Detergent in my hair because nothing I was using would keep the oily look and feel out.</li>
            <li>But, the one thing I did notice by using the CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR shampoo was that my hair seemed much smoother, softer, and over all nicer.  </li>
            <li>It has caused my scalp to become unbearably oily with normal shampoos.</li>
            <li>The consistency of the shampoo is medium to slightly thick and it smells quite nice but not over whelming.  </li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo because I get occasional flakiness in the winter and was experiencing hair loss to the point where I had could see through the hair right to the scalp.</li>
            <li>This was a new one I hadn’t tried yet</li>
            <li>, got a new dermatologist (mine moved)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a huge dandruff problem, I just don&#x27;t want any visible flakes when I wear dark clothing.</li>
            <li>Clear please do not stop making it!</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t find this exact same one at the stores</li>
            <li>like this shampoo and am willing to try the one for color treated hair next.</li>
            <li>The only negative I have for this is the smell is not bad, but strong (but I am very sensitive to smells).  </li>
            <li>This works fairly well, so much so that I can wear black outfits, and see very few flakes and infrequently.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Clear Scalp Anti Dandruff pretty regularly now (washing my hair 3-4 times a week) and it has helped but not like before.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference with my scalp within a few days, but the quality of my hair changed dramatically very quickly.  </li>
            <li>and I usually have the most dandruff near my forehead.</li>
            <li>the version for men (the slate grey bottle), this shampoo has a pleasant and subtle scent.</li>
            <li>Tried one more time and almost cried with what I felt trickling down my back and legs in the shower</li>
            <li>After the first use of this shampoo, my flakes were less and itchiness very much improved.  </li>
            <li>Will probably go back to what I was using before after this bottle&#x27;s used up - cheaper, smells nicer, does pretty much the same job.</li>
            <li>Because it is so mild, it can be used every day or every other day which is not the case with tar based shampoos.</li>
            <li>I also use a different conditioner in the end for improved scent and feel, as well as other benefits its not that it has a strong medicinal smell</li>
            <li>This is one of two Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Therapy shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it every couple days now that i&#x27;m clear and that seems to work well</li>
            <li>I use Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Therapy Anti-Dandruss Shampoo and two of my granddaughters</li>
            <li>For reference, I have baby fine, long and wavy hair which tends to get dry ends.</li>
            <li>and I suffer for at minimum a month trying to clear the outbreak.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway</li>
            <li>So, if you benefit from the zinc based dandruff shampoos and are looking for something that leaves your hair looking nicer than the rest, I would recommend the Clear brand.  </li>
            <li>I suggest you do the same and try to advocate to keep producing this this product because it REALLY works.</li>
            <li>not irritate my scalp or cause any rashes on any part of my (sensitive) skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft and silky as what I am used to and at times, it&#x27;s made me feel like I forgot to use conditioner at all.</li>
            <li>Both Pantene and a macadamia oil conditioner left my hair MUCH softer and closer to what I would expect.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t break my scalp out.</li>
            <li>Ended up with the Teal Complete Care.</li>
            <li>I think you will be happily surprised.</li>
            <li>So far I have seen about a 70 percent reduction in dandruff.</li>
            <li>As an adult, I have used dandruff shampoos to treat it.</li>
            <li>This Clear shampoo says it is nourishing, anti-dandruff, complete care.</li>
            <li>No need for a conditioner, leaves my hair soft.  </li>
            <li>The most commonly known shampoo with this anti-dandruff ingredient is probably Head and Shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>shampoo smells much nicer than Head and Shoulders, and left my hair looking and feeling cleaner; Head and Shoulders often made my hair feel \\&quot;oily\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>if you scalp burns like fire for a good 20 minutes after getting out of the shower, it&#x27;s not a good thing!!!!!</li>
            <li>The shampoo also gives volume to my fine curly short hair, an added benefit that I am struggling to find with other shampoos that protect hair which is color</li>
            <li>As this particular variety of Clear is so hard to find in local stores, I&#x27;m glad I can order online.  </li>
            <li>Leaves a pile of thick buildup of the shampoo outside the bottle the more you use it, even if you usually wipe the top off after closing.  </li>
            <li>While it doesn&#x27;t impact my opinions of this shampoo it does make me question whether I&#x27;ll see the full benefit of using this product as even if I continue using this shampoo I will likely switch to a different conditioner to get my silky hair back</li>
            <li>I decided to give it another whirl and try a second washing, exactly the same!</li>
            <li>I only use the shampoo and it made wonders and it&#x27;s safe for everyday use!</li>
            <li>I have long hair and it doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot to apply.</li>
            <li>It quickly moved through my hair and reached my scalp with little effort.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li>Maybe I got lucky, but I&#x27;ve never had this little frizz.  </li>
            <li>This was a big problem because my long thick hair was my favorite feature!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be the only one to have a complete turn-around!</li>
            <li>The very first time I used it, I could literally feel the hair rinsing down my back in the shower.</li>
            <li>I immediately went online and googled, &amp;#34;hair loss with Clear Scalp&amp;#34; and was astounded to see the hair loss reviews that dated back 2 years!</li>
            <li>The only problem I find is the design of the Clear Scalp brand bottles tends to leak during shipping.</li>
            <li>and they are only store near me.</li>
            <li>Not much scent seems to carry over to my hair, but opening it up in the shower the smell is just too much for me.</li>
            <li>So far this seems like a very solid product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two months now and have decided to go back to my old shampoo.</li>
            <li>Prior to using this product, I had been using Head &amp; Shoulders while still not having any confidence in my hair ever getting back to normal.</li>
            <li>The active ingredients aren&#x27;t anything especially new or different</li>
            <li>The shampoo is thicker than most, but not as thick of some of the other varieties of Clear shampoos.</li>
            <li>First off, I have been struggling with what was diagnosed as Seborrheic Dermatits for about a year and a half.</li>
            <li>If your hair is on the oily side, the shampoo alone would work well, but if you have normal to dry hair, or use a lot of \\&quot;heat\\&quot; appliances, then you may want to add the conditoner to the mix.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In general, this is a decent shampoo, but it is nothing out of the ordinary or anything new as far as dandruff treatment.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I don&#x27;t know that it had any effective on my (minor) case of dandruff, this product did make my scalp feel less dry and itchy, possibly due to the vitamins in it</li>
            <li>CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Total Care Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]] instead.</li>
            <li>It also has a easy open cap, just press down on one side and the other side pops open.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely long hair (to my waist) and it even moisturized the damaged ends without removing my natural curl.  </li>
            <li>and they are 2 to 3 times as expensive as other brands I have used which do as good of a job on my hair as this brand.</li>
            <li>I developed dry scalp like I&#x27;d never seen before.</li>
            <li>(please note I did not personally use this product, I was apparently allergic to something in it, the review was written based upon a third party&#x27;s use of the product)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>From when I first began using Clear Complete Care shampoo my hair has progressively gotten worse-</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair</li>
            <li>I picked up this shampoo because I have a very dry sensitive scalp, especially in the winter time.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>

            <li> I use it with a leave-in treatment and am very happy with the results I have gotten.</li>
            <li> and it advertises that you see the best results by using both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>

            <li> It is wonderful to find an inexpensive shampoo that does what it says!  </li>
            <li> It smelled awesome, but that&#x27;s not what my mailbox is supposed to smell like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not convinced that it&#x27;s the best online purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve added it to my list of products to look for when comparing best price on shampoo.</li>

            <li> Tried this shampoo and it is very effective in clearing dandruff.  </li>
            <li> ; it works Great but doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance you would consider pleasant.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing!</li>
            <li> I like this product line because the company has done a good job of creating a product that is pleasant to use without being overbearing about trying to endear itself to you.</li>
            <li> Smells good on the hair, too.</li>
            <li> I save the coupons for the conditioner (not dandruff) which is just as good, but easier to find.</li>
            <li> Good to find this product as stores are no longer carrying it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does a good job at cleansing the hair.</li>
            <li> Amazon does a good job of taping them up in an effort to prevent anything from spilling out.</li>

            <li> /&gt;This is a good anti-dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> it smells good, but i still have dandruff.  </li>
            <li> For a dandruff shampoo, it is mild and has a pleasant smell, an issue with the best shampoos out there like tar based ones.  </li>
            <li> Like we all need more shampoo brands/varieties, but this one is a good one!</li>
            <li> It also smells good and it looks great; my hair is shinier for sure.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant scent and nice packaging.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> This product seems to work almost, but not quite, as good and has a much more pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> and I love how it makes my hair look and feel after washing with it!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have that dandruff shampoo smell but works effectively.</li>
            <li> Really works and smells great too!!</li>
            <li> The bottle is a nice shape and can be turned over so you can get all of the product out.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo smells really nice</li>
            <li> , and it works about as effectively -- which is not at all for me.</li>
            <li> I believe it would be a good choice for most people.  </li>
            <li> As for applying, it is nice.</li>
            <li> It seems to do the job of cleaning my hair and leaving it nice without any residue.</li>
            <li> This shampoo comes in a nicely designed bottle.</li>
            <li> so effective.</li>
            <li> Zinc pyrithione is regarded as an effective treatment against dandruff.  </li>
            <li> As a person who has struggled to find the perfect dandruff shampoo, I&#x27;m pretty sure the search is over.</li>
            <li> Very surprised, very happy!</li>
            <li> This is so clean smelling and cleans your hair so nice!</li>
            <li> So far, the best anti-dandruff shampoo that I tried.  </li>
            <li> So far this is the best that I have found.  </li>
            <li> The Clear Scalp dandruff shampoo has worked great!!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a new product that will be the latest and greatest</li>
            <li> With so many of the dandruff shampoos having an offensive odor, I was glad to see this one smells nice.  </li>
            <li> To be fair, I do not have dandruff, but mild psoriasis.</li>
            <li> It does have a mild scent and seems to do a good job on my hair.</li>
            <li> But after reading the reviews I cannot believe that there are so many people that are having this issue and these products remain on the market.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I bought the shampoo because I wanted another subscribe and save for the 15% off, and needed more shampoo anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It turns out that the more I used it, the better my scalp felt.</li>
            <li> So love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> , while I love the shampoo, the conditioner for me leaves a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li> literally magic.</li>
            <li> but i love it.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still working its magic.</li>
            <li> lather is phenomenal ...</li>
            <li> some of the best later I have ever encountered.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It was a shame that I could not find it in the stores anymore, but I am glad that I was able to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The way this shampoo works reminds me of Head and Shoulders, just in a more feminine bottle and with a more appealing fragrance.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Gets the job done, but it makes my hair feel more oily...</li>
            <li> Most dandruff shampoos have a medicinal smell that&#x27;s off-putting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with dandruff for many, many years</li>
            <li> It does, however, smell much better than most dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li> It also isn&#x27;t overpowering like many products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> liked it very much, works for me, smell is nice as well.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> Even though I don&#x27;t have flakes anymore I will continue to purchase it and use it a couple times a week because it does a nice job getting my hair and scalp clean.</li>
            <li> It just gets you nice and clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise it is a pretty good shampoo</li>
            <li> This Clear Anti-Dandruff Shampoo works well at controlling dandruff, leaves hair feeling clean, and has a very pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> The scent is also great - fresh, clean, almost like the original Herbal Essence scent.</li>
            <li> It is fine, but not any better than Head and shoulders.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a pleasant scent and did a good job of getting rid of the flakes my dry scalp produces.  </li>
            <li> As far as I am concerned that is working great.</li>
            <li> It also leaves my hair feeling soft and shiny and smelling great.</li>
            <li> course I cannot say that this will ring true for everyone, but if you are at the end of your rope with nothing to lose, go ahead and give this a try!</li>
            <li> It has helps keep my scalp clean and healthy.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers up well and rinses easily and thoroughly from the hair.</li>
            <li> On days that I needed to dry and style my hair, I used the shampoo and the matching conditioner with very good results.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dandruff, but figured - fine</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s fine for me or</li>
            <li> Like the Clear brand conditioners that I have tried, this shampoo is lightly scented and the scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li> Every time I took a bath there was a huge pile of hair in the drain.</li>
            <li> Fantastic budget shampoo.</li>
            <li> They also list animal testing or animal testing free information, if that is known.</li>
            <li> free smelling good soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li> why it&#x27;s so cheap</li>
            <li> It also smelled better than most of H&amp;S&#x27;s variety, though my friend has thicker hair and thus she found she had to use more of the product in order to achieve the results she wanted (and thus it lasted a far shorter amount of time than is</li>
            <li> It also rinses out very quickly and leaves the hair squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this shampoo by accident because the store was having a sale, buy the shampoo and get the conditioner free.</li>
            <li> I do not get that gritty dullness to my hair that some dandruff shampoos leave, and the smell is great.  </li>
            <li> Clear Scalp and Hair Therapy Complete Care is absolutely perfect!</li>
            <li> My scalp was clean, light, and not itchy.</li>
            <li> My hair looks so clean, bouncy and dandruff free.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really doesn&#x27;t smell pleasant, it smells very chemically to me.</li>
            <li> This shampoo cleared my dandruff, and it actually smells nice!  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got dandruff please try it, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s salon quality at $5 &amp; I have seen significant improvement in my scalp.</li>
            <li> Okay, I bought this at the drugstore first, but I have ordered it off Amazon when I needed it and was pacing an order anyway.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I often used Head and Shoulders because it worked for the dandruff, but it didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling clean the way I wanted it to.</li>
            <li> My hair feels and looks clean, and I haven&#x27;t felt the urge to itch my scalp at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clean fragrance</li>
            <li> I have needed to use a dandruff shampoo for a long time, they have never been very effective over a span of time.</li>
            <li> Also seems like a good price compared to similar products.</li>
            <li> It has really changed my hair for the better.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find a scalp shampoo with a nice smell.</li>
            <li> Overall, a good product and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> but it was so cheap it was worth a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i will stick with it for longer, just to make sure that it really doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> If zinc pyrithione has worked for you in the past, but you want to try a nice smelling shampoo that leaves your hair looking good, this may be for you.</li>
            <li> Smells great, unlike other dandruff shampoos</li>
            <li> The scent of this shampoo is really nice and it has good soaping power in hard water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair and scalp felt clean and fresh afterwards.</li>
            <li> Again, this allows for the scalp to be fully covered in the product.&lt;br /&gt;-It washes clean and leaves the hair feeling fresh ...</li>
            <li> I thought the scent was mild and the shampoo lathered and rinsed off well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a white, creamy shampoo with a nice light scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Actually feels like a normal shampoo consistency and lathers so much more than Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
            <li> While the fragrance is nice, it doesn&#x27;t really stick with your hair the way a normal perfumed shampoo would.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the  Dry Scalp Shampoo and Conditioner</li>
            <li> It is good for dry scalps, but without making your scalp oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> moisturizing, yet still safe for oily scalps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has restored my damaged hair to a very soft and manageable state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> one scent available for dandruff control for women, but I do not find this to be too much of an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not glamorous and certainly isn&#x27;t as fun as the salon shampoos I&#x27;d prefer to buy, but it&#x27;s treated my scalp well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one, by far, is my favorite.</li>
            <li> but maybe it works better in a soft water environment</li>
            <li> It was a success after just one wash.</li>
            <li> So, I rarely have issues with dandruff.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s worth a $5 experiment.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While I have personally not found Head and Shoulders to be very effective, if it works for you, the Clear shampoo should also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I see other people love this too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The itching seemed to stop right away.</li>
            <li> Seems like a pretty good antidandruff shampoo ... and is generally the right type  .. keeps hair soft also...</li>
            <li> So while it is a good shampoo, something about how these bottles are designed causes them to be more likely than other brands to leak during shipping.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo, cleans well and makes the scalp fresh for several days.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very much like the others from this company in that it is an anti-dandruff shampoo</li>
            <li> i love this shampoo, it&#x27;s the only one i will ever use.</li>
            <li> My daughters love this shampoo -- it is the only one they will use!</li>
            <li> For most of the time since then, I have used different products in the search for relief.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more than one conditioner in their line and had the same experience with both.  </li>
            <li> Recommended in a magazine article in First Magazine.  </li>
            <li> Tried every shampoo under the sun to stop the flaking, came across Clear Scalp &amp; Hair (the light blue color code) and it was like magic after the first use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my flakes have become more resistant or if the conditioner added the extra my head needed (I&#x27;m on the hunt).</li>
            <li> However, once I applied it to my hair, I instantly understood why it was thinner than most shampoos.</li>
            <li> I cannot rate it as excellent because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see how it will actually control my issues, but I would say that this shampoo is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> With in the first week of using this shampoo, the dandruff disappeared.</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter have tested several of the Clear varieties of the shampoos and, for the most part, have been pleased with the results when compared to our normal brand, Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> This one not only helps my scalp but my hair remains shinning and healthy looking as well.</li>
            <li> After the first use, I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> You definitely have to make sure you rinse</li>
            <li> I tried many shampoos, even prescription ones that would help, but not totally alleviate the problem.  </li>
            <li> And my scalp had never itched so much in my life!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dandruff or any particular hair/scalp issues I&#x27;ve been aware of, but I&#x27;m starting to wonder if my &#x27;normal&#x27; wasn&#x27;t so normal, because I&#x27;ve never been able to have my hair smell so good for so long or feel so clean in-between washings.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo has a nice clean fragrance and makes a lot of lather using a small amount.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from occassional mild dandruff, and this product is respectable in its place among other anti-dandruff shampoos.  </li>
            <li> Wish me luck in my findings for a clear and clean scalp.</li>
            <li> The itching stopped and it made my hair feel so soft and really clean.</li>
            <li> This product is one that pretty much anyone in your house can use.</li>
            <li> After trying so many products for dandruff and very itchy scalp like Selsun, head and shoulders and Proactiv shampoo I found that after just one use Clear Scalp and Hair Therapy Complete Care really helped me out.</li>
            <li> I suffer from extremely dry scalp and this works even better than Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> I have tried clear shampoo for dry damaged hair and I really liked it.</li>
            <li> I have very short, fine, highlighted but growing out hair.</li>
            <li> Now I know not everyone likes the other Clear hair products, but as of yet I&#x27;ve been very pleased with their selection of shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, not only it cleared my dandruff, it also leaved hair soft!</li>
            <li> and I will be honest that I see little result from using any of the OTC shampoos that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> actually saw a difference THE VERY FIRST TIME!</li>
            <li> My hair gets really greasy fast using this.</li>
            <li> really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, all of the Clear products I have tried have had a mild clean scent and seem to work well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very floral and not that</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not the type of person to write reviews, but I had to hop on my husbands account and tell you how much I ADORE this</li>
            <li> I see the light blue label, my night in shining armor.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and it really helped to reduce the plaques on my scalp.</li>
            <li> and I really think it helps.</li>
            <li> however I really do think that it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s become very frizzy, damaged</li>
            <li> I realize that packaging and shipping shouldn&#x27;t really be part of the product review, but I have to point out that this product really didn&#x27;t ship well.</li>
            <li> Over-the-counter products used sporadically whenever I have an outbreak are all I really need to keep my dandruff under control.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast .</li>
            <li> It left my hair shiny, soft, dandruff free and smelling heavenly!</li>
            <li> If nothing else, it&#x27;s worth the low price to give it a try, right?</li>
            <li> It’s actually better than the other shampoo I was using</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers of this product, I had embarrassing flakes and itching for many years.  </li>
            <li> While this smells way, way better than Head &amp; Shoulders in my opinion, I think it&#x27;s a little less effective.</li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;m using T-Gel and then using the Clear Scalp and still have a decent amount of flakes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a decent dandruff shampoo that works well and is reasonably prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a general shampoo it is a step up from Head &amp; Shoulders -- my hair felt healthier overall, with good body but no major build-up -- but given that the dandruff component doesn&#x27;t work at all for me, I might as well be using [[ASIN:B007RTR898</li>
            <li> Head &amp; Shoulders Classic Clean Dandruff Shampoo with Pump 33.8 Fluid ounce]]</li>
            <li> She hasn&#x27;t been having any problems with a dry scalp and she likes this shampoo far better than some of the others I&#x27;ve bought for her to help with the dandruff.</li>
            <li> This typically seems to run at a higher price in the stores around us, but also seems to be on sale far more often.</li>
            <li> It looks much better than the standard Selsun Blue or Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
            <li> Takes a few shampoos for the flakes to completely disappear but the itching was better after the first wash.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t the only one that had done exactly that!</li>
            <li> I tend to have problems with products drying my hair out, but this left it soft and clean without stripping it.  </li>
            <li> Nearly the whole time I have used Dawn Dish Detergent in my hair because nothing I was using would keep the oily look and feel out.</li>
            <li> But, the one thing I did notice by using the CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR shampoo was that my hair seemed much smoother, softer, and over all nicer.  </li>
            <li> It has caused my scalp to become unbearably oily with normal shampoos.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the shampoo is medium to slightly thick and it smells quite nice but not over whelming.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo because I get occasional flakiness in the winter and was experiencing hair loss to the point where I had could see through the hair right to the scalp.</li>
            <li> This was a new one I hadn’t tried yet</li>
            <li> , got a new dermatologist (mine moved)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a huge dandruff problem, I just don&#x27;t want any visible flakes when I wear dark clothing.</li>
            <li> Clear please do not stop making it!</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t find this exact same one at the stores</li>
            <li> like this shampoo and am willing to try the one for color treated hair next.</li>
            <li> The only negative I have for this is the smell is not bad, but strong (but I am very sensitive to smells).  </li>
            <li> This works fairly well, so much so that I can wear black outfits, and see very few flakes and infrequently.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Clear Scalp Anti Dandruff pretty regularly now (washing my hair 3-4 times a week) and it has helped but not like before.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference with my scalp within a few days, but the quality of my hair changed dramatically very quickly.  </li>
            <li> and I usually have the most dandruff near my forehead.</li>
            <li> the version for men (the slate grey bottle), this shampoo has a pleasant and subtle scent.</li>
            <li> Tried one more time and almost cried with what I felt trickling down my back and legs in the shower</li>
            <li> After the first use of this shampoo, my flakes were less and itchiness very much improved.  </li>
            <li> Will probably go back to what I was using before after this bottle&#x27;s used up - cheaper, smells nicer, does pretty much the same job.</li>
            <li> Because it is so mild, it can be used every day or every other day which is not the case with tar based shampoos.</li>
            <li> I also use a different conditioner in the end for improved scent and feel, as well as other benefits its not that it has a strong medicinal smell</li>
            <li> This is one of two Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Therapy shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it every couple days now that i&#x27;m clear and that seems to work well</li>
            <li> I use Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Therapy Anti-Dandruss Shampoo and two of my granddaughters</li>
            <li> For reference, I have baby fine, long and wavy hair which tends to get dry ends.</li>
            <li> and I suffer for at minimum a month trying to clear the outbreak.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway</li>
            <li> So, if you benefit from the zinc based dandruff shampoos and are looking for something that leaves your hair looking nicer than the rest, I would recommend the Clear brand.  </li>
            <li> I suggest you do the same and try to advocate to keep producing this this product because it REALLY works.</li>
            <li> not irritate my scalp or cause any rashes on any part of my (sensitive) skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft and silky as what I am used to and at times, it&#x27;s made me feel like I forgot to use conditioner at all.</li>
            <li> Both Pantene and a macadamia oil conditioner left my hair MUCH softer and closer to what I would expect.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t break my scalp out.</li>
            <li> Ended up with the Teal Complete Care.</li>
            <li> I think you will be happily surprised.</li>
            <li> So far I have seen about a 70 percent reduction in dandruff.</li>
            <li> As an adult, I have used dandruff shampoos to treat it.</li>
            <li> This Clear shampoo says it is nourishing, anti-dandruff, complete care.</li>
            <li> No need for a conditioner, leaves my hair soft.  </li>
            <li> The most commonly known shampoo with this anti-dandruff ingredient is probably Head and Shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> shampoo smells much nicer than Head and Shoulders, and left my hair looking and feeling cleaner; Head and Shoulders often made my hair feel \\&quot;oily\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you scalp burns like fire for a good 20 minutes after getting out of the shower, it&#x27;s not a good thing!!!!!</li>
            <li> The shampoo also gives volume to my fine curly short hair, an added benefit that I am struggling to find with other shampoos that protect hair which is color</li>
            <li> As this particular variety of Clear is so hard to find in local stores, I&#x27;m glad I can order online.  </li>
            <li> Leaves a pile of thick buildup of the shampoo outside the bottle the more you use it, even if you usually wipe the top off after closing.  </li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t impact my opinions of this shampoo it does make me question whether I&#x27;ll see the full benefit of using this product as even if I continue using this shampoo I will likely switch to a different conditioner to get my silky hair back</li>
            <li> I decided to give it another whirl and try a second washing, exactly the same!</li>
            <li> I only use the shampoo and it made wonders and it&#x27;s safe for everyday use!</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot to apply.</li>
            <li> It quickly moved through my hair and reached my scalp with little effort.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li> Maybe I got lucky, but I&#x27;ve never had this little frizz.  </li>
            <li> This was a big problem because my long thick hair was my favorite feature!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be the only one to have a complete turn-around!</li>
            <li> The very first time I used it, I could literally feel the hair rinsing down my back in the shower.</li>
            <li> I immediately went online and googled, &amp;#34;hair loss with Clear Scalp&amp;#34; and was astounded to see the hair loss reviews that dated back 2 years!</li>
            <li> The only problem I find is the design of the Clear Scalp brand bottles tends to leak during shipping.</li>
            <li> and they are only store near me.</li>
            <li> Not much scent seems to carry over to my hair, but opening it up in the shower the smell is just too much for me.</li>
            <li> So far this seems like a very solid product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two months now and have decided to go back to my old shampoo.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this product, I had been using Head &amp; Shoulders while still not having any confidence in my hair ever getting back to normal.</li>
            <li> The active ingredients aren&#x27;t anything especially new or different</li>
            <li> The shampoo is thicker than most, but not as thick of some of the other varieties of Clear shampoos.</li>
            <li> First off, I have been struggling with what was diagnosed as Seborrheic Dermatits for about a year and a half.</li>
            <li> If your hair is on the oily side, the shampoo alone would work well, but if you have normal to dry hair, or use a lot of \\&quot;heat\\&quot; appliances, then you may want to add the conditoner to the mix.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In general, this is a decent shampoo, but it is nothing out of the ordinary or anything new as far as dandruff treatment.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I don&#x27;t know that it had any effective on my (minor) case of dandruff, this product did make my scalp feel less dry and itchy, possibly due to the vitamins in it</li>
            <li> CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Total Care Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]] instead.</li>
            <li> It also has a easy open cap, just press down on one side and the other side pops open.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely long hair (to my waist) and it even moisturized the damaged ends without removing my natural curl.  </li>
            <li> and they are 2 to 3 times as expensive as other brands I have used which do as good of a job on my hair as this brand.</li>
            <li> I developed dry scalp like I&#x27;d never seen before.</li>
            <li> (please note I did not personally use this product, I was apparently allergic to something in it, the review was written based upon a third party&#x27;s use of the product)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> From when I first began using Clear Complete Care shampoo my hair has progressively gotten worse-</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair</li>
            <li> I picked up this shampoo because I have a very dry sensitive scalp, especially in the winter time.</li>
            <li> I tried everything...from home remedies to high end shampoos; from tea tree products to African black soap.</li>
            <li> I alternate Clear and Avalon biotin shampoo washing my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> My daughter tends to have some minor dandruff from time to time and so for the last few weeks shes been using this Clear Scalp Anti-Dandruff shampoo, and as far as I can tell, it appears to be working well.</li>
            <li> B001F51RCY Head &amp; Shoulders Dry Scalp Care with Almond Oil 2-in-1 Dandruff Shampoo &amp; Conditioner 23.7 Fluid ounce (Pack of 2)]].</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo with the dry scalp conditioner (same brand).  </li>
            <li> husband who tries whatever is closest in the bathroom actually ended up preferring this over the male version.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a wide variety of CLEAR products (see my other reviews).</li>
            <li> I usually use high end products and after using this I would think it was.</li>
            <li> main complaint against all of the Clear shampoos I have used, is that when you put them upside down as they are meant to be used in your shower they seep out a bit</li>
            <li> a girl&#x27;s gotta live a little!).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure which ingredient(s) to give credit to, but there is definitely something that sets this far apart from H&amp;S!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you have been experimenting with CLEAR products and found them too \\&quot;smelly\\&quot; or too heavy, give this shampoo a try.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has a Anti-dandruff problem for a long time, and he has already tried one time ,and it seems working.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had seboratic dermatitis as long as I can remember</li>
            <li> Only shampoo / and Conditioner, I have found to actually help my scalp itch and flake less, I have tried everything.  </li>
            <li> Before, it was itchy and irritates the h*ll out of me; Besides, it made my thick dry frizzy hair real real soft!</li>
            <li> I usually alternate it with a clarifying shampoo every other day.  </li>
            <li> I have a dry flaky scalp and this stuff made me itch.  </li>
            <li> just some dry scalp from time to time.</li>
            <li> On days that I plan to stay at home and air dry my hair, I just used the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> At times my scalp gets dry too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though, I didn&#x27;t notice any moisturizing effects on my scalp and it seemed to make my dry ends drier.</li>
            <li> This one takes care of the itch and dandruff without making my scalp and hair as dry as the Sahara.</li>
            <li> That being said, it takes care of the dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient in this dandruff shampoo (1% Pyrithion Zinc) is the same as in [[ASIN:B000GCY2PG</li>
            <li> Works extremely well at keeping my dry winter scalp under control, without drying my hair like other similar products do.</li>
            <li> It smells terrific and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> This was a big plus for me because it made it easier to wash out and meant less build-up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> I have to admit it did act like it had conditioner in it, and there was no sign of dandruff, although my dandruff is only a slight case.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I just needed a little extra conditioner on my ends so they don&#x27;t get too dry or tangly.  </li>
            <li> It was sealed in a plastic bag (taped shut) and wrapped tightly in a cardboard mailer similar to the mailers for a paperback book.</li>
            <li> My scalp still itches but not nearly as much.  </li>
            <li> I just think that taking a shower and all of that should be a pleasure everyday and not such a chore.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems odd to not have flakes, as I have had them for so long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the typical zinc based ones like Head and Shoulders, I&#x27;ve tried their more intense forumla (which smells awful), and I&#x27;ve used T-Gel by Neutrogena.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several different types of dandruff shampoo over the years, with no good results.</li>
            <li> What does one have to do with the other?</li>
            <li> not give a filmy feeling to hair like other shampoos might.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Compared to Head and Shoulders (and other shampoos I try)</li>
            <li> I tried switching to other shampoo/conditioner pairs to see if it was just a change in my hair type</li>
            <li> Not sure what was the cause of the flakes, but I wanted to get rid of them as soon as possible.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t put the Anti-Dandruff Shampoo with the other brands they sell so</li>
            <li> The only thing that worked in the past Nizoral, which I haven’t seen in a store in ages and is 20 bucks for a 7oz bottle on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for several months and no more flakes and</li>
            <li> Does not have the medicinal smell that other anti-dandruff shampoos have.</li>
            <li> This works just as well so far however my scalp issues are mild so not sure how it hold up against reallly bad scalp problems.</li>
            <li> Left my hair very dried out, so I threw away the bottle.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo uses zinc pyrithione as its active ingredient.  </li>
            <li> I no longer avoided wearing dark clothing; my hair started coming in thicker and healthier again.</li>
            <li> I can even get by with some exercise or summer sweat til my next wash without feeling icky now.  </li>
            <li> I have always struggled with dandruff and equally have struggled finding a shampoo that not only worked, but didn&#x27;t leave a film in my hair that left it feeling dirty even though I had just washed it.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any allergic reactions to this product, and I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> so I did not expect much, but I was dead wrong.</li>
            <li> Typically my go-to shampoo and conditioner has been[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> /&gt;Between this and the typical Shampoo and Conditioner used (from Head&amp;Shoulders), there seemed to be a quicker result.  </li>
            <li> She also found the feel of it to be less oily feeling</li>
            <li> I threw half my bottle away this morning.</li>
            <li> Well, recently my flaking has gotten worse and to add an insult to injury had become extremely itchy.</li>
            <li> I live in the northwest, where the winters are cold and dry and dandruff shampoo is a staple in everyone&#x27;s shower.</li>
            <li> Unlike the men&#x27;s shampoo, I did notice that my hair seemed a little drier after using just the shampoo, as opposed to using the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> All my other dandruff and ordinary shampoos do not have this result.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s our little secret.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I still scratch a little, but not to the point where I am ashamed and trying to hide it like I used</li>
            <li> Also, it leaves hair feeling a little &#x27;treated&#x27; in a way</li>
            <li> Nothing extraordinary or terrible about it in my experience so far.</li>
            <li> and I shampoo and condition everyday.  </li>
            <li> One of the few shampoos that have helped my daughters dandruff</li>
            <li> and I wanted to find a shampoo to use without going through all of the trouble.  </li>
            <li> Years ago I tried H&amp;S and I&#x27;ve tried a few others along the way as well.  </li>
            <li> I can wear black shirts again!  </li>
            <li> In the past, the slightest bit of humidity or even taking a shower with a headband and shower cap made my hair less than freshly-shampoo&#x27;d.....</li>
            <li> No other shampoo have ever given faster and wanted results, not even the expensive ones like Kerium.</li>
            <li> a note, I have thick, wavy dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> I used to have to shower every other day without fail or my hair would get so oily, and my scalp so dry that I would look like I hadn&#x27;t showered in weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> though I never use heat on my hair), and my dandruff has gotten much worse (itchy and dry).</li>
            <li> First of all, I must say that I&#x27;m confused by the bad reviews people have given the product due to packing/shipping issues.</li>
            <li> I thought that I just had bad dandruff, but I started getting a few sores and the larger patches of rough areas.  </li>
            <li> Not sure about the anti-dandruff element, as I don&#x27;t usually have dandrull...</li>
            <li> (sorry to be gross).</li>
            <li> not sure whether it cause hair loss...</li>
            <li> Well, went back to buy another bottle and bought the wrong one.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my flaking, didn&#x27;t realize I had bought the wrong one (till recently) and tried again to find the solution.</li>
            <li> I’m not sure if my problem is dandruff or psoriasis</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it seems to make hair a little flat with a residue build-up in hard water.</li>
            <li> here goes:&lt;br /&gt;After being hospitalized for months and on a regimen of serious medications, my hair and scalp were a mess.</li>
            <li> I rotate this shampoo into my routine at least twice a week.</li>
            <li> I have prescription oils to use before shampooing, but they have to stay on at least 4 hours to work well</li>
            <li> ANYONE who has dandruff problems should at least try this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I decided to give the anti-dandruff a shot because my flakes have been out of control lately.</li>
            <li> Small price to pay for \\&quot;clean\\&quot; hair from wash-to-wash!  </li>
            <li> but they dry my poor hair out SO bad and seem to only make the itching worse.</li>
            <li> I have had terrible dandruff my entire life, starting with cradle cap and going all through school, college, and life thereafter.  </li>
            <li> After a few uses it was at least 95% gone!!!</li>
            <li> and I just didnt connect the dots that this shampoo and conditioner was making it worse.</li>
            <li> I have used it for 2 weeks and my dandruff has significantly decreased.</li>
            <li> but I would always be itchy and it would get worse at the gym.  </li>
            <li> It made my dandruff worse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had really bad dandruff all my life, it&#x27;s extremely embarrassing.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t support this brand by buying this or any Clear shampoo, it&#x27;s just awful.</li>
            <li> I have tried every expensive shampoo out there, and nothing has ever worked.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical, of course, thinking that it was just a fluke.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not perfect.</li>
            <li> and unfortunately, it wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m probably spelling it wrong, but you get the point).  </li>
            <li> Every morning that I use it my scalp itches like crazy.</li>
            <li> I have crazy allergies and have to read the ingredients of anything and everything I use or my eczema and dishydrosis go crazy</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t like it, it isn&#x27;t a terrible waste of money.</li>
            <li> Nothing too crazy with scents or anything like that.</li>
            <li> It also had a slightly unpleasant tingling/burning sensation that I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have bad dandruff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have a bad case of dandruff or just ocassional issues.</li>
            <li> Things would work for about 3/4 of a bottle then stop, and I&#x27;d get frustrated.</li>
            <li> I hate to put a lot of products in my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disgusted to see the company is still getting away with selling it to consumers.</li>
            <li> My scalp gets horribly itchy in the winter.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My hair gets really greasy fast using this.</li>
            <li> I feel compelled to write a review on this product because of the damage it has done to my hair. I have fine, thin hair and I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a new product that will be the latest and greatest, this is not it!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE TAKE CAUTION THIS PRODUCT CAN MAKE YOUR HAIR FALL OUT AND IRRITATE YOUR SCALP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have issues with hair breakage to begin with and I just didnt connect the dots that this shampoo and conditioner was making it worse. But after reading the reviews I cannot believe that there are so many people that are having this issue and these products remain on the market. FYI... if you scalp burns like fire for a good 20 minutes after getting out of the shower, it&#x27;s not a good thing!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t have that dandruff shampoo smell but works effectively. I can&#x27;t find it in any of my local stores anymore so I&#x27;m very happy that amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> I will confess - I didn&#x27;t buy this shampoo with any delusions that it would actually help my dandruff.  I have had terrible dandruff my entire life, starting with cradle cap and going all through school, college, and life thereafter.  I bought the shampoo because I wanted another subscribe and save for the 15% off, and needed more shampoo anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t until recently that I realized, when I combed my hair it wasn&#x27;t like shaking a snow globe. I still can&#x27;t believe that the dandruff is gone. I have tried every expensive shampoo out there, and nothing has ever worked.  I would get out of the shower and still have loads of dandruff in my hair.  I was constantly shaking the dandruff off of shirts and wiping it off of my desk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, its gone.  I cannot stress how severe my dandruff problem was, and that I had zero hope this would actually help it.  To my shock and amazement, it has not only worked, but left my hair looking really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a note, I have thick, wavy dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> I have a dry flaky scalp and this stuff made me itch.  Not for me.</li>
            <li> i love this shampoo, it&#x27;s the only one i will ever use. i can&#x27;t find this exact same one at the stores so i always get it off amazon.</li>
            <li> Really works and smells great too!!</li>
            <li> The bottle was busted when I got it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo cleared my dandruff, and it actually smells nice!  Also seems like a good price compared to similar products.</li>
            <li> Only thing that works for me!</li>
            <li> MY HAIR HAS BEEN FALLING OUT</li>
            <li> So far, the best anti-dandruff shampoo that I tried.  Smells good on the hair, too.</li>
            <li> Fantastic budget shampoo. For the price, it exceeds expectations. Works extremely well at keeping my dry winter scalp under control, without drying my hair like other similar products do. The scent is also great - fresh, clean, almost like the original Herbal Essence scent. I rotate this shampoo into my routine at least twice a week.</li>
            <li> Works great and smells great too.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing! It has a wonderful lather and smells so good. I suffer from extremely dry scalp and this works even better than Head and Shoulders. Def. reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> First of all, I must say that I&#x27;m confused by the bad reviews people have given the product due to packing/shipping issues. What does one have to do with the other? Anyway...here goes:&lt;br /&gt;After being hospitalized for months and on a regimen of serious medications, my hair and scalp were a mess. I developed dry scalp like I&#x27;d never seen before. I tried everything...from home remedies to high end shampoos; from tea tree products to African black soap. You name it, I tried it. I finally decided to give this a shot--after all, the price was right.&lt;br /&gt;I actually saw a difference THE VERY FIRST TIME! I was skeptical, of course, thinking that it was just a fluke. It turns out that the more I used it, the better my scalp felt. I no longer avoided wearing dark clothing; my hair started coming in thicker and healthier again. The itchiness disappeared and I was no longer embarrassed by the condition of my hair. I use it with a leave-in treatment and am very happy with the results I have gotten. If nothing else, it&#x27;s worth the low price to give it a try, right?</li>
            <li> My daughters love this shampoo -- it is the only one they will use!</li>
            <li> I have tried everything! even 2% prescription Nizoral. Nothing works. this is the only thing that has worked. my local stores stopped carrying it! So I tried the Men&#x27;s antidandruff and my dandruff is back. I called the manufacturer to complain to get it back in my area. I suggest you do the same and try to advocate to keep producing this this product because it REALLY works. I have long curly hair and I usually have the most dandruff near my forehead. After a few uses it was at least 95% gone!!! Its a miracle product. Clear please do not stop making it! The scent is very nice too!</li>
            <li> My source is ewg.org Skin Deep Cosmetics Database, which informs you of potential health hazards in your cosmetics/beauty products. They also list animal testing or animal testing free information, if that is known.</li>
            <li> So love this shampoo. Been using it since it came out.leaves hair dandruff free smelling good soft and tangle free. Only shampoo I can use and get brush through my hair. But now Walmart no longer sales it and they are only store near me.</li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t feel or smell like medicine and yet it is a dandruff shampoo. I thought the scent was mild and the shampoo lathered and rinsed off well. My hair and scalp felt clean and fresh afterwards. I don&#x27;t have a huge dandruff problem, I just don&#x27;t want any visible flakes when I wear dark clothing. This shampoo seemed to work and I didn&#x27;t notice any flakes. Overall, all of the Clear products I have tried have had a mild clean scent and seem to work well.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo. Not sure about the anti-dandruff element, as I don&#x27;t usually have dandrull...just some dry scalp from time to time. But I like the scent of the shampoo, and the consistency. It seems to do what it&#x27;s supposed to. Recommended, though I can&#x27;t speak to its effectiveness in terms of anti-dandruff.</li>
            <li> After trying so many products for dandruff and very itchy scalp like Selsun, head and shoulders and Proactiv shampoo I found that after just one use Clear Scalp and Hair Therapy Complete Care really helped me out. The itching seemed to stop right away.</li>
            <li> First off, I have been struggling with what was diagnosed as Seborrheic Dermatits for about a year and a half. This was a big problem because my long thick hair was my favorite feature! It has caused my scalp to become unbearably oily with normal shampoos. For most of the time since then, I have used different products in the search for relief. Nearly the whole time I have used Dawn Dish Detergent in my hair because nothing I was using would keep the oily look and feel out. Prior to using this product, I had been using Head &amp; Shoulders while still not having any confidence in my hair ever getting back to normal. Then one day when I ran out of H&amp;S, I noticed this product on the shelf next to it. Looking at the ingredients, I noticed that it was very similar to H&amp;S and it was about a dollar cheaper so I did not expect much, but I was dead wrong. It has really changed my hair for the better. I&#x27;m not sure which ingredient(s) to give credit to, but there is definitely something that sets this far apart from H&amp;S!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Actually feels like a normal shampoo consistency and lathers so much more than Head &amp; Shoulders. This was a big plus for me because it made it easier to wash out and meant less build-up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not irritate my scalp or cause any rashes on any part of my (sensitive) skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes hair smell great even through blow drying and styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not give a filmy feeling to hair like other shampoos might.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very moisturizing, yet still safe for oily scalps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has restored my damaged hair to a very soft and manageable state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Only one scent available for dandruff control for women, but I do not find this to be too much of an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course I cannot say that this will ring true for everyone, but if you are at the end of your rope with nothing to lose, go ahead and give this a try! I can&#x27;t be the only one to have a complete turn-around!</li>
            <li> This product was discontinued and it was one of two I finally found that workled for my hair. Others have left my hair looking and feely oily just after I would wash it. Ew!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has a Anti-dandruff problem for a long time, and he has already tried one time ,and it seems working.</li>
            <li> I picked up this shampoo because I have a very dry sensitive scalp, especially in the winter time. This is one of two Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Therapy shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.  Typically my go-to shampoo and conditioner has been[[ASIN:B001F51RCY Head &amp; Shoulders Dry Scalp Care with Almond Oil 2-in-1 Dandruff Shampoo &amp; Conditioner 23.7 Fluid ounce (Pack of 2)]]. It&#x27;s not glamorous and certainly isn&#x27;t as fun as the salon shampoos I&#x27;d prefer to buy, but it&#x27;s treated my scalp well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo works equally well at keeping my scratching at bay and gives me another brand to choose from. But it&#x27;s not perfect. Compared to Head and Shoulders (and other shampoos I try) I personally find the scent overpowering. Not much scent seems to carry over to my hair, but opening it up in the shower the smell is just too much for me. It&#x27;s very floral and not that pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, while I love the shampoo, the conditioner for me leaves a lot to be desired. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft and silky as what I am used to and at times, it&#x27;s made me feel like I forgot to use conditioner at all. I&#x27;ve tried more than one conditioner in their line and had the same experience with both.  I tried switching to other shampoo/conditioner pairs to see if it was just a change in my hair type and unfortunately, it wasn&#x27;t.  Both Pantene and a macadamia oil conditioner left my hair MUCH softer and closer to what I would expect.  While it doesn&#x27;t impact my opinions of this shampoo it does make me question whether I&#x27;ll see the full benefit of using this product as even if I continue using this shampoo I will likely switch to a different conditioner to get my silky hair back and it advertises that you see the best results by using both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I saw this product reviewed on the Today show a year or so ago and decided to try.  I can wear black shirts again!  While my dandruff has not totally gone away, it has improved by 90%.  My scalp still itches but not nearly as much.  You can not beat the price.  As this particular variety of Clear is so hard to find in local stores, I&#x27;m glad I can order online.  I save the coupons for the conditioner (not dandruff) which is just as good, but easier to find.</li>
            <li> Good to find this product as stores are no longer carrying it.</li>
            <li> havn&#x27;t had dandruff since i was a kid. suddenly started having it again - lots if itchy, flakey, scabby scalp stuff going on and lots of flakes (sorry to be gross). after 2 days, this stuff cleared it up. it&#x27;s like i never had it to begin with! literally magic. and it&#x27;s 4.99. and it&#x27;s probably the BEST smelling shampoo i&#x27;ve ever used. i don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s doing it or why it&#x27;s so cheap but i love it. I&#x27;m using it every couple days now that i&#x27;m clear and that seems to work well ( i use my regular shampoo the rest of the time)</li>
            <li> I have worked this shampoo into my routine.  I use about 3 or 4 shampoos and conditioners throughout the week and I shampoo and condition everyday.  This is one I have thrown into the mix.  It has helps keep my scalp clean and healthy.  My kids and husband like it as well. The bottle is a nice shape and can be turned over so you can get all of the product out.  It also has a easy open cap, just press down on one side and the other side pops open.  The consistency of the shampoo is medium to slightly thick and it smells quite nice but not over whelming.  I just think that taking a shower and all of that should be a pleasure everyday and not such a chore.</li>
            <li> After extended use, this product made my hair start falling out. Every time I took a bath there was a huge pile of hair in the drain. Every time I brushed it my hair started coming out.  I stopped using the product immediately and the problem stopped.</li>
            <li> One of the few shampoos that have helped my daughters dandruff</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I have needed to use a dandruff shampoo for a long time, they have never been very effective over a span of time. This product continues to work each and every time.</li>
            <li> liked it very much, works for me, smell is nice as well.&lt;br /&gt;but not sure whether it cause hair loss...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I see other people love this too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not the type of person to write reviews, but I had to hop on my husbands account and tell you how much I ADORE this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had really bad dandruff all my life, it&#x27;s extremely embarrassing. And as the saying goes I tried everything. Things would work for about 3/4 of a bottle then stop, and I&#x27;d get frustrated. I&#x27;m on my third bottle of this and it&#x27;s still working its magic. I used to have to shower every other day without fail or my hair would get so oily, and my scalp so dry that I would look like I hadn&#x27;t showered in weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I can go 3, even 4 days without having to wash my hair and still NOT get dandruff! This combined with the moisturizing shampoo has been a godsend to me. If you&#x27;ve got dandruff please try it, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I panicked when I had some dandruff when I had burnt my scalp and it was peeling.  Not sure what was the cause of the flakes, but I wanted to get rid of them as soon as possible.  This shampoo smells really nice and I love how it makes my hair look and feel after washing with it!  Even though I don&#x27;t have flakes anymore I will continue to purchase it and use it a couple times a week because it does a nice job getting my hair and scalp clean.</li>
            <li> This is so clean smelling and cleans your hair so nice!</li>
            <li> I usually use high end products and after using this I would think it was. It left my hair shiny, soft, dandruff free and smelling heavenly!</li>
            <li> I cannot believe this shampoo is still on the market. I was pleasantly surprised to find a scalp shampoo with a nice smell. The very first time I used it, I could literally feel the hair rinsing down my back in the shower. The final rinse left a clump of strands in my hand. I couldn&#x27;t believe it and thought it was just a fluke. I decided to give it another whirl and try a second washing, exactly the same! Tried one more time and almost cried with what I felt trickling down my back and legs in the shower and it wasn&#x27;t just water. I immediately went online and googled, &amp;#34;hair loss with Clear Scalp&amp;#34; and was astounded to see the hair loss reviews that dated back 2 years! I immediately threw away my bottle. I had even gone to the doctor that week to have bloodwork done to check my thyroid, and reading those hair loss reviews I wasn&#x27;t the only one that had done exactly that! It took 3 months for my hair to STOP falling out and now 7 months later I can see the 1-2 inch regrowth. This product should be pulled from shelves. I&#x27;m disgusted to see the company is still getting away with selling it to consumers.</li>
            <li> Product is working great.  Only problem was with the packaging.  The shampoo had opened during shipping and spilled out in the box.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo, cleans well and makes the scalp fresh for several days. I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t break my scalp out.</li>
            <li> (please note I did not personally use this product, I was apparently allergic to something in it, the review was written based upon a third party&#x27;s use of the product)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between this and the typical Shampoo and Conditioner used (from Head&amp;Shoulders), there seemed to be a quicker result.  It also smelled better than most of H&amp;S&#x27;s variety, though my friend has thicker hair and thus she found she had to use more of the product in order to achieve the results she wanted (and thus it lasted a far shorter amount of time than is typical).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also seemed to work comparably well without the Conditioner.  Even just using the Shampoo my friend saw a noticeable difference quicker than H&amp;S.  She also found the feel of it to be less oily feeling and it rinsed out quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall my friend says she&#x27;d recommend this over H&amp;S dependent on the price.  This typically seems to run at a higher price in the stores around us, but also seems to be on sale far more often.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo I ever tried! It cleared my scalp off flakes! Before, it was itchy and irritates the h*ll out of me; Besides, it made my thick dry frizzy hair real real soft! I don&#x27;t use any conditioner with it! I only use the shampoo and it made wonders and it&#x27;s safe for everyday use! I have been using it for the last two weeks and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint! In fact, I want to order 10 bottles or something in case they recall it!</li>
            <li> Recommended in a magazine article in First Magazine.  Inexpensive product.  Left my hair very dried out, so I threw away the bottle.  I have very short, fine, highlighted but growing out hair.</li>
            <li> Great! No other shampoo have ever given faster and wanted results, not even the expensive ones like Kerium.</li>
            <li> does not work for me.</li>
            <li> I had gotten this before. Tried every shampoo under the sun to stop the flaking, came across Clear Scalp &amp; Hair (the light blue color code) and it was like magic after the first use. No flaking. That was about a year ago. Well, went back to buy another bottle and bought the wrong one. Ended up with the Teal Complete Care. Did nothing for my flaking, didn&#x27;t realize I had bought the wrong one (till recently) and tried again to find the solution. *They don&#x27;t put the Anti-Dandruff Shampoo with the other brands they sell so didn&#x27;t see it*. Well, recently my flaking has gotten worse and to add an insult to injury had become extremely itchy. In my desperation (an AGH HAH!) moment I see the light blue label, my night in shining armor. LOL. Snatch up the bottle (all my problems are going to be solved) and notice there&#x27;s no conditioner (I swear there was a conditioner). I have been using the Clear Scalp Anti Dandruff pretty regularly now (washing my hair 3-4 times a week) and it has helped but not like before. I don&#x27;t know if my flakes have become more resistant or if the conditioner added the extra my head needed (I&#x27;m on the hunt). Right now I&#x27;m using T-Gel and then using the Clear Scalp and still have a decent amount of flakes. Wish me luck in my findings for a clear and clean scalp.</li>
            <li> I have tried a wide variety of CLEAR products (see my other reviews). This one, by far, is my favorite. Here are some thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Unlike the version for men (the slate grey bottle), this shampoo has a pleasant and subtle scent. (No medicinal smell here!)&lt;br /&gt;-The thin-consistency of the shampoo initially had me confounded. However, once I applied it to my hair, I instantly understood why it was thinner than most shampoos. It quickly moved through my hair and reached my scalp with little effort.&lt;br /&gt;-The lather is phenomenal ... some of the best later I have ever encountered. Again, this allows for the scalp to be fully covered in the product.&lt;br /&gt;-It washes clean and leaves the hair feeling fresh ... not stripped!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have been experimenting with CLEAR products and found them too \\&quot;smelly\\&quot; or too heavy, give this shampoo a try. I think you will be happily surprised.</li>
            <li> So far I have seen about a 70 percent reduction in dandruff. As far as I am concerned that is working great. It also smells good and it looks great; my hair is shinier for sure. So far this seems like a very solid product.</li>
            <li> Like the Clear brand conditioners that I have tried, this shampoo is lightly scented and the scent is pleasant. The shampoo lathers up well and rinses easily and thoroughly from the hair. This shampoo does a good job at cleansing the hair. Overall, a good product and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient in this dandruff shampoo (1% Pyrithion Zinc) is the same as in [[ASIN:B000GCY2PG Head &amp; Shoulders Classic Clean Dandruff Shampoo with Pump 33.8 Fluid ounce]], and it works about as effectively -- which is not at all for me. As a general shampoo it is a step up from Head &amp; Shoulders -- my hair felt healthier overall, with good body but no major build-up -- but given that the dandruff component doesn&#x27;t work at all for me, I might as well be using [[ASIN:B007RTR898 CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Total Care Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]] instead.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I do not have dandruff, but mild psoriasis. As an adult, I have used dandruff shampoos to treat it. Some worked and some did not. This works fairly well, so much so that I can wear black outfits, and see very few flakes and infrequently. For a dandruff shampoo, it is mild and has a pleasant smell, an issue with the best shampoos out there like tar based ones.  Because it is so mild, it can be used every day or every other day which is not the case with tar based shampoos. It also rinses out very quickly and leaves the hair squeaky clean. The shampoo also gives volume to my fine curly short hair, an added benefit that I am struggling to find with other shampoos that protect hair which is color treated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this shampoo and am willing to try the one for color treated hair next.</li>
            <li> I have tried several items in this line, including the men&#x27;s shampoo.  This shampoo has a pleasant scent and did a good job of getting rid of the flakes my dry scalp produces.  Unlike the men&#x27;s shampoo, I did notice that my hair seemed a little drier after using just the shampoo, as opposed to using the shampoo and conditioner.  On days that I plan to stay at home and air dry my hair, I just used the shampoo.  On days that I needed to dry and style my hair, I used the shampoo and the matching conditioner with very good results.  I have not experienced any allergic reactions to this product, and I have sensitive skin.  I believe it would be a good choice for most people.  If your hair is on the oily side, the shampoo alone would work well, but if you have normal to dry hair, or use a lot of \\&quot;heat\\&quot; appliances, then you may want to add the conditoner to the mix.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very good. I have recently been diagnosed with psoriasis.  I thought that I just had bad dandruff, but I started getting a few sores and the larger patches of rough areas.  I have prescription oils to use before shampooing, but they have to stay on at least 4 hours to work well and I wanted to find a shampoo to use without going through all of the trouble.  So far this is the best that I have found.  I tend to have problems with products drying my hair out, but this left it soft and clean without stripping it.  I have not tried the conditioner yet, but I think that I will.  I hate to put a lot of products in my hair and I haven&#x27;t felt the need to.  I cannot rate it as excellent because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see how it will actually control my issues, but I would say that this shampoo is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a nice clean fragrance and makes a lot of lather using a small amount.  I would definitely look for this to buy.</li>
            <li> It is fine, but not any better than Head and shoulders. In fact, I swore it made my head itch. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> As for applying, it is nice. I have long hair and it doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot to apply. It does have a mild scent and seems to do a good job on my hair. It seems to do the job of cleaning my hair and leaving it nice without any residue.</li>
            <li> This gets the job done, when it comes to dandruff/dry scalp I have always kept a Head &amp; Shoulders on standby. This works just as well so far however my scalp issues are mild so not sure how it hold up against reallly bad scalp problems. I also use a different conditioner in the end for improved scent and feel, as well as other benefits its not that it has a strong medicinal smell it&#x27;s just not a scent I preferr. I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This shampoo comes in a nicely designed bottle. It looks much better than the standard Selsun Blue or Head &amp; Shoulders. It&#x27;s a white, creamy shampoo with a nice light scent. Unfortunately it seems to make hair a little flat with a residue build-up in hard water. It also had a slightly unpleasant tingling/burning sensation that I didn&#x27;t like. I&#x27;d have to pass on purchasing this product in the future for myself... but maybe it works better in a soft water environment and I&#x27;d try it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty Therapy Anti-Dandruss Shampoo and two of my granddaughters use it.  Also, my daughter and neighbor also use it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really doesn&#x27;t smell pleasant, it smells very chemically to me. Every morning that I use it my scalp itches like crazy. I would not recommend this shampoo. I threw half my bottle away this morning.</li>
            <li> I’m not sure if my problem is dandruff or psoriasis but at this point it doesn’t matter, the end result is the same, so I need a shampoo to fix it. I have tried everything on the shelf to no avail. The only thing that worked in the past Nizoral, which I haven’t seen in a store in ages and is 20 bucks for a 7oz bottle on Amazon. I picked this up at a drugstore because I ran out of Nizoral and needed a “bump” in between shipments. This was a new one I hadn’t tried yet, I figured it wouldn’t work but it was so cheap it was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked WONDERS. It’s actually better than the other shampoo I was using so I’ve cut that out and use only this now. It was a success after just one wash. My scalp was clean, light, and not itchy. I’ve been using it ever since and have had no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I run out and try to use something else, all the itching and flaking comes back. I need to stay well stocked in this and hope it’s never discontinued.</li>
            <li> Was prescribed by the dermatologist, worked well at mitigating a persistent problem.</li>
            <li> I tried this before I bought it and after using it just once I felt a difference. I have psoriasis and it really helped to reduce the plaques on my scalp. I use this a couple of times a week and I really think it helps. The active ingredients aren&#x27;t anything especially new or different however I really do think that it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try!</li>
            <li> Love it. Used it twice and my head is no longer itchy! so effective.</li>
            <li> Caused my hair to fall out!!</li>
            <li> Seems like a pretty good antidandruff shampoo ... and is generally the right type  .. keeps hair soft also...</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo but I noticed my hair kept falling off. My daughter still uses it and loves it.</li>
            <li> With in the first week of using this shampoo, the dandruff disappeared. The itching stopped and it made my hair feel so soft and really clean. It was a shame that I could not find it in the stores anymore, but I am glad that I was able to find it on Amazon. Thank you!</li>
            <li> product arrived without any over-wrap &amp; had a musty smell from the outside, so did not use</li>
            <li> The way this shampoo works reminds me of Head and Shoulders, just in a more feminine bottle and with a more appealing fragrance. My daughter tends to have some minor dandruff from time to time and so for the last few weeks shes been using this Clear Scalp Anti-Dandruff shampoo, and as far as I can tell, it appears to be working well. She hasn&#x27;t been having any problems with a dry scalp and she likes this shampoo far better than some of the others I&#x27;ve bought for her to help with the dandruff. The only problem I find is the design of the Clear Scalp brand bottles tends to leak during shipping. Amazon does a good job of taping them up in an effort to prevent anything from spilling out. But the bottles themselves still seem to leak a tiny bit while in transport. Of the 4 bottles I had shipped to me, 2 of them were leaking just a bit when they arrived. It also appears others are having the same problem. So while it is a good shampoo, something about how these bottles are designed causes them to be more likely than other brands to leak during shipping.</li>
            <li> This Clear Anti-Dandruff Shampoo works well at controlling dandruff, leaves hair feeling clean, and has a very pleasant scent. My wife and daughter have tested several of the Clear varieties of the shampoos and, for the most part, have been pleased with the results when compared to our normal brand, Head and Shoulders. This is the one that they would look for when they need more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a decent dandruff shampoo that works well and is reasonably prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dandruff or any particular hair/scalp issues I&#x27;ve been aware of, but I&#x27;m starting to wonder if my &#x27;normal&#x27; wasn&#x27;t so normal, because I&#x27;ve never been able to have my hair smell so good for so long or feel so clean in-between washings.  I just needed a little extra conditioner on my ends so they don&#x27;t get too dry or tangly.  Small price to pay for \\&quot;clean\\&quot; hair from wash-to-wash!  In the past, the slightest bit of humidity or even taking a shower with a headband and shower cap made my hair less than freshly-shampoo&#x27;d..... I can even get by with some exercise or summer sweat til my next wash without feeling icky now.  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Not as good as the  Dry Scalp Shampoo and Conditioner For some reason the company discontinued that product.&lt;br /&gt;But do not know where to find it.</li>
            <li> Only shampoo / and Conditioner, I have found to actually help my scalp itch and flake less, I have tried everything.  This one not only helps my scalp but my hair remains shinning and healthy looking as well.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this shampoo by accident because the store was having a sale, buy the shampoo and get the conditioner free. Best choice I ever made! I have always struggled with dandruff and equally have struggled finding a shampoo that not only worked, but didn&#x27;t leave a film in my hair that left it feeling dirty even though I had just washed it. I often used Head and Shoulders because it worked for the dandruff, but it didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling clean the way I wanted it to. Clear Scalp and Hair Therapy Complete Care is absolutely perfect! After the first use, I noticed a difference. My hair feels and looks clean, and I haven&#x27;t felt the urge to itch my scalp at all. As a person who has struggled to find the perfect dandruff shampoo, I&#x27;m pretty sure the search is over. ANYONE who has dandruff problems should at least try this shampoo. It works for me and I hope it does for you, too!</li>
            <li> Now I know not everyone likes the other Clear hair products, but as of yet I&#x27;ve been very pleased with their selection of shampoos and conditioners.  I suffer from occassional mild dandruff, and this product is respectable in its place among other anti-dandruff shampoos.  I do not get that gritty dullness to my hair that some dandruff shampoos leave, and the smell is great.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> For reference, I have baby fine, long and wavy hair which tends to get dry ends. At times my scalp gets dry too. The scent of this shampoo is really nice and it has good soaping power in hard water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though, I didn&#x27;t notice any moisturizing effects on my scalp and it seemed to make my dry ends drier. I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem with dandruff. I have tried several different types of dandruff shampoo over the years, with no good results. The Clear Scalp dandruff shampoo has worked great!! I have used it for 2 weeks and my dandruff has significantly decreased. I have been using it with the volumizing conditioner, and my hair looks great!!</li>
            <li> Like we all need more shampoo brands/varieties, but this one is a good one! I believe I am permanently switching to this brand.  I have extremely long hair (to my waist) and it even moisturized the damaged ends without removing my natural curl.  It smells terrific and a little goes a long way.  It&#x27;s salon quality at $5 &amp; I have seen significant improvement in my scalp. I don&#x27;t have bad dandruff but I would always be itchy and it would get worse at the gym.  I haven&#x27;t had that problem in two months with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This Clear shampoo says it is nourishing, anti-dandruff, complete care. I have to admit it did act like it had conditioner in it, and there was no sign of dandruff, although my dandruff is only a slight case.&lt;br /&gt;The problem is, the next morning my hair was oily looking. All my other dandruff and ordinary shampoos do not have this result. The shampoo is thicker than most, but not as thick of some of the other varieties of Clear shampoos. You definitely have to make sure you rinse thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main complaint against all of the Clear shampoos I have used, is that when you put them upside down as they are meant to be used in your shower they seep out a bit and they are 2 to 3 times as expensive as other brands I have used which do as good of a job on my hair as this brand.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo.  No need for a conditioner, leaves my hair soft.  Smells great, unlike other dandruff shampoos and I definitely couldn&#x27;t beat the price.  $2 cheaper than the store!</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers of this product, I had embarrassing flakes and itching for many years.  I tried many shampoos, even prescription ones that would help, but not totally alleviate the problem.  After the first use of this shampoo, my flakes were less and itchiness very much improved.  I have been using it for several months and no more flakes and only occasional itching.&lt;br /&gt;It seems odd to not have flakes, as I have had them for so long.  It is wonderful to find an inexpensive shampoo that does what it says!  The only negative I have for this is the smell is not bad, but strong (but I am very sensitive to smells).  If you have had years of embarrassing flakes and itchiness, try this shampoo!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very much like the others from this company in that it is an anti-dandruff shampoo and it will increase the volume of your hair.  It has a pleasant scent and nice packaging.  This product is one that pretty much anyone in your house can use.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done, but it makes my hair feel more oily...I usually alternate it with a clarifying shampoo every other day.  Leaves a pile of thick buildup of the shampoo outside the bottle the more you use it, even if you usually wipe the top off after closing.  Will probably go back to what I was using before after this bottle&#x27;s used up - cheaper, smells nicer, does pretty much the same job.</li>
            <li> Tried this shampoo and it is very effective in clearing dandruff.  But the only problem is that it left the hair a bit dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it is a pretty good shampoo</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells so good I always get complements for smelling good because of this!</li>
            <li> I only used this shampoo for a week before I threw it out. It made my dandruff worse. And my scalp had never itched so much in my life! It was unbearable! So I&#x27;m switching back to Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo because I get occasional flakiness in the winter and was experiencing hair loss to the point where I had could see through the hair right to the scalp. I read that using a product that exfoliates the scalp will help energize the roots...I really like it. It cleans so well. My hair looks so clean, bouncy and dandruff free. My hair is growing back because of the combination of things I&#x27;m doing. I alternate Clear and Avalon biotin shampoo washing my hair every other day. If I need to wash it on the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; day I use a cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> Works good on dandruff.</li>
            <li> My scalp gets horribly itchy in the winter. I&#x27;ve tried harsher shampoos such as T-Gel but they dry my poor hair out SO bad and seem to only make the itching worse.This one takes care of the itch and dandruff without making my scalp and hair as dry as the Sahara. Takes a few shampoos for the flakes to completely disappear but the itching was better after the first wash. Smells soooooo good too.</li>
            <li> So, I rarely have issues with dandruff. It&#x27;s a stress-related eczema sort of thing. That being said, it takes care of the dry, itchy skin. It also leaves my hair feeling soft and shiny and smelling great. Most dandruff shampoos have a medicinal smell that&#x27;s off-putting. This doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have a bad case of dandruff or just ocassional issues.</li>
            <li> I live in the northwest, where the winters are cold and dry and dandruff shampoo is a staple in everyone&#x27;s shower. I have tried clear shampoo for dry damaged hair and I really liked it. I decided to give the anti-dandruff a shot because my flakes have been out of control lately. I tried this product last night, the smell is heavenly. Does not have the medicinal smell that other anti-dandruff shampoos have. I was by no means expecting a miracle; nor did I receive one. I did however notice a drastic decrease in dandruff and scalp itch just in one use. Very surprised, very happy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two months now and have decided to go back to my old shampoo. From when I first began using Clear Complete Care shampoo my hair has progressively gotten worse- it&#x27;s become very frizzy, damaged looking(even though I never use heat on my hair), and my dandruff has gotten much worse (itchy and dry). This shampoo isn&#x27;t even \\&quot;clear\\&quot;, it contains lots of harmful sulfates that strip your hair of what it needs to remain nourished. Please don&#x27;t support this brand by buying this or any Clear shampoo, it&#x27;s just awful.</li>
            <li> Okay, I bought this at the drugstore first, but I have ordered it off Amazon when I needed it and was pacing an order anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had seboratic dermatitis as long as I can remember (I&#x27;m probably spelling it wrong, but you get the point).  Years ago I tried H&amp;S and I&#x27;ve tried a few others along the way as well.  I have crazy allergies and have to read the ingredients of anything and everything I use or my eczema and dishydrosis go crazy and I suffer for at minimum a month trying to clear the outbreak.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, got a new dermatologist (mine moved) and he suggested I try a shampoo with zinc.  Search for that and all you&#x27;ll find is dandruff shampoos.  I don&#x27;t have dandruff, but figured - fine, it&#x27;s worth a $5 experiment.  I bought this shampoo with the dry scalp conditioner (same brand).  I noticed a difference with my scalp within a few days, but the quality of my hair changed dramatically very quickly.  Maybe I got lucky, but I&#x27;ve never had this little frizz.  Could be because I&#x27;m not clawing at my scalp, or could be the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I like the smell (even though I&#x27;m allergic to fragrance...a girl&#x27;s gotta live a little!).  I&#x27;ve been complemented on how my hair smells and didn&#x27;t have the heart to tell them it was dandruff shampoo, that&#x27;s our little secret.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot vouch for dandruff, but I will say this has made my seboratic dermatitis bearable!  I still scratch a little, but not to the point where I am ashamed and trying to hide it like I used to.&lt;br /&gt;Try it, it&#x27;s $5...if you don&#x27;t like it, it isn&#x27;t a terrible waste of money.</li>
            <li> I realize that packaging and shipping shouldn&#x27;t really be part of the product review, but I have to point out that this product really didn&#x27;t ship well. It was sealed in a plastic bag (taped shut) and wrapped tightly in a cardboard mailer similar to the mailers for a paperback book. The result was a disaster. I could smell the fragrance when I opened my mailbox. It smelled awesome, but that&#x27;s not what my mailbox is supposed to smell like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the package, a lot of the product had seeped out into the plastic bag. I washed it off, but the lid and cap had also been damaged, so it leaks if I just squeeze the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what about the product itself? It smells good. It&#x27;s a clean fragrance that&#x27;s fine for me or my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good anti-dandruff shampoo. It is good for dry scalps, but without making your scalp oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this shampoo, but I&#x27;m not convinced that it&#x27;s the best online purchase.</li>
            <li> This shampoo uses zinc pyrithione as its active ingredient.  Zinc pyrithione is regarded as an effective treatment against dandruff.  The most commonly known shampoo with this anti-dandruff ingredient is probably Head and Shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I have personally not found Head and Shoulders to be very effective, if it works for you, the Clear shampoo should also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo smells much nicer than Head and Shoulders, and left my hair looking and feeling cleaner; Head and Shoulders often made my hair feel \\&quot;oily\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I don&#x27;t know that it had any effective on my (minor) case of dandruff, this product did make my scalp feel less dry and itchy, possibly due to the vitamins in it lie Vitamin E.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, this is a decent shampoo, but it is nothing out of the ordinary or anything new as far as dandruff treatment.  If zinc pyrithione has worked for you in the past, but you want to try a nice smelling shampoo that leaves your hair looking good, this may be for you.</li>
            <li> I like this product line because the company has done a good job of creating a product that is pleasant to use without being overbearing about trying to endear itself to you. Nothing too crazy with scents or anything like that. It just gets you nice and clean. Nothing extraordinary or terrible about it in my experience so far.</li>
            <li> While this smells way, way better than Head &amp; Shoulders in my opinion, I think it&#x27;s a little less effective. Also, it leaves hair feeling a little &#x27;treated&#x27; in a way that H&amp;S doesn&#x27;t. The price is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with dandruff for many, many years and I will be honest that I see little result from using any of the OTC shampoos that I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;ve tried the typical zinc based ones like Head and Shoulders, I&#x27;ve tried their more intense forumla (which smells awful), and I&#x27;ve used T-Gel by Neutrogena.  But, the one thing I did notice by using the CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR shampoo was that my hair seemed much smoother, softer, and over all nicer.  So, if you benefit from the zinc based dandruff shampoos and are looking for something that leaves your hair looking nicer than the rest, I would recommend the Clear brand.  However, if you haven&#x27;t seen results from something from Head and Shoulders, don&#x27;t expect a different result when it comes to your dandruff.</li>
            <li> My dandruff is not severe enough for me to need to use a dandruff shampoo every day. Over-the-counter products used sporadically whenever I have an outbreak are all I really need to keep my dandruff under control. My current go to product is [[ASIN:B000052XZQ Neutrogena T-Gel]]; it works Great but doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance you would consider pleasant. This product seems to work almost, but not quite, as good and has a much more pleasant fragrance. While the fragrance is nice, it doesn&#x27;t really stick with your hair the way a normal perfumed shampoo would. It does, however, smell much better than most dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li> With so many of the dandruff shampoos having an offensive odor, I was glad to see this one smells nice.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it smells feminine as it&#x27;s simply calming to my senses.  It also isn&#x27;t overpowering like many products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband who tries whatever is closest in the bathroom actually ended up preferring this over the male version.  Plus it works great on dandruff so it&#x27;s a winner to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve added it to my list of products to look for when comparing best price on shampoo.</li>
            <li> it smells good, but i still have dandruff.  i will stick with it for longer, just to make sure that it really doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, not only it cleared my dandruff, it also leaved hair soft! Shipping was fast . I would definitely buy again!</li>
