    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Therefore, I thought going online would be my best bet, and it was.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner works well and smells great, so I recommend it.</li>
            <li>While its great for her it leaves my hair looking and feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>Always find it a good product for my hair.</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>Great product, absolutely love.</li>
            <li>It turns out its mostly petroleum jelly!</li>
            <li>I love this oil!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happily satisfied!</li>
            <li>Softee smells good, leaves hair soft, and works great as a styling product for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>, what is there not to LOVE about this</li>
            <li>this isn&#x27;t it, but it has a nice light consistency and a very fresh but subtle coconut smell.</li>
            <li>I am pleased and the amount of jars I ordered should last me quite a while in case I can no longer find it online.  </li>
            <li>plain Coconut Oil is better!</li>
            <li>Otherwise it will be too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got very oily skin</li>
            <li>Plus it cost as much to ship as the product.</li>
            <li>So Softee&#x27;s absolutely has a place in my family as both a medicine and hair care product.</li>
            <li>if you have a good thick head of hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely mainly petroleum-based, so if you&#x27;re looking for pure coconut oil</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a whole jar of this, and it was well worth the money (although I will note that I paid only $1.00 for it at Walgreens!)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend if you&#x27;re looking for something budget-friendly that actually works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Check your local family dollar or any cheap dollar store, I get the same size tub for $1.</li>
            <li>The next time I put on only enough to lightly coat one finger, and that was plenty to give my hair a soft glow.  </li>
            <li>not waste your money buying it off this site.</li>
            <li>On the plus side it is natural unlike some products today.</li>
            <li>I feel gross, so between this and the desert environment in which I live, my hair is quite brittle.</li>
            <li>my 4 yr old mixed race son came home with a case of head lice, and guess what the prescription to kill/prevent a return of lice was?</li>

            <li> After showering the next day, my hair is so shiny and flat, but it isn&#x27;t greasy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine blonde hair and this is just the thing to keep the frizz down and to give my color-treated hair a healthier shine.</li>
            <li> (I apply it after heat-treating because I suspect that using a flat iron or blow-dryer over this product is not a good idea), and once or twice a week I put in a large amount and leave it on over night as a deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> As I keep my hair cut close to my scalp, you only need to use a small amount to keep your scalp well oiled.........and the price at your local Walgreen is only about 99 cents a jar</li>

            <li> This product is one that I have used for several years and as of late I could not find it in the stores</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is simply too thick to massage into your scalp.</li>
            <li> I am a 58 yr old black man, and I have used this product for at least the past 15 years.</li>
            <li> I got it for $2.99, and I think it often goes on sale for less.</li>
            <li> ... Makes hair fill heavy..</li>
            <li> Again, disappointed in another product promising to help dry scalp issues without looking greasy.</li>
            <li> I typically put a very small amount in after I get out of the shower focusing on the ends</li>
            <li> I usually buy this product at Walgreens, but for some reason it was discontinued.  </li>

            <li> It has gotten hard to find in stores, so I have been ordering it one line.</li>
            <li> It was actually hard pomade too...</li>
            <li> It moisturizes like crazy, although it will be too heavy for some.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I am a Caucasian with blonde hair in a short style. Softee smells good, leaves hair soft, and works great as a styling product for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a whole jar of this, and it was well worth the money (although I will note that I paid only $1.00 for it at Walgreens!) It moisturizes like crazy, although it will be too heavy for some. I think if you have Caucasian hair you may not like or need this, except perhaps for your damaged ends. Otherwise it will be too much. I highly recommend if you&#x27;re looking for something budget-friendly that actually works pretty well.</li>
            <li> After I put this in my hair, I couldn&#x27;t get it out. I must have washed my hair 6 times before it all came out. Aaand I used dish washing soap -that&#x27;s what&#x27;s recommended to get vaseline out. It turns out its mostly petroleum jelly!</li>
            <li> It is like putting Vaseline on your hair...plain Coconut Oil is better!</li>
            <li> I use this to condition my hair and I also use it on my feet with socks to soften them.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years . It has gotten hard to find in stores, so I have been ordering it one line. Always find it a good product for my hair.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to make my graying Caucasian hair shiny, and I saw this stuff at the grocery store.  It was inexpensive, so I thought I would give it a try.  One thing I learned--use it SPARINGLY.  I put on what I thought was enough, and it made my hair look oily!  The next time I put on only enough to lightly coat one finger, and that was plenty to give my hair a soft glow.  The conditioner works well and smells great, so I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product, absolutely love. However, DO NOT BUY THIS ON AMAZON. Check your local family dollar or any cheap dollar store, I get the same size tub for $1. All of them, coconut oil, herbal gro, Indian hemp, hair food, etc. all for 1 dollar.&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your money buying it off this site.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! It&#x27;s definitely mainly petroleum-based, so if you&#x27;re looking for pure coconut oil this isn&#x27;t it, but it has a nice light consistency and a very fresh but subtle coconut smell. I have thin, fine blonde hair and this is just the thing to keep the frizz down and to give my color-treated hair a healthier shine. I&#x27;ve got very oily skin so I need to shower every day or else I feel gross, so between this and the desert environment in which I live, my hair is quite brittle. This stuff is a life-saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is helping increase the amount of time I can wait between haircuts, because it bonds split ends back together and camouflages them. I typically put a very small amount in after I get out of the shower focusing on the ends (I apply it after heat-treating because I suspect that using a flat iron or blow-dryer over this product is not a good idea), and once or twice a week I put in a large amount and leave it on over night as a deep conditioning treatment. After showering the next day, my hair is so shiny and flat, but it isn&#x27;t greasy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check your local Walgreens, though. I got it for $2.99, and I think it often goes on sale for less.</li>
            <li> Smells good. Nourishes the hair keeping it hydrated and vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;But if you have a good thick head of hair like I do...it wont reach your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;It is simply too thick to massage into your scalp.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this product at Walgreens, but for some reason it was discontinued.  I had to use the internet to find a place where to buy it from. This is the only hair product my husband used for a shiny look.</li>
            <li> the softee was overpriced and amazon refunded me back my money.</li>
            <li> This product works for my mother but not for me. While its great for her it leaves my hair looking and feeling greasy. Softee is not for everyone but it depends on your hair type. I would recomend it for people with a corser hair type. On the plus side it is natural unlike some products today.</li>
            <li> This product is one that I have used for several years and as of late I could not find it in the stores I usually frequent.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, I thought going online would be my best bet, and it was.  I am pleased and the amount of jars I ordered should last me quite a while in case I can no longer find it online.  I&#x27;m happily satisfied!</li>
            <li> Again, disappointed in another product promising to help dry scalp issues without looking greasy. Plus it cost as much to ship as the product.</li>
            <li> I actually expected an oil instead of a pomade. It was actually hard pomade too... No fancy from my part... Makes hair fill heavy..</li>
            <li> I am a 58 yr old black man, and I have used this product for at least the past 15 years. As I keep my hair cut close to my scalp, you only need to use a small amount to keep your scalp well oiled.........and the price at your local Walgreen is only about 99 cents a jar, what is there not to LOVE about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it goes even further....my 4 yr old mixed race son came home with a case of head lice, and guess what the prescription to kill/prevent a return of lice was? Using a coconut-based shampoo and hair oil!!! Using it repels head lice. So Softee&#x27;s absolutely has a place in my family as both a medicine and hair care product.</li>
