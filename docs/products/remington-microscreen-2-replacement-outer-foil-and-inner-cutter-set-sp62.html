    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Everything is perfect.</li>
            <li>Remington is greatly overpricing this parts kit.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>I searched many sites before I purchased, this was the best seller.</li>
            <li>It installed perfectly and worked just fine until yesterday.  </li>
            <li>As advertised, fit and work perfectly.</li>
            <li>but I ordered it and when it came it fit great and worked great</li>
            <li>excellent product, really meets my expectations</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>I read someone else&#x27;s idea today on this forum that I find interesting.  </li>
            <li>Turns out Remington does make the blade that is pictured any more.</li>
            <li>All in all I am quite pleased with the product from this vendor.  </li>
            <li>Nice fit and well made replacement parts.</li>
            <li>quited satisfied with the sellers remarks and they lived up to the&lt;br /&gt;products performance and quality.</li>
            <li>This was a perfect fit for the razor, it was easy to install and works like the razor is brand new.</li>
            <li>As a result, the cutter seems to contact the foil somewhat more than the original, thus making the foil warm to the touch on occasion.  </li>
            <li>These are a good value because they are low in price and the quality is good.</li>
            <li>Does fit well, and works just fine!</li>
            <li>The quality seems good and the price is very fair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As others have stated, doesn&#x27;t have as many blades as original equipment.</li>
            <li>The cutter head seems a bit taller than the original because the covering fits more snugly.  </li>
            <li>Received the item very quickly even though I was deployed to Iraq at the time.</li>
            <li>works fine with</li>
            <li>so I had some concerns, but everything was fine.  </li>
            <li>The foil is just fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine now.</li>
            <li>Working out fine - this is my husband&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I guess for me, I&#x27;d rather get a genuine Remington shorter cutter than one of the longer aftermarket ones which a number of people have had problems with.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and remove.</li>
            <li>Plastic was cheap and wore away a month into</li>
            <li>The foil replacement fit like the original Remington part.  </li>
            <li>For the price, next time I&#x27;ll spend more and buy a set that has a better quality.</li>
            <li>We have already filled out your first request and do not see why you are asking again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made sure the shaver is completely charged and have even applied clipper oil to the cutter bar.</li>
            <li>right so that it didn&#x27;t jump out, impelled by the spring.</li>
            <li>the price was right.  </li>
            <li>Price was very reasonable and shipping very fast.</li>
            <li>They fit the F3800 perfectly, where the SP-62 parts that I had on hand as spares for my previous shaver did not fit the newer shaver.  </li>
            <li>Sounds logical.  </li>
            <li>These were factory sealed and they had the longer, original cutter, probably because they are old stock.  </li>
            <li>I received a free Remington F3790 a couple of years ago as a replacement, and it does have this new design, but I still get as close a shave as with the old style.  </li>
            <li>The cutter and the foil fit properly and I have had no issues w/ quality.</li>
            <li>I am very please with this foil and cutter set.  </li>
            <li>The delivery was fast</li>
            <li>I like this  foil and cutter because it is sharp and does a better job than one after it has been used for a year.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t last 30 days and the cutter wouldn&#x27;t stay latched to clean.  </li>
            <li>My Remington is pretty old.</li>
            <li>my Remington shave like new!</li>
            <li>The Remington is like NEW!  </li>
            <li>The user guide for my Flex Foil F3800 shaver states that the replacement parts are SP-62, thought the buyer comments for this part stated that it did not fit the F3800 because it&#x27;s not listed on the package, I was in a hurry for the parts and since it is listed as fitting the F3790 shaver, I suspected that it was the newer version of this part and ordered it.  </li>
            <li>The microscreen fits okay however the blade does not fit on the pivot in the razor.</li>
            <li>It has a round hole that is just a bit too large to fit on the pin</li>
            <li>But I won&#x27;t hesitate buying the new style, despite its shorter length.  </li>
            <li>These new cutters do not go to the end of the foils.  </li>
            <li>I now have 2 new cutter blocks and 1 used cutter block, plus 1 new microscreen, 1 damaged-in-shipping microscreen and one used microscreen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all combinations of new and used, excluding damaged parts.</li>
            <li>The Remington SP-62 foil and cutter refils were exactly what I needed to get my razor back running like new again.</li>
            <li>With the new cutters, the far ends of the foil will not have the cutters below them, so it may prevent premature foil damage.  </li>
            <li>I had to detach the old blades plastic piece and replace the plastic on the new razor with it.</li>
            <li>Prior to receiving this item, I saw and purchased, on sale, a brand new F2 F3800 (a newer model) shaver for $19.99 at a large store in the SF Bay Area.  </li>
            <li>Because of this I had to throw it away and use my old cutter.</li>
            <li>That said, there has been no rub through problem so far.  </li>
            <li>The old ones lasted longer, but this passed the test.</li>
            <li>I just today (4/3/15) received two new Remington MS2 Microscreen, cord only, not rechargeable shavers I bought from Amazon.</li>
            <li>life.&lt;br /&gt;Order was initially shipped with half of the ordered parts included though I was charged in full.</li>
            <li>The clips on the old and newer one are slightly different to where the two are NOT interchangeable.  </li>
            <li>so I resorted back to my old blade.</li>
            <li>I put off getting a new foil and cutter for a long time.  </li>

            <li> This cutter seems to be shorter in width, and the central connecting part does not fit into the housing, We never could get it seated</li>
            <li> Partial order was rectified however.</li>
            <li> Please be careful shaving!  </li>
            <li> I waited a month before writing my review due to some of the previous reviews.  </li>
            <li> Just because something is a &amp;#34;replacement part&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s the same as the part it&#x27;s ostensibly replacing.</li>
            <li> On returning home I looked to see that Amazon also sells the F2 F3800 for less than the replacement parts.  </li>
            <li> This makes the blade seem dull, but on the other hand mayby the blade and foil were used previously.</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit on Amazon a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, one end of the screen completely wore through while I was shaving (VERY SHARP EDGE EXPOSED), and it left me with a couple of very nasty cuts on the right side of my face before I realized what was happening.  </li>
            <li> The plastic piece that is attached to the blades was too small for my razors input.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it is hard to find cutters and foil for this razor</li>
            <li> At least it is not too expensive to replace.</li>
            <li> Quality on supplied cutter head very poor.</li>
            <li> Really, really disappointing.</li>
            <li> BAD!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The foil on this product lasted 4 months. Time for another replacement. At least it is not too expensive to replace.</li>
            <li> works fine with my Remington F3790,I bought the two pack (two screens and two cutters) cheaper than the one pack when My local Wal-mart use to carry it.</li>
            <li> Three BIG FAT ZEROS for Remington on this part.  1) Somewhere along the line of various shavers, they changed the design of this part but kept it identified as SP-62.  The clips on the old and newer one are slightly different to where the two are NOT interchangeable.  The user guide for my Flex Foil F3800 shaver states that the replacement parts are SP-62, thought the buyer comments for this part stated that it did not fit the F3800 because it&#x27;s not listed on the package, I was in a hurry for the parts and since it is listed as fitting the F3790 shaver, I suspected that it was the newer version of this part and ordered it.  They fit the F3800 perfectly, where the SP-62 parts that I had on hand as spares for my previous shaver did not fit the newer shaver.  2) Remington is greatly overpricing this parts kit.  Prior to receiving this item, I saw and purchased, on sale, a brand new F2 F3800 (a newer model) shaver for $19.99 at a large store in the SF Bay Area.  On returning home I looked to see that Amazon also sells the F2 F3800 for less than the replacement parts.  http://www.amazon.com/Remington-F2-3800L-Flexing-Foil-Technology/dp/B00ANZOVAW/ref&#x3D;sr_1_cc_1?s&#x3D;aps&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1417394102&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1-catcorr&amp;keywords&#x3D;F3800+shaver.  3) Pricing replacement parts, that have a relatively short useful life, more expensive than purchasing a whole new product is TERRIBLY WASTEFUL AND ENVIRONMENTALLY HOSTILE!!!</li>
            <li> As others have stated, doesn&#x27;t have as many blades as original equipment. Does fit well, and works just fine!</li>
            <li> The cutter wouldn&#x27;t stay hooked on the razor knob.  Because of this I had to throw it away and use my old cutter.</li>
            <li> Foil and cutter came without replacement spring that pushes up cutter next to foil allowing for close shave.  This makes the blade seem dull, but on the other hand mayby the blade and foil were used previously.</li>
            <li> I received a free Remington F3790 a couple of years ago as a replacement, and it does have this new design, but I still get as close a shave as with the old style.  I just today (4/3/15) received two new Remington MS2 Microscreen, cord only, not rechargeable shavers I bought from Amazon. These were factory sealed and they had the longer, original cutter, probably because they are old stock.  But I won&#x27;t hesitate buying the new style, despite its shorter length.  It gives me as close a shave.  I read someone else&#x27;s idea today on this forum that I find interesting.  These new cutters do not go to the end of the foils.  With the originals, the foils often failed at the end where more pressure is sometimes put on them.  With the new cutters, the far ends of the foil will not have the cutters below them, so it may prevent premature foil damage.  Sounds logical.  I just know the new cutter with its round blades seems to work quite well in my F-3790 shaver (the cheapest model).  I put that cutter on one of my DA-307 to test, and it worked well there too.  I guess for me, I&#x27;d rather get a genuine Remington shorter cutter than one of the longer aftermarket ones which a number of people have had problems with.</li>
            <li> For some reason, I&#x27;m not getting as close a shave (as my Braun) with this Remington shaving foil and cutter. The shaver was a used gift and needed replacement microscreen and cutter. I now have 2 new cutter blocks and 1 used cutter block, plus 1 new microscreen, 1 damaged-in-shipping microscreen and one used microscreen. I&#x27;ve tried all combinations of new and used, excluding damaged parts. I&#x27;ve made sure the shaver is completely charged and have even applied clipper oil to the cutter bar. Nothing helps, which is a shame, as the seller was so helpful. I&#x27;ll keep on using the shaver, but will probably buy a different one if the results don&#x27;t improve.</li>
            <li> Unit received with .26 cents postage due.&lt;br /&gt;Box bent and screen smashed&lt;br /&gt;I will find another vendor next time.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> Bought this so I could replace the cutter and foil on my Remington SP-62 electric razor. Received the item very quickly even though I was deployed to Iraq at the time. The cutter and the foil fit properly and I have had no issues w/ quality.</li>
            <li> Buying these as a combo set makes sense.  My foils wear out and develop holes that will cut my face if not replaced.  These are a good value because they are low in price and the quality is good.</li>
            <li> excellent product, really meets my expectations</li>
            <li> This was a genuine part unlike some fake stuff I have bought at that well-known auction site. I&#x27;m smooooth again!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last 30 days and the cutter wouldn&#x27;t stay latched to clean.  Didn&#x27;t come in Remington sealed package. Must be a generic Copy. BAD!</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on the picture. It matched the blade and foil that I have now. I did not get what was pictured. I was told it would work just as well. It did not. Turns out Remington does make the blade that is pictured any more. I sent it back.</li>
            <li> I waited a month before writing my review due to some of the previous reviews.  All in all I am quite pleased with the product from this vendor.  The package arrived in bubble pack so I had some concerns, but everything was fine.  The foil replacement fit like the original Remington part.  The cutter head seems a bit taller than the original because the covering fits more snugly.  As a result, the cutter seems to contact the foil somewhat more than the original, thus making the foil warm to the touch on occasion.  That said, there has been no rub through problem so far.  Would I buy from this vendor again?  The answer is a definite YES.  The quality seems good and the price is very fair.&lt;br /&gt;December note added - foil starting to show tear through after 6 months, which is the recommended replacement timie.  The old ones lasted longer, but this passed the test.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work. The cutter pops off the shaver when you try to attach it.  The foil doesn&#x27;t stay in place in the shaver head.</li>
            <li> I like this  foil and cutter because it is sharp and does a better job than one after it has been used for a year.</li>
            <li> Made my Remington shave like new! Price was very reasonable and shipping very fast. I recommend this to anyone wanting to restore shaving quality.</li>
            <li> The foil is just fine. But the cutter is NOT the same as the cutters used to be. Just because something is a &amp;#34;replacement part&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s the same as the part it&#x27;s ostensibly replacing. This cutter seems to be shorter in width, and the central connecting part does not fit into the housing, We never could get it seated right so that it didn&#x27;t jump out, impelled by the spring. Really, really disappointing.</li>
            <li> Nice fit and well made replacement parts. They last a long time and stay sharp as well. Easy to clean and remove. Nice.</li>
            <li> Everything is perfect.</li>
            <li> My Remington is pretty old. The plastic piece that is attached to the blades was too small for my razors input. I had to detach the old blades plastic piece and replace the plastic on the new razor with it. Works fine now. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Quality on supplied cutter head very poor. Plastic was cheap and wore away a month into it&#x27;s 6 month service life.&lt;br /&gt;Order was initially shipped with half of the ordered parts included though I was charged in full. Partial order was rectified however.</li>
            <li> As advertised, fit and work perfectly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit on Amazon a few weeks ago.  It installed perfectly and worked just fine until yesterday.  Unfortunately, one end of the screen completely wore through while I was shaving (VERY SHARP EDGE EXPOSED), and it left me with a couple of very nasty cuts on the right side of my face before I realized what was happening.  The entire episode took about two seconds. Please be careful shaving!  BTW:  The cutter and screen that came on the shaver lasted four years and was of no danger when it finally wore out.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it is hard to find cutters and foil for this razor but I ordered it and when it came it fit great and worked great</li>
            <li> I put off getting a new foil and cutter for a long time.  I am very please with this foil and cutter set.  The Remington is like NEW!  The delivery was fast the price was right.  I searched many sites before I purchased, this was the best seller.</li>
            <li> This was a perfect fit for the razor, it was easy to install and works like the razor is brand new.</li>
            <li> The microscreen fits okay however the blade does not fit on the pivot in the razor. It has a round hole that is just a bit too large to fit on the pin so I resorted back to my old blade. For the price, next time I&#x27;ll spend more and buy a set that has a better quality.</li>
            <li> The Remington SP-62 foil and cutter refils were exactly what I needed to get my razor back running like new again.</li>
            <li> quited satisfied with the sellers remarks and they lived up to the&lt;br /&gt;products performance and quality. no problem with performance.</li>
            <li> Working out fine - this is my husband&#x27;s.  We have already filled out your first request and do not see why you are asking again.</li>
