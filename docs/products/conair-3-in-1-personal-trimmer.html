    <ol>
            <li>This product is awesome.  </li>
            <li>Great product!!!</li>
            <li>It makes a very attractive addition to my toiletry products.</li>
            <li>it works great for that too!  </li>
            <li>I use it as a bikini trimmer and it works wonderfully!</li>
            <li>After I  charged  the trimmer it worked perfect</li>
            <li>Great transaction on a great product for a great price to a great person.  </li>
            <li>the eyebrow trimmer, the ear and nose hair clipper, etc, all great... while they worked.  </li>
            <li>Plus its lighter and the attachments make it a great kit.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on how it works on a beard, but I can tell you that it&#x27;s great for eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product and thought I was getting a great deal</li>
            <li>I bought it as a gift and my friend said it was perfect ad worked better than anything he&#x27;d used before.</li>
            <li>The trimmer seemed like a good idea in the package..</li>
            <li>If you want to buy a good trimmer, do not select this one.</li>
            <li>rather they were better quality/more durable, but I&#x27;m still going to (relatively) happily buy another.  </li>
            <li>You have to make sure that the charging light is on and it is seated perfectly.  </li>
            <li>If I want to trim more/faster, I use the heavier-duty trimmer on my razor, but this trimmer has better control for finer work - a good complement.  </li>
            <li>Good thing that throwing it in the garbage was easy because it didn&#x27;t cost me anything.</li>
            <li>Buy this because you don&#x27;t want to own 3 separate trimmers and like just one item on you sink top.</li>
            <li>The fact that I can recharge the equipment is great, because it is always ready for use.</li>
            <li>Both trimmers work excellent at trimming facial hair etc.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m not even sure it was *ever</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>It pulls more hair</li>
            <li>, I couldn&#x27;t get the top portion of it to stay locked.</li>
            <li>Seems to work a lot better for me than those circular nasal trimmers.  </li>
            <li>I love it &amp; would recommend it to any woman looking for a bikini trimmer.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product and recommend it :)</li>
            <li>This trimmer does an excellent job up close and personal, in noses, ears and eyebrows,  I  </li>
            <li>when i first bought it i loved the attachments.  </li>
            <li>it is good for trimming hair, but I don&#x27;t think it cuts very close.</li>
            <li>The plastic accessories are brittle and break easily.</li>
            <li>The plastic guide does not stay in place easily, and this leads to holes in the beard.  </li>
            <li>It can need a lot of force to get it unsnapped, then it easily lifts off.  </li>
            <li>The plastic trimming guides do not remain in place and break easily.  </li>
            <li>it was so easy,  </li>
            <li>It still cuts a goatee just fine.</li>
            <li>This item worked fine for 9 months.</li>
            <li>The fine \\&quot;brow\\&quot; trimmer is really good for the really fine work, trimming hairs near lips, etc.</li>
            <li>I received this trimmer as a free item when I bought my electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Works fabulous and I like that I don&#x27;t have to buy batteries for it.</li>
            <li>I have owned this model for the last 7 years and it still works great.</li>
            <li>Yes, it feels cheaply made and it doesn&#x27;t seat well in the charger.  </li>
            <li>i didnt particularly care since i bought it more for the eyebrow and nose trimmer, and more to shape my beard than to trim it.</li>
            <li>Product arrived safely and very very well packaged.</li>
            <li>so it wouldnt charge, but i couldnt figure out any way to make them connect, and i&#x27;m a pretty inventive guy.  </li>
            <li>This is just the right size - and it is multi-functional!</li>
            <li>For trimming those hard to reach areas, this item is probably the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This trimmer works great and you don&#x27;t have to be careful at all, it will not pull or pinch your skin.</li>
            <li>, you just shove it up there and hope for the best, and they have a thick wall, limiting closeness of cut.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this if you plan to trim a full beard.</li>
            <li>The first trimmer I received didn&#x27;t work, this was the first time I had to return anything to Amazon, it was  so easy!</li>
            <li>Was very happy to find it at such a super low price.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve had no trouble with it and more than 5 years of use, not bad for under $20.</li>
            <li>The large beard trimmer attachment does fine for me free-handed; I don&#x27;t bother with the comb guides.  </li>
            <li>Mb1000 Complete Beard and Mustache Trimmer with Bonus Nose Ear Trimmer\\&quot; which I hope will be much better made.</li>
            <li>But for a $15 trimmer to work for 7 years; I think I got my  money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>To be honest I only use one of the head attachments to trim all.  </li>
            <li>Hands down the best trimmer in the western hemisphere!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I never write reviews but this is such a wonderful little trimmer that I had to share.</li>
            <li>I love my blue Conair clipper for light shaving (leaving that shadow on my face) and wanted an extra one for the beach house, but it wasn&#x27;t available, so I bought this.  </li>
            <li>Bought one of these recently and just love it.  </li>
            <li>The tip of the nose/brow trimmer gets painfully hot and pulls rather than cuts hair.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It broke on the first use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But if your willing to pay $295.34 for this piece of junk ,I have a bridge l&#x27;d like to sell you.</li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m a repeat customer; can&#x27;t find another trimmer set with all of these features, and around $20 is OK even if it only lasts a couple of years.  </li>
            <li>It couldn&#x27;t be more different.  </li>
            <li>3) Interchangeable Head Design: The various cutter heads are designed to slip onto the top of the handle/base and then rotated to lock the head into place.  </li>
            <li>This product has many different attachments that covered everything needed.</li>
            <li>product didn&#x27;t last more than 2 months .  </li>
            <li>The unit does a pretty good job of trimming but the heads get dull rather quickly plus after awhile</li>
            <li>This product looks very nice and has a lot of features, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>Its very small and has many, many uses.</li>
            <li>this product looks good &amp; is small.</li>
            <li>in case my title doesn&#x27;t give you a strong enough impression, let me explain:&lt;BR&gt;</li>
            <li>, my husband has a  large mustache and is very particular on how it is trimmed.  </li>
            <li>Bought one 5 years ago &amp; decided it was time for a new one,  this was the only  one I looked at as I was so pleased with the lst one.</li>
            <li>I was searching for a new electric shaver when I saw this in the bottom navigation and laughed at the memories of owning this a few years ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though the blades dont cut very well..</li>
            <li>It really does the job efficiently.</li>
            <li>Now it removes very efficiently the hairs that protrude from the nostrel and also from the ear lobe.</li>
            <li>Normally priced much higher.   </li>
            <li>and it trimmed very well,</li>
            <li>if you really feel like giving this company money, just send them a check and save yourself the aggravation.</li>
            <li>I really like this trimmer</li>
            <li>highly  recommend!  </li>
            <li>Was very dissapointed with this product.</li>
            <li>and I really like the eyebrow attachment to trim my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find the designated nose hair attachment to work very well.  </li>
            <li>The locking attachments wore out very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I use it to trim nose and ear hair (we old folks have more there than on our heads) and to keep my mustache off my upper lip.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product for the cheap price, just don&#x27;t expect miracles without a little experimentation.</li>
            <li>The flat trimmer for fine hair (ears, neck, bikini) work well also for those areas in particular.</li>
            <li>Though not \\&quot;high-end\\&quot; this device does a decent job of trimming with attachments for anything you may need.</li>
            <li>works decent for nose and eyebrow trimming..</li>
            <li>the main problems i had were:&lt;BR&gt;1)</li>
            <li>The unit came with two trimmer guides which snap on to the main trimmer head to allow you to fine-tune the length of beard/mustach you want.  </li>
            <li>The guide slips onto the tip of the trimmer (near the teeth) and there are \\&quot;hooks or claws\\&quot; which you are supposed to snap over the back of the trimmer head and secure the guide into place.  </li>
            <li>and the main head broke within a couple of months.</li>
            <li>However when it comes to performance it does a decent job of trimming nose hair, ear hair and eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s cheap and has multiple attachments, but it&#x27;s cheaply made and you&#x27;ll be on Amazon in a few weeks or so looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li>and I have had no issues with the new one.</li>
            <li>Once we even went so far as to contact the mfgr and purchased a few more replacement heads just to have them on hand.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found you have to keep it clean because it&#x27;s not very powerful</li>
            <li>The only difference being the first was not rechargable.</li>
            <li>The second one just died after about 2 years, the first lasted perhaps 5.  </li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer to replace one I had almost exactly the same that quit working after about 7 or 8 years.</li>
            <li>This is the second one we have used (the first one lasted 3 years..?)</li>
            <li>It worked great when it was new out of the box, but after a few months, it slowly stopped charging the trimmer.</li>
            <li>I would spend a little more and get a different unit.</li>
            <li>Works just like my old 1.  </li>
            <li>then it cuts, cheap plastic pieces broke in a matter of days, and it stopped holding the charge after just a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li>So far, it works well.</li>
            <li>Although I like the rechargable feature, I hope the unit works this well when it is as old as the one I replaced.</li>
            <li>Works fabulously as a bikini line trimmer, since many of the other trimmers can be just too large for the job or have difficult cords to negotiate.  </li>
            <li>I printed out a slip put in in the box and UPS  picked it up the  next day the new trimmer was delivered!  </li>
            <li>I purchased this item to replace and older Wahl trimmer that finally went tango uniform.</li>
            <li>Although the trimmer works well for my particular purposes, I am rating this particular model only as OK (3 stars) because it has a few minor flaws which the prior models did not.  </li>
            <li>This was my second one of these, the first one lasted over 8 years with very regular use.  </li>
            <li>and right up against other hair that you don&#x27;t want trimmed.  </li>
            <li>I had an earlier version of this conair product that lasted for years, so naturally I bought a new one.</li>
            <li>It has a long battery life for those really overgrown areas.</li>
            <li>Shipping costs about same as new one.</li>
            <li>My old trimmer (same model) lasted nearly 10 years and wouldn&#x27;t consider anything else.</li>
            <li>Tried to repair both by replacing the NiCad AA cell, but it seems that the motors have worn out; they run a little with no load and perhaps a push with a fresh alkalyne cell.  </li>
            <li>The stand is small enough to fit in the corner of your bathroom and conveniently holds all the attachments.  </li>
            <li>The product works well but only for maybe 6-9 months before it completely &amp;#34;dies&amp;#34; and has to be replaced.  </li>
            <li>I figured it would be generally the same.  </li>
            <li>The charge seems to last long so far.</li>
            <li>If you instead try to first separate the upper clam shell halves, the locking pins on the round cap will break (made this mistake twice now).  </li>
            <li>The nose hair trimmer has an almost bare, narrow, flat blade, letting you trim very close and where you want.  </li>

            <li> when i first bought it i loved the attachments.  </li>
            <li> it is good for trimming hair, but I don&#x27;t think it cuts very close.</li>

            <li> it was so easy,  </li>
            <li> It still cuts a goatee just fine.</li>
            <li> This item worked fine for 9 months.</li>
            <li> The fine \\&quot;brow\\&quot; trimmer is really good for the really fine work, trimming hairs near lips, etc.</li>
            <li> I received this trimmer as a free item when I bought my electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Works fabulous and I like that I don&#x27;t have to buy batteries for it.</li>

            <li> I was searching for a new electric shaver when I saw this in the bottom navigation and laughed at the memories of owning this a few years ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though the blades dont cut very well..</li>
            <li> It really does the job efficiently.</li>
            <li> Now it removes very efficiently the hairs that protrude from the nostrel and also from the ear lobe.</li>
            <li> Normally priced much higher.   </li>
            <li> and it trimmed very well,</li>
            <li> if you really feel like giving this company money, just send them a check and save yourself the aggravation.</li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer</li>
            <li> highly  recommend!  </li>
            <li> Was very dissapointed with this product.</li>
            <li> and I really like the eyebrow attachment to trim my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the designated nose hair attachment to work very well.  </li>
            <li> The locking attachments wore out very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I use it to trim nose and ear hair (we old folks have more there than on our heads) and to keep my mustache off my upper lip.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product for the cheap price, just don&#x27;t expect miracles without a little experimentation.</li>
            <li> The flat trimmer for fine hair (ears, neck, bikini) work well also for those areas in particular.</li>
            <li> Though not \\&quot;high-end\\&quot; this device does a decent job of trimming with attachments for anything you may need.</li>
            <li> works decent for nose and eyebrow trimming..</li>
            <li> the main problems i had were:&lt;BR&gt;1)</li>
            <li> The unit came with two trimmer guides which snap on to the main trimmer head to allow you to fine-tune the length of beard/mustach you want.  </li>
            <li> The guide slips onto the tip of the trimmer (near the teeth) and there are \\&quot;hooks or claws\\&quot; which you are supposed to snap over the back of the trimmer head and secure the guide into place.  </li>
            <li> and the main head broke within a couple of months.</li>
            <li> However when it comes to performance it does a decent job of trimming nose hair, ear hair and eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s cheap and has multiple attachments, but it&#x27;s cheaply made and you&#x27;ll be on Amazon in a few weeks or so looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li> and I have had no issues with the new one.</li>
            <li> Once we even went so far as to contact the mfgr and purchased a few more replacement heads just to have them on hand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found you have to keep it clean because it&#x27;s not very powerful</li>
            <li> The only difference being the first was not rechargable.</li>
            <li> The second one just died after about 2 years, the first lasted perhaps 5.  </li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace one I had almost exactly the same that quit working after about 7 or 8 years.</li>
            <li> This is the second one we have used (the first one lasted 3 years..?)</li>
            <li> It worked great when it was new out of the box, but after a few months, it slowly stopped charging the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I would spend a little more and get a different unit.</li>
            <li> Works just like my old 1.  </li>
            <li> then it cuts, cheap plastic pieces broke in a matter of days, and it stopped holding the charge after just a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> So far, it works well.</li>
            <li> Although I like the rechargable feature, I hope the unit works this well when it is as old as the one I replaced.</li>
            <li> Works fabulously as a bikini line trimmer, since many of the other trimmers can be just too large for the job or have difficult cords to negotiate.  </li>
            <li> I printed out a slip put in in the box and UPS  picked it up the  next day the new trimmer was delivered!  </li>
            <li> I purchased this item to replace and older Wahl trimmer that finally went tango uniform.</li>
            <li> Although the trimmer works well for my particular purposes, I am rating this particular model only as OK (3 stars) because it has a few minor flaws which the prior models did not.  </li>
            <li> This was my second one of these, the first one lasted over 8 years with very regular use.  </li>
            <li> and right up against other hair that you don&#x27;t want trimmed.  </li>
            <li> I had an earlier version of this conair product that lasted for years, so naturally I bought a new one.</li>
            <li> It has a long battery life for those really overgrown areas.</li>
            <li> Shipping costs about same as new one.</li>
            <li> My old trimmer (same model) lasted nearly 10 years and wouldn&#x27;t consider anything else.</li>
            <li> Tried to repair both by replacing the NiCad AA cell, but it seems that the motors have worn out; they run a little with no load and perhaps a push with a fresh alkalyne cell.  </li>
            <li> The stand is small enough to fit in the corner of your bathroom and conveniently holds all the attachments.  </li>
            <li> The product works well but only for maybe 6-9 months before it completely &amp;#34;dies&amp;#34; and has to be replaced.  </li>
            <li> I figured it would be generally the same.  </li>
            <li> The charge seems to last long so far.</li>
            <li> If you instead try to first separate the upper clam shell halves, the locking pins on the round cap will break (made this mistake twice now).  </li>
            <li> The nose hair trimmer has an almost bare, narrow, flat blade, letting you trim very close and where you want.  </li>
            <li> the unit doesn&#x27;t recharge well enough to hold the charge long enough to finish the trim job.  </li>
            <li> This is a decent trimmer for small jobs such as nose , ears and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> it got dull so fast</li>
            <li> but I just cant recommend it based on how long it works.</li>
            <li> The comb is minor, but works well for me for lifting/trimming sideburns, eyebrows, etc.  </li>
            <li> I use the nose and eyebrow trimmer every other day, the beard attachment takes a gentle touch but will trim a small goatee easily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The other seems to be made for non-rechargables and does not have the same type of attachments.  </li>
            <li> No more tweezers, no more hot wax!  </li>
            <li> admit this tries to be many things and fails at half of them.</li>
            <li> Not worth the expense to return it and less than 6 months old..</li>
            <li> I went through 2 other trimmers before ordering this one, the others pulled or pinched my skin even when I was being careful and even left marks on my skin</li>
            <li> My first trimmer is still working after years of use, but the battery hinge has broken from changing batteries.</li>
            <li> It worked correctly for less than a month and shortly thereafter would not turn on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the guards on it, so I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell you about that, but it seems like all the bad ratings are from men trying to use it as a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> I am SO happy I didn&#x27;t have to pay a dime for it because this shaver is horrible.</li>
            <li> So the long hair attachments in my opinion are pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> Never got it wet....</li>
            <li> I suspect this is the intent or result of tight tolerances, but my previous models had a different design which took no force to complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took a while to arrive due to postal requirements placed on the product due to over-sized packaging.   </li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers that this product is a piece of junk.       </li>
            <li> I used it once and threw it away, after having to shave off the rest of the beard due to the damage this caused.</li>
            <li> Maybe should be 3 stars due to lack of durability, but gave it 4 &#x27;cause I can&#x27;t find anything else \\&quot;as good\\&quot; for me.  </li>
            <li> If my son hadn&#x27;t mistakenly crushed it, I wouldn&#x27;t be buying another!</li>
            <li> This puppy won&#x27;t let you down.</li>
            <li> They each broke down and stopped working around 9 months in.</li>
            <li> I like to run the battery down before recharging so</li>
            <li> It feels like a piece of junk, and, sure enough, after about 6 uses its on-off switch failed so that, this morning, it was impossible to shut off after I used it.  </li>
            <li> So it has twice the use as a bikini trimmer with half the price...</li>
            <li> If I could give it half of one star I&#x27;d think that was generous.</li>
            <li> Is only subtly mentioned inthe Amazon review, not the product description.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to mess with buying batteries or having less power as they lose strength.</li>
            <li> You can see where the blade is and put it in tight places.  </li>
            <li> But the little plastic heads break often.</li>
            <li> These are expensive and don&#x27;t last very long.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dead.</li>
            <li> Bought a few battery operated ones.  </li>
            <li> For those that want to try battery replacement, the bottom round cap can be released/removed by giving it a &lt;1/8 twist counter-clockwise.  </li>
            <li> I have not had any trouble with contact between trimmer &amp; charger.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer does not cut well, causing an uneven and choppy look to one&#x27;s beard.</li>
            <li> With the two trimmer heads that I use, it takes moderate force to initially push the head onto the base prior to the rotation step.  </li>
            <li> The charger is within the black base, and a fixed cord comes out the back.  </li>
            <li> The nose-hair trimmer works as well as the others of this type that I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I bought in the fall of 2012 and it completely lost its cutting edge by Jan/Feb of 2013.</li>
            <li> It feels and looks incredibly cheap and is simply awful when used.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see all of the negative reviews when I bought it.  </li>
            <li> the trimmer is louder than past models, so when I trim my side burns the noise is irritating to the nearby ear. 2)</li>
            <li> However, this time, the product stopped charging after just a few months, making it useless.</li>
            <li> I felt sheer pleasure in smashing this piece of crap onto the floor.</li>
            <li> Also don&#x27;t get this confused with another Conair 3-in-1 trimmer I saw on Ebay when I went looking for a replacement.  </li>
            <li> but this product is of poor quality.</li>
            <li> i hate this company b/c of this product and b/c of a horrible hair buzzer i bought of theirs that yanked more hair out than it cut, but i&#x27;ll stick to this product in this rant.  </li>
            <li> I felt terrible; until I discovered this gem and now it works like a charm, just like my old used to.  </li>
            <li> Horrible product... maybe use if you&#x27;re using it on hair so long that it doesn&#x27;t have to contact the skin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> i hate this product.  </li>
            <li> it appears to me the contacts didnt connect btwn the shaver and the base</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a worthless piece of Chinese-made junk.</li>
            <li> (plus it was painful!).</li>
            <li> Worst trimmer</li>

            <li> I had an earlier version of this conair product that lasted for years, so naturally I bought a new one. However, this time, the product stopped charging after just a few months, making it useless.</li>
            <li> It feels like a piece of junk, and, sure enough, after about 6 uses its on-off switch failed so that, this morning, it was impossible to shut off after I used it.  I waited until it&#x27;s battery died before putting in the trash.  I&#x27;ve just order a \\&quot;Remington Mb1000 Complete Beard and Mustache Trimmer with Bonus Nose Ear Trimmer\\&quot; which I hope will be much better made.</li>
            <li> My old trimmer (same model) lasted nearly 10 years and wouldn&#x27;t consider anything else. Though not \\&quot;high-end\\&quot; this device does a decent job of trimming with attachments for anything you may need.</li>
            <li> Not only does the plastic guide continuously fall off but the length setting does not remain where you set it. I felt sheer pleasure in smashing this piece of crap onto the floor. Of course now I have a scraggly beard.  meh</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.  Its very small and has many, many uses. The stand is small enough to fit in the corner of your bathroom and conveniently holds all the attachments.  I bought this one because of its size and price.  Being a woman, I have found that this can also be used on those pesky eyebrows for trimming and shaping.  So it has twice the use as a bikini trimmer with half the price...Great product!!!</li>
            <li> Bought one of these recently and just love it.  Works fabulously as a bikini line trimmer, since many of the other trimmers can be just too large for the job or have difficult cords to negotiate.  This is just the right size - and it is multi-functional!</li>
            <li> For trimming those hard to reach areas, this item is probably the best I have ever used. It has a long battery life for those really overgrown areas. This puppy won&#x27;t let you down. Hands down the best trimmer in the western hemisphere!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The trimmer seemed like a good idea in the package.. Though the blades dont cut very well.. I found yself going through the same spots over and over.. Does not work well with hair longer than 1/8 inch. So the long hair attachments in my opinion are pretty much useless. works decent for nose and eyebrow trimming.. I would spend a little more and get a different unit.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is just what I wanted. It really does the job efficiently. Now it removes very efficiently the hairs that protrude from the nostrel and also from the ear lobe. My eyebrows can be trimmed so that I do not look like some monster from outer space. The fact that I can recharge the equipment is great, because it is always ready for use. It makes a very attractive addition to my toiletry products.</li>
            <li> Great transaction on a great product for a great price to a great person.  I used to have a 3 in 1 personal trimmer that someone gave me, but accidentally dropped it and broke it.  I felt terrible; until I discovered this gem and now it works like a charm, just like my old used to.  Was very happy to find it at such a super low price. Normally priced much higher.   It took a while to arrive due to postal requirements placed on the product due to over-sized packaging.   So instead of arriving in one week, I got it in three weeks, but no harm done.   Product arrived safely and very very well packaged.</li>
            <li> Bought one 5 years ago &amp; decided it was time for a new one,  this was the only  one I looked at as I was so pleased with the lst one.</li>
            <li> This is the second Conair trimmer I have owned like this. The only difference being the first was not rechargable. Both trimmers work excellent at trimming facial hair etc., I would not suggest as a haircut tool and I don&#x27;t think that this tool was intended for that. The charge seems to last long so far. I have used this trimmer for about a month and haven&#x27;t had to charge. My first trimmer is still working after years of use, but the battery hinge has broken from changing batteries. Hence the purchase of the rechargeable. I would recommend this product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I had one of these. The plastic accessories are brittle and break easily. When the $0.75 plastic guide breaks you are out of luck. They don&#x27;t sell them and they don&#x27;t answer e-mail asking about a replacement. If I could give it half of one star I&#x27;d think that was generous.</li>
            <li> I have purchased two of these units. They each broke down and stopped working around 9 months in. I took one of them in to get repaired because I just thought the rechargeable battery was defective, but no it was the unit itself. These are expensive and don&#x27;t last very long.    I like the versatility of all of the tools (can trim eyebrow etc...) and it trimmed very well, but I just cant recommend it based on how long it works.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers that this product is a piece of junk.       The plastic pieces on the trimmer attachment broke the second time I used it.      If you want to buy a good trimmer, do not select this one.</li>
            <li> The plastic guide does not stay in place easily, and this leads to holes in the beard.  I used it once and threw it away, after having to shave off the rest of the beard due to the damage this caused.</li>
            <li> in case my title doesn&#x27;t give you a strong enough impression, let me explain:&lt;BR&gt;i hate this product.  i hate this company b/c of this product and b/c of a horrible hair buzzer i bought of theirs that yanked more hair out than it cut, but i&#x27;ll stick to this product in this rant.  &lt;BR&gt;when i first bought it i loved the attachments.  the eyebrow trimmer, the ear and nose hair clipper, etc, all great... while they worked.  the main problems i had were:&lt;BR&gt;1) the plastic beard length guide broke almost immediately.  i didnt particularly care since i bought it more for the eyebrow and nose trimmer, and more to shape my beard than to trim it. &lt;BR&gt;2) it got dull so fast i&#x27;m not even sure it was *ever* sharp.&lt;BR&gt;3) it stopped charging after a couple weeks.  it appears to me the contacts didnt connect btwn the shaver and the base so it wouldnt charge, but i couldnt figure out any way to make them connect, and i&#x27;m a pretty inventive guy.  &lt;br /&gt;in summary: garbage garbage garbage garbage garbage.  if you really feel like giving this company money, just send them a check and save yourself the aggravation.</li>
            <li> Low quality, thus the low price. It worked great when it was new out of the box, but after a few months, it slowly stopped charging the trimmer. I could jiggle it, the lights would come on and start charging again. Recently, it stopped altogether.  It&#x27;s dead. Time for another unit and another brand.</li>
            <li> This is a decent trimmer for small jobs such as nose , ears and eyebrows.I like that I don&#x27;t have to mess with buying batteries or having less power as they lose strength.</li>
            <li> Had this trimmer for 10 years until I accidentally broke it.  Tried buying anew 1 but couldnt find it.  Bought a few battery operated ones.  They all sukttttt.  Didn&#x27;t cut close enough.  Tried amazon and they had it. Works just like my old 1.  Love it</li>
            <li> I like it. I can&#x27;t find another one at our local stores.  We have had one for about a year with no problems.</li>
            <li> I received this trimmer as a free item when I bought my electric shaver. I am SO happy I didn&#x27;t have to pay a dime for it because this shaver is horrible. It feels and looks incredibly cheap and is simply awful when used. It pulls more hair then it cuts, cheap plastic pieces broke in a matter of days, and it stopped holding the charge after just a few weeks of use. Good thing that throwing it in the garbage was easy because it didn&#x27;t cost me anything. Don&#x27;t spend a dollar on that thing, you WILL regret it.</li>
            <li> Works fabulous and I like that I don&#x27;t have to buy batteries for it. My last one had batteries and everytime I took it apart to put batteries in it, I couldn&#x27;t get the top portion of it to stay locked. Plus its lighter and the attachments make it a great kit.</li>
            <li> this product looks good &amp; is small. it is good for trimming hair, but I don&#x27;t think it cuts very close. When you&#x27;re trying to outline your beard, it doesn&#x27;t cut close enough to provide an outline. I still have to use a razor to shape and outline.</li>
            <li> This product looks very nice and has a lot of features, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long. It worked correctly for less than a month and shortly thereafter would not turn on. I cleaned it and did everything the manual suggested. I would not recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to replace and older Wahl trimmer that finally went tango uniform. I use it to trim nose and ear hair (we old folks have more there than on our heads) and to keep my mustache off my upper lip. So far, it works well. It is rechargable and uses a battery that is not replacable. Although I like the rechargable feature, I hope the unit works this well when it is as old as the one I replaced.</li>
            <li> The tip of the nose/brow trimmer gets painfully hot and pulls rather than cuts hair. The unit lost the ability to charge after a month or so - had to jam a piece of paper in there to make it sit on the leads. It&#x27;s a worthless piece of Chinese-made junk. Do not buy this.</li>
            <li> Husband has purchased several of these and similar products over the years.  Once we even went so far as to contact the mfgr and purchased a few more replacement heads just to have them on hand.  In his opinion a head only lasts a month or two.  The unit does a pretty good job of trimming but the heads get dull rather quickly plus after awhile the unit doesn&#x27;t recharge well enough to hold the charge long enough to finish the trim job.  The product works well but only for maybe 6-9 months before it completely &amp;#34;dies&amp;#34; and has to be replaced.  Sadly haven&#x27;t found any unit that works any better or lasts any longer.</li>
            <li> No way is that price right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought one at big lots for $12.99&lt;br /&gt;It broke on the first use. Worst trimmer I&#x27;ve ever bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t deserve one star.&lt;br /&gt;It deserves a beware sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if your willing to pay $295.34 for this piece of junk ,I have a bridge l&#x27;d like to sell you.</li>
            <li> This product hurts did not work well.</li>
            <li> I am about to buy my third of these Conair trimmers.  The second one just died after about 2 years, the first lasted perhaps 5.  Tried to repair both by replacing the NiCad AA cell, but it seems that the motors have worn out; they run a little with no load and perhaps a push with a fresh alkalyne cell.  I&#x27;d rather they were better quality/more durable, but I&#x27;m still going to (relatively) happily buy another.  The large beard trimmer attachment does fine for me free-handed; I don&#x27;t bother with the comb guides.  If I want to trim more/faster, I use the heavier-duty trimmer on my razor, but this trimmer has better control for finer work - a good complement.  The nose hair trimmer has an almost bare, narrow, flat blade, letting you trim very close and where you want.  Seems to work a lot better for me than those circular nasal trimmers.  You can see where the blade is and put it in tight places.  Seems like with the circular ones, you just shove it up there and hope for the best, and they have a thick wall, limiting closeness of cut.  The fine \\&quot;brow\\&quot; trimmer is really good for the really fine work, trimming hairs near lips, etc. and right up against other hair that you don&#x27;t want trimmed.  The comb is minor, but works well for me for lifting/trimming sideburns, eyebrows, etc.  So that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m a repeat customer; can&#x27;t find another trimmer set with all of these features, and around $20 is OK even if it only lasts a couple of years.  For those that want to try battery replacement, the bottom round cap can be released/removed by giving it a &lt;1/8 twist counter-clockwise.  It can need a lot of force to get it unsnapped, then it easily lifts off.  If you instead try to first separate the upper clam shell halves, the locking pins on the round cap will break (made this mistake twice now).  The cell is a standard AA NiCad, not soldered.  I don&#x27;t know if the charger will work with different-type rechargables.  By the way, this is a rechargable unit.  Is only subtly mentioned inthe Amazon review, not the product description.  The charger is within the black base, and a fixed cord comes out the back.  Standard 2-prong AC plug, no wall wart.  In some future spare time, I hope to do a hack and set it up as a removable cord to reduce counter clutter (have a spare now).  I like to run the battery down before recharging so don&#x27;t leave it plugged in.  I have not had any trouble with contact between trimmer &amp; charger.  Also don&#x27;t get this confused with another Conair 3-in-1 trimmer I saw on Ebay when I went looking for a replacement.  The other seems to be made for non-rechargables and does not have the same type of attachments.  Maybe should be 3 stars due to lack of durability, but gave it 4 &#x27;cause I can&#x27;t find anything else \\&quot;as good\\&quot; for me.  Your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> The plastic trimming guides do not remain in place and break easily.  I only used the product three times before the guide broke.  The trimmer does not cut well, causing an uneven and choppy look to one&#x27;s beard.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on how it works on a beard, but I can tell you that it&#x27;s great for eyebrows.  No more tweezers, no more hot wax!  Yes, ladies have nosehair too......it works great for that too!  I really like this trimmer and I wish I would  have it purchased sooner.</li>
            <li> I bought this thing and the plastic guard that adjusts the trim length broke in two weeks - junk, junk, junk</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but this is such a wonderful little trimmer that I had to share. I bought this trimmer to replace one I had almost exactly the same that quit working after about 7 or 8 years. I use it as a bikini trimmer and it works wonderfully! I don&#x27;t use the guards on it, so I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell you about that, but it seems like all the bad ratings are from men trying to use it as a beard trimmer. I went through 2 other trimmers before ordering this one, the others pulled or pinched my skin even when I was being careful and even left marks on my skin (plus it was painful!). This trimmer works great and you don&#x27;t have to be careful at all, it will not pull or pinch your skin. I love it &amp; would recommend it to any woman looking for a bikini trimmer.</li>
            <li> I love my blue Conair clipper for light shaving (leaving that shadow on my face) and wanted an extra one for the beach house, but it wasn&#x27;t available, so I bought this.  I figured it would be generally the same.  It couldn&#x27;t be more different.  The metal on the clippers hurts to bring across the face and it DOES NOT CUT ANYTHING.  Horrible product... maybe use if you&#x27;re using it on hair so long that it doesn&#x27;t have to contact the skin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;0 stars</li>
            <li> This is my third version of this basic design of trimmer.  Although the trimmer works well for my particular purposes, I am rating this particular model only as OK (3 stars) because it has a few minor flaws which the prior models did not.  1) Noise:  the trimmer is louder than past models, so when I trim my side burns the noise is irritating to the nearby ear. 2) Trimmer Guides: The unit came with two trimmer guides which snap on to the main trimmer head to allow you to fine-tune the length of beard/mustach you want.  The guide slips onto the tip of the trimmer (near the teeth) and there are \\&quot;hooks or claws\\&quot; which you are supposed to snap over the back of the trimmer head and secure the guide into place.  My concern is that the force it takes to snap the guide into place combined with the guide being made of plastic may someday result in the guide breaking into pieces.  This has not happened yet, but it is a concern.  3) Interchangeable Head Design: The various cutter heads are designed to slip onto the top of the handle/base and then rotated to lock the head into place.  With the two trimmer heads that I use, it takes moderate force to initially push the head onto the base prior to the rotation step.  Each time I do this, I wonder if I am breaking the unit or if it is made this way.  I suspect this is the intent or result of tight tolerances, but my previous models had a different design which took no force to complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, all the trimmer functions that I or my wife utilize work well.  The beard/mustach trimmer head and guides trim the hair as desired.  The nose-hair trimmer works as well as the others of this type that I have used in the past.  I have never used a rotary type nose hair trimmer, so I can&#x27;t compare the two types.  The flat trimmer for fine hair (ears, neck, bikini) work well also for those areas in particular.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it does. It keeps a charge for days. But the little plastic heads break often. This is the second one we have used (the first one lasted 3 years..?) and the main head broke within a couple of months.</li>
            <li> this is for my dad. i got him one years ago and i died. get another one. so that speaks for it&#x27;s self</li>
            <li> I have owned this model for the last 7 years and it still works great. I have changed the rechargeable battery out 3 times it is simple and uses over the counter AA rechargeable. It still cuts a goatee just fine. Don&#x27;t buy this if you plan to trim a full beard. Buy this because you don&#x27;t want to own 3 separate trimmers and like just one item on you sink top. I use the nose and eyebrow trimmer every other day, the beard attachment takes a gentle touch but will trim a small goatee easily.&lt;br /&gt;I admit this tries to be many things and fails at half of them. But for a $15 trimmer to work for 7 years; I think I got my  money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found you have to keep it clean because it&#x27;s not very powerful but I&#x27;ve had no trouble with it and more than 5 years of use, not bad for under $20. If my son hadn&#x27;t mistakenly crushed it, I wouldn&#x27;t be buying another!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this - mine lasted for one charge. I didn&#x27;t realize my husband had not informed me that it did not work until today - which is the reason for the delayed review - or I would have asked for my money back.  I didn&#x27;t see all of the negative reviews when I bought it.  What a piece of junk.  I had a Wahl that looked just like this that lasted for years.  Amazon should give us our money back.</li>
            <li> This item worked fine for 9 months. It then stopped taking a charge. Calling Conair service no help. You have to mail it to them at your expense and pay for mail back to you. This is while it is under warranty. Shipping costs about same as new one. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> excelente producto de acabados muy fino y material impecable lo recomiendo 100 por ciento la maquina trae lo justo para una depilación perfecta.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift and my friend said it was perfect ad worked better than anything he&#x27;d used before.</li>
            <li> This product has many different attachments that covered everything needed. I have only used it once, but it definitely did the job. I am pleased with this product and recommend it :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and thought I was getting a great deal but this product is of poor quality. I followed manufacturers directions regarding charging time and proper usage but after it never worked, after 2 days it still did not work. I then attempted to open the battery area to check it and it stopped charging afterwards and the battery was emitting a white liquid. Conair.....Never again.</li>
            <li> The first trimmer I received didn&#x27;t work, this was the first time I had to return anything to Amazon, it was  so easy! I printed out a slip put in in the box and UPS  picked it up the  next day the new trimmer was delivered!  After I  charged  the trimmer it worked perfect, my husband has a  large mustache and is very particular on how it is trimmed.  This trimmer does an excellent job up close and personal, in noses, ears and eyebrows,  I  highly  recommend!  Also Amazon did NOT  disappoint  on returning  an  item that  was defective,  it was so easy,  that is why everyone should shop Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> product didn&#x27;t last more than 2 months .  Was very dissapointed with this product. It stopped working after using it for only 2 months</li>
            <li> I bought in the fall of 2012 and it completely lost its cutting edge by Jan/Feb of 2013. Never got it wet....It became totallty unuseable and would not cut. I finally threw it away in April 2013. Not worth the expense to return it and less than 6 months old.. Very disappointing. I would give it 0 stars if possible</li>
            <li> This was my second one of these, the first one lasted over 8 years with very regular use.  I seems like a very solid unit and I have had no issues with the new one.</li>
            <li> I have owned this product for about five years and I really like the eyebrow attachment to trim my eyebrows.  That unit finally stopped charging so I just picked up another one on Amazon.  Yes, it feels cheaply made and it doesn&#x27;t seat well in the charger.  You have to make sure that the charging light is on and it is seated perfectly.  However when it comes to performance it does a decent job of trimming nose hair, ear hair and eyebrows.  To be honest I only use one of the head attachments to trim all.  I don&#x27;t find the designated nose hair attachment to work very well.  Not a bad product for the cheap price, just don&#x27;t expect miracles without a little experimentation.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a new electric shaver when I saw this in the bottom navigation and laughed at the memories of owning this a few years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t purchase this product. I know it&#x27;s cheap and has multiple attachments, but it&#x27;s cheaply made and you&#x27;ll be on Amazon in a few weeks or so looking for a replacement. The locking attachments wore out very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this. You&#x27;ve been warned.</li>
