            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>Found a pair of boots that I loved.</li>
            <li>It was good stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>I loved them</li>
            <li>Does really good when used with a combination of mechanical shoe stretchers</li>
            <li>It does a fairly good job</li>
            <li>was lucky and found Meltonian online, and In my opinion, Meltonian products are the very best for leather care.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the way this product worked</li>
            <li>Although this product did not work with every type of shoe, I am very pleased with the outcome.</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing...</li>
            <li>Made a great looking pair of shoes supremely comfortable as well</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t honestly say if you buy this all your problems will be resolved.</li>
            <li>Nice because you use the product and then wear the shoe or boot to stretch it.</li>
            <li>I tried to use a shoe stretch, but found that my own foot was all I need.  </li>
            <li>should buy good fitting shoes, but this works temporarily</li>
            <li>I like that it is a spray as it was very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This worked wonderfully and made the inside of the boots soft!</li>
            <li>The right one fit perfectly...</li>
            <li>this one has seems the best so far.</li>
            <li>Maybe works better with thinner leather??</li>
            <li>It worked ok.  </li>
            <li>This idea worked better than this spray that didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Spraying with this product loosens the leather so that my shoes are comfortable and stretch in the strained spots and save me the blisters and sore feet!</li>
            <li>I love this shoe stretch-aerosol.</li>
            <li>I repeated the process as it say to do, and now i can wear my favorite shoes without pain...</li>
            <li>I had two pairs that I love, but just couldn&#x27;t wear for any length of time.</li>
            <li>I need more</li>
            <li>I wish I had realized there were products like this many years ago</li>
            <li>I shook it up many times, tried to spray, nothing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>All I will say, it is ok.</li>
            <li>and this helped make more room without staining.</li>
            <li>I have worn the shoes for a couple weeks and still nothing, but I&#x27;m hoping over time they stretch a bit more.  </li>
            <li>I purchased some cute knee-high, zip-up Steve Madden leather boots.</li>
            <li>I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be able to spend any amount of time in them.  </li>
            <li>Now they&#x27;re one of my favorite pair of shoes!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Meltonian Shoe Stretch product does work although you may need to apply the product more than once.  </li>
            <li>I used this along with the wooden shoe stretcher and it worked perfect.</li>
            <li>MAGIC.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Works OK but it stopped spraying even though you can tell there&#x27;s still a lot in the can.</li>
            <li>Ok so i recieved this shoe spray on time and all, but i don&#x27;t get how this works</li>
            <li>It took more than 1 treatment but work well.</li>
            <li>And to the reviewers complaining about the S&amp;H, I don&#x27;t know for sure</li>
            <li>the boots fit like they were custom made for my feet!</li>
            <li>Most worked better.</li>
            <li>Had to stretch the calf of my favorite boots almost two inches</li>
            <li>I now have more shoes I am able to wear.</li>
            <li>I have bunions that make most of my heels hurt.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be able to do a mother-son dance without pain.</li>
            <li>I bought this product hoping they would make the shoes feel better, and behold, they did.  </li>
            <li>I was able to spray one shoe, and then it was done.  </li>
            <li>I used it however not quite sure if it worked or was it just my boot stretchers.</li>
            <li>Just be sure after you soak in water and stretch you treat the leather after it dries.</li>
            <li>I repeated the process one more time to be sure, and have been wearing the boots all day today with no uncomfortableness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good seller - product arrived right away, packed well.</li>
            <li>and this did the trick - Great Product, would highly recommend</li>
            <li>My first time using it, I didn&#x27;t have good results.</li>
            <li>this stuff works pretty darn good.</li>
            <li>have found that the best way to stretch a shoe is to lightly spray the offending area, and insert an adjustable  wooden shoe stretcher to ease the area of tightness.</li>
            <li>I sprayed the inside, and stuffed the shoe with newspaper, 1 week later, the shoes fit, and feel great!</li>
            <li>Makes them much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The shoe becomes more pliant nd comfortable.</li>
            <li>After that, shoe were soft, happy now.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and does not harm your skin  nor your shoes.</li>
            <li>The spray is easy to apply and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>This product was easy to use, just spray on inside of leather footware and then wear for about an hour until it dries.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t deny yourself, use the shoe stretch and enjoy a comfortable fit!</li>
            <li>So easy to use</li>
            <li>Works well and makes wearing shoes easy.</li>
            <li>the nozzle button is fine</li>
            <li>I also use the wood shoe stretcher in another pair of shoes and works fine....</li>
            <li>The shoes are now easy to put on and they are comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>If you have a pair of quality shoes that are tight in one area this stuff works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Fit fine in the store</li>
            <li>and now they fit just fine.</li>
            <li>as described - shoes fit comfortably.</li>
            <li>Followed the instructions and now I can wear shoes comfortably all day.</li>
            <li>Comfortable shoes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve treated the shoes 5 times and used shoe trees and also wore them around the house as the directions indicated but found no difference in the fit of the shoes.  </li>
            <li>That informs me that the spray is more powerful than one might think.  </li>
            <li>Shoes fit well now.  </li>
            <li>They now fit like a glove.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>This stuff is just fantastic.</li>
            <li>I bought this spray to help me stretch a pair of loafers that were a marginal fit.</li>
            <li>After 24 hours I could wear my shoes comfortably.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fabulous to use when stretching your shoes.  </li>
            <li>but you might have to buy more to get the right strech.</li>
            <li>It does not make the leather stiff, so I was very happy with it.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong smell, but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing that soaking them for a bit can&#x27;t fix, and totally worth it to make a too tight pair of awesome shoes fit.</li>
            <li>But I feel it&#x27;s richly deserved here.</li>
            <li>Purchased this product based on customer review, and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>After significant amount of time, I took off my boots.</li>
            <li>My clogs that I was not able to stretch for about a year with just wearing them are now perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely easy to use and it really works!!  </li>
            <li>I sprayed it on some very tight fitting shoes, walked around with the on foe about 5 minutes and voila!!!</li>
            <li>When I attempted to return it as a defective item, I was told that because it requires special handling</li>
            <li>I have a pair of shoes i love sooo much</li>
            <li>I was able to add an inch of circumference to the shaft of boots thanks to this Shoe Stretch.</li>
            <li>This product seemed to help, but I couldn&#x27;t really tell for sure.</li>
            <li>Good also to use when you have leather footwear that has been sitting since last season.</li>
            <li>They stay soft and nice.</li>
            <li>Oh also, it actually smells really good.</li>
            <li>After about 30 minutes I took them off and tried the boot with a thinner stocking sock and it was very well adjusted and comfortable!  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not bad to use.</li>
            <li>Great product to shoes new and old.</li>
            <li>works great  and is fast acting</li>
            <li>we your spray product on and shoe stretchers in shoes an extra couple of days, to see if they would stretch more / better.  </li>
            <li>It works quickly on shoes after spraying and stretching them out for an hour or two.</li>
            <li>Just walk around in the shoes afterwards and they will be good and stretched out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this along with a pair of wooden shoe stretchers and that&#x27;s been getting some great results, but I&#x27;m pretty sure this is due more to the shoe stretchers than the meltonian</li>
            <li>Anyone who has purchased a new pair of leather shoes that are a bit snug will love this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li>If you need to soften your shoes for comfort this product would be good, but if you need them stretched a 1/2 size or more take them to a professional.  </li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t do much when it came to stretching out my shoes but did effectively discolor a pair of brand new shoes.</li>
            <li>Worked great on tight shoes</li>
            <li>Great for all those tight shoes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it one time, but it made my shoes much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>As I expected, it is a good product.  </li>
            <li>but I figured it was worth a shot as I couldn&#x27;t return the shoes.  </li>
            <li>As soon as I sprayed it and put the shoe on it instantly felt more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>definitely helped with making my shoes more comfortable.</li>
            <li>A bigger can size would be nice.  </li>
            <li>I used the deluxe shoe stretcher with the spray and left the stretcher</li>
            <li>Just spray inside your shoe than put shoe on and its stretched, it seems to good to be true but it really works just like i said.</li>
            <li>area.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to stretch my shoes just enough to make them comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>It is well worth trying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this similiar products in many other brands and they all were okay</li>
            <li>It worked right away without any problems.</li>
            <li>But Amazon treated me right.  </li>
            <li>Had to wait to try it because I broke my right foot and could not wear any shoe.</li>
            <li>It zipped right up like a charm.</li>
            <li>If you have a pair of shoes that you love, but they pinch and could actually fit very well, if only...  </li>
            <li>as promised.&lt;br /&gt;Softens the leather so that the shoe stretches more easily and quicker.&lt;br /&gt;Works extremely well with my boot stretchers.</li>
            <li>This product helps walking in new shoes comfortable.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried to stretch a shoe up a size or even a half size, but this is a good product when you need some wiggle room.</li>
            <li>How fast it actually works is amazing.</li>
            <li>Being in aerosol, it is easy to spread on far places in your boots or shoes.</li>
            <li>This item really works!  </li>
            <li>Just follow the basic instructions and your shoes will feel better.</li>
            <li>This product really works!  </li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I might make plastic shoe booties first and then add my socks before using the spray.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>This is going to save me so much money!</li>
            <li>, I say most definitely!</li>
            <li>hoping this stretch would work, and it absolutely did!</li>
            <li>First of all, I didn&#x27;t order it intentionally.</li>
            <li>This product really worked!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried a product like this</li>
            <li>and it really works,great buy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this stuff on many of my shoes, just gives them that extra bit of stretch to make them comfy.  </li>
            <li>Costs practically nothing and honestly works, especially when going up a size will change the entire fit.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>I tried this stretch spray on my brand new Kenneth Cole REACTION Women&#x27;s Full Of Life Oxford,Black.</li>
            <li>The price is right and just makes my life so much easier.  </li>
            <li>I have a very expensive pair of high heels and this absolutely got them fitting perfectly.</li>
            <li>Some shoes many need a few applications, but it has not damaged any of my shoes - even super pricey patent leather Ferragamos!  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a frequent need to use it aside from the original time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m size 6, perfect size, the only thing is the KC shoes were hard to put it on and also when I walk, so</li>
            <li>Meltonian Shoe Strech Aresol was easy to use and gave the new shoes a new life.</li>
            <li>I will have to apply it again to have total success in the fit of my treated shoes.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical on using this thinking it wouldn&#x27;t work, but it really did great!  </li>
            <li>My reviews are usually positive, and I don&#x27;t recall ever according a product one star.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions, and like magic, the boots stretched and my feet no longer are in agony.  </li>
            <li>, you are better off going to a shoe shop and having them professionally stretched....</li>
            <li>Worked very well for me, exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Everyone at work has used this on their tight fitting shoes and loves it!  </li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s Frye boots were about half a size too tight and one application loosened them up perfectly.</li>
            <li>It seems easy enough.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use and lives up to its claim of stretching the shoe only where needed.</li>
            <li>and I was amazed at how simple and easy it was to use.</li>
            <li>Upon standing and walking a few steps, I was in shock at how much better my shoes felt!</li>
            <li>I only used it on one pair of shoes where it worked fine.  </li>
            <li>Most shoe stretchers leave leave more to be desired, Meltonian actually does the the stretch where needed fast, unmessy, less time</li>
            <li>It really did widen my shoes enough to make them comfortable to wear</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t know if this spray really works</li>
            <li>I used the spray on shoe stretch and it really works on leather shoes.  </li>
            <li>I will not be returning it; too much of a hassle.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>it works very well</li>
            <li>Highly recommnded!</li>
            <li>It really dies work.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like shopping for shoes because of this problem but don&#x27;t have the problem with this shoe stretch product.  </li>
            <li>Works very well with the stretcher.  </li>
            <li>I never ever wrtie review unless something is really out there</li>
            <li>Bummer I was really hoping it would</li>
            <li>Thanks,</li>
            <li>Works ok, but water will also work if you wear the shoes while wet....</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>This worked very well.</li>
            <li>If you do the same that should get you the stretch you need to make your shoes comfortable.</li>
            <li>I wore them around the apartment for 10 minutes and was in so much pain.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t really help my boots stretch.</li>
            <li>Really does loosen the the fabric of the shoe.</li>
            <li>This product really works</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>really think you need to do it overnight)  </li>
            <li>I used this on a very sparkly pair of shoes that I bought for my son&#x27;s wedding.  </li>
            <li>They are so comfortable now that I don&#x27;t think I will need my back up sandals</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>This is much easier.</li>
            <li>Really doesn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s so reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>cannot straight the shoes</li>
            <li>I received the can reasonably prompt.  </li>
            <li>I tried spraying straight from can.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference, though that&#x27;s more likely due to me having hugely fat feet and the shoes needing a LOT of stretching.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, did not stain my shoes, which were  quickly stretched.</li>
            <li>Try a little bit first and then see if you need more.</li>
            <li>I formerly would buy the larger size pair and then use heel and tongue pads on the too large right shoe to make it fit.  </li>
            <li>This works quickly, and the only thing is you must follow directions and not use too much</li>
            <li>I shook the bottle, and rotated the nozzle multiple times, but no liquid will spray from the can, even though the bottle is full.</li>
            <li>I have not had the same luck with athletic shoes [too much mesh/not enough leather?], but on all-leather uppers I am seeing outstanding results.</li>
            <li>I did not have to buy a new pair of shoes!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect to change your shoes to two sizes larger, but if you have spots where your foot rubs, and especially if you have bunions, this product will help in many cases.</li>
            <li>My only issue was that it stopped spraying after many uses, but there was still product left in the can.</li>
            <li>I am glad to have Meltonian Shoe Stretch Spray and believe I&#x27;ll ultimately get my boots toe box roomy enough with it!</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t even need a shoe stretcher with this product I sprayed in my peep toe heels and a few minutes later they were good to go.</li>
            <li>I stayed my show many times but my shoe is still tight.</li>
            <li>I have many work shoes that are tight in the toe box</li>
            <li>It was just as high as the product itself.  </li>
            <li>I zip my boots as high as I can</li>
            <li>I have used it with and without a stretcher, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Then I wore them for a few hours and when I took off my sock the sandal felt very comfortable wearing.</li>
            <li>Neither pair of shoes are patent leather, both are high end leather shoes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Did get a little bit more space in a pair of shoes that I had just purchased.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using the Meltonian Shoe Stretch-Aerosol, my shoes seemed to fit more loosely; however, the product seems sticky to me or like my feet are sweating heavily, and I don&#x27;t like the feel.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at how fast the leather softened.</li>
            <li>It works slowly not all at once.</li>
            <li>I have wide feet and struggle to find comfortable shoes.</li>
            <li>My shoes were narrow, now I am able to wear them all day.</li>
            <li>I have trouble with my shoes fitting because of bunions.  </li>
            <li>Most likely to find in strictly shoe stores instead of big box.&lt;br /&gt;Light spray does the trick to give the shoe a natural stretch.</li>
            <li>Really worth trying, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I sprayed then wore the boots around the house with a thicker pair of sock than I would normally wear with those shoes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already thinking about a couple of other pairs of shoes of mine that aren&#x27;t too comfortable, that I haven&#x27;t been wearing for some time and will be after I stretch them, too.</li>
            <li>a new pair of sandals</li>
            <li>I use it with all my new shoes, and my fiance uses it with his new shoes as well.</li>
            <li>Complete and painless procedure!  </li>
            <li>I purchased this and after the first use i could feel a big difference.</li>
            <li>As is the case with most people one foot was tighter than the other so on one foot I simply sprayed the product on the inside of the sandal and eased my foot into it</li>
            <li>The first can didn&#x27;t operate, a second can was promptly sent to me.</li>
            <li>So I finally bought my first pair of Louboutins (Decollete&#x27;s).</li>
            <li>WOW, I had a new pair of shoes.</li>
            <li>Now that I have it, I use it on almost every pair of new (and old) shoes.</li>
            <li>New shoes, old shoes, any shoe that when worn gets tight will fit.</li>
            <li>but when I got them they were too tight for me to be comfortable wearing.  </li>
            <li>Clear these items now.  </li>
            <li>Just wish it had given me at least a quarter of an inch more room.</li>
            <li>I think the seller was professional and prompt also.</li>
            <li>Meltonian is reasonable and works instantly to stretch shoes as  you wear them.  </li>
            <li>but after applying this spray that issue was fixed.</li>
            <li>Still too early to tell</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll always have a can of this spray in the cabinet ready for my next pair of shoes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li>used the Meltonian Shoe Stretch along with a high heel shoe stretcher, that I also bought from Amazon, applied a couple of times and left the shoe stretcher on overnight.(Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I have gout and shoes give me toe pain if the toe box isn&#x27;t high enough.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been stretching out two pair of leather work boots to try and accommodate a new little bunion on my right foot.  </li>
            <li>The directions said to shake very well and spray it inside on the place that needed to be stretched.  </li>
            <li>and i have to say i have wide feet so a regular shoe unless its in w next to it , doesnt fit me.</li>
            <li>If they fit my heel well, they&#x27;re usually snug in the toe</li>
            <li>This  particular shoe stretch product leaves the leather soft, doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;watermark\\&quot; or stain delicate leathers, and leaves no unpleasant lingering chemical odor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Then little by little I zip my boots even higher - and within minutes they fit like they should.</li>
            <li>I used it on a new pair of heels that I bought and they now feel totally broke in and compfy!</li>
            <li>I was going to return a new pair of shoes I had purchased, because they pinched the side of my left foot.</li>
            <li>This product did not do anything to stretch my new shoes even though I appled it several times.  </li>
            <li>It was snug, but I spent a few more minutes working in some rolled up pieces of paper between the leather and the newspaper.</li>
            <li>i have used this on a few pair of new shoes and slightly tight fitting shoes</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to use it on my leather computer bag that is just a little too tight to slide my computer in and out of easily!  </li>
            <li>i recently got a sweet deal on were a bit tight around the pinky</li>
            <li>To be on the safe side, I probably shouldn&#x27;t have used this product on anything other than black leather shoes, not suede or colored shoes and definitely not suede AND colored shoes.</li>
            <li>Given all the other positive reviews, I must have received a defective unit.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it took a few times but now the shoes are stretched and comfortable to wear&lt;br /&gt;worth</li>
            <li>I spent too much on those boots to give them up.  </li>
            <li>Not great, better off buying the FootFitter Bunion Stretcher Ball &amp; Ring, Cast Iron</li>
            <li>I did not find it any better then other shoe stretch sprays only that it is a little pricier.</li>
            <li>Received it earlier than expected, have started stretching out several shoes with problems due to bone spur growth and it is working fine.</li>
            <li>Shoe stretch works well to make stiff, tight leather shoes more roomy.  </li>
            <li>I the near future, I will determine if this product actually helped with softening the lesther.</li>
            <li>I sprayed the inside of the shoe that was too tight (my left foot is 1/2 size bigger than my right), and then wore the pair around with sox on.  </li>
            <li>It gives a temporary fix, but not long term.  </li>
            <li>I havent used this product yet but have every confidence it will work as well for me as it did for other customers who rated it highly.</li>
            <li>The first brown pair chewed up my heels with the back zipper and crunched my toes with the stiff toe box.</li>
            <li>In my case I really don&#x27;t think it solved my tight shoe</li>
            <li>If your shoes are tight this product really works as designed.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t completely dry at that point, so I left the boots on while I was at home and let them completely dry out (wearing knee high socks-</li>
            <li>This little can of Meltonian shoe stretch is really a blessing.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t stretch as much as I wanted it too, just a little.</li>

            <li> was lucky and found Meltonian online, and In my opinion, Meltonian products are the very best for leather care.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the way this product worked</li>
            <li> Although this product did not work with every type of shoe, I am very pleased with the outcome.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  </li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing...</li>
            <li> Made a great looking pair of shoes supremely comfortable as well</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t honestly say if you buy this all your problems will be resolved.</li>
            <li> Nice because you use the product and then wear the shoe or boot to stretch it.</li>
            <li> I tried to use a shoe stretch, but found that my own foot was all I need.  </li>
            <li> should buy good fitting shoes, but this works temporarily</li>
            <li> I like that it is a spray as it was very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This worked wonderfully and made the inside of the boots soft!</li>
            <li> The right one fit perfectly...</li>
            <li> this one has seems the best so far.</li>
            <li> Maybe works better with thinner leather??</li>
            <li> It worked ok.  </li>
            <li> This idea worked better than this spray that didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Spraying with this product loosens the leather so that my shoes are comfortable and stretch in the strained spots and save me the blisters and sore feet!</li>
            <li> I love this shoe stretch-aerosol.</li>
            <li> I repeated the process as it say to do, and now i can wear my favorite shoes without pain...</li>
            <li> I had two pairs that I love, but just couldn&#x27;t wear for any length of time.</li>
            <li> I need more</li>
            <li> I wish I had realized there were products like this many years ago</li>
            <li> I shook it up many times, tried to spray, nothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> All I will say, it is ok.</li>
            <li> and this helped make more room without staining.</li>
            <li> I have worn the shoes for a couple weeks and still nothing, but I&#x27;m hoping over time they stretch a bit more.  </li>
            <li> I purchased some cute knee-high, zip-up Steve Madden leather boots.</li>
            <li> I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be able to spend any amount of time in them.  </li>
            <li> Now they&#x27;re one of my favorite pair of shoes!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Meltonian Shoe Stretch product does work although you may need to apply the product more than once.  </li>
            <li> I used this along with the wooden shoe stretcher and it worked perfect.</li>
            <li> MAGIC.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Works OK but it stopped spraying even though you can tell there&#x27;s still a lot in the can.</li>
            <li> Ok so i recieved this shoe spray on time and all, but i don&#x27;t get how this works</li>
            <li> It took more than 1 treatment but work well.</li>
            <li> And to the reviewers complaining about the S&amp;H, I don&#x27;t know for sure</li>
            <li> the boots fit like they were custom made for my feet!</li>
            <li> Most worked better.</li>
            <li> Had to stretch the calf of my favorite boots almost two inches</li>
            <li> I now have more shoes I am able to wear.</li>
            <li> I have bunions that make most of my heels hurt.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be able to do a mother-son dance without pain.</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping they would make the shoes feel better, and behold, they did.  </li>
            <li> I was able to spray one shoe, and then it was done.  </li>
            <li> I used it however not quite sure if it worked or was it just my boot stretchers.</li>
            <li> Just be sure after you soak in water and stretch you treat the leather after it dries.</li>
            <li> I repeated the process one more time to be sure, and have been wearing the boots all day today with no uncomfortableness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good seller - product arrived right away, packed well.</li>
            <li> and this did the trick - Great Product, would highly recommend</li>
            <li> My first time using it, I didn&#x27;t have good results.</li>
            <li> this stuff works pretty darn good.</li>
            <li> have found that the best way to stretch a shoe is to lightly spray the offending area, and insert an adjustable  wooden shoe stretcher to ease the area of tightness.</li>
            <li> I sprayed the inside, and stuffed the shoe with newspaper, 1 week later, the shoes fit, and feel great!</li>
            <li> Makes them much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> The shoe becomes more pliant nd comfortable.</li>
            <li> After that, shoe were soft, happy now.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and does not harm your skin  nor your shoes.</li>
            <li> The spray is easy to apply and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li> This product was easy to use, just spray on inside of leather footware and then wear for about an hour until it dries.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t deny yourself, use the shoe stretch and enjoy a comfortable fit!</li>
            <li> So easy to use</li>
            <li> Works well and makes wearing shoes easy.</li>
            <li> the nozzle button is fine</li>
            <li> I also use the wood shoe stretcher in another pair of shoes and works fine....</li>
            <li> The shoes are now easy to put on and they are comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> If you have a pair of quality shoes that are tight in one area this stuff works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Fit fine in the store</li>
            <li> and now they fit just fine.</li>
            <li> as described - shoes fit comfortably.</li>
            <li> Followed the instructions and now I can wear shoes comfortably all day.</li>
            <li> Comfortable shoes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve treated the shoes 5 times and used shoe trees and also wore them around the house as the directions indicated but found no difference in the fit of the shoes.  </li>
            <li> That informs me that the spray is more powerful than one might think.  </li>
            <li> Shoes fit well now.  </li>
            <li> They now fit like a glove.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is just fantastic.</li>
            <li> I bought this spray to help me stretch a pair of loafers that were a marginal fit.</li>
            <li> After 24 hours I could wear my shoes comfortably.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fabulous to use when stretching your shoes.  </li>
            <li> but you might have to buy more to get the right strech.</li>
            <li> It does not make the leather stiff, so I was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> It does have a strong smell, but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing that soaking them for a bit can&#x27;t fix, and totally worth it to make a too tight pair of awesome shoes fit.</li>
            <li> But I feel it&#x27;s richly deserved here.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product based on customer review, and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> After significant amount of time, I took off my boots.</li>
            <li> My clogs that I was not able to stretch for about a year with just wearing them are now perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely easy to use and it really works!!  </li>
            <li> I sprayed it on some very tight fitting shoes, walked around with the on foe about 5 minutes and voila!!!</li>
            <li> When I attempted to return it as a defective item, I was told that because it requires special handling</li>
            <li> I have a pair of shoes i love sooo much</li>
            <li> I was able to add an inch of circumference to the shaft of boots thanks to this Shoe Stretch.</li>
            <li> This product seemed to help, but I couldn&#x27;t really tell for sure.</li>
            <li> Good also to use when you have leather footwear that has been sitting since last season.</li>
            <li> They stay soft and nice.</li>
            <li> Oh also, it actually smells really good.</li>
            <li> After about 30 minutes I took them off and tried the boot with a thinner stocking sock and it was very well adjusted and comfortable!  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not bad to use.</li>
            <li> Great product to shoes new and old.</li>
            <li> works great  and is fast acting</li>
            <li> we your spray product on and shoe stretchers in shoes an extra couple of days, to see if they would stretch more / better.  </li>
            <li> It works quickly on shoes after spraying and stretching them out for an hour or two.</li>
            <li> Just walk around in the shoes afterwards and they will be good and stretched out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this along with a pair of wooden shoe stretchers and that&#x27;s been getting some great results, but I&#x27;m pretty sure this is due more to the shoe stretchers than the meltonian</li>
            <li> Anyone who has purchased a new pair of leather shoes that are a bit snug will love this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> If you need to soften your shoes for comfort this product would be good, but if you need them stretched a 1/2 size or more take them to a professional.  </li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do much when it came to stretching out my shoes but did effectively discolor a pair of brand new shoes.</li>
            <li> Worked great on tight shoes</li>
            <li> Great for all those tight shoes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it one time, but it made my shoes much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> As I expected, it is a good product.  </li>
            <li> but I figured it was worth a shot as I couldn&#x27;t return the shoes.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I sprayed it and put the shoe on it instantly felt more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> definitely helped with making my shoes more comfortable.</li>
            <li> A bigger can size would be nice.  </li>
            <li> I used the deluxe shoe stretcher with the spray and left the stretcher</li>
            <li> Just spray inside your shoe than put shoe on and its stretched, it seems to good to be true but it really works just like i said.</li>
            <li> area.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to stretch my shoes just enough to make them comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> It is well worth trying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this similiar products in many other brands and they all were okay</li>
            <li> It worked right away without any problems.</li>
            <li> But Amazon treated me right.  </li>
            <li> Had to wait to try it because I broke my right foot and could not wear any shoe.</li>
            <li> It zipped right up like a charm.</li>
            <li> If you have a pair of shoes that you love, but they pinch and could actually fit very well, if only...  </li>
            <li> as promised.&lt;br /&gt;Softens the leather so that the shoe stretches more easily and quicker.&lt;br /&gt;Works extremely well with my boot stretchers.</li>
            <li> This product helps walking in new shoes comfortable.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried to stretch a shoe up a size or even a half size, but this is a good product when you need some wiggle room.</li>
            <li> How fast it actually works is amazing.</li>
            <li> Being in aerosol, it is easy to spread on far places in your boots or shoes.</li>
            <li> This item really works!  </li>
            <li> Just follow the basic instructions and your shoes will feel better.</li>
            <li> This product really works!  </li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> I might make plastic shoe booties first and then add my socks before using the spray.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> This is going to save me so much money!</li>
            <li> , I say most definitely!</li>
            <li> hoping this stretch would work, and it absolutely did!</li>
            <li> First of all, I didn&#x27;t order it intentionally.</li>
            <li> This product really worked!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried a product like this</li>
            <li> and it really works,great buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this stuff on many of my shoes, just gives them that extra bit of stretch to make them comfy.  </li>
            <li> Costs practically nothing and honestly works, especially when going up a size will change the entire fit.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I tried this stretch spray on my brand new Kenneth Cole REACTION Women&#x27;s Full Of Life Oxford,Black.</li>
            <li> The price is right and just makes my life so much easier.  </li>
            <li> I have a very expensive pair of high heels and this absolutely got them fitting perfectly.</li>
            <li> Some shoes many need a few applications, but it has not damaged any of my shoes - even super pricey patent leather Ferragamos!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a frequent need to use it aside from the original time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m size 6, perfect size, the only thing is the KC shoes were hard to put it on and also when I walk, so</li>
            <li> Meltonian Shoe Strech Aresol was easy to use and gave the new shoes a new life.</li>
            <li> I will have to apply it again to have total success in the fit of my treated shoes.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical on using this thinking it wouldn&#x27;t work, but it really did great!  </li>
            <li> My reviews are usually positive, and I don&#x27;t recall ever according a product one star.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions, and like magic, the boots stretched and my feet no longer are in agony.  </li>
            <li> , you are better off going to a shoe shop and having them professionally stretched....</li>
            <li> Worked very well for me, exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Everyone at work has used this on their tight fitting shoes and loves it!  </li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s Frye boots were about half a size too tight and one application loosened them up perfectly.</li>
            <li> It seems easy enough.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and lives up to its claim of stretching the shoe only where needed.</li>
            <li> and I was amazed at how simple and easy it was to use.</li>
            <li> Upon standing and walking a few steps, I was in shock at how much better my shoes felt!</li>
            <li> I only used it on one pair of shoes where it worked fine.  </li>
            <li> Most shoe stretchers leave leave more to be desired, Meltonian actually does the the stretch where needed fast, unmessy, less time</li>
            <li> It really did widen my shoes enough to make them comfortable to wear</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t know if this spray really works</li>
            <li> I used the spray on shoe stretch and it really works on leather shoes.  </li>
            <li> I will not be returning it; too much of a hassle.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> it works very well</li>
            <li> Highly recommnded!</li>
            <li> It really dies work.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like shopping for shoes because of this problem but don&#x27;t have the problem with this shoe stretch product.  </li>
            <li> Works very well with the stretcher.  </li>
            <li> I never ever wrtie review unless something is really out there</li>
            <li> Bummer I was really hoping it would</li>
            <li> Thanks,</li>
            <li> Works ok, but water will also work if you wear the shoes while wet....</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> This worked very well.</li>
            <li> If you do the same that should get you the stretch you need to make your shoes comfortable.</li>
            <li> I wore them around the apartment for 10 minutes and was in so much pain.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t really help my boots stretch.</li>
            <li> Really does loosen the the fabric of the shoe.</li>
            <li> This product really works</li>
            <li> and it really works.</li>
            <li> really think you need to do it overnight)  </li>
            <li> I used this on a very sparkly pair of shoes that I bought for my son&#x27;s wedding.  </li>
            <li> They are so comfortable now that I don&#x27;t think I will need my back up sandals</li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> This is much easier.</li>
            <li> Really doesn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s so reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> cannot straight the shoes</li>
            <li> I received the can reasonably prompt.  </li>
            <li> I tried spraying straight from can.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference, though that&#x27;s more likely due to me having hugely fat feet and the shoes needing a LOT of stretching.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, did not stain my shoes, which were  quickly stretched.</li>
            <li> Try a little bit first and then see if you need more.</li>
            <li> I formerly would buy the larger size pair and then use heel and tongue pads on the too large right shoe to make it fit.  </li>
            <li> This works quickly, and the only thing is you must follow directions and not use too much</li>
            <li> I shook the bottle, and rotated the nozzle multiple times, but no liquid will spray from the can, even though the bottle is full.</li>
            <li> I have not had the same luck with athletic shoes [too much mesh/not enough leather?], but on all-leather uppers I am seeing outstanding results.</li>
            <li> I did not have to buy a new pair of shoes!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect to change your shoes to two sizes larger, but if you have spots where your foot rubs, and especially if you have bunions, this product will help in many cases.</li>
            <li> My only issue was that it stopped spraying after many uses, but there was still product left in the can.</li>
            <li> I am glad to have Meltonian Shoe Stretch Spray and believe I&#x27;ll ultimately get my boots toe box roomy enough with it!</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t even need a shoe stretcher with this product I sprayed in my peep toe heels and a few minutes later they were good to go.</li>
            <li> I stayed my show many times but my shoe is still tight.</li>
            <li> I have many work shoes that are tight in the toe box</li>
            <li> It was just as high as the product itself.  </li>
            <li> I zip my boots as high as I can</li>
            <li> I have used it with and without a stretcher, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Then I wore them for a few hours and when I took off my sock the sandal felt very comfortable wearing.</li>
            <li> Neither pair of shoes are patent leather, both are high end leather shoes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Did get a little bit more space in a pair of shoes that I had just purchased.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using the Meltonian Shoe Stretch-Aerosol, my shoes seemed to fit more loosely; however, the product seems sticky to me or like my feet are sweating heavily, and I don&#x27;t like the feel.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how fast the leather softened.</li>
            <li> It works slowly not all at once.</li>
            <li> I have wide feet and struggle to find comfortable shoes.</li>
            <li> My shoes were narrow, now I am able to wear them all day.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with my shoes fitting because of bunions.  </li>
            <li> Most likely to find in strictly shoe stores instead of big box.&lt;br /&gt;Light spray does the trick to give the shoe a natural stretch.</li>
            <li> Really worth trying, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I sprayed then wore the boots around the house with a thicker pair of sock than I would normally wear with those shoes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already thinking about a couple of other pairs of shoes of mine that aren&#x27;t too comfortable, that I haven&#x27;t been wearing for some time and will be after I stretch them, too.</li>
            <li> a new pair of sandals</li>
            <li> I use it with all my new shoes, and my fiance uses it with his new shoes as well.</li>
            <li> Complete and painless procedure!  </li>
            <li> I purchased this and after the first use i could feel a big difference.</li>
            <li> As is the case with most people one foot was tighter than the other so on one foot I simply sprayed the product on the inside of the sandal and eased my foot into it</li>
            <li> The first can didn&#x27;t operate, a second can was promptly sent to me.</li>
            <li> So I finally bought my first pair of Louboutins (Decollete&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> WOW, I had a new pair of shoes.</li>
            <li> Now that I have it, I use it on almost every pair of new (and old) shoes.</li>
            <li> New shoes, old shoes, any shoe that when worn gets tight will fit.</li>
            <li> but when I got them they were too tight for me to be comfortable wearing.  </li>
            <li> Clear these items now.  </li>
            <li> Just wish it had given me at least a quarter of an inch more room.</li>
            <li> I think the seller was professional and prompt also.</li>
            <li> Meltonian is reasonable and works instantly to stretch shoes as  you wear them.  </li>
            <li> but after applying this spray that issue was fixed.</li>
            <li> Still too early to tell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll always have a can of this spray in the cabinet ready for my next pair of shoes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> used the Meltonian Shoe Stretch along with a high heel shoe stretcher, that I also bought from Amazon, applied a couple of times and left the shoe stretcher on overnight.(Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I have gout and shoes give me toe pain if the toe box isn&#x27;t high enough.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been stretching out two pair of leather work boots to try and accommodate a new little bunion on my right foot.  </li>
            <li> The directions said to shake very well and spray it inside on the place that needed to be stretched.  </li>
            <li> and i have to say i have wide feet so a regular shoe unless its in w next to it , doesnt fit me.</li>
            <li> If they fit my heel well, they&#x27;re usually snug in the toe</li>
            <li> This  particular shoe stretch product leaves the leather soft, doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;watermark\\&quot; or stain delicate leathers, and leaves no unpleasant lingering chemical odor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Then little by little I zip my boots even higher - and within minutes they fit like they should.</li>
            <li> I used it on a new pair of heels that I bought and they now feel totally broke in and compfy!</li>
            <li> I was going to return a new pair of shoes I had purchased, because they pinched the side of my left foot.</li>
            <li> This product did not do anything to stretch my new shoes even though I appled it several times.  </li>
            <li> It was snug, but I spent a few more minutes working in some rolled up pieces of paper between the leather and the newspaper.</li>
            <li> i have used this on a few pair of new shoes and slightly tight fitting shoes</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going to use it on my leather computer bag that is just a little too tight to slide my computer in and out of easily!  </li>
            <li> i recently got a sweet deal on were a bit tight around the pinky</li>
            <li> To be on the safe side, I probably shouldn&#x27;t have used this product on anything other than black leather shoes, not suede or colored shoes and definitely not suede AND colored shoes.</li>
            <li> Given all the other positive reviews, I must have received a defective unit.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it took a few times but now the shoes are stretched and comfortable to wear&lt;br /&gt;worth</li>
            <li> I spent too much on those boots to give them up.  </li>
            <li> Not great, better off buying the FootFitter Bunion Stretcher Ball &amp; Ring, Cast Iron</li>
            <li> I did not find it any better then other shoe stretch sprays only that it is a little pricier.</li>
            <li> Received it earlier than expected, have started stretching out several shoes with problems due to bone spur growth and it is working fine.</li>
            <li> Shoe stretch works well to make stiff, tight leather shoes more roomy.  </li>
            <li> I the near future, I will determine if this product actually helped with softening the lesther.</li>
            <li> I sprayed the inside of the shoe that was too tight (my left foot is 1/2 size bigger than my right), and then wore the pair around with sox on.  </li>
            <li> It gives a temporary fix, but not long term.  </li>
            <li> I havent used this product yet but have every confidence it will work as well for me as it did for other customers who rated it highly.</li>
            <li> The first brown pair chewed up my heels with the back zipper and crunched my toes with the stiff toe box.</li>
            <li> In my case I really don&#x27;t think it solved my tight shoe</li>
            <li> If your shoes are tight this product really works as designed.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t completely dry at that point, so I left the boots on while I was at home and let them completely dry out (wearing knee high socks-</li>
            <li> This little can of Meltonian shoe stretch is really a blessing.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t stretch as much as I wanted it too, just a little.</li>
            <li> I had just purchased a new pair of racing gloves and they were so tight they were putting my hands to sleep after just a short ride.  </li>
            <li> I decided to just exchange the shoes (while they were still brand new) and picked a half size</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten rid of a few pairs of shoes due to them becoming a little snug (weight gain).</li>
            <li> I used this spray with the high heel shoe stretcher and managed to save a few pair of shoes from the &#x27;Goodwill&#x27; pile.  </li>
            <li> I had a new pair of shoes that were a tad to tight.</li>
            <li> Not sure this is doing much for me.  </li>
            <li> This spray seems to let the leather stretch, and I haven&#x27;t noticed the leather shrinking back yet, so I&#x27;m hopeful it will work for the long term.  </li>
            <li> Have only used it a few times so far</li>
            <li> , i sprayed it inside a couple of my shoes and put my foot in while it was still wet and walked around in it, but when i go back to wear the shoes later</li>
            <li> If they are wide enough for my toes, they&#x27;re way too big at the heel.  </li>
            <li> Almost immediately they felt better and now after a few rides they are perfectly broken in.  </li>
            <li> but just enough to get it loose.</li>
            <li> I tried this product several times on the same shoe, after the can is empty now, I am still trying other ways to stretch the same shoe.</li>
            <li> I think this is a portion alcohol but not completely.  </li>
            <li> You just spray it on the area you want stretched and wear the shoes until it dries.  </li>
            <li> Also, my shoes didn&#x27;t seem to stay stretched out, if they ever were.  </li>
            <li> I read a review that they were wide enough, they werent.</li>
            <li> I have only used this one time and no real difference</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that this stretched my shoes even a 1/2 size</li>
            <li> The shoes after spraying this for 1 day and the shoes were nicely stretched without ruining the leather or shoe itself.  </li>
            <li> I took 2 pair of shoes to a cobbler to be stretched</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe how this stretched my shoes.  </li>
            <li> Last night I wore the shoes for a couple of hours with absolutely no pain.  </li>
            <li> If your shoes are a little tight, just spray where it is needed and desired and your feet will gently slide in your shoe.</li>
            <li> I ordered a pair of boots a half size smaller then my shoe size (that was all that was left!)</li>
            <li> Bought this for a pair of western boots which were tight on the side if the big toe.  </li>
            <li> so it could help stretch the shoes a little bigger than my actual size i.e. in this case</li>
            <li> evidently no gas pressurization in the can to push the fluid out.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers mentioned the spray will make your feet sweat a lot, even when you make shoes dry for a day or two, but no big issue it was just for couple days...</li>
            <li> I have a skinny heel and a wide toe box which makes it difficult to find shoes that fit well.  </li>
            <li> i sprayed on after putting on the shoe and wore them till dry</li>
            <li> I wore the shoes until I thought product was dry.</li>
            <li> Could not live without it.</li>
            <li> This product restored the loafers to me, after a single application.</li>
            <li> I have spent lots of money over the years taking my shoes to shoe repair to be stretched.  </li>
            <li> I hace used this for my leather boot that were a little too tight cause they were new and</li>
            <li> Within about 2 minutes I could feel the boots start to release and within 10 minutes they were nearing downright loose.</li>
            <li> Other ways of stretching shoes takes a long time.</li>
            <li> I purchased shoe stretchers for several pair of shoes that were too tight.  </li>
            <li> I sprayed inside and outside of the gloves in the areas they were tight, put the gloves on and went for a ride.  </li>
            <li> the left one was tight.  </li>
            <li> Bitter experience.</li>
            <li> used the product a few times as directed (i.e. applying before you wear the shoe) and actually felt it exacerbated the problem.  </li>
            <li> Arrived before I expected.</li>
            <li> SO I USED CAN OPENER AND EMPTY</li>
            <li> Following directions from the can, I sprayed inside of boots&#x27; toe boxes, followed by donning heavy socks.  </li>
            <li> it works just the way it&#x27;s supposed to - i have a wide forefoot but a skinny ankle</li>
            <li> Because one of my feet is larger than the other, which is typical, one boot was tighter than the other.</li>
            <li> I applied it as directed to a pair of shoes that were tight across my metatarsial region and wore them until the shoe stretched worked.</li>
            <li> My feet swell and some times you need your shoes stretched a little.</li>
            <li> I intend to use it on those shoes a 2nd time, because they&#x27;re still a little too tight.</li>
            <li> If your shoes are to tight and they just need a little stretching in specific areas, this is the product to buy.  </li>
            <li> If you are like me, with one foot just a tad smaller/larger than the other, then this product is for you.  </li>
            <li> and I put a sock on the other foot before gradually easing my foot into the sandal.  </li>
            <li> I will explore some other alternatives to stretching leather footwear.</li>
            <li> Not sure why I can&#x27;t find this locally anywhere.</li>
            <li> must say, I was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> Tried other ways to stretch my leather boots that all had no effects.</li>
            <li> This spray really works, I had to apply it at least two times and wore my shoes with two thick socks one over the other</li>
            <li> This seems less damaging to leather or sinthetic shoe materials by a wide margin in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> However if one does not happen to have one of these devices, an alternative solution is to spray the area to be stretched, put on a heavy sock, and wear the shoe around indoors until the product dries - a matter of a few minutes.</li>
            <li> -- it may take a few careful applications, but if anything makes your shoes wearable, this is it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product to stretch a pair of too tight suede boots and it worked extremely well.  </li>
            <li> I held the boots upside down and sprayed.  </li>
            <li> Does not stretch, it soften the show a little bit for a while, however, it has to be applied over and over due that as soon as it dries</li>
            <li> Tried to stretch my black leather sneakers.</li>
            <li> Oddly, my polished toenails adhered to my socks from the spray--completely stuck.  </li>
            <li> Just spray inside as directed, wear around the house for a half hour or so with socks</li>
            <li> I previously took my shoes to the Cobbler for stretching but they stayed the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just got a pair in black today.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t have had to struggle with my feet hurting with slightly too tight shoes.  </li>
            <li> I did feel bad walking around in my oxfords with thick white gym socks, but it was well worth the comfort.</li>
            <li> I tried them on a pair of Sanita nursing shoes and they are still too tight.</li>
            <li> I always have a problem with leather  boots that are too tight in the calf area.  </li>
            <li> but they were to tight</li>
            <li> They were no longer too tight.</li>
            <li> If you have a tight pair of leather shoes that need to stretch then your going to need this.</li>
            <li> Given a pair of shoes that were slightly tight at the toes.</li>
            <li> but after one wearing were too tight in the instep.</li>
            <li> Had a couple pair of shoes that were too tight.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I still felt that they were too tight...</li>
            <li> but they just seemed tight.  </li>
            <li> I used it on a pair of shoes that were tight.  </li>
            <li> I bought shoes that were too tight and didn&#x27;t want to return them.  </li>
            <li> Used this with a shoe stretcher on a pair of Loubountins that I got that were too tight.  </li>
            <li> They were a bit tight in the toes.  </li>
            <li> I used the spray on a pair of suede boots that we too tight around the heel, ball of foot and over my instep.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked that this product worked so quickly in stretching out my shoes.</li>
            <li> I sprayed them on the inside and then wore them with thick socks until dry.  </li>
            <li> Bought meltonian shoe stretch, sprayed it on, put on a heavy pair of socks and wore around the house for a half hour</li>
            <li> and then spray a little of this Meltonian-</li>
            <li> a little tight.i would reccomend this product to anybody that need yo strech or soften their shoes.</li>
            <li> I had hoes in my closet that pitched a little.</li>
            <li> I tried to stretch them by wearing socks with them, putting tubes of lipsticks and rolls of quarters up the toebox to hopefully get a little give.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this helped stretching them a little</li>
            <li> ... I am still not very sure if this product works as it says it does...</li>
            <li> The button was dead and nothing would come out.</li>
            <li> It works, sprayed in my shoes and wore till it dried as directed.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> you were instructed to put them on and walk around until the spray dried.  </li>
            <li> Used it to stretch a few pairs of shoes along with a FootFitter, followed directions and seemed to work as advertised.</li>
            <li> However, I sprayed this in them and wore them until they dried.  </li>
            <li> I was about to either return or resell them because the toebox was too narrow for me.</li>
            <li> Painfully narrow.</li>
            <li> What a waste</li>
            <li> within a few minutes you can feel them stretch out.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on it.</li>
            <li> nothing came o - waste of moneyut --clogged</li>
            <li> It took forever and a day to receive this shoe stretcher, but when I did receive it, I immediately used it on a pair of leather riding boots that are one half size too small.  </li>
            <li> Should have listened to the other negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> Sprayed some of this on the inside on the heel and into the toe box (turn the shoe upside down and spray with the can upright), put on some thick socks, crammed my feet in there and started walking around.</li>
            <li> No more foot discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I was unable to find anything like it locally and gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> No more squeezed toes,  I spray it on as I leave the house by the time I reach my destination I can tell the difference.</li>
            <li> Spayed the product in the toe area, inserted a shoe stretcher; allowed it to set a few hours and presto!</li>
            <li> Well, the zipper would not budge past the widest part of my rather *</li>
            <li> not sure you want this stuff on your skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cant place my order for all the past order inmy face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve past it on to friends and family &amp; they couldn&#x27;t believe it either.</li>
            <li> Some of their shoes run small.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work, but I&#x27;m not sure anything would on frye boots</li>
            <li> I put on a thick pair of socks while the spray dried and worked like a charm!</li>
            <li> This is what i did: I sprayed the inside of the shoe then put them on at home for about a half hour wearing two pairs of very thick athletic socks.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and I want to say this works, but it&#x27;s hard to tell.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> I was afraid I would have to send them back.  </li>
            <li> Leather, lace-up oxfords, with fairly thick leather &amp; thick soles.</li>
            <li> Just spray it on leather straps put shoes on with thick socks and</li>
            <li> Down side is that the boot can still be uncomfortable while it is stretching.</li>
            <li> I had a pair of boots that needed some serious breaking in</li>
            <li> I just thought this product was a little too expensive for the amount that you get.</li>
            <li> Perhaps, a warning about how wearing toenail polish is not a good idea when using this spray.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to buy some dog toys today for tough dogs.  </li>
            <li> I see comments that these stretching liquids are merely over the counter common alcohol.  </li>
            <li> CAN THE SPRAY DID NOT WORK AND WAS BROKEN ,</li>
            <li> HAS POOR QUALITY CONTROL I WOULD GIVE IT 5 STARS</li>
            <li> Not true - the can says to spray the INSIDE - that would be difficult with the boots I purchased the spray for!</li>
            <li> Unable to use.</li>
            <li> and these days it is difficult to find it just</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t convinced that anything would work to ease some of my too-snug shoes, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> A purchased a can of this about six months ago on the advice of my brother; his wife uses it and, though I was skeptical it would work, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I was definitely skeptical</li>
            <li> used for 1-2 sprays, nozzle failed.</li>
            <li> and I save one of my verrry expensive shoes from being sent out to the pasture.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical but ordered this anyway.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to get the spray where I needed it.  </li>
            <li> Broke a pair of horribly difficult to break-in Frye boots in about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Seems to work but difficult to tell</li>
            <li> I would not goo too crazy and drench the shoe</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> I bought some very expensive boots online.  </li>
            <li> Bad.</li>
            <li> My bad.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, I Googled for a solution, and came across this product on Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shocked!</li>
            <li> The arrival time from the date ordered was terrible....</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I read the reviews and I want to say this works, but it&#x27;s hard to tell. I can&#x27;t honestly say if you buy this all your problems will be resolved. In my case I really don&#x27;t think it solved my tight shoe issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it along with shoe stretchers and think without the shoe stretchers the shoes would be the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s just my situation. Some people swear by this stuff. My first time using it, I didn&#x27;t have good results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it one time, but it made my shoes much more comfortable.  I intend to use it on those shoes a 2nd time, because they&#x27;re still a little too tight.</li>
            <li> Meltonian Shoe Strech Aresol was easy to use and gave the new shoes a new life. Great product to shoes new and old.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to how well the product works because there was no propellant in the can when I went to use it! The button was dead and nothing would come out. Amazon promptly refunded my money, though and I&#x27;ll try it again. Stay tuned.....</li>
            <li> works great  and is fast acting</li>
            <li> So-So Experience...  Husbands work shoes: Leather, lace-up oxfords, with fairly thick leather &amp; thick soles. we your spray product on and shoe stretchers in shoes an extra couple of days, to see if they would stretch more / better.  That did not help.  Maybe works better with thinner leather?? Good delivery service. Item appeared as described.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the miracle I&#x27;d hoped for - it only stretches shoes a tiny bit. However, that tiny bit was somewhat helpful. Just wish it had given me at least a quarter of an inch more room. Good seller - product arrived right away, packed well.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work.  I tried them on a pair of Sanita nursing shoes and they are still too tight. Oh well</li>
            <li> Worked great on tight shoes</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t seem to work all that well. I stayed my show many times but my shoe is still tight. So don&#x27;t know if this spray really works but this has been my experience.</li>
            <li> Did not work the way I thought it should.</li>
            <li> This product works.  I have spent lots of money over the years taking my shoes to shoe repair to be stretched.  I have used the shoe stretchers which didn&#x27;t seem to work.  Shoe stretch-aerosol does work.</li>
            <li> works as advertised.  I used others to stretch the same shoes, which didn&#x27;t make any difference.  This one did.</li>
            <li> I see comments that these stretching liquids are merely over the counter common alcohol.  I think this is a portion alcohol but not completely.  This seems less damaging to leather or sinthetic shoe materials by a wide margin in my opinion.  I think the seller was professional and prompt also.</li>
            <li> It worked ok.  Took several applications and stretching to get desired results.</li>
            <li> It works, sprayed in my shoes and wore till it dried as directed.</li>
            <li> as described - shoes fit comfortably. I have problems with corns and after spraying this on the shoe, the leather stretches and the corns do not bother me.</li>
            <li> I used the spray on shoe stretch and it really works on leather shoes.  Makes them much more comfortable.  You just spray it on the area you want stretched and wear the shoes until it dries.  It couldn&#x27;t be easier and it sells for a great price.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT.  USE AS INSTRUCTED.</li>
            <li> My reviews are usually positive, and I don&#x27;t recall ever according a product one star. But I feel it&#x27;s richly deserved here. It arrived in a timely fashion, and sprayed without issue two or three times. And then the nozzle simply would not spray anymore, no matter what I tried. I wasn&#x27;t even done spraying one shoe that I was trying to stretch. I shook the bottle, and rotated the nozzle multiple times, but no liquid will spray from the can, even though the bottle is full. Bitter experience. Given all the other positive reviews, I must have received a defective unit. I will not be returning it; too much of a hassle. I&#x27;ll just order a different brand.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it! It has helped stretch all my family&#x27;s shoes and boots!</li>
            <li> Bad. Unable to use. It does not spray</li>
            <li> This really worked--I sprayed it inside my shoes, added my wooden stretchers, let them sit a few days and WOW, I had a new pair of shoes. My shoes were narrow, now I am able to wear them all day. Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Leaves stains on your leather and suede</li>
            <li> Loss its spray after using twice.</li>
            <li> Anyone who has purchased a new pair of leather shoes that are a bit snug will love this product. I have used shoe stretch for years on all types of shoes- and these days it is difficult to find it just anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky and found Meltonian online, and In my opinion, Meltonian products are the very best for leather care. This  particular shoe stretch product leaves the leather soft, doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;watermark\\&quot; or stain delicate leathers, and leaves no unpleasant lingering chemical odor.&lt;br /&gt;I have found that the best way to stretch a shoe is to lightly spray the offending area, and insert an adjustable  wooden shoe stretcher to ease the area of tightness. However if one does not happen to have one of these devices, an alternative solution is to spray the area to be stretched, put on a heavy sock, and wear the shoe around indoors until the product dries - a matter of a few minutes. Voila! and you are done. Complete and painless procedure!  No more foot discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;My order was received and promptly shipped in record time and it was properly packaged as well.</li>
            <li> Sprayer broke off after three uses</li>
            <li> The arrival time from the date ordered was terrible....3 weeks?&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE.  During time of order, check out the S@H charges.  It was just as high as the product itself.  So in essesence you are paying double.  I find this unexceptable.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t even get the can to spray. Ended up having to go to a cobbler.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work a bit. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> does not seem to work.... my daughter told me to put on 2 pairs of socks and use a blow dryer on the shoes to help increase the width.  This idea worked better than this spray that didn&#x27;t work.  Save your money on this one.</li>
            <li> Works just as described.  My daughter&#x27;s Frye boots were about half a size too tight and one application loosened them up perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with my shoes fitting because of bunions.  Spraying with this product loosens the leather so that my shoes are comfortable and stretch in the strained spots and save me the blisters and sore feet!</li>
            <li> Not sure this is doing much for me.  I had a pair of boots that needed some serious breaking in and I think that this stuff just wasn&#x27;t up to the task.  I&#x27;ve been using this along with a pair of wooden shoe stretchers and that&#x27;s been getting some great results, but I&#x27;m pretty sure this is due more to the shoe stretchers than the meltonian product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the product a few times as directed (i.e. applying before you wear the shoe) and actually felt it exacerbated the problem.  I&#x27;ll stick to using it with the shoe stretchers in the hopes that it does soften up the leather on my boots, but I don&#x27;t plan on relying on this product solely in the future.</li>
            <li> Shocked! it worked for me without a flaw. It worked right away without any problems. No second try, no greasy or irritation. I love this shoe stretch-aerosol. Yes, I have tried others, so I know this is the one. You will like it.</li>
            <li> I always have a problem with leather  boots that are too tight in the calf area.  This little can of Meltonian shoe stretch is really a blessing.  I zip my boots as high as I can and then spray a little of this Meltonian- it works immediately.  Then little by little I zip my boots even higher - and within minutes they fit like they should.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as I had wanted.</li>
            <li> As I expected, it is a good product.  Arrived before I expected. Good service</li>
            <li> I purchased shoe stretchers for several pair of shoes that were too tight.  I sprayed this product into the shoes before applying the shoe stretchers.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Defective can - doesn&#x27;t spray.  But Amazon treated me right.  One star for the product, and 5 stars for Amazon.</li>
            <li> This item really works!  I was unable to find anything like it locally and gave it a try.  It arrived in perfect condition and within the promised time.  I only wish I had purchased two cans!</li>
            <li> Meltonian is reasonable and works instantly to stretch shoes as  you wear them.  It is easy to apply and does not harm your skin  nor your shoes.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried to stretch a shoe up a size or even a half size, but this is a good product when you need some wiggle room. I&#x27;ve used before I&#x27;ve put the shoe on and just let it work while I wear the shoe. I&#x27;ve also used this with a shoe stretcher. Both ways give the same results. The shoe becomes more pliant nd comfortable. Just follow the basic instructions and your shoes will feel better.</li>
            <li> Most shoe stretchers leave leave more to be desired, Meltonian actually does the the stretch where needed fast, unmessy, less time</li>
            <li> We bought this for my husbands work boots. It worked great and his boots were &amp;#34;broken in&amp;#34; in one days time!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Could not live without it.</li>
            <li> OMG, this stuff actually works. I have a pair of shoes i love sooo much but they were to tight, they tore my feet up everytime i wore them. I purchased this and after the first use i could feel a big difference. I repeated the process as it say to do, and now i can wear my favorite shoes without pain...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been stretching out two pair of leather work boots to try and accommodate a new little bunion on my right foot.  This spray seems to let the leather stretch, and I haven&#x27;t noticed the leather shrinking back yet, so I&#x27;m hopeful it will work for the long term.  It smells very nice too so it&#x27;s not bad to use.</li>
            <li> Tried it and tried it, didn&#x27;t seem to do anything.</li>
            <li> I have used it with and without a stretcher, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> And it does no damage to the shoe leather or color. Don&#x27;t expect to change your shoes to two sizes larger, but if you have spots where your foot rubs, and especially if you have bunions, this product will help in many cases. Now that I have it, I use it on almost every pair of new (and old) shoes.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do much when it came to stretching out my shoes but did effectively discolor a pair of brand new shoes. To be on the safe side, I probably shouldn&#x27;t have used this product on anything other than black leather shoes, not suede or colored shoes and definitely not suede AND colored shoes. My bad.</li>
            <li> if you need a shoe softner this is the product. it works very well but you might have to buy more to get the right strech. i used it on my 1970 vietnam jungle boots which i purchased fron ebay....a little tight.i would reccomend this product to anybody that need yo strech or soften their shoes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten rid of a few pairs of shoes due to them becoming a little snug (weight gain). I had two pairs that I love, but just couldn&#x27;t wear for any length of time. This product gave me the additional space that I needed, even with a pair of gym shoes!</li>
            <li> I sprayed it on some very tight fitting shoes, walked around with the on foe about 5 minutes and voila!!! They were no longer too tight.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t convinced that anything would work to ease some of my too-snug shoes, but I was wrong. This works quickly, and the only thing is you must follow directions and not use too much -- it may take a few careful applications, but if anything makes your shoes wearable, this is it. Highly recommnded!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing...I need more</li>
            <li> I only used it on one pair of shoes where it worked fine.  The nest time that I tried it would not spray out of the can.  the nozzle button is fine the product will not come out of the can.</li>
            <li> Does the job beautifully.</li>
            <li> I had bought a pair of boots that were too snug in the toes.  The directions said to shake very well and spray it inside on the place that needed to be stretched.  I held the boots upside down and sprayed.  you were instructed to put them on and walk around until the spray dried.  I did this and the boots felt great.  A really good product that works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Followed the instructions and now I can wear shoes comfortably all day. It really dies work. I had hoes in my closet that pitched a little. One spray of this and they feel great all day.</li>
            <li> If you are like me, with one foot just a tad smaller/larger than the other, then this product is for you.  With just a touch on the spray button and your shoes will fit perfect.  I really don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.  The price is right and just makes my life so much easier.  I really didn&#x27;t like shopping for shoes because of this problem but don&#x27;t have the problem with this shoe stretch product.  Highly, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This did not work on a pair of leather winter boots.  Left a big stain that could have been a problem had I not taken care of it immediately.</li>
            <li> I KNOW THIS BRAND&amp; PRODUCT  IS GOOD . I FOUND THIS ON AMAZON,I SHOULD SAY I DONT HAVE TIME OR LIKE TO RETURN ITEMS. I ORDERED 2 CANS.BOTH  CAN THE SPRAY DID NOT WORK AND WAS BROKEN , SO I USED CAN OPENER AND EMPTY THE LIQUID TO SPRAY BOTTLE.THE COMPANY I GUESS HAS POOR QUALITY CONTROL I WOULD GIVE IT 5 STARS IF THE SPRAY WAS WORKING</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the way this product worked and it was just like the product stated.  I had purchased (online) a new pair of sandals but when I got them they were too tight for me to be comfortable wearing.  Since they did not come in width sizes I was afraid I would have to send them back.  I thought I might purchase a mechanical type shoe stretcher when I happened across this product on amazon.  I wish I had realized there were products like this many years ago so I wouldn&#x27;t have had to struggle with my feet hurting with slightly too tight shoes.  As is the case with most people one foot was tighter than the other so on one foot I simply sprayed the product on the inside of the sandal and eased my foot into it and I put a sock on the other foot before gradually easing my foot into the sandal.  Then I wore them for a few hours and when I took off my sock the sandal felt very comfortable wearing.</li>
            <li> A purchased a can of this about six months ago on the advice of my brother; his wife uses it and, though I was skeptical it would work, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  And it works!  So well, in fact, I shared it with a coworker and she never returned it.  Now she keeps in in her desk drawer and has been sharing it with others in the office.  Rather than asking for it back (since she obviously thought it was a gift) I purchased another can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This spray really works, I had to apply it at least two times and wore my shoes with two thick socks one over the other so it could help stretch the shoes a little bigger than my actual size i.e. in this case the width of my feet. I&#x27;ve never seen this stuff sold in my country and stumbled on it browsing the Online Amazon store. Took a chance and bought it and had no regrets.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy and will buy again if needed.</li>
            <li> spray it on, combine it with a shoe stretcher or a show tree plus regular wearing of the shoes, and you will notice a difference over time. Be patient. But also do not over-apply. Try a little bit first and then see if you need more.</li>
            <li> The sprayer did not work. I shook it up many times, tried to spray, nothing. I turned the nozzle, nothing still would not spray. I removed nozzle and reinserted nozzle still would not spray. It is now in the trash.</li>
            <li> This product really works!  I was definitely skeptical but I figured it was worth a shot as I couldn&#x27;t return the shoes.  I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try.  My only issue was that it stopped spraying after many uses, but there was still product left in the can.</li>
            <li> Tried to stretch my black leather sneakers. It didn&#x27;t work. At all. And I read all the reviews on all the shoe stretch aerosols on amazon. This one had the best rating. I don&#x27;t think so</li>
            <li> Worked well with boot stretcher.  Haven&#x27;t tried it without a stretcher but it didn&#x27;t stain and didn&#x27;t have any odor.</li>
            <li> I tried this on a pair of leather sneakers and it worked like a dream.  If you have a tight pair of leather shoes that need to stretch then your going to need this.</li>
            <li> It didnt make any difference at all.</li>
            <li> Have only used it a few times so far but it seems to be working. Nice because you use the product and then wear the shoe or boot to stretch it. Down side is that the boot can still be uncomfortable while it is stretching.</li>
            <li> I just thought this product was a little too expensive for the amount that you get. I will explore some other alternatives to stretching leather footwear.</li>
            <li> I cant believe how this stuff works.  I used it on canvas Sperry&#x27;s, a pair of flats and a pair of wedges.  I tried to use a shoe stretch, but found that my own foot was all I need.  As soon as I sprayed it and put the shoe on it instantly felt more comfortable.  I brought it to work and showed everyone and told them if they ever need to stretch a shoe amazon is the place to find this.</li>
            <li> Does not stretch, it soften the show a little bit for a while, however, it has to be applied over and over due that as soon as it dries it does not work anymore.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, did not stain my shoes, which were  quickly stretched. Good price too.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied. Would purchase again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product to stretch a pair of too tight suede boots and it worked extremely well.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I sprayed this in on the inside of boots and then used a Cast Aluminum Stretcher to expand a pair of boots I bought. This worked wonderfully and made the inside of the boots soft! I was able to add an inch of circumference to the shaft of boots thanks to this Shoe Stretch. It does have a strong smell, but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> used for 1-2 sprays, nozzle failed.</li>
            <li> It really works! My Ralph Lauren shoes fit perfect now. Had to wait to try it because I broke my right foot and could not wear any shoe.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the shoes stretcher and I save one of my verrry expensive shoes from being sent out to the pasture.  So was it the shoes or the spray, I do not know.  But they worked and that is all that counts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product.  I love it It works great</li>
            <li> It does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> After using the Meltonian Shoe Stretch-Aerosol, my shoes seemed to fit more loosely; however, the product seems sticky to me or like my feet are sweating heavily, and I don&#x27;t like the feel.  Also, my shoes didn&#x27;t seem to stay stretched out, if they ever were.  I can&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Used this product before.  Great for all those tight shoes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some shoes for a couple of years that I never wore because they pinched.  I sprayed them on the inside and then wore them with thick socks until dry.  It worked and now I can wear my shoes.  Good product</li>
            <li> All I will say, it is ok.I did not find it any better then other shoe stretch sprays only that it is a little pricier.</li>
            <li> This product seemed to help, but I couldn&#x27;t really tell for sure. I haven&#x27;t had a frequent need to use it aside from the original time.</li>
            <li> Works very well with the stretcher.  This product performs as advertised!</li>
            <li> definitely helped with making my shoes more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Not great, better off buying the FootFitter Bunion Stretcher Ball &amp; Ring, Cast Iron</li>
            <li> No more squeezed toes,  I spray it on as I leave the house by the time I reach my destination I can tell the difference.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product based on customer review, and was not disappointed. Given a pair of shoes that were slightly tight at the toes. Spayed the product in the toe area, inserted a shoe stretcher; allowed it to set a few hours and presto! Comfortable shoes.</li>
            <li> It took forever and a day to receive this shoe stretcher, but when I did receive it, I immediately used it on a pair of leather riding boots that are one half size too small.  I spent too much on those boots to give them up.  I followed the directions, and like magic, the boots stretched and my feet no longer are in agony.  I recommend, but perhaps from another seller.  They were not Amazon Prime at the time I bought it.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews, I ordered this to stretch a pair of shoes I had ordered online but which was not returnable.  I&#x27;ve treated the shoes 5 times and used shoe trees and also wore them around the house as the directions indicated but found no difference in the fit of the shoes.  This product worked for some people but did not for me.</li>
            <li> Use with a wooden shoe stretcher or with wearing shoe.  A bigger can size would be nice.  It gets the job done and isn&#x27;t too toxic smelling.</li>
            <li> I did not get to try this product because it was defective and would not spray, also it cannot be returned.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Not sure why I can&#x27;t find this locally anywhere.</li>
            <li> I never ever wrtie review unless something is really out there and i have to say i have wide feet so a regular shoe unless its in w next to it , doesnt fit me. I order some boots 8 , too tigh I read a review that they were wide enough, they werent. I sprayed this on and put a can of bean inside the boot to strch it out, left it overnight after sparaying this inside, works like miracle next night i tried on and they were perfect!</li>
            <li> I have only used this one time and no real difference so I will just try again.  It seems easy enough.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. No issues</li>
            <li> Working&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;with this product</li>
            <li> Works well. Needed to add some room for the second toe and this helped make more room without staining.</li>
            <li> Found a pair of boots that I loved. Fit fine in the store but after one wearing were too tight in the instep. Tried all the home remedies...none worked. Bought meltonian shoe stretch, sprayed it on, put on a heavy pair of socks and wore around the house for a half hour and now they fit just fine.</li>
            <li> It was good stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary Hanna</li>
            <li> Stretches boots somewhat noticeably--will take diligent and continued effort though ...  Following directions from the can, I sprayed inside of boots&#x27; toe boxes, followed by donning heavy socks.  After significant amount of time, I took off my boots. I noted somewhat of a difference in boots&#x27; roominess. So why only four stars rating?  Oddly, my polished toenails adhered to my socks from the spray--completely stuck.  To extricate my toes, my toenail polish was sacrificed.  That informs me that the spray is more powerful than one might think.  I might make plastic shoe booties first and then add my socks before using the spray. Perhaps, a warning about how wearing toenail polish is not a good idea when using this spray.  I am glad to have Meltonian Shoe Stretch Spray and believe I&#x27;ll ultimately get my boots toe box roomy enough with it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that this stretched my shoes even a 1/2 size but it did make the leather softer.  I have worn the shoes for a couple weeks and still nothing, but I&#x27;m hoping over time they stretch a bit more.  If you need to soften your shoes for comfort this product would be good, but if you need them stretched a 1/2 size or more take them to a professional.  The spray is easy to apply and non-greasy.  It doesn&#x27;t stain socks and it has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Used it to stretch a few pairs of shoes along with a FootFitter, followed directions and seemed to work as advertised.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Woks well to stretch shoes.</li>
            <li> This item did not work for me.  Bummer I was really hoping it would</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised. I was surprised at how fast the leather softened.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a pair of western boots which were tight on the side if the big toe.  Sprayed until the cows came home to no avail,  Even used boot stretcher in conjunction with the spray</li>
            <li> Had a couple pair of shoes that were too tight.  This worked like a dream.  Shoes fit well now.  Thanks,</li>
            <li> It really works! Bought a pair of boots. Because one of my feet is larger than the other, which is typical, one boot was tighter than the other. I feared that exchanging them for a bigger size would then leave one boot larger than my foot. So, I used this on the tighter boot. Perfect!</li>
            <li> Used it on a pair of moccasins,worked for me.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t even need a shoe stretcher with this product I sprayed in my peep toe heels and a few minutes later they were good to go.</li>
            <li> This shoe stretch aerosol works well. Just wish it would come with an extended tube to spray inside the boot toe easier...</li>
            <li> I purchased some cute knee-high, zip-up Steve Madden leather boots. Well, the zipper would not budge past the widest part of my rather *ahem* \\&quot;athletic\\&quot; calf. Disappointed, I Googled for a solution, and came across this product on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say, I was skeptical at first. I sprayed the area around the zipper, as well as a couple of inches out onto the boot shaft. I then wrapped a mason jar in a couple layers of newspaper and zipped the boot up over it. It was snug, but I spent a few more minutes working in some rolled up pieces of paper between the leather and the newspaper. After about 15 or 20 minutes, I took the \\&quot;stretcher\\&quot; out and attempted to zip it up my leg, and... voila! It zipped right up like a charm. It wasn&#x27;t completely dry at that point, so I left the boots on while I was at home and let them completely dry out (wearing knee high socks- not sure you want this stuff on your skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So happy to have found this product!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm! I sprayed the toe area of my 1 1/2 heeled shoes with this aerosol; then put on a shoe stretcher immediately afterwards - let stand overnight or 2 nights or so and VOILA: I&#x27;ve got shoes that now fits comfortably!!!l</li>
            <li> Received it earlier than expected, have started stretching out several shoes with problems due to bone spur growth and it is working fine. Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I heistated before buying this product for fear that it wouldn&#x27;t work. Boy was I wrong! this stuff is absolutely awesome! I used it on a new pair of heels that I bought and they now feel totally broke in and compfy!</li>
            <li> Works well…&lt;br /&gt;Does as promised.&lt;br /&gt;Softens the leather so that the shoe stretches more easily and quicker.&lt;br /&gt;Works extremely well with my boot stretchers.</li>
            <li> If your shoes are to tight and they just need a little stretching in specific areas, this is the product to buy.  It was very effective for the one place in my shoes that need stretch.</li>
            <li> I was going to return a new pair of shoes I had purchased, because they pinched the side of my left foot. I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be able to spend any amount of time in them.  However, I sprayed this in them and wore them until they dried.  That night, I was dancing in them with no pain at all.  Now they&#x27;re one of my favorite pair of shoes!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to use it on my leather computer bag that is just a little too tight to slide my computer in and out of easily!  This is going to save me so much money!</li>
            <li> This Meltonian Shoe Stretch product does work although you may need to apply the product more than once.  I will have to apply it again to have total success in the fit of my treated shoes.  One application changes the shoe&#x27;s material but I feel a second application of the spray should do the trick.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after hearing about it on a motorcycle forum.  I had just purchased a new pair of racing gloves and they were so tight they were putting my hands to sleep after just a short ride.  I sprayed inside and outside of the gloves in the areas they were tight, put the gloves on and went for a ride.  Almost immediately they felt better and now after a few rides they are perfectly broken in.  Did the spray help, I say most definitely!</li>
            <li> It helps to stretch shoes. It works slowly not all at once. But it does help.</li>
            <li> Did get a little bit more space in a pair of shoes that I had just purchased.&lt;br /&gt;Since I still felt that they were too tight... I decided to just exchange the shoes (while they were still brand new) and picked a half size up.&lt;br /&gt;So... I am still not very sure if this product works as it says it does...&lt;br /&gt;But I decided to keep it, in case I ever need it for maybe myself or shoes for the kids!</li>
            <li> WORKS WELL WITH THE Foot Fitter shoe stretchers</li>
            <li> I used this along with the wooden shoe stretcher and it worked perfect. My clogs that I was not able to stretch for about a year with just wearing them are now perfect.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores so I have no choice but to order online.  Most likely to find in strictly shoe stores instead of big box.&lt;br /&gt;Light spray does the trick to give the shoe a natural stretch.</li>
            <li> This spray worked immediately. I am happy with this purchase. I sprayed inside of my leather shoes, put on the thickest sock I owned and walked around for 30 to 40 minutes. I wore the shoes the next day and....MAGIC. I did not have to buy a new pair of shoes! I love this product. I did feel bad walking around in my oxfords with thick white gym socks, but it was well worth the comfort.</li>
            <li> I tried this product several times on the same shoe, after the can is empty now, I am still trying other ways to stretch the same shoe.</li>
            <li> To be effective ,it should be used with a mechanical type shoe stretcher ,I used the Bravo-fit product,but it still takes time &amp; patience!!</li>
            <li> It gives a temporary fix, but not long term.  I suggest using it with actual stretchers to give the stretching process an extra umph.</li>
            <li> I have sprayed and worn, sprayed and used a shoe stretcher and this product has not aided at all in the stretching of two pairs of leather shoes. Neither pair of shoes are patent leather, both are high end leather shoes. Cole Hahn and Jimmy Choo.  I do not recommend this product, to me it appears to be perfumed alcohol spray.</li>
            <li> Works OK but it stopped spraying even though you can tell there&#x27;s still a lot in the can.</li>
            <li> This product did not do anything to stretch my new shoes even though I appled it several times.  Maybe it only works on &amp;#34;certain&amp;#34; shoes</li>
            <li> No complains. I tried this stretch spray on my brand new Kenneth Cole REACTION Women&#x27;s Full Of Life Oxford,Black. (got it in Amazon too) I&#x27;m size 6, perfect size, the only thing is the KC shoes were hard to put it on and also when I walk, so I use the stretcher just to break them. After that, shoe were soft, happy now. I also use the wood shoe stretcher in another pair of shoes and works fine.... As other reviewers mentioned the spray will make your feet sweat a lot, even when you make shoes dry for a day or two, but no big issue it was just for couple days...</li>
            <li> should buy good fitting shoes, but this works temporarily</li>
            <li> I bought some very expensive boots online.  I loved them but they just seemed tight.  I used this aerosol on the advise of a friend and &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34;.  Just spray inside as directed, wear around the house for a half hour or so with socks and you will feel them &amp;#34;give&amp;#34;. They now fit like a glove.  Good also to use when you have leather footwear that has been sitting since last season.</li>
            <li> Funky smell. Not really necessary or helpful</li>
            <li> Works ok, but water will also work if you wear the shoes while wet....</li>
            <li> I have a very expensive pair of high heels and this absolutely got them fitting perfectly. This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> We used this product with a shoe stretcher and it worked perfectly. I cannot wait to use on a pair of shoes&lt;br /&gt;that I have with just my foot inserted to help stretch.</li>
            <li> Ok so i recieved this shoe spray on time and all, but i don&#x27;t get how this works, i sprayed it inside a couple of my shoes and put my foot in while it was still wet and walked around in it, but when i go back to wear the shoes later i don&#x27;t feel the difference, maybe time will tell, i don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in a timely fashion. This product was easy to use, just spray on inside of leather footware and then wear for about an hour until it dries. I ordered a pair of boots a half size smaller then my shoe size (that was all that was left!) hoping this stretch would work, and it absolutely did! I put on a thick pair of socks while the spray dried and worked like a charm!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. I used it on a pair of shoes that were tight.  Sprayed it inside and put the shoes on.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t bother me anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Vivianne</li>
            <li> Seems to work as described! I had a new pair of shoes that were a tad to tight. So bought this AND a set of shoe stretchers. worked perfectly together!</li>
            <li> Worked as it said it would. Does really good when used with a combination of mechanical shoe stretchers</li>
            <li> This worked very well. I previously took my shoes to the Cobbler for stretching but they stayed the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pair of AE Park Avenues i recently got a sweet deal on were a bit tight around the pinky but after applying this spray that issue was fixed. This is what i did: I sprayed the inside of the shoe then put them on at home for about a half hour wearing two pairs of very thick athletic socks. If you do the same that should get you the stretch you need to make your shoes comfortable.</li>
            <li> First of all, I didn&#x27;t order it intentionally. I have also tried it and didn&#x27;t find it worked at all.</li>
            <li> This is the best shoe stretching product I have used.</li>
            <li> This product worked well.  It took more than 1 treatment but work well.</li>
            <li> The sender backed up their product . The first can didn&#x27;t operate, a second can was promptly sent to me. I am still stretching boot leather . I the near future, I will determine if this product actually helped with softening the lesther.</li>
            <li> Still too early to tell</li>
            <li> I bought shoes that were too tight and didn&#x27;t want to return them.  This product worked great and would order again.</li>
            <li> Amazingly, the Meltonian shoe stretch works..as advertised! If you have a pair of shoes that you love, but they pinch and could actually fit very well, if only...  Don&#x27;t deny yourself, use the shoe stretch and enjoy a comfortable fit!</li>
            <li> Clear these items now.  I have them bought them some time ago.  I wanted to buy some dog toys today for tough dogs.  I cant place my order for all the past order inmy face.  where is the shopping cart order sheet?</li>
            <li> So I finally bought my first pair of Louboutins (Decollete&#x27;s). I was about to either return or resell them because the toebox was too narrow for me. Painfully narrow. I wore them around the apartment for 10 minutes and was in so much pain. I tried to stretch them by wearing socks with them, putting tubes of lipsticks and rolls of quarters up the toebox to hopefully get a little give.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical but ordered this anyway. So so happy I did. You spray it on the inside and wear them around while the liquid dries. Almost INSTANT relief. Upon standing and walking a few steps, I was in shock at how much better my shoes felt! Really worth trying, especially for the price. And to the reviewers complaining about the S&amp;H, I don&#x27;t know for sure but I remember reading somewhere that aerosols require a bit extra to ship. Maybe that&#x27;s why S&amp;H is a bit more expensive than we think it should be. Regardless, I would order again!</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm! Tried other ways to stretch my leather boots that all had no effects. This product really worked!</li>
            <li> Worked great on my ostrich boots.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. It really works. I&#x27;ve past it on to friends and family &amp; they couldn&#x27;t believe it either. How fast it actually works is amazing. This product helps walking in new shoes comfortable. Other ways of stretching shoes takes a long time. With Meltonian, just spray &amp; go!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical on using this thinking it wouldn&#x27;t work, but it really did great!  I purchased some Tory Burch flats that I thought were just going to kill my feet!  I sprayed the inside, and stuffed the shoe with newspaper, 1 week later, the shoes fit, and feel great!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t really help my boots stretch.</li>
            <li> Really does loosen the the fabric of the shoe. Works on suede! Leaves no stain or anything! Great product</li>
            <li> This is very good product-- amazing ----</li>
            <li> Spray works excellent! Just walk around in the shoes afterwards and they will be good and stretched out. Will reorder.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and lives up to its claim of stretching the shoe only where needed.</li>
            <li> This product has seemed to work as described. I applied it as directed to a pair of shoes that were tight across my metatarsial region and wore them until the shoe stretched worked.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried a product like this and I was amazed at how simple and easy it was to use. I purchased a pair of leather boots and they were a bit snug .... just sprayed some in the boots...put on two pairs of socks, put on the boots... wore them for a couple hours then took off one pair of socks and the boots fit like they were custom made for my feet!</li>
            <li> This stuff works and works well. It does not make the leather stiff, so I was very happy with it. I use it with all my new shoes, and my fiance uses it with his new shoes as well.</li>
            <li> It works quickly on shoes after spraying and stretching them out for an hour or two. Does wonders for any type of shoe from flats to heels. I love this product!</li>
            <li> I have purchased several similar products . Most worked better.</li>
            <li> Used this with a shoe stretcher on a pair of Loubountins that I got that were too tight.  Some of their shoes run small.  I used the deluxe shoe stretcher with the spray and left the stretcher I. The shoes after spraying this for 1 day and the shoes were nicely stretched without ruining the leather or shoe itself.  I would not goo too crazy and drench the shoe but just enough to get it loose.</li>
            <li> We bought this to use for my shoes but it did not work well at all.  After I spray the shoes and wear them, I don&#x27;t feel the difference at all.  Will not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I thought I read that you could spray the outside of the shoe.  Not true - the can says to spray the INSIDE - that would be difficult with the boots I purchased the spray for!</li>
            <li> It required several applications.  It was difficult to get the spray where I needed it.  I ended up using another product that I could use on the outside of the shoe.</li>
            <li> i have used this on a few pair of new shoes and slightly tight fitting shoes and it really works,great buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this stuff on many of my shoes, just gives them that extra bit of stretch to make them comfy.  I have many work shoes that are tight in the toe box and this stuff has helped a great deal.  Some shoes many need a few applications, but it has not damaged any of my shoes - even super pricey patent leather Ferragamos!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Just spray inside your shoe than put shoe on and its stretched, it seems to good to be true but it really works just like i said. It also has a pleasant smell. Costs practically nothing and honestly works, especially when going up a size will change the entire fit.  Amazon has best price and it arrived in three days.</li>
            <li> This product really works</li>
            <li> This stuff is just fantastic. So easy to use and it really works.</li>
            <li> Ran out of aerosol after one use.  What a waste</li>
            <li> I like this shoe stretch-aerosol. My feet swell and some times you need your shoes stretched a little. Simply put on your shoes and spray. If your shoes are a little tight, just spray where it is needed and desired and your feet will gently slide in your shoe.</li>
            <li> Had to stretch the calf of my favorite boots almost two inches and this did the trick - Great Product, would highly recommend</li>
            <li> I bought this spray to help me stretch a pair of loafers that were a marginal fit. IT WORKS. The shoes are now easy to put on and they are comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever purchased. I now have more shoes I am able to wear. Just spray it on leather straps put shoes on with thick socks and within a few minutes you can feel them stretch out. They stay soft and nice. I recommend this to anyone that has problems with shoes do to width for any reason.</li>
            <li> This is the best shoe stretcher that I&#x27;ve ever used.  I took 2 pair of shoes to a cobbler to be stretched and I did not see any difference.&lt;br /&gt;I used the Meltonian Shoe Stretch along with a high heel shoe stretcher, that I also bought from Amazon, applied a couple of times and left the shoe stretcher on overnight.(Don&#x27;t really think you need to do it overnight)  I used this on a very sparkly pair of shoes that I bought for my son&#x27;s wedding.  I have bunions that make most of my heels hurt.  Couldn&#x27;t believe how this stretched my shoes.  They are so comfortable now that I don&#x27;t think I will need my back up sandals and I&#x27;ll be able to do a mother-son dance without pain.</li>
            <li> The nozzle on mine broke after 2 uses.</li>
            <li> Really works. Broke a pair of horribly difficult to break-in Frye boots in about 20 minutes. The first brown pair chewed up my heels with the back zipper and crunched my toes with the stiff toe box. Just got a pair in black today. Sprayed some of this on the inside on the heel and into the toe box (turn the shoe upside down and spray with the can upright), put on some thick socks, crammed my feet in there and started walking around. Within about 2 minutes I could feel the boots start to release and within 10 minutes they were nearing downright loose. Don&#x27;t think, just buy. Oh also, it actually smells really good.</li>
            <li> I used this spray with the high heel shoe stretcher and managed to save a few pair of shoes from the &#x27;Goodwill&#x27; pile.  I have a skinny heel and a wide toe box which makes it difficult to find shoes that fit well.  If they are wide enough for my toes, they&#x27;re way too big at the heel.  If they fit my heel well, they&#x27;re usually snug in the toe area.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to stretch my shoes just enough to make them comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help stretch a pair of boots that I bought last year.  It does a fairly good job and I would probably purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I have bunions so shoes hurt that i wear sometimes&lt;br /&gt;this i sprayed on after putting on the shoe and wore them till dry&lt;br /&gt;it took a few times but now the shoes are stretched and comfortable to wear&lt;br /&gt;worth the money</li>
            <li> This stuff works perfectly for spot stretching shoes. If you have a pair of quality shoes that are tight in one area this stuff works perfectly.</li>
            <li> It seems to work, but not on man made materials. But I believe it says that in the description.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work, but I&#x27;m not sure anything would on frye boots, you are better off going to a shoe shop and having them professionally stretched....</li>
            <li> Works very well. I hace used this for my leather boot that were a little too tight cause they were new and this helped stretching them a little</li>
            <li> Soften leather well to stretch the leather</li>
            <li> I sprayed it on the portion where my pinky toe was hitting the side of the shoe and inserted the shoe stretcher I got from Amazon. After 24 hours I could wear my shoes comfortably.</li>
            <li> Works well and makes wearing shoes easy.</li>
            <li> this stuff works pretty darn good.</li>
            <li> This product is truly awesome!  I bought a pair of boots - on sale.  The right one fit perfectly...the left one was tight.  I used this product and I couldn&#x27;t believe it!  It works!  Everyone at work has used this on their tight fitting shoes and loves it!  Some have even ordered their own!</li>
            <li> I bought a pair of shoes to wear for a dance that I am doing in a community show.  They were a bit tight in the toes.  I bought this product hoping they would make the shoes feel better, and behold, they did.  Last night I wore the shoes for a couple of hours with absolutely no pain.  I&#x27;m already thinking about a couple of other pairs of shoes of mine that aren&#x27;t too comfortable, that I haven&#x27;t been wearing for some time and will be after I stretch them, too.</li>
            <li> Shoe stretch works well to make stiff, tight leather shoes more roomy.  I sprayed the inside of the shoe that was too tight (my left foot is 1/2 size bigger than my right), and then wore the pair around with sox on.  I formerly would buy the larger size pair and then use heel and tongue pads on the too large right shoe to make it fit.  This is much easier.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fabulous to use when stretching your shoes.  Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Really doesn&#x27;t do much.  Does not seem to soften the leather to aid in stretching.  Wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on it.</li>
            <li> it works just the way it&#x27;s supposed to - i have a wide forefoot but a skinny ankle so i have to adjust.  This is great!</li>
            <li> This product did not stretch my leather shoes at all even after following the directions given. I do not recommend this product</li>
            <li> The can would not spray.</li>
            <li> I have gout and shoes give me toe pain if the toe box isn&#x27;t high enough.  I found this spray so I had to try it.  It&#x27;s extremely easy to use and it really works!!  Now I can buy the shoes I want, use this spray, and walk without pain.  I love this spray!!  Also it&#x27;s so reasonably priced.  I&#x27;ll always have a can of this spray in the cabinet ready for my next pair of shoes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> It works.  Being in aerosol, it is easy to spread on far places in your boots or shoes.</li>
            <li> AEROSOL can was inoperable and cannot be used.</li>
            <li> Do not do the work as stated. cannot straight the shoes</li>
            <li> Made a great looking pair of shoes supremely comfortable as well</li>
            <li> nothing came o - waste of moneyut --clogged</li>
            <li> Should have listened to the other negative reviews.  I was able to spray one shoe, and then it was done.  The nozzle isn&#x27;t clogged, there&#x27;s just no propellant left.  I can get a tiny trickle of liquid out of the can, but not an actual spray.  When I attempted to return it as a defective item, I was told that because it requires special handling it&#x27;s not eligible for return.  So I&#x27;m just out of luck.</li>
            <li> I used it however not quite sure if it worked or was it just my boot stretchers.</li>
            <li> It was somewhat helpful.</li>
            <li> I received the can reasonably prompt.  When I went to use the can on my offending leather cowboy boot shaft the can would not work-no spray.  Upon close exam under magnification I could not see the hole in the plastic spray nozzle.  I removed the plastic nozzle &amp; tried using a needle to open it up.  Still did not work.  I tried spraying straight from can.  There was fluid in the can but evidently no gas pressurization in the can to push the fluid out.  The can was defective so I could not use the product to see how it might work. I bought leather shoe stretcher solution in a container with a had pump sprayer which worked find at a chain shoe store.</li>
            <li> What can you say, it works</li>
            <li> didn.t notice any advantage to using this product.  Had to redo multiple times.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t stretch as much as I wanted it too, just a little. Needed quite a bit more and found soaking it in water worked awesome. Just be sure after you soak in water and stretch you treat the leather after it dries.</li>
            <li> Worked very well for me, exactly as advertised. I like that it is a spray as it was very easy to apply. I do not understand the comment about the squishy feel, but then I always wear socks or tights.</li>
            <li> Seems to work but difficult to tell</li>
            <li> Great products. Great prices. I&#x27;ve had this similiar products in many other brands and they all were okay this one has seems the best so far.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I was shocked that this product worked so quickly in stretching out my shoes. I have wide feet and struggle to find comfortable shoes. Although this product did not work with every type of shoe, I am very pleased with the outcome.</li>
            <li> I bought this spray unsure of what to expect.  I used the spray on a pair of suede boots that we too tight around the heel, ball of foot and over my instep.  I sprayed then wore the boots around the house with a thicker pair of sock than I would normally wear with those shoes.  After about 30 minutes I took them off and tried the boot with a thinner stocking sock and it was very well adjusted and comfortable!  I repeated the process one more time to be sure, and have been wearing the boots all day today with no uncomfortableness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I did not like about this product was the chemical smell that it left on my feet.  It&#x27;s nothing that soaking them for a bit can&#x27;t fix, and totally worth it to make a too tight pair of awesome shoes fit.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference, though that&#x27;s more likely due to me having hugely fat feet and the shoes needing a LOT of stretching.</li>
            <li> If your shoes are tight this product really works as designed. New shoes, old shoes, any shoe that when worn gets tight will fit.</li>
            <li> I havent used this product yet but have every confidence it will work as well for me as it did for other customers who rated it highly.</li>
            <li> Works great on Converse shoes.</li>
            <li> Put on the inside of my shoes and put on 2 pairs of socks. I wore the shoes until I thought product was dry. It really did widen my shoes enough to make them comfortable to wear</li>
            <li> Two words: it works. I have some Ecco loafers sitting on the shelf because of a bunion. This product restored the loafers to me, after a single application. I have not had the same luck with athletic shoes [too much mesh/not enough leather?], but on all-leather uppers I am seeing outstanding results. It is well worth trying.</li>
