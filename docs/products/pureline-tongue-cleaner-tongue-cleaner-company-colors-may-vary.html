            <li>Fits well on the tongue and feels good in the hand.</li>

            <li>Great product and love services</li>
            <li>I love these and would never use another brand!</li>
            <li>We love our tongue cleaners!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great customer service!</li>
            <li>Nice size and shape.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a customer of this particular tongue cleaner for years and its the best out there.</li>
            <li>I love these tongue cleaners, they really get the gunk off lol after brushing and flossing of course!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best tongue scrapper Ive used</li>
            <li>This is by far the best tongue cleaner I have used in my life.</li>
            <li>exactly what i needed @ a great price.  </li>
            <li>It works great, it is efficient, it does not rust and it is easy to clean. :)</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>love it :)</li>
            <li>i love it, it cleans every area of the tounge after mouthwash ane brushing.</li>
            <li>This one is tapered at the top so it doesn&#x27;t cause the gag reflex.</li>
            <li>Glad I was able to purchase it once again.  </li>
            <li>Have not been able to obtain them loacally anymore.</li>
            <li>I had one of these many years ago, kept looking for it in stores but no luck.</li>
            <li>Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do but not as effiecient as I would like, could be designed better, and WAY overpriced.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to find them at Walmart, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find them there for years now.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>They just collect better.</li>
            <li>Most people think by brushing their tongue, they are getting everything off of it.  </li>
            <li>Also, judging by the fact that this went 5 years before breaking, it&#x27;s a pretty good investment.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels fresh always!!  </li>
            <li>Most others are flimsy and can break easily.  </li>
            <li>This seems ok even though it is smooth when scraping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy and doesn&#x27;t break easily.</li>
            <li>so I think it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Great product, everyone should use one daily.  </li>
            <li>These tongue cleaners are great - totally reusable, because they have no strings attached - just plastic parts!  </li>
            <li>Using mints helps mask the smell but being able to scrape the bacteria off is much better(takes about 3-4 seconds) and makes my breath smell much more acceptable.</li>
            <li>THEY REALLY WORK!!!</li>
            <li>50 cents each, very economical.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re golden!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why some pharmacies stopped carrying these, they are the best!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to clean, and does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>Scrapes tongue clean of bacteria.</li>
            <li>keeps your tong clean and your mouth clean and healthy&lt;</li>
            <li>The pics on this page show 3 tools in various colors with no way to select the desired color which leads one to think you&#x27;ll get all 3, but no it&#x27;s just 1 tool at 3x the fair price.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy I found this online, I can never live without it!!  </li>
            <li>this arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I found these online, so I bought 2, so</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit very well into my toothbrush sterilizer.</li>
            <li>Very thankful they are available online.</li>
            <li>Angled nicely for way back access.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other brands, but have never been pleased with them.</li>
            <li>This style is more \\&quot;rigid\\&quot; than other versions and perform better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It really helps to keep my mouth feeling clean, and my breath fresh by scraping away the germs on my tongue.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought some other brand (Oral B I think) for my travel toiletry set and it doesn&#x27;t do nearly as good a job.</li>
            <li>this tounge scrapper is the right shape and sturdy</li>
            <li>I bought my first one of these at Walmart almost a decade ago.  </li>
            <li>What more can you say about something so simple.</li>
            <li>Much easier than using your toothbrush or those tiny flosser/scraper disposable things (and more economical/environmentally-friendly).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s looked so simple and elegant that it seemed it should work well, but it really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The tongue is a rough surface, and I don&#x27;t understand now how a straight-edged piece of plastic is supposed to be suitable for scraping everything away.</li>
            <li>/&gt;just scrap your tong from back to front and rinse well, that easy</li>
            <li>Solid, strong, product that gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and love it!</li>
            <li>At best, most are too small to be effective, requiring multiple passes, others (usually the type with multiple ridges) simply don&#x27;t do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a much needed item for everyone dental hygine.</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it to any body who wants a tinge cleaner/scrapper</li>
            <li>My mouth feels so much cleaner</li>
            <li>and my breath is much fresher (so says my hubby).  </li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ve been ordering them through amazon because they work better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>These seem to work better than other ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>Very strudy, hits the whole toungue at once and leaves you feeling much cleaner on the whole.&lt;br /&gt;Things to note: Yes there is only one</li>
            <li>I will order agan when I need a new one.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly when I tried them out, they work quite well, probably because of the shape, but they don&#x27;t need to be extra edgy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it three times, I think, but It&#x27;s pretty alright.</li>
            <li>I have used ora brush in the past, but many reviews on here led me to try this pure-line product.</li>
            <li>So, I ordered this one from Amazon as an exact replacement and now all is right with the world and one tongue is a little cleaner.  </li>
            <li>tongue scraper completely cleans your tongue off in one pass.  </li>
            <li>and so far I like it.</li>
            <li>much larger than dentek, but very effective.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>and it,s completely overpriced,</li>
            <li>, no this will never break on you, this works better than the small version as it only adds 15 secounds to your routine</li>
            <li>They are OK, but they usually break after a period of time and always in the same place.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend had been using this exact tongue scraper for nearly 5 years (that seems like a long time to keep the same tongue scraper, no?).  </li>
            <li>Best remedy for bad breath!</li>
            <li>They only have the soft plastic tongue cleaners,which I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>Also good for early morning if you have bad morning breath.</li>
            <li>This little plastic goody should last for a long time, rinses clean, shakes dry.  </li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I went so long without one.</li>
            <li> Seems strange to be scraping my tongue, but a dental hygienist suggested years ago - brush or scrape.  </li>
            <li> Does not bend, clears all bacteria, and lasts long.</li>
            <li> The ad&#x27;s photo shows three tongue, but beware, you are only buying one due to seller&#x27;s misleading advertisement.</li>
            <li> When it finally broke I went to all the usual local places (CVS, Walmart, Walgreens, Target, etc) to buy a replacement.  </li>
            <li> Mine came in a plastic bag, not on a card like the picture, and it&#x27;s pink.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The other flexible one don&#x27;t work we&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li> Each one will last you at least a year.  </li>
            <li> It looks just like all of my previous tongue cleaners.</li>
            <li> I think a slight change in there injection molds would resolve the problem but would probably cut down on sales!</li>
            <li> I have bad breath because the bacteria on my tongue builds up really quickly.</li>

            <li> larger tounge scrapers are not available in any!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this tongue cleaner in the past and had purchased it at a Health Food Store a number of years ago.  </li>
            <li> The products they currently have in stores are very poor quality and don&#x27;t work&lt;</li>
            <li> I had to resort to ordering these scrapers online as they&#x27;re near impossible to find in store.  </li>
            <li> and they are hard durable plastic</li>
            <li> Hard plastic,which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I keep one in my backpack so that I can scrape the bacteria off my tongue after meals or late in the afternoon if I haven&#x27;t had a chance to brush my teeth in a while.</li>
            <li> Try it yourself and you&#x27;ll see what I mean.  </li>
            <li> It is very hard so it does the job.</li>
            <li> Those things they give away at the dentists office are (in my opinion) worthless.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product.  This item is a must!</li>
            <li> This works great, my mouth always feels cleaner when I use it. I can&#x27;t believe I went so long without one. My dental hygienist recommended using one so I ordered this and I love it.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend had been using this exact tongue scraper for nearly 5 years (that seems like a long time to keep the same tongue scraper, no?).  Then the handle snapped off.  I tried to replace it with a different tongue scraper which didn&#x27;t even come close in the scrape-ability department.  So, I ordered this one from Amazon as an exact replacement and now all is right with the world and one tongue is a little cleaner.  Also, judging by the fact that this went 5 years before breaking, it&#x27;s a pretty good investment.</li>
            <li> this arrived quickly.  packed well.  exactly what i needed @ a great price.  highly recommend.  would buy this item again.  these ARE the best ones.</li>
            <li> I love these and would never use another brand! Beware, photo is semi deceiving. Only comes with ONE tongue cleaner (not 3)</li>
            <li> Excellent Product! Cleans your tongue &amp; removes bacteria! Best remedy for bad breath!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean, and does exactly what it says it will do. Angled nicely for way back access. Fast shipping and great customer service!</li>
            <li> me like my tongue cleannnnnnn</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t purchase from. Not honesy people and item not as described</li>
            <li> Picture shows three tongue cleaners.  Yes I know the description does not say three but when your brain sees three, it assumes three in the order. My bad!  Other than that, product is great.</li>
            <li> I used to pick these up at WalMart, but they&#x27;ve stopped carrying them. I&#x27;ve tried many other brands, but have never been pleased with them. These are great, and I&#x27;m happy to have found them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It works great, it is efficient, it does not rust and it is easy to clean. :)&lt;br /&gt;The way it is designed works great! :)&lt;br /&gt;I love it :)</li>
            <li> i love it, it cleans every area of the tounge after mouthwash ane brushing. this tounge scrapper is the right shape and sturdy</li>
            <li> I love these tongue cleaners, they really get the gunk off lol after brushing and flossing of course!</li>
            <li> We love our tongue cleaners!</li>
            <li> I bought my first one of these at Walmart almost a decade ago.  When it finally broke I went to all the usual local places (CVS, Walmart, Walgreens, Target, etc) to buy a replacement.  None of them sold it anymore!  Luckily I found these online, so I bought 2, so I figure I&#x27;m good for another 20 years or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only tongue scraper I&#x27;ve ever used that actually did anything.  At best, most are too small to be effective, requiring multiple passes, others (usually the type with multiple ridges) simply don&#x27;t do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tongue scraper completely cleans your tongue off in one pass.  Do yourself a favor and buy one now, your family, friends, and dentist will thank you for it.</li>
            <li> This shape of tongue cleaner works well for me. I had a different one that was wider and it always made me gag. This one is tapered at the top so it doesn&#x27;t cause the gag reflex. The scraping surface is serrated so it does have a bite to it, but I&#x27;ve never actually injured my tongue so I think it&#x27;s fine. It doesn&#x27;t fit very well into my toothbrush sterilizer.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and love it!</li>
            <li> Nice size and shape. Scrapes tongue clean of bacteria. Fresher breath and cleaner, healthier mouth. Much easier than using your toothbrush or those tiny flosser/scraper disposable things (and more economical/environmentally-friendly). What&#x27;s not to like here?</li>
            <li> My husband loves it; he says it works wonders.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best tongue scrapper Ive used and Ive tried a lot. they last years and they are hard durable plastic and it cleans your tongue well. This is a much needed item for everyone dental hygine.</li>
            <li> I have used it a few weeks and so far I like it. I was used to a two hand scraper that is rougher on the tong. This seems ok even though it is smooth when scraping.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, and it does everything it is supposed to.  You won&#x27;t find any surprises here.  What more can you say about something so simple.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I found this online, I can never live without it!!  My mouth feels fresh always!!  Awesome product!!</li>
            <li> Solid, strong, product that gets the job done. Most others are flimsy and can break easily.  Nothing left to say.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it three times, I think, but It&#x27;s pretty alright. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this tongue cleaner in the past and had purchased it at a Health Food Store a number of years ago.  When I went to purchase another several years later, I couldn&#x27;t find it and tried others on the market.  There&#x27;s no comparison...Pureline Oralcare is the best.  Glad I was able to purchase it once again.  A great product.</li>
            <li> Mine came in a plastic bag, not on a card like the picture, and it&#x27;s pink.  Works really well.  Makes your mouth feel cleaner,  Try it!</li>
            <li> Great product, everyone should use one daily.  well built too. A+</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a customer of this particular tongue cleaner for years and its the best out there. It&#x27;s sturdy and doesn&#x27;t break easily.</li>
            <li> much larger than dentek, but very effective.&lt;br /&gt;At 50 cents each, very economical.</li>
            <li> I had to resort to ordering these scrapers online as they&#x27;re near impossible to find in store.  These are the greatest scrapers ever.  They are sturdy and long lasting.  Once you&#x27;ve used one of these scrapers and followed it up with some mouthwash you&#x27;re golden!  Highly recommended.  The items is not flimsy. It will not bend in your hand.  Each one will last you at least a year.  The only tongue scraper I will use.</li>
            <li> This is the best tongue cleaner around. I bought some other brand (Oral B I think) for my travel toiletry set and it doesn&#x27;t do nearly as good a job. I went back to the store to see if I could find one of these and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere, will end up buying one online. I&#x27;m not sure why some pharmacies stopped carrying these, they are the best! I keep one in my backpack so that I can scrape the bacteria off my tongue after meals or late in the afternoon if I haven&#x27;t had a chance to brush my teeth in a while. I have bad breath because the bacteria on my tongue builds up really quickly. Using mints helps mask the smell but being able to scrape the bacteria off is much better(takes about 3-4 seconds) and makes my breath smell much more acceptable. Also good for early morning if you have bad morning breath.</li>
            <li> I had never used one of these before and don&#x27;t know anyone who has but this thing is great! Very strudy, hits the whole toungue at once and leaves you feeling much cleaner on the whole.&lt;br /&gt;Things to note: Yes there is only one, no this will never break on you, this works better than the small version as it only adds 15 secounds to your routine</li>
            <li> Works great! Have not been able to obtain them loacally anymore. Very thankful they are available online. This style is more \\&quot;rigid\\&quot; than other versions and perform better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The best on the market. It is very hard so it does the job. The other flexible one don&#x27;t work we&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li> I had bought these in stores for years and then suddenly you couldn&#x27;t find them any longer.  The products they currently have in stores are very poor quality and don&#x27;t work&lt;br /&gt;So happy to have found these. They work!</li>
            <li> I have been using these for over 10 years. Brushing alone is insufficient after I added this to my routine.  It really helps to keep my mouth feeling clean, and my breath fresh by scraping away the germs on my tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have given these as gifts to friends and everyone have loved them.</li>
            <li> I have searched almost every store I could find and larger tounge scrapers are not available in any!!!! It&#x27;s like they disappeared so I had to order them online and I&#x27;m going to buy in bulk &#x3D;o)</li>
            <li> the picture says that you can get 3, but in reality, you only get 1. and it,s completely overpriced,</li>
            <li> I got a white tongue cleaner. It looks just like all of my previous tongue cleaners. Was delivered on time and in good condition. I will order agan when I need a new one.</li>
            <li> The tongue cleaner works as described. The ad&#x27;s photo shows three tongue, but beware, you are only buying one due to seller&#x27;s misleading advertisement.</li>
            <li> I had one of these many years ago, kept looking for it in stores but no luck. So happy I ordered it. Best kind I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Great product and love services</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do but not as effiecient as I would like, could be designed better, and WAY overpriced.</li>
            <li> keeps your tong clean and your mouth clean and healthy&lt;br /&gt;just scrap your tong from back to front and rinse well, that easy</li>
            <li> They are OK, but they usually break after a period of time and always in the same place.  I think a slight change in there injection molds would resolve the problem but would probably cut down on sales!</li>
            <li> These cleaners are good but the pic shows three indicating you get three but you only get one not three!</li>
            <li> These seem to clean my tongue the best of any cleaners I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> very good tongue cleaner.Hard plastic,which is what I wanted.I used to buy them at CVS or Walgreen&#x27;s,but they don&#x27;t sell them anymore.They only have the soft plastic tongue cleaners,which I didn&#x27;t like.I would definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to find them at Walmart, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find them there for years now. So, I&#x27;ve been ordering them through amazon because they work better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It says what it does and does it correctly I had no problems with it I would recommend it to any body who wants a tinge cleaner/scrapper</li>
            <li> Beware! The pics on this page show 3 tools in various colors with no way to select the desired color which leads one to think you&#x27;ll get all 3, but no it&#x27;s just 1 tool at 3x the fair price.</li>
            <li> I have used ora brush in the past, but many reviews on here led me to try this pure-line product. This is by far the best tongue cleaner I have used in my life. Unlike the ora brush, it does not deteriorate and it is built to last. There are no bristles, no need to worry about that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off a star because the picture is deceiving to some users (including me, until I read the reviews). Why not just input a different picture that only has 1 cleaner instead of 3?</li>
            <li> Seems strange to be scraping my tongue, but a dental hygienist suggested years ago - brush or scrape.  For once I listened and had been brushing my tongue for years.  One day I ran across an article on the benefits of tongue scraping.  Those things they give away at the dentists office are (in my opinion) worthless.  This little plastic goody should last for a long time, rinses clean, shakes dry.  And its good for you.</li>
            <li> I was recommended to get one of these and given one with a sawtooth pattern. I thought this guys had the saw-tooth pattern too, but they don&#x27;t. Surprisingly when I tried them out, they work quite well, probably because of the shape, but they don&#x27;t need to be extra edgy.</li>
            <li> I thought they would be like dental flossers, which you have to throw out.  These tongue cleaners are great - totally reusable, because they have no strings attached - just plastic parts!  And they work great!  Love them.</li>
            <li> These seem to work better than other ones I&#x27;ve tried. They just collect better. Maybe bc they are bigger? I got my kids into using tongue cleaners, too, but these are too big for their mouths.</li>
            <li> Trust me when I tell you that once you start using this thing, you will never go a day without it.  I can&#x27;t imagine NOT using this as a part of my daily routine when brushing my teeth.  Most people think by brushing their tongue, they are getting everything off of it.  NOT EVEN CLOSE!!!  Try it yourself and you&#x27;ll see what I mean.  This tongue cleaner removes even yucky stuff from my post nasal drip way in the back of my tongue.  Sounds gross but it&#x27;s true.  My mouth feels so much cleaner and my breath is much fresher (so says my hubby).  Now I&#x27;ve got him hooked too.  He uses it everyday, and even takes it with him on trips.</li>
            <li> This product works as designed. Fits well on the tongue and feels good in the hand. The price was competitive as well.</li>
            <li> MUST HAVE MANY OF THESE!!  THEY REALLY WORK!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s looked so simple and elegant that it seemed it should work well, but it really doesn&#x27;t. The tongue is a rough surface, and I don&#x27;t understand now how a straight-edged piece of plastic is supposed to be suitable for scraping everything away. I plan on giving the GUM Tongue Cleaner a shot, since it has a brush as well as a scraper. Gagging for me is likely to always be a problem to some degree, but I expect to have an easier time with that as well. This is better than nothing I suppose, but I&#x27;m definitely not impressed.</li>
            <li> Does not bend, clears all bacteria, and lasts long. Just works great. Best of all - best deal among all.</li>
