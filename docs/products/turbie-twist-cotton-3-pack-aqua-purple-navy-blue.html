    <ol>

            <li>I am very happy with my order.</li>
            <li>Best thing I ever bought for the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful colors.</li>
            <li>These worked perfectly!  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re the best hair towel ever!!</li>
            <li>All in all almost a perfect purchase.</li>
            <li>These are AWESOME!</li>
            <li>These stay put and work great!</li>
            <li>but I will say this quality is very good.  </li>
            <li>Im so happy so very happy.</li>
            <li>The colors are really beautiful.</li>
            <li>These towels are great.  </li>
            <li>We all agree that this is a great product.</li>
            <li>The seller has a great product.</li>
            <li>This is a great product</li>
            <li>But the quality is not that great..</li>
            <li>Great value for the price.  </li>
            <li>Great for gifts, too.</li>
            <li>Love these!!</li>
            <li>$25 for 3 is a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so this pack is a good way to go.</li>
            <li>all my nieces loved these and use them all the time.</li>
            <li>The original Turbie Twist works the best.</li>
            <li>They are great, but are microfiber and that is not my favorite fabric.  </li>
            <li>The 3-pack was a great deal and love the colors.</li>
            <li>I love these things!</li>
            <li>Love these and always will!  </li>
            <li>Just wish they came in more colors and designs!  </li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>Nice, but material picks up lint and holds it.</li>
            <li>Glad to find them here at a good price.</li>
            <li>I never could find another one as nice.  </li>
            <li>prefer the cotton Turbie Twists because it adsorbs the moisture from my hair much more effectively than the micro fiber turbie twists.  </li>
            <li>I had ordered my first set a couple of years ago from QVC and they are still in GREAT shape.  </li>
            <li>As good as the original or better.</li>
            <li>I was so glad to find the Cotton Turbie Twist on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I use these all the time, and I love them.  </li>
            <li>I think I like that better than the Turbie&#x27;s system.</li>
            <li>and I did discover I like the microfiber ones better.  </li>
            <li>The cotton ones are much better quality.</li>
            <li>I have bought more than 20 of these for myself, my friends, nieces, my nephews&#x27; girlfriends and sister in laws.  </li>
            <li>THEY ALL LOVE IT</li>
            <li>No need for bulky towels and filling the washing machine with so many towels.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend ordering these as they are all cotton and absorb better than some of the others on the market.  </li>
            <li>We all love the absorbency and ease of this towel.  </li>
            <li>so we ordered some more.  </li>
            <li>My daughters love these for drying their hair.  </li>
            <li>I love them.  </li>
            <li>This 3 pack is every bit as vivid as the photo - beautiful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thicker, more secure and more absorbent.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY Recommend for anyone in the hospital or nursing home, great to wrap up your hair in, so light and absorbent.</li>
            <li>ok, i like huge bath towels and when i used to use those 1.</li>
            <li>They eventually need replacement because the elastic loop in the back that holds the towel on my head eventually stretches out, but not for many years of great use.  </li>
            <li>I have been using &amp; loving Turbie Twists since they first came out over 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>My hair dries more quickly when ii use these</li>
            <li>Colors are attractive but I wish there were pinks or yellow.</li>
            <li>I bought this set for my sister in law and her daughter because they told me IF the Turbie Twist isn&#x27;t available, then they won&#x27;t wash their hair.  </li>
            <li>WOW I can not say anything but good to say about the towel.</li>
            <li>I got a turbie twist for Christmas a few years ago and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;I needed a new one, and also wanted to give one to each of my sister&#x27;s in law, so the 3-pack was ideal.</li>
            <li>Very practical, cotton absorbs water nicely, very easy to tie.</li>
            <li>4,5 times of use(don&#x27;t judge me) and lounging around w/ wet hair is a lot more pleasant.</li>
            <li>They were well worth the money!</li>
            <li>these are great for long hair to dry when you get out of the shower, or just to soak in the tub, really great when you need to put makeup on.</li>
            <li>bought these for christmas gifts because i love mine so much.</li>
            <li>They beat using a full size bath towel.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.  </li>
            <li>I was worried they wouldn&#x27;t stay on my head because my hair is not thick or long, but these are great.</li>
            <li>Not the best I&#x27;ve used nor the worse.  </li>
            <li>They are worth the price.</li>
            <li>i was surprised to see that they were being sold through Amazon and even more to see the price hike.</li>
            <li>and I liked this set enough to also gift it two times.  </li>
            <li>My wife loves these to use right after her shower to keep her hair up.  </li>
            <li>Several years ago I picked up a Turbie Twist towel locally and it was great for putting her hair up after the bath.  </li>
            <li>Very, very, absorbent.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product and all the various colors and patterns!</li>
            <li>and they stay in place much better than a regular towell  </li>
            <li>I would have given them 5 stars but they weren&#x27;t exactly the cheapest</li>
            <li>I finally decided to look on Amazon for better hair towels</li>
            <li>She puts it on right after washing her hair and it stays in place till she is ready to take it off.</li>
            <li>The colors are bright, the towel is very absorbent and it is so much better than wrapping a big heavy towel on your head that ALWAYS falls off.</li>
            <li>I love them, and I have long hair.</li>
            <li>My first 3 I had got were almost ready to toss, but they still had life yet.</li>
            <li>No more rubbing which isn&#x27;t good for your hair.  </li>
            <li>The material is so much thicker and the colors are vibrant and fun.  </li>
            <li>The colors are pretty and vibrant and very feminine.  </li>
            <li>Perfect size, stay on tight, and saves washing a bunch of big towels -- especially in a family with 3 girls!</li>
            <li>I hope the two people I gave them to like them as much as I do.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really like the Turbie Twists for after the shower.  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I really like the Turbie Twist  </li>
            <li>I really like using Turbie Twists on my hair</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Even after the elastic loop stretches out, the towel is still very absorbent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>3 is all you really need too</li>
            <li>I really like the color.</li>
            <li>They are so much nicer than the one I bought years ago.  </li>
            <li>I really like these.</li>
            <li>do own a few imitations.</li>
            <li>I had 1 of my original Turbie Twist left all of the others got stolen over the years by family &amp; friends.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the purchase.</li>
            <li>When I seen them on line at Amazon while looking for X-Mass gift&#x27;s, I had to get new ones.</li>
            <li>My daughter uses them everytime she showers and it seems to dry her hair quickly and does not seem soaked.</li>
            <li>Most of what I find now are microfiber which I don&#x27;t like and many have awkward attachments like buttons and elastic loops.  </li>
            <li>my huge bath towels used get pretty wet w/ my long hair,</li>
            <li>Have the original white turbie twist, and finally treated myself to something i use all the time.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Bought one several years ago and use it every time I wash my hair- decided it was time to get a few more.</li>
            <li>A yellow, pink, orange or green would be nice...</li>
            <li>I just love these, I have since they come out a few few years ago.</li>
            <li>but now it&#x27;s barely damp and last me</li>
            <li>My 9 year old has long hair but can not balance a regular towel on her head like I can...</li>
            <li>My grandaughter is 6 years old with real long hair and she had no problem using the Turbie Twist.  </li>

            <li> but now it&#x27;s barely damp and last me</li>
            <li> My 9 year old has long hair but can not balance a regular towel on her head like I can...</li>
            <li> My grandaughter is 6 years old with real long hair and she had no problem using the Turbie Twist.  </li>
            <li> By the time I dry and dress, my hair has been dried pretty well by the turbie twist.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long, and those Hotel/Cruise ship towels, are either TOO big or TOO tiny, to wrap up all my hair in, could not find one anywhere on the cruise for sale or on any of the side trips.</li>
            <li> My old ones were plain white</li>
            <li> I have used a regular towel all my life to dry my long hair</li>
            <li> All they sell in the stores here are the yucky microfiber ones that cling to your fingers if your skin is dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these towels to help dry my hair for years.  </li>
            <li> I get into the shower without wanting to get my hair wet, That&#x27;s when I use the microfiber Turbie.</li>
            <li> Needed something for my shoulder length hair that I could use without having to flip my head over and wrap a big, heavy towel around it.</li>
            <li> yet she hates for wet hair to touch her clothing.  </li>
            <li> I got to keep one, and give the other 2 as gifts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other hair towels on the market, but I think Turbie Twist is the best...strongly recommend!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re slightly thinner/flimsy</li>
            <li> They were such a waste of money and they are just so horribly thick I cannot get over it.</li>
            <li> If you have long, thick hair, these may not work for you.</li>
            <li> AND I HATE USING A BIG BATH TOWEL AS THEY WEIGH TO MUCH.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair, so they do work well, but the quality is not great.</li>
            <li> like I do and would never use an ordinary towel ever again.  </li>
            <li> uncomfortable, constantly falling/</li>
            <li> My very long hair isn&#x27;t twisted or pulled inside this wrap.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s just me, but I have a hard time trying to figure out how to wrap this thing on my head so that it stays there</li>
            <li> The microfiber version sucks all of the hydration out of my hair -</li>
            <li> Thick and absorbant without being bulky.  </li>
            <li> There’s no better way tool for washing hair!</li>
            <li> I wish the colors were prettier, actually they are ugly.</li>
            <li> It is a quality item to say the least!</li>
            <li> The horrible weight of ordinary towels on our heads topples over and unwrap themselves by moving your head or bending over.  </li>
            <li> These were so thick and they washed up horrible!</li>

            <li> these are great for long hair to dry when you get out of the shower, or just to soak in the tub, really great when you need to put makeup on.</li>
            <li> Chaz Dean recommended these for sleeping in his hair oils. I was worried they wouldn&#x27;t stay on my head because my hair is not thick or long, but these are great.</li>
            <li> I have used the Turbie Twist towels for my hair for the last 5 or 6 years. I could only find the micro fiber ones and I do not like them at all. I was so glad to find the Cotton Turbie Twist on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Nice, but material picks up lint and holds it. Colors are attractive but I wish there were pinks or yellow.</li>
            <li> I gave two of these for gifts and kept one for myself.  I use these all the time, and I love them.  I hope the two people I gave them to like them as much as I do.</li>
            <li> This have a moderate level of thickness.  Not the best I&#x27;ve used nor the worse.  They are worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using &amp; loving Turbie Twists since they first came out over 10 years ago. This 3 pack is every bit as vivid as the photo - beautiful. I especially love the way this product holds in my curls overnight...You can&#x27;t get that from a regular towel. For me, this is a styling too. $25 for 3 is a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do own a few imitations. They&#x27;re slightly thinner/flimsy so hair takes longer to try. They have a loop a button...I think I like that better than the Turbie&#x27;s system. The microfiber version sucks all of the hydration out of my hair - Not good.&lt;br /&gt;If I get into the shower without wanting to get my hair wet, That&#x27;s when I use the microfiber Turbie.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I have purchased them before form the &amp;#34;As Seen on TV&amp;#34; site. i was surprised to see that they were being sold through Amazon and even more to see the price hike. I still have my invoice from last year when I bought them at a price of three for $9. This year they cost almost twice that.</li>
            <li> I really like the Turbie Twists for after the shower.  By the time I dry and dress, my hair has been dried pretty well by the turbie twist.  No more rubbing which isn&#x27;t good for your hair.  These are cotton terry cloth and I did discover I like the microfiber ones better.  They&#x27;re easier to handle than the cotton ones.  But these still work well.</li>
            <li> Very practical, cotton absorbs water nicely, very easy to tie. I love them, and I have long hair. I wish the colors were prettier, actually they are ugly. A yellow, pink, orange or green would be nice...</li>
            <li> I could not for the life of me find the COTTON Turbie Twist towels! All they sell in the stores here are the yucky microfiber ones that cling to your fingers if your skin is dry. The cotton ones are much better quality. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have purchased Turbie Twists in retail stores. They are great, but are microfiber and that is not my favorite fabric.  These are terry cloth, and simply marvelous. I am very happy with my order.</li>
            <li> I HAVE SHORT HAIR AND I HATE USING A BIG BATH TOWEL AS THEY WEIGH TO MUCH. THE TURBIE TOWELS ARE&lt;br /&gt;GREAT!!</li>
            <li> Best thing I ever bought for the bathroom.  Perfect size, stay on tight, and saves washing a bunch of big towels -- especially in a family with 3 girls!</li>
            <li> Im so happy so very happy. Wonderful colors. Have the original white turbie twist, and finally treated myself to something i use all the time. Missed it immensely on my cruise and vacation, had forgotten it at home. Now one will stay in my suitcase as a reminder, and will refresh it, just before vacation. Never want to be without it again. My hair is long, and those Hotel/Cruise ship towels, are either TOO big or TOO tiny, to wrap up all my hair in, could not find one anywhere on the cruise for sale or on any of the side trips. HIGHLY Recommend for anyone in the hospital or nursing home, great to wrap up your hair in, so light and absorbent.</li>
            <li> I have bought more than 20 of these for myself, my friends, nieces, my nephews&#x27; girlfriends and sister in laws.  THEY ALL LOVE IT like I do and would never use an ordinary towel ever again.  No need for bulky towels and filling the washing machine with so many towels.  No worries to get back to housework or tending the children because the towel stays on.  The horrible weight of ordinary towels on our heads topples over and unwrap themselves by moving your head or bending over.  My very long hair isn&#x27;t twisted or pulled inside this wrap.  I bought this set for my sister in law and her daughter because they told me IF the Turbie Twist isn&#x27;t available, then they won&#x27;t wash their hair.  I bought them only 1 each years ago and 1 got lost so they&#x27;ve been sharing the remaining one.  LOVE this product and all the various colors and patterns!</li>
            <li> These towels are great.  My hair does not rip out, and the towel stays on my head without falling off.</li>
            <li> Ordered these after having neck surgery.  Needed something for my shoulder length hair that I could use without having to flip my head over and wrap a big, heavy towel around it. These worked perfectly!  I would recommend ordering these as they are all cotton and absorb better than some of the others on the market.  If you have long, thick hair, these may not work for you.</li>
            <li> I gave my daughter one, my grandaughter one and kept one for myself.  My grandaughter is 6 years old with real long hair and she had no problem using the Turbie Twist.  My daughter and I really like the Turbie Twist  We all agree that this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Love these!! They&#x27;re the best hair towel ever!! You won&#x27;t regret buying them.Glad to find them here at a good price.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses them everytime she showers and it seems to dry her hair quickly and does not seem soaked.</li>
            <li> I really like using Turbie Twists on my hair and I liked this set enough to also gift it two times.  The colors are pretty and vibrant and very feminine.  I only use the cotton version of the Turbie - I don&#x27;t like the microfiber ones at all.</li>
            <li> Bought them for myself and three daughters.  We all love the absorbency and ease of this towel.  My hair dries more quickly when ii use these and they stay in place much better than a regular towell  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> turbie twista are the bomb! never leave home without one.  bought these for christmas gifts because i love mine so much.</li>
            <li> We have one of these we bought from a store so we ordered some more.  My daughters love these for drying their hair.  The seller has a great product.</li>
            <li> ok, i like huge bath towels and when i used to use those 1. uncomfortable, constantly falling/yanking my hair 2. would have to wash the towel after 2,3 times.&lt;br /&gt;now my huge bath towels used get pretty wet w/ my long hair, but now it&#x27;s barely damp and last me 4,5 times of use(don&#x27;t judge me) and lounging around w/ wet hair is a lot more pleasant.</li>
            <li> I have used a regular towel all my life to dry my long hair and I never did master the technique to have it remain on my head.  I thought I would go to the Amazon site and do a search for &#x27;hair towel&#x27; and this product came up. I thought I would give it a try and made the purchase. WOW I can not say anything but good to say about the towel. I highly recommend the purchase. It is a quality item to say the least!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these towels to help dry my hair for years.  They hold on to my head with the the elastic loop holding the &amp;#34;tail&amp;#34; in.  They eventually need replacement because the elastic loop in the back that holds the towel on my head eventually stretches out, but not for many years of great use.  Even after the elastic loop stretches out, the towel is still very absorbent.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the cotton Turbie Twists because it adsorbs the moisture from my hair much more effectively than the micro fiber turbie twists.  This is a great product</li>
            <li> I just love these, I have since they come out a few few years ago. They beat using a full size bath towel. I had to try them then. When I seen them on line at Amazon while looking for X-Mass gift&#x27;s, I had to get new ones. My first 3 I had got were almost ready to toss, but they still had life yet. Very, very, absorbent.</li>
            <li> My wife loves these things. She puts it on right after washing her hair and it stays in place till she is ready to take it off.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s just me, but I have a hard time trying to figure out how to wrap this thing on my head so that it stays there</li>
            <li> I love these things! There’s no better way tool for washing hair! 3 is all you really need too so this pack is a good way to go.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd set of Turbie twists.  I love them.  My hair doesn&#x27;t fall out like it did if I wear a regular towel on my head.  I had ordered my first set a couple of years ago from QVC and they are still in GREAT shape.  I just ordered these from Amazon and they came today.  Quick shipping.  Love these and always will!  Just wish they came in more colors and designs!  The ones I ordered from QVC had flowers and polka dots (I believe) on them.</li>
            <li> I would have given them 5 stars but they weren&#x27;t exactly the cheapest but I will say this quality is very good.  I had 1 of my original Turbie Twist left all of the others got stolen over the years by family &amp; friends. As good as the original or better. The colors are really beautiful. My old ones were plain white I really like the color. All in all almost a perfect purchase. Let u know if anything changes after use</li>
            <li> I got a turbie twist for Christmas a few years ago and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;I needed a new one, and also wanted to give one to each of my sister&#x27;s in law, so the 3-pack was ideal. I got to keep one, and give the other 2 as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other hair towels on the market, but I think Turbie Twist is the best...strongly recommend!</li>
            <li> My wife loves these to use right after her shower to keep her hair up.  This is the second set that she has used.</li>
            <li> These are AWESOME! Bought one several years ago and use it every time I wash my hair- decided it was time to get a few more. The colors are bright, the towel is very absorbent and it is so much better than wrapping a big heavy towel on your head that ALWAYS falls off. These stay put and work great! Love them!</li>
            <li> These hair towels do what there suppose to do..But the quality is not that great.. After 1 wash they were falling apart...I do like that I don&#x27;t need an extra towel for my hair and it holds my hair up well. I have very long hair, so they do work well, but the quality is not great. I would not recommend them..</li>
            <li> These were so thick and they washed up horrible! Threw them away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They were such a waste of money and they are just so horribly thick I cannot get over it.</li>
            <li> Thick and absorbant without being bulky.  Great value for the price.  Would definitely buy them again. Great for gifts, too.</li>
            <li> My 9 year old has long hair but can not balance a regular towel on her head like I can...yet she hates for wet hair to touch her clothing.  Several years ago I picked up a Turbie Twist towel locally and it was great for putting her hair up after the bath.  I never could find another one as nice.  Most of what I find now are microfiber which I don&#x27;t like and many have awkward attachments like buttons and elastic loops.  I finally decided to look on Amazon for better hair towels and I ordered these.  Wow!  They are so much nicer than the one I bought years ago.  The material is so much thicker and the colors are vibrant and fun.  They were well worth the money!</li>
            <li> The original Turbie Twist works the best. It&#x27;s thicker, more secure and more absorbent. The 3-pack was a great deal and love the colors.</li>
            <li> I really like these. If you put them on and then take it off shortly they don&#x27;t work. But leave them on for 10-15 minutes and quite a lot of water has been soaked up. These are not the microfiber type. They are thinner towel material. My friend has the microfiber type and she doesn&#x27;t feel like those soak up as well.</li>
            <li> all my nieces loved these and use them all the time.</li>
