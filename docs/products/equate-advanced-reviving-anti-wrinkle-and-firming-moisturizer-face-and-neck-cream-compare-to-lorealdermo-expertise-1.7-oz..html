    <ol>
            <li>Very good hydrating skin cream.</li>
            <li>This is very good cream; seemed to make a difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>Great value for the price.</li>
            <li>It does moisturizes but not all that great on wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I have been on the search for a great face cream.</li>
            <li>When you take a good look at ones self, there is always room for improvement.</li>
            <li>Dr. Oz suggested DMAE cream which and while using the DMAE cream for about 2 months (which I have to say wasn&#x27;t too great as I hadn&#x27;t seen anything grand while using it)  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I have to honestly say it does firm..ran out for a week and noticed the chin /jaw</li>
            <li>My face is smoother and more youthful looking.</li>
            <li>Love the generics - most of the time, not all of the time though.</li>
            <li>so I put more on.</li>
            <li>Most moisturizers make me break out.</li>
            <li>I have tried Garnier firming cream that stuff does work pretty good.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and makeup goes nicely over it......</li>
            <li>Product goes on easily,  and works well on my oily skin.</li>
            <li>Absorbs very quickly allowing for applying makeup over it without wandering the house for 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Strong scent for face cream</li>
            <li>Pleasant light baby powder scent, creamy and soft.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed any significant advantage over my Oil of Olay products.  </li>
            <li>Worth a try!</li>
            <li>I have made the decision to stop buying the expensive creams and stick to this wonderful more affordable cream coz it works.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how nice my skin looks after only 10 days, firmer and smoother.</li>
            <li>Just because it&#x27;s cheaper doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not as good!</li>
            <li>and this have been very gentle to me, does not clog pores and does not make me break out.</li>
            <li>I was an avid user of L&#x27;Oreal</li>
            <li>first I have to say I llike the smell, almost has a baby powder smell to it</li>
            <li>and you can really feel the difference!</li>
            <li>the reviews were all positive so of course then I just had to have this cream,</li>
            <li>With that being said this stuff works really well.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell</li>
            <li>--I really wasn&#x27;t expecting any miracles, but I do think I see some improvement.  </li>
            <li>I have even tried the more expensive ever popular</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried four or five similar creams and was becoming convinced that none would actually work.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised when this one worked almost immediately!</li>
            <li>I am 69 years old and never have time for me.</li>
            <li>I also have really sensitive acne prone skin</li>
            <li>Does not irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It, so far, I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed, hasn&#x27;t made me break out.</li>
            <li>I love the thick texture it has which tells me</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not a thick cream, a little goes far, absorbs quickly...</li>
            <li>A well known expensive brand does not mean a better product!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t see any real improvement on my skin yet, but it hasn&#x27;t been very long.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It seems to do about as good a job as the more expensive alternatives, but the smell is very unpleasant. I will probably not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Very good hydrating skin cream. I recommend this for a day or night face cream. I love the thick texture it has which tells me it is no watered down.</li>
            <li> I used this moisturizer face and neck cream years ago.  I thought maybe  I&#x27;ll try to get it online.  It&#x27;s great.  My face and neck looks different already. I would recommend this product to friends and family. .</li>
            <li> Great value for the price. My face is smoother and more youthful looking. Product goes on easily,  and works well on my oily skin. Will definitely re-order.</li>
            <li> It does moisturizes but not all that great on wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This along with the other, I hope will work together to my advantage. I am 69 years old and never have time for me. So I decided to do something about that. When you take a good look at ones self, there is always room for improvement.I do not want to be beautifull, I just want to be &#x27;I see you&#x27;.Thank you.</li>
            <li> hope I can buy again!</li>
            <li> Been using it for years in the morning on my face.  Absorbs very quickly allowing for applying makeup over it without wandering the house for 20 minutes.  Love the generics - most of the time, not all of the time though.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve turned 40 I have been on the search for a great face cream. I was an avid user of L&#x27;Oreal but it&#x27;s expensive and worked OK. I have tried Garnier firming cream that stuff does work pretty good. I have even tried the more expensive ever popular Dr. Oz suggested DMAE cream which and while using the DMAE cream for about 2 months (which I have to say wasn&#x27;t too great as I hadn&#x27;t seen anything grand while using it)  I happen to notice my near empty jar of the equate cream in the back of my shelf. I thought I would use it for kicks to see if I can compare to the DMAE and whaaaaat! I was in awe of the difference in my skin that evening when I was going to bed. My skin looked firmer, brighter and just healthier. In the morning I could still see a difference so I put more on. Instant firmness in my cheeks and jaw line. I have made the decision to stop buying the expensive creams and stick to this wonderful more affordable cream coz it works. It just works!!</li>
            <li> Been just a week, I bought this cream after reading the reviews on Wal-Mart&#x27;s site, seems they can&#x27;t keep this in stock and the reviews were all positive so of course then I just had to have this cream, and of course I had to run to Amazon and there it was, I ordered two ...first I have to say I llike the smell, almost has a baby powder smell to it, it&#x27;s not a thick cream, a little goes far, absorbs quickly...like I said its just been a week , but I have to say I see a slight improvemt in the neck area, I will come back and update my review in another two weeks</li>
            <li> Strong scent for face cream</li>
            <li> I have almost used the jar and my neck still looks the same.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Wal-mart because I go there at least once a week and it&#x27;s cheaper there. With that being said this stuff works really well. I use it on my neck, frown lines and around my eyes. I really like the smell and I use it in all season (some creams I found too heavy in the warmer months). I also have really sensitive acne prone skin and this have been very gentle to me, does not clog pores and does not make me break out. The only thing is I wish they made it in bigger jars!</li>
            <li> I have to honestly say it does firm..ran out for a week and noticed the chin /jaw area looseness returning. U can even feel that area feeling tighter.  I like this goop</li>
            <li> Pleasant light baby powder scent, creamy and soft.  Does not irritate my sensitive skin.  Does seem to firm a little--I really wasn&#x27;t expecting any miracles, but I do think I see some improvement.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any significant advantage over my Oil of Olay products.  If anything, a little inferior.</li>
            <li> After persevering way too long with a more expensive highly fragrance Shiseido face cream, I finally gave up after bad results and took this $7 walmart cream from my husband&#x27;s shelf.  I cannot believe how nice my skin looks after only 10 days, firmer and smoother. It absorbs quickly and makeup goes nicely over it......A well known expensive brand does not mean a better product!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I use it religiously,too! Just a little goes along way. It tightens and firms your skin and you can really feel the difference! If you haven&#x27;t tried this, please do. Just because it&#x27;s cheaper doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not as good!</li>
            <li> I have only been using for about a week. I haven&#x27;t see any real improvement on my skin yet, but it hasn&#x27;t been very long. There is a bit of a stronger scent, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. It, so far, I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed, hasn&#x27;t made me break out. Most moisturizers make me break out. I does moisturize really well, although it could be a bit heavy for my combination skin.</li>
            <li> Feels nice,only time will tell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried four or five similar creams and was becoming convinced that none would actually work.  I was very pleasantly surprised when this one worked almost immediately!</li>
            <li> This is very good cream; seemed to make a difference. Worth a try!</li>
