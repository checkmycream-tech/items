            <li>Has anyone found a great replacement product for this yet?</li>
            <li>I am so happy to have found this product (got it from my stylist for a lot more than Amazon&#x27;s price)!</li>
            <li>A bit spendy - but a good value</li>
            <li>I recommended this product to a friend and she loved it too.</li>
            <li>Anyone found any good alternatives??</li>
            <li>I WAS DELIGHTED TO BE ABLE TO PURCHASE IT THROUGH AMAZON - GREAT PRICES.</li>

            <li>I have been using the product for many years and  works great.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Good pruduct, came quickly, delivery on time.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>and I just love it.</li>
            <li>I love this style cream .</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>Wanted a more of a &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; look, but this is not for that.</li>
            <li>Over all satisfied with product.</li>
            <li>I love this product but can&#x27;t find it in salons anymore</li>
            <li>I  highly recommend this product for curly hair and probably works great on all textures.</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have found for my curly, dry locks.  </li>
            <li>It is good for separating and taming hair whether  your hair is styled curly or straight.     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li>Wish this product was available all the time.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light, like all Davines products.</li>
            <li>I would compare it to bumble and bumble curl conscious calming creme but a bit stickier with better hold and better frizz control.</li>
            <li>It kind of reminds me of the old Brylcream of my youth, but not so greasy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and light, but for curly hair it&#x27;s not enough.</li>
            <li>I swim twice a week and this help keep my hair soft and easy to take care after shampoo.</li>
            <li>I use a small amount and my hair dries naturally frizz free with great curl.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>For the first time my hair doesn&#x27;t frizz up and does not feel crunchy either.  </li>
            <li>Only thing is the Davines Invisible Paste smells better.</li>
            <li>but they are charging too much so shame on them!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is the real deal, I am suspicious of the authenticity of the prodcut I bought from Amazon.</li>
            <li>If I do not update my post, it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li>except for the fact that my hair will go where I put it, and hold whatever shape I tell it to (straight or curled) for a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>I really want to like this product - and I still use it because I always WANT to like it.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, that wants nothing less than to do what it&#x27;s told, and products tend to make it clump or stick out.</li>
            <li>The smell is not unpleasant (really barely there).  </li>
            <li>It will let you pull your hair into shape without flattening it or weighing it down (helpful if your hair is getting thinner on top).</li>
            <li>I DISCOVERED THIS PRODUCT AT A HIGH END BEAUTY SALON.  </li>
            <li>You only need a little of this to work, so a tube lasts a good long time.</li>
            <li>I have had trouble all my life finding anything that controls my fine hair and does not just wilt over time, and is also not stiff.  </li>
            <li>I really like this style cream because it seems to help keep the frizzy&#x27;s at by while holding my curl until my next wash.  </li>
            <li>This stuff leaves your hair flexible and natural</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll report back if this is not the real deal.</li>
            <li>It is not gressy and does leave hair looking natural.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>Especially as I get older, my hair would get that \\&quot;raggedy\\&quot; flyaway appearance.</li>
            <li>If you use too much, your hair will feel slightly crunchy, but not too much.  </li>
            <li>It definitely makes older hair look younger.</li>
            <li>-- you can barely tell it&#x27;s there.  </li>
            <li>and this is the only product that leaves my curls soft and not frizzy.</li>
            <li>Especially if you do not wash hair everyday (a big destroyer of hair -- better to go as long as possible between shampoos)    </li>
            <li>It really smooths my hair out without taking away from the curl or weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>It just feels like I&#x27;ve got so much product in my hair when I use this - no matter how little I use.</li>
            <li>live in a very wet climate (Seattle) and I need this.</li>

            <li> it won&#x27;t weigh the hair down, but the shape and the hold are still there at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> I used this product, The Davines Defining Invisible Style Cream as a styler AFTER I have dried my hair.</li>

            <li> It does give my hair a ton of volume, but I HATE the texture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a mixture of glue and dirt at the base and straw like at the ends.</li>

            <li> I have thick wavy hair that gets a bit frizzy in humidity.  I really like this style cream because it seems to help keep the frizzy&#x27;s at by while holding my curl until my next wash.  A bit spendy - but a good value</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is the real deal, I am suspicious of the authenticity of the prodcut I bought from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I had always straightened my hair before finding this.  My stylist suggested I use it if I wanted to stop straightening.  Now I use this in my hair after showering, twirl my hair with my fingers, and diffuse dry.  For the first time my hair doesn&#x27;t frizz up and does not feel crunchy either.  This tube lasted over a year.  If you use too much, your hair will feel slightly crunchy, but not too much.  I would compare it to bumble and bumble curl conscious calming creme but a bit stickier with better hold and better frizz control.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I have had trouble all my life finding anything that controls my fine hair and does not just wilt over time, and is also not stiff.  I like Stucco, but it stiffens my hair.  This stuff leaves your hair flexible and natural -- you can barely tell it&#x27;s there.  It&#x27;s so light it won&#x27;t weigh the hair down, but the shape and the hold are still there at the end of the day.  I am so happy to have found this product (got it from my stylist for a lot more than Amazon&#x27;s price)!</li>
            <li> Works great for blowing curls out or keeping the curls.  Only thing is the Davines Invisible Paste smells better.</li>
            <li> I have always had problems with my curly hair frizzing. Especially as I get older, my hair would get that \\&quot;raggedy\\&quot; flyaway appearance. I was introduced by my long time hair stylist to this product and I just love it. It&#x27;s the perfect combination of anti-friz without stiffening your hair. It definitely makes older hair look younger. It will let you pull your hair into shape without flattening it or weighing it down (helpful if your hair is getting thinner on top). It kind of reminds me of the old Brylcream of my youth, but not so greasy.  You only need a little of this to work, so a tube lasts a good long time. Nothing bad to say.

            <li> Started using this after a visit to Vidal Sassoon salon months ago. It works great. I swim twice a week and this help keep my hair soft and easy to take care after shampoo. I recommended this product to a friend and she loved it too.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found for my curly, dry locks.  It really smooths my hair out without taking away from the curl or weighing it down.  Wish it was less expensive, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and light, but for curly hair it&#x27;s not enough. The smell is not unpleasant (really barely there).  But if you&#x27;ve got short curly hair, you should try the Defining Invisible Paste instead.  It&#x27;s a smaller container, but you&#x27;ll use less product each time.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time as promised. Great product leaves my hair healthy and Shiny looking. Wish this product was available all the time.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have a lot of very long and curly hair. I use a small amount and my hair dries naturally frizz free with great curl.&lt;br /&gt;I live in a very wet climate (Seattle) and I need this. I  highly recommend this product for curly hair and probably works great on all textures.</li>
            <li> I love this style cream . I have been using the product for many years and  works great.Only I think this it  is very expensive  and  price went up twice since I started to use the product. Initially I pay 20 $ now 40 $</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.  Sad though because my hair stylist told me they aren&#x27;t making it any longer.  I went searching for it and there&#x27;s only one person still selling it via Amazon but they are charging too much so shame on them!</li>
            <li> Tured on to Davines products by my hairdresser. Have been using these oroducts for over two years now. Very happy with them.     I used this product, The Davines Defining Invisible Style Cream as a styler AFTER I have dried my hair. I run some through my styled shoulder length hair (about the size of two quarters). It is good for separating and taming hair whether  your hair is styled curly or straight.     The fragrance is light, like all Davines products. You only need to use a little, so the tube will last you forever. Especially if you do not wash hair everyday (a big destroyer of hair -- better to go as long as possible between shampoos)    I know the product says that you can use on wet hair, but I use the Davines Momo Anti-Frizz  on wet. Only because that is how my stylist told me to manage my hair.    Here is link to Davines Momo Anti-Frizz, another great Davines product:     [[ASIN:B00161928S DAVINES by Davines MOMO ANTI FRIZZ FLUID 5 OZ]]</li>
            <li> Has anyone found a great replacement product for this yet? The best alternative Davines recommended was This is A Medium Hold Pliable Paste, but it is not really a styling cream. Anyone found any good alternatives??</li>
            <li> I DISCOVERED THIS PRODUCT AT A HIGH END BEAUTY SALON.  I WAS DELIGHTED TO BE ABLE TO PURCHASE IT THROUGH AMAZON - GREAT PRICES.</li>
            <li> Good pruduct, came quickly, delivery on time.  It is not gressy and does leave hair looking natural.  Wanted a more of a &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; look, but this is not for that. Over all satisfied with product.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, that wants nothing less than to do what it&#x27;s told, and products tend to make it clump or stick out. Comb a little of this through my wet hair before blowdrying it, though, and you can&#x27;t tell there&#x27;s anything there... except for the fact that my hair will go where I put it, and hold whatever shape I tell it to (straight or curled) for a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> I really want to like this product - and I still use it because I always WANT to like it. It does give my hair a ton of volume, but I HATE the texture. It just feels like I&#x27;ve got so much product in my hair when I use this - no matter how little I use. It&#x27;s like a mixture of glue and dirt at the base and straw like at the ends. I just can&#x27;t get into it.</li>
            <li> I love this product but can&#x27;t find it in salons anymore so I tried Amazon. Thank you Amazon for finding it for me. I have naturally curly hair and this is the only product that leaves my curls soft and not frizzy. It doesn&#x27;t way my hair down like other products do. I have spent so much money (on expensive products too) trying to find something like this styling cream but nothing compared.</li>
            <li> Can be use when hair is wet or dry . . . adds lustre  and really only a LITTLE DUB will do ya &amp; my hair is shoulder length!!gj</li>
