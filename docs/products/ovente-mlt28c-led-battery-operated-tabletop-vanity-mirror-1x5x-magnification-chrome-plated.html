            <li>it was worth it.</li>

            <li> but, &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; is much softer than mirrors have had in the past... may as well not be lighted.</li>
            <li> The light is useless.</li>
            <li> it so low that only works if you are in a dark room.</li>
            <li> The light is not bright enough and it is very small.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Shipping does take a little while before receiving it.</li>
            <li> Wish it was a little brighter.</li>
            <li> Actually very flimsy and weak you have to be very delicate with it.</li>
            <li> Much smaller and cheaper looking than expected and the lighting is useless.  </li>
            <li> It came with one foot pad missing</li>
            <li> Not really a light up</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how it would hold up to falls (which I hope I won&#x27;t find out by accidentally tipping it over).</li>
            <li> The mirror itself is small that was not the issue.</li>
            <li> The only disappointment was that the shell of the mirror is made out of plastic.</li>
            <li> a mirror that wobbles is not good for me or anyone.</li>
            <li> Not happy...</li>
            <li> Poor lighting.  </li>
            <li> Poor magnification.  </li>

            <li> Worse purchase EVER!!!</li>
            <li> The product is crap.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.</li>

            <li> Looks good... mirrors are clear... no distortion... but, &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; is much softer than mirrors have had in the past... may as well not be lighted.</li>
            <li> It came with one foot pad missing so it wobbles..a mirror that wobbles is not good for me or anyone. I was hoping for an exchange but was given return as only option. Not happy...</li>
            <li> I want to return it. The light is not bright enough and it is very small.</li>
            <li> I thought this had a metal frame but it&#x27;s all plastic (excluding the mirror itself). It has a plug for a DC adaptor (not included) or a battery compartment that uses 3 AA batteries. It&#x27;s okay for what I got it for (a college course). It&#x27;s light weight so I&#x27;m not sure how it would hold up to falls (which I hope I won&#x27;t find out by accidentally tipping it over). If your on a budget this is an okay mirror. The light illuminates a soft light around the mirror so it&#x27;s easy on the eyes and it lights up evenly.</li>
            <li> Much smaller and cheaper looking than expected and the lighting is useless.  This would be OK as a travel mirror but not much more.</li>
            <li> Light is not very bright but great mirror</li>
            <li> Grand Daughter  will love these when she opens it xmas morning.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.  It&#x27;s more light, but not a lot.  Don&#x27;t use it to get ready for a job interview or other important appointment.</li>
            <li> Light isn&#x27;t as bright as I thought it would be, but it&#x27;s something. For its price I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Really like this, just wish the lights were brighter. But, it works great.</li>
            <li> The light sucks on this mirror.</li>
            <li> Light isn&#x27;t very bright, not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Actually very flimsy and weak you have to be very delicate with it. It does not come with the ac adaptor or 3 AA batteries. Overall I think it&#x27;s an alright purchase if you want a cheaper lighted mirror.</li>
            <li> Light isn&#x27;t that bright.</li>
            <li> Not really a light up mirror-  not bright enough for purpose, but other wise it is okay.</li>
            <li> The light is useless. No illumination. Should have just bought a mirror.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because i felt that a magnific mirror would be good to just have. Its an ok product for its purpose, the only thing that concerns me is that the whole base(frame) is made out of plastic so it could break easily. But the cost was cheap so i&#x27;m not that disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is very cheap low power barely any light tiny mirror. Lol</li>
            <li> This mirror is fine for me. I use it daily to put on makeup or plucking eyebrows, and like the two different magnification settings depending on what I&#x27;m needing to do. The LED light is okay. It adds some light to my face, enough to help, but you still may want to double check your makeup in the bathroom. It doesn&#x27;t seem to eat through batteries, I&#x27;m still on my first set. I like that I don&#x27;t have to hassle with a cord and plug.</li>
            <li> Poor lighting.  Poor magnification.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> not the heaviest built mirror, but decent for the price.</li>
            <li> Very cheap plastic mirror.  Actually bought it to take to UK so I had a mirror to apply makeup.  Worked well as long as I had enough light.  The light on the mirror is LED, so not natural and not very bright.  Left at my relatives in UK.</li>
            <li> The product is crap. Do not waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> The light never gets that bright and stays pretty dim.</li>
            <li> The mirror itself is small that was not the issue. The light on it is a dim blue that if anything makes it worse to put on makeup that help. I was very disappointed with this product. I have to use a lamp next to it just to see. It is also very cheaply made plastic</li>
            <li> If you move the mirror up and down the light turned off, also the light (if yo can called that) it so low that only works if you are in a dark room. Worse purchase EVER!!!</li>
            <li> Cheap, lightweight, tiny&lt;br /&gt;More like a toy mirror</li>
            <li> It looks good. The mirror is light weight. That is what I wanted since I do a lot of trade shows, but the light is not bright at all I can not see difference when the light is on or if you are in a dark room.</li>
            <li> I love it, it was a lot smaller than what I expected but with the price I paid it was worth it. The only disappointment was that the shell of the mirror is made out of plastic. Shipping does take a little while before receiving it.</li>
            <li> Nice lighted mirror with magnified mirror on one side. Great for your make up table close up work.</li>
            <li> Great buy....I bought it for my daughter.</li>
            <li> It works for the ok just not as bright as I had expected.</li>
            <li> Nice mirror for price. Wish it was a little brighter.</li>
            <li> It didnt meet my expectations. It doesnt give off enough bright light to to see in the mirror.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not as bright as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected. A simple mirror to do my make up wherever I want while sitting. Some mornings I just don&#x27;t want to stand in the bathroom mirror to get ready. I can stay bundled in my blanket sit on the couch pull up a table and do my makeup lol. The light is very bright but works to see clearly and helps with shadows.</li>
            <li> Everything was great!</li>
