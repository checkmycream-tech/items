            <li>The three pack is great deal, too.</li>

            <li>great replacement for muro.  </li>
            <li>He is happy with this product and plus we get three instead of the 2 of the Muro that we used to get for the price.</li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>Great price and seems to work as well as Muro 128.</li>
            <li>Great product and even greater price!</li>
            <li>I found this product instead and find it is a good as the Muro 128.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps it will be good for someone else.</li>
            <li>good price on a good item,,, would buy here again</li>
            <li>Good product, good value for the money.</li>
            <li>Good deal.</li>
            <li>Does just as good a job as the Muro for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than Muro 128 ointment and works just as good.  </li>
            <li>Price is good and it does what it should.  </li>
            <li>Great buy and comparable to name brands the cost so much more.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>great product, quick delivery, great price</li>
            <li>This is probably the best synthetic version I&#x27;ve found, but I still don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s as good as the real thing.  </li>
            <li>I plan on ordering more soon!</li>
            <li>Plus more for your money!</li>
            <li>This is a great deal, and the 3 pack is cheap and convenient.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>I only buy this product, it is the best and works great for overnight eye care</li>
            <li>For me it works very well, and I am very happy that I made the change.</li>
            <li>Found this brand just as effective as Bausch &amp; Lomb for me.</li>
            <li>It got to me quick and works great .  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery and at a very good price.</li>
            <li>Way more cost effective then the name brand.</li>
            <li>I need to warm it in my hand before using it for better application.</li>
            <li>Good cheap alternative.</li>
            <li>Like all ointments, it takes some practice to be able to squeeze a nice line of ointment into the pocket of your lower eyelid.  </li>
            <li>The price of the medicine is fair, and it ships quickly.  </li>
            <li>I will buy more.</li>
            <li>Have bought it many times and will continue to do so.  </li>
            <li>It works about as well as Muro128 at better price.</li>
            <li>Has been excellent replacement for prior brand.</li>
            <li>Great love it so much cheaper than muro</li>
            <li>Love this product and the price.</li>
            <li>and I love the price</li>
            <li>Thanks for  great product.</li>
            <li>I am grateful to be able to take care of my eyes and save money too.  </li>
            <li>much  better price.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the purchase.  </li>
            <li>I am totally satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>and I have not found a better price anywhere else.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get the more costly name brand anymore and substituted this.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect to be able to read a book, or even an alarm clock, after applying it</li>
            <li>Same as name brand work the same and best price very happy</li>
            <li>opt for the B&amp;L as it is reliable and safe.</li>
            <li>Works great and a lot more cost effective especially if you use every night.</li>
            <li>This product provides excellent dry eye relief at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>Other than that everything about the transaction was excellent.</li>
            <li>I like it 100% more than muro all around great product please continue selling this product as i will be purchasing it regularly</li>
            <li>I can easily recommend it.</li>
            <li>As good as the high $ brand.</li>
            <li>It seems to be working just fine.</li>
            <li>product works fine.  </li>
            <li>This product has replaced Refresh Advanced PM Gel for me.</li>
            <li>While not the most convenient product to use, it is worth the difficulty.</li>
            <li>It seems to squeeze out of my eyes faster than the original product does, and doesn&#x27;t seem to be as effective at reducing cornial in-fillment.&lt;br /&gt;These are mostly subjective measures, but I&#x27;ve been using the original B&amp;L product for fifteen plus years, and definitely find a difference</li>
            <li>I plan to continue using this more reasonably priced brand.</li>
            <li>Not as good as Muro 128, ingredients seem to be the same</li>
            <li>did nor receive the full order  which has since been compensated for&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Had problems one time with the quality from a different supplier but has been good from here.</li>
            <li>very good,reduce the cost will be better.</li>
            <li>I use this regularly due to an ongoing cornea problem and it works great.</li>
            <li>I received my order quickly and the expiration date is 2 years out.  </li>
            <li>A super value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Could tell a difference with the very first use.</li>
            <li>Have been using this product for several months now and it is just as good as the higher priced product.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t come out of the tube, I felt like my eyes stuck to my lids more frequently than they did with the store</li>
            <li>This has helped clear up my dog&#x27;s eyes and price on Amazon definitely much much better than in the stores.</li>
            <li>This is every bit as effective (basically the same thing) at a much lower cost.</li>
            <li>I was very disapointed that I couldn&#x27;t find anything cheaper at the store, and I was so lucky I found this on Amazon--a set of 3 tubes for $27.</li>
            <li>Delivery was very fast and efficient.</li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>Very much like Mura, but much cheaper!</li>
            <li>A much better buy and equal quality.</li>
            <li>LOVE the generic version of Muro ointment.</li>
            <li>In this case, cheaper is (much) better than the Bausch &amp; Lomb product that I have been using for that last year.</li>
            <li>I try heating it up a bit (by securing to my bedside light, near the bulb, for about 20 minutes)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back when I need more.</li>
            <li>-- things look pretty blurry for a while.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion better than the big name brand.</li>
            <li>This works every bit as good as the Bosch &amp; Lomb version that is MUCH more expensive.  </li>
            <li>Akorn&#x27;s product is every bit as good as the more expensive version; we use it for our aging dog&#x27;s eye condition and it&#x27;s withstood the test of time.</li>
            <li>This is the generic ointment of Muro 128 at a much more reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>And because of easier application, I can better lubricate the eye which results in fewer dry eye incidents in the morning.</li>
            <li>It works fine and no gritty feeling.  </li>
            <li>The regular PM OINTMENTS are OK, but the MURO 128 or the generic equivalent such as this is the magic wand for both me and my father.  </li>
            <li>It works very well and is affordable.</li>
            <li>For me, this works just as well as the name brand which costs twice as much.  </li>
            <li>The price is sooooo much cheaper than getting it anywhere else.</li>
            <li>Thank You so much .  </li>
            <li>It seems to be working very well.</li>
            <li>shipping was very prompt.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Had been using another product and was paying twice as much.</li>
            <li>It is very runny and caused eye irritation both times i used it.</li>
            <li>It is so much cheaper.</li>
            <li>As listed..  Fast S&amp;H.</li>
            <li>Having used the product only 2 days, so far I am pleased, it is taking the redness out of the sclera.</li>
            <li>Item came quickly and the boxes were not crushed.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a more affordable option for Muro 128 or other Sodium Chloride 5% Ophthalmic ointment.</li>
            <li>Good value, but the texture&#x27;s a little lumpy compared to Bausch &amp; Lomb or generic store brands.</li>
            <li>That being said, the few nights I&#x27;ve been able to get good overall coverage on my eyes, it does seem to help very much -- in terms of reducing my morning dry eyes and in (theoretically) helping with the cornea damage/swelling.  </li>
            <li>Product came quickly and works the same as Muro 128</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The product itself is comparable to Muro 128 without the high cost.</li>
            <li>As always, consult an eye doctor to make sure that you do not have a more serious condition - but if you have dry eye issues this stuff is &#x27;the bomb&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>product is exactly what i ordered;  service was terrific and pricing comparable.  </li>
            <li>It is very slightly burny at first, which passes quickly.  </li>
            <li>It stays very viscous and does not dry out or make your lids stick to your eyeball.  </li>
            <li>I have had only positive results from this brand and supplier.</li>
            <li>perfect and less expensive substitute for muro 128</li>
            <li>Had been getting it in 2-pack boxes but for some reason that wasn&#x27;t available so had to get multiple single boxes.</li>
            <li>It is excellent and far less expensive than Muro&#x27;s brand.  </li>
            <li>AND SO FAR IT HAS STAYED OUT.</li>
            <li>working well so far</li>
            <li>first time I bought this, I got the single tube to see how well it worked.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I expected when I ordered it</li>
            <li>After much messing around with the dry eye &amp;#34;feels</li>
            <li>Buying them in a pack of three is much cheaper than buying one of the same brand at my local pharmacy.</li>
            <li>If that is really the case, then it is not unreasonable to suspect that this generic substitute was also subjected to the same adverse freezing conditions.</li>
            <li>I expected this product to arrive much sooner.  </li>
            <li>Must reapply a few times (up to four with eye problems) but worth it.</li>
            <li>Having suffered for years with dry eye, I highly depend on a 5% ophthalmic ointment to avoid awakening to corneal damage and severe pain.  </li>
            <li>This product says it has exactly the same ingredient as Muro 128 in the same 5% concentration, but somehow it doesn&#x27;t seem to protect dry eyes quite as well.  </li>
            <li>but I notice that it smarts a little when I first apply it, unlike the Muro brand.  </li>
            <li>Just as good as Muro 128 but a lot less expensive</li>
    </ol>

            <li> LOVE the generic version of Muro ointment.</li>
            <li> In this case, cheaper is (much) better than the Bausch &amp; Lomb product that I have been using for that last year.</li>
            <li> I try heating it up a bit (by securing to my bedside light, near the bulb, for about 20 minutes)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be back when I need more.</li>
            <li> -- things look pretty blurry for a while.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion better than the big name brand.</li>
            <li> This works every bit as good as the Bosch &amp; Lomb version that is MUCH more expensive.  </li>
            <li> Akorn&#x27;s product is every bit as good as the more expensive version; we use it for our aging dog&#x27;s eye condition and it&#x27;s withstood the test of time.</li>
            <li> This is the generic ointment of Muro 128 at a much more reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> And because of easier application, I can better lubricate the eye which results in fewer dry eye incidents in the morning.</li>
            <li> It works fine and no gritty feeling.  </li>
            <li> The regular PM OINTMENTS are OK, but the MURO 128 or the generic equivalent such as this is the magic wand for both me and my father.  </li>
            <li> It works very well and is affordable.</li>
            <li> For me, this works just as well as the name brand which costs twice as much.  </li>
            <li> The price is sooooo much cheaper than getting it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Thank You so much .  </li>
            <li> It seems to be working very well.</li>
            <li> shipping was very prompt.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Had been using another product and was paying twice as much.</li>
            <li> It is very runny and caused eye irritation both times i used it.</li>
            <li> It is so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> As listed..  Fast S&amp;H.</li>
            <li> Having used the product only 2 days, so far I am pleased, it is taking the redness out of the sclera.</li>
            <li> Item came quickly and the boxes were not crushed.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a more affordable option for Muro 128 or other Sodium Chloride 5% Ophthalmic ointment.</li>
            <li> Good value, but the texture&#x27;s a little lumpy compared to Bausch &amp; Lomb or generic store brands.</li>
            <li> That being said, the few nights I&#x27;ve been able to get good overall coverage on my eyes, it does seem to help very much -- in terms of reducing my morning dry eyes and in (theoretically) helping with the cornea damage/swelling.  </li>
            <li> Product came quickly and works the same as Muro 128</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The product itself is comparable to Muro 128 without the high cost.</li>
            <li> As always, consult an eye doctor to make sure that you do not have a more serious condition - but if you have dry eye issues this stuff is &#x27;the bomb&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> product is exactly what i ordered;  service was terrific and pricing comparable.  </li>
            <li> It is very slightly burny at first, which passes quickly.  </li>
            <li> It stays very viscous and does not dry out or make your lids stick to your eyeball.  </li>
            <li> I have had only positive results from this brand and supplier.</li>
            <li> perfect and less expensive substitute for muro 128</li>
            <li> Had been getting it in 2-pack boxes but for some reason that wasn&#x27;t available so had to get multiple single boxes.</li>
            <li> It is excellent and far less expensive than Muro&#x27;s brand.  </li>
            <li> AND SO FAR IT HAS STAYED OUT.</li>
            <li> working well so far</li>
            <li> first time I bought this, I got the single tube to see how well it worked.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I expected when I ordered it</li>
            <li> After much messing around with the dry eye &amp;#34;feels</li>
            <li> Buying them in a pack of three is much cheaper than buying one of the same brand at my local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> If that is really the case, then it is not unreasonable to suspect that this generic substitute was also subjected to the same adverse freezing conditions.</li>
            <li> I expected this product to arrive much sooner.  </li>
            <li> Must reapply a few times (up to four with eye problems) but worth it.</li>
            <li> Having suffered for years with dry eye, I highly depend on a 5% ophthalmic ointment to avoid awakening to corneal damage and severe pain.  </li>
            <li> This product says it has exactly the same ingredient as Muro 128 in the same 5% concentration, but somehow it doesn&#x27;t seem to protect dry eyes quite as well.  </li>
            <li> but I notice that it smarts a little when I first apply it, unlike the Muro brand.  </li>
            <li> Just as good as Muro 128 but a lot less expensive</li>
            <li> Effective and much less expensive than Murray.</li>
            <li> This product has performed equally as well as the Muro-128, and the price is far less than the brand-name Muro product.</li>
            <li> only product that I trust to use for my dry eyes</li>
            <li> This totally elminated that dry eye issue of the eyelid sticking to the cornea</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several weeks, and I have yet to notice any difference between this value priced item, and the Muro product I had been using for years to relieve my dry eyes during the night.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few nights so far</li>
            <li> I use this stuff faithfully every single night and have had only one minor wake up instance in 4 months of feeling like something was in my eye.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the brand-name Muro-128 product for years, Due to the recent recall, I decided to try the generic version.</li>
            <li> I would have given this product 5 stars if the product did take so long to arrive.</li>
            <li> I used to use Bausch &amp; Lomb&#x27;s Muro 128, but could not order it due to a recent recall by Bausch &amp; Lomb.  </li>
            <li> Helps with my dry eye issue.</li>
            <li> I use this for cleaning the eyes of my Maltese who has dry eye syndrome.  </li>
            <li> So can&#x27;t yet say if long-term use will help with my dry eye and corneal edema/erosion issues.  </li>
            <li> I use this ointment at bedtime, to counter my dry eye problem.</li>
            <li> I can tell you this: the stuff is so thick and gloppy that it&#x27;s challenging to apply it in a thin line along the inside of my lower lid.  </li>
            <li> Hey, it works as well if not better and costs a whole lot less.</li>
            <li> BTW, for my dry eye, I also microwave wet wash cloth, then apply to eyes as long as I can stand it.  </li>
            <li> Pleased to find this medication at the price I paid on Amazon, as it is a very expensive &amp;#34;Salt Solution&amp;#34;  that I must have in order to control a ophthalmic condition that my Labrador Retriever has.</li>
            <li> I have a scratched cornea that will never heal correctly due to dry eye.  </li>
            <li> Lately, when I use this non-B&amp;L brand I have noticed the same adverse reactions as those reported for B&amp;L&#x27;s Muro 128: excessive tears for no other reason, burning and gritty feeling in my eye (like when sand at the beach gets in your eye).</li>
            <li> After reading a number of the reviews and carefully checking the ingredients, I decided to try this ointment.  </li>
            <li> Really no difference between the two, I have RCE Recurring Corneal Erosions and have had laser treatments in both eyes</li>
            <li> I checked this out a few years back</li>
            <li> Works just as expected</li>
            <li> The store brand Muro 128 at the pharmacy is $20 for a .12oz, and I go through roughly a tube a month or so.</li>
            <li> The muro 128 feels a little stronger in the eye and this one actually feels a little easier on the eye.</li>
            <li> That stuff wasn&#x27;t opaque or thick enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> Less pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> about 1/3 less the cost.</li>
            <li> Because I waste less, it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> This applicator is a small metal tube, which I find easier to use than the plastic tubes of some other brands.</li>
            <li> very hard to get ointment in eye, going to try the drops next time.</li>
            <li> I have very bad Keratoconus, and use Muro 128 ointment mostly at night.  </li>
            <li> Had to switch from plain lubricating ointment to this...</li>
            <li> Plus, having 3 tubes at once means shopping less frequently and not worrying about running out in an inconvenient time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The ointment is thick for about 30 seconds or less then dissolves into moisture.  </li>
            <li> I hope this doesn&#x27;t mean problems down the road</li>
            <li> I use this ointment in my eyes at least twice a day.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 star if it wouldn&#x27;t be so thick.</li>
            <li> MUCH less expensive than Muro1</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick, so it lasts for hours.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly less expensive, though!</li>
            <li> but now it seems Muro the branded one is expensive and hard to find.</li>
            <li> But this stuff is just thick and viscous and inherently difficult to get onto your eyes and spread out evenly across them.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it burned my eyes, so I could not use it</li>
            <li> Used Muru 128 for 8 years and it was so expensive</li>
            <li> Scratchy,, irritation to the eyes, which is very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It keeps him from developing painful ulcers.  </li>
            <li> I hated it.</li>
            <li> I have had corneal abrasions since 1990 and have been buying Muro Ointment at outrageous prices.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The only difference is the price.I will buy more.</li>
            <li> Great substitute for Muro 128.</li>
            <li> I used to use Bausch &amp; Lomb&#x27;s Muro 128, but could not order it due to a recent recall by Bausch &amp; Lomb.  I found this product instead and find it is a good as the Muro 128. The Muro 128 twinpack (2 tubes) on Amazon is $36.89.  One tube at Walgreens is $24.99.  This product is $26.25 for 3 tubes.  A much better buy and equal quality.</li>
            <li> I use this ointment in my eyes at least twice a day. I find this brand to work just as well as the much more expensive Bausch and Lomb brand - same size tube - same ingredients. I plan to continue using this more reasonably priced brand.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time at met my expectations</li>
            <li> This is great ointment for eye injuries requiring saline ointment or for wetting your eyes and not wanting the film of the cheaper vaseline based ointments that we use during the night.  The ointment is thick for about 30 seconds or less then dissolves into moisture.  Must reapply a few times (up to four with eye problems) but worth it. Have bought it many times and will continue to do so.  The three pack is great deal, too. Thankful.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Muro 128, ingredients seem to be the same so I can&#x27;t imagine why it doesn&#x27;t seem to do the same job.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be comparable to Muro 128 Ointment.  I am please with it.</li>
            <li> very hard to get ointment in eye, going to try the drops next time.</li>
            <li> Very much like Mura, but much cheaper! I will be buying this regularly!</li>
            <li> I have to use this ointment for my dog&#x27;s eyes and got the very best price at Amazon in this 3-pack.  And to think I formerly used Muro and paid a fortune.</li>
            <li> Same product as Bausch and Lomb&#x27;s Muro 128 at a fraction of the price</li>
            <li> I have a scratched cornea that will never heal correctly due to dry eye.  Muro 128 releived my fear of reopening the scratch while I am sleeping.</li>
            <li> I use the product every night for a chronic eye condition.  It is excellent and far less expensive than Muro&#x27;s brand.  Delivery was very fast and efficient.</li>
            <li> Always buy the 3 pack for the value.  It works about as well as Muro128 at better price.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, fast delivery.  Equal to Brand name product.  Less pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying both ointment and drops every 3 months.</li>
            <li> LOVE the generic version of Muro ointment. Prefer buying it over Bausch and Lomb. Way more cost effective then the name brand.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Helps with my dry eye issue.</li>
            <li> This works every bit as good as the Bosch &amp; Lomb version that is MUCH more expensive.  Buying them in a pack of three is much cheaper than buying one of the same brand at my local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> only product that I trust to use for my dry eyes</li>
            <li> Product is as marketed.</li>
            <li> Move to a cheaper brand? For my eyes? The only set I have? I noodled this decision for some time before diving into the deep end.  In this case, cheaper is (much) better than the Bausch &amp; Lomb product that I have been using for that last year. This product is almost 1/3 the price. The ointment comes out in thinner stream making application easier. Because I waste less, it lasts longer. And because of easier application, I can better lubricate the eye which results in fewer dry eye incidents in the morning. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Has been excellent replacement for prior brand.</li>
            <li> Great product and even greater price!</li>
            <li> Akorn&#x27;s product is every bit as good as the more expensive version; we use it for our aging dog&#x27;s eye condition and it&#x27;s withstood the test of time.</li>
            <li> same ointment from vet</li>
            <li> I only buy this product, it is the best and works great for overnight eye care</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this ointment for years to quell the dryness in my eyes at night.  It stays very viscous and does not dry out or make your lids stick to your eyeball.  This is the generic ointment of Muro 128 at a much more reasonable price.  I have had only positive results from this brand and supplier.</li>
            <li> This product has replaced Refresh Advanced PM Gel for me. That stuff wasn&#x27;t opaque or thick enough to do the job. This Sodium chloride product is now a necessary medication for me overnight so I dont&#x27; get corneal abrasions.</li>
            <li> We paid about $25 for one tube of Muro 128. This is every bit as effective (basically the same thing) at a much lower cost. We&#x27;ve ordered it before and will do so again when needed.</li>
            <li> After much messing around with the dry eye &amp;#34;feels like there is a boulder in my eye&amp;#34; upon waking up problem...  THIS IS MY ANSWER.  The regular PM OINTMENTS are OK, but the MURO 128 or the generic equivalent such as this is the magic wand for both me and my father.  I use this stuff faithfully every single night and have had only one minor wake up instance in 4 months of feeling like something was in my eye.  This totally elminated that dry eye issue of the eyelid sticking to the cornea overnight sort of problem.  As always, consult an eye doctor to make sure that you do not have a more serious condition - but if you have dry eye issues this stuff is &#x27;the bomb&#x27;.  LOL.</li>
            <li> I use this ointment in one of my dog&#x27;s eyes, as recommended by his eye doctor.  It works very well and is affordable.</li>
            <li> Same product as in stores and can get three for the same price as one...</li>
            <li> Great deal. Thank you..</li>
            <li> Good value, but the texture&#x27;s a little lumpy compared to Bausch &amp; Lomb or generic store brands. It does the job at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I use this regularly due to an ongoing cornea problem and it works great. Had been getting it in 2-pack boxes but for some reason that wasn&#x27;t available so had to get multiple single boxes. Other than that everything about the transaction was excellent.</li>
            <li> I like it 100% more than muro all around great product please continue selling this product as i will be purchasing it regularly</li>
            <li> RECOMMENDED BY MY EYE DOCTOR. HAD A WRINKLE ON THE COLORED PART OF EYE AND IT HAS HELPED TO GET IT OUT AND SO FAR IT HAS STAYED OUT.</li>
            <li> Had to switch from plain lubricating ointment to this...price is very good, product is great.  &#x27;Nuff said.</li>
            <li> For me, this works just as well as the name brand which costs twice as much.  I can easily recommend it.</li>
            <li> Same as Muro 128 - haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly, as described. Excellent price.</li>
            <li> The ointment is what I wanted and I need regularly&lt;br /&gt;I did nor receive the full order  which has since been compensated for&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the carriage exhorbitant.  Equal to that of the goods</li>
            <li> We use it for our shih tzu dog who is loosing her sight. I would give it 5 star if it wouldn&#x27;t be so thick. I need to warm it in my hand before using it for better application.</li>
            <li> This product says it has exactly the same ingredient as Muro 128 in the same 5% concentration, but somehow it doesn&#x27;t seem to protect dry eyes quite as well.  It&#x27;s certainly less expensive, though!</li>
            <li> great product, quick delivery, great price</li>
            <li> I do not care for it, but my doctor told me to use it.</li>
            <li> I use this ointment for my dog who has corneal disease.  It keeps him from developing painful ulcers.  The price of the medicine is fair, and it ships quickly.  I will continue to purchase from this vendor.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several weeks, and I have yet to notice any difference between this value priced item, and the Muro product I had been using for years to relieve my dry eyes during the night.  After reading a number of the reviews and carefully checking the ingredients, I decided to try this ointment.  For me it works very well, and I am very happy that I made the change. Having suffered for years with dry eye, I highly depend on a 5% ophthalmic ointment to avoid awakening to corneal damage and severe pain.  This product provides excellent dry eye relief at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it burned my eyes, so I could not use it and I have returned it.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it will be good for someone else.</li>
            <li> product is exactly what i ordered;  service was terrific and pricing comparable.  thank you very much</li>
            <li> Really no difference between the two, I have RCE Recurring Corneal Erosions and have had laser treatments in both eyes, problem is I do not produce enough tears (NONE) and must use this or Muro nightly or I still get erosions and have found this to be 1/3 the cost of Muro.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and at a very good price. I bought this for my father, will update the review after a month or so after he will use it.</li>
            <li> Pleased to find this medication at the price I paid on Amazon, as it is a very expensive &amp;#34;Salt Solution&amp;#34;  that I must have in order to control a ophthalmic condition that my Labrador Retriever has.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my doctor for my eye issues. Works excellently! Could tell a difference with the very first use. The price is sooooo much cheaper than getting it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> It got to me quick and works great .  I plan on ordering more soon!</li>
            <li> I checked this out a few years back and it didn&#x27;t work for me.  Burned my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;New formula appears to be w/out preservatives and now works great.&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s not to like?  MUCH less expensive than Muro1</li>
            <li> It is the same as Muro 128 at a fraction of the cost. Had problems one time with the quality from a different supplier but has been good from here. Great price for the quality of name brand.</li>
            <li> Great love it so much cheaper than muro</li>
            <li> Thank You so much .  My dog died anyways,but your product reduced her pain</li>
            <li> Effective and much less expensive than Murray.</li>
            <li> overpriced for salt water</li>
            <li> Love this product and the price.</li>
            <li> Just as good as Muro 128 but a lot less expensive</li>
            <li> Changed from Muro 128. This does what I need.</li>
            <li> Lately, when I use this non-B&amp;L brand I have noticed the same adverse reactions as those reported for B&amp;L&#x27;s Muro 128: excessive tears for no other reason, burning and gritty feeling in my eye (like when sand at the beach gets in your eye). I have stopped using this product and am waiting to see my ophthalmologist about it. The reported cause of the B&amp;L recall was that their supplies of Muro 128 were exposed to freezing winter temperatures. If that is really the case, then it is not unreasonable to suspect that this generic substitute was also subjected to the same adverse freezing conditions.</li>
            <li> working well so far and I love the price</li>
            <li> Just what is needed for my husband&#x27;s Fuchs Dystrophy!</li>
            <li> I use this for cleaning the eyes of my Maltese who has dry eye syndrome.  This is a great price compared to what the vet ordered.</li>
            <li> Product came quickly and works the same as Muro 128</li>
            <li> Item came quickly and the boxes were not crushed.</li>
            <li> good price on a good item,,, would buy here again</li>
            <li> Works just as expected</li>
            <li> great replacement for muro.  my doctor approves</li>
            <li> I need to use this in both eyes every night and being a generic it has saved me a lot of money over the years. Thanks for  great product.</li>
            <li> Just starting using this nightly, beginning about a week ago.  So can&#x27;t yet say if long-term use will help with my dry eye and corneal edema/erosion issues.  I can tell you this: the stuff is so thick and gloppy that it&#x27;s challenging to apply it in a thin line along the inside of my lower lid.  I try heating it up a bit (by securing to my bedside light, near the bulb, for about 20 minutes) before I apply it.  But this stuff is just thick and viscous and inherently difficult to get onto your eyes and spread out evenly across them.  That being said, the few nights I&#x27;ve been able to get good overall coverage on my eyes, it does seem to help very much -- in terms of reducing my morning dry eyes and in (theoretically) helping with the cornea damage/swelling.  I have a check-in with my eye doctor (cornea specialist) in about a month, and we&#x27;ll see what he has to say about any actual improvements in my corneal condition.</li>
            <li> Great buy and comparable to name brands the cost so much more.</li>
            <li> As good as the high $ brand.</li>
            <li> I use this ointment at bedtime, to counter my dry eye problem. It seems to be working very well. While not the most convenient product to use, it is worth the difficulty.</li>
            <li> I thank the Preferred Mart team for selling this product.  I have had corneal abrasions since 1990 and have been buying Muro Ointment at outrageous prices.  I am grateful to be able to take care of my eyes and save money too.  I received my order quickly and the expiration date is 2 years out.  I will definitely be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> Good product, good value for the money. My grandfather used Muro before but now it seems Muro the branded one is expensive and hard to find. He is happy with this product and plus we get three instead of the 2 of the Muro that we used to get for the price. Good deal. Will buy again for him as we runs out.</li>
            <li> same product as in pharmacy. much  better price. save a lot of money! I&#x27;ll be back when I need more.</li>
            <li> Does just as good a job as the Muro for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Good cheap alternative.</li>
            <li> Having used the product only 2 days, so far I am pleased, it is taking the redness out of the sclera.</li>
            <li> very good,reduce the cost will be better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Muro 128 at 1/3rd the price.  I&#x27;m very happy as I had to have a corneal scraping and the doctor recommended this at night so my eyelid doesn&#x27;t stick to my eyeball and tear at the scar tissue on my eye.  It works.</li>
            <li> No issues....Cheaper than Muro 128 ointment and works just as good.  Used Muru 128 for 8 years and it was so expensive I decided to try this with the mixed reviews.  It works fine and no gritty feeling.  It feels the same . The muro 128 feels a little stronger in the eye and this one actually feels a little easier on the eye. I am satisfied with the purchase.  Will be purchasing this in the future.  Hope this helps others who are considering this product......</li>
            <li> shipping was very prompt. The product itself is comparable to Muro 128 without the high cost.</li>
            <li> An inexpensive alternative to Mura 128.</li>
            <li> There was no receipt in the package and I for one would like a receipt.  I use it to check by credit card items when my bill comes.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Had been using another product and was paying twice as much. Have been using this product for several months now and it is just as good as the higher priced product. I am totally satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it daily and it works the same as Muro Ophthalmic Ointment 128. about 1/3 less the cost.</li>
            <li> Works great and a lot more cost effective especially if you use every night.</li>
            <li> I &amp;agrave;m very happy with this product. I use it every night.  BTW, for my dry eye, I also microwave wet wash cloth, then apply to eyes as long as I can stand it.  Between the two I don&#x27;t get that blinding gritty feeling in the morning.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working just fine.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I expected when I ordered it and I will be buying it again. The price is very good and I have not found a better price anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Like the fact it comes in multiples!!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I can&#x27;t get the more costly name brand anymore and substituted this. Hey, it works as well if not better and costs a whole lot less. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> My ophthamologist recommended ointment when I started getting corneal irritation.  I use it at night.  It&#x27;s very thick, so it lasts for hours.  Don&#x27;t expect to be able to read a book, or even an alarm clock, after applying it -- things look pretty blurry for a while.  Like all ointments, it takes some practice to be able to squeeze a nice line of ointment into the pocket of your lower eyelid.  This applicator is a small metal tube, which I find easier to use than the plastic tubes of some other brands.</li>
            <li> NOT the same as Muro 128 !&lt;br /&gt;Caused burning of the eyes and could not get a refund from seller.&lt;br /&gt;NEGATIVE 5 stars !&lt;br /&gt;Matters not that I have purchased &amp;#34;TONS&amp;#34; of stuff from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Posted by &amp;#34;Very Unhappy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is a product we needed.  Very good price  Excellent dealer</li>
            <li> Great price and seems to work as well as Muro 128. I expected this product to arrive much sooner.  I would have given this product 5 stars if the product did take so long to arrive.</li>
            <li> product works fine.  does the job.</li>
            <li> Same as name brand work the same and best price very happy</li>
            <li> I have used B&amp;L ointment for years and thought I would try this as a cheaper substitute. It is very runny and caused eye irritation both times i used it. Scratchy,, irritation to the eyes, which is very uncomfortable. Do not purchase this product...opt for the B&amp;L as it is reliable and safe.</li>
            <li> I need the sodium chloride ointment on a regular basis. It is so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have recurrent corneal erosion, and my ophthalmologist Rx&#x27;ed Muro 128 for my eyes. Regular eye lubrication wouldn&#x27;t do, and the Muro 128 is about $30 per tube at my local pharmacy. The store brand Muro 128 at the pharmacy is $20 for a .12oz, and I go through roughly a tube a month or so. I was very disapointed that I couldn&#x27;t find anything cheaper at the store, and I was so lucky I found this on Amazon--a set of 3 tubes for $27. A super value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I bought this, I got the single tube to see how well it worked. Once, when I was still buying this at the store, they were out of store brand so I had to get the name-brand Muro. I hated it. It didn&#x27;t come out of the tube, I felt like my eyes stuck to my lids more frequently than they did with the store brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this product is AWESOME. it works just as well as the pharmacy-brand that I was paying $20 a tube for. Plus, having 3 tubes at once means shopping less frequently and not worrying about running out in an inconvenient time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a more affordable option for Muro 128 or other Sodium Chloride 5% Ophthalmic ointment. This is a great deal, and the 3 pack is cheap and convenient.</li>
            <li> As listed..  Fast S&amp;H.</li>
            <li> Found this brand just as effective as Bausch &amp; Lomb for me. Plus more for your money!</li>
            <li> This has helped clear up my dog&#x27;s eyes and price on Amazon definitely much much better than in the stores.</li>
            <li> Does not compare to the effectiveness of Muro128</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few nights so far but I notice that it smarts a little when I first apply it, unlike the Muro brand.  I hope this doesn&#x27;t mean problems down the road -- maybe we need to check with the manufacturers?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the brand-name Muro-128 product for years, Due to the recent recall, I decided to try the generic version. This product has performed equally as well as the Muro-128, and the price is far less than the brand-name Muro product.</li>
            <li> perfect and less expensive substitute for muro 128</li>
            <li> Price is good and it does what it should.  In my opinion better than the big name brand.</li>
            <li> I have very bad Keratoconus, and use Muro 128 ointment mostly at night.  This is probably the best synthetic version I&#x27;ve found, but I still don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s as good as the real thing.  It is very slightly burny at first, which passes quickly.  It seems to squeeze out of my eyes faster than the original product does, and doesn&#x27;t seem to be as effective at reducing cornial in-fillment.&lt;br /&gt;These are mostly subjective measures, but I&#x27;ve been using the original B&amp;L product for fifteen plus years, and definitely find a difference here.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t say not to buy this, and I may again in the future to save money, but for now I&#x27;ll do a few months on real Muro.</li>
