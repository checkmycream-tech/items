    <ol>
            <li>but once you figure it out, this is the greatest hair-holder ever.  </li>
            <li>This is awesome.</li>
            <li>This works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t go all the way to the end of my hair because I can&#x27;t reach the ends and it works wonderful.</li>
            <li>These hold my hair perfectly in place and give me the perfect bun.</li>
            <li>a great purchase - thank you amazon!</li>
            <li>This is not the original!!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li>This thing is awesome, it saved me from having to do my hair when I travel.</li>
            <li>it stays in awesome.</li>
            <li>the one we did receive works great.  </li>
            <li>product itself is great</li>
            <li>Great concept..</li>
            <li>so I had to buy a hair doughnut thingy which worked great.</li>
            <li>I know a girl that it works great for</li>
            <li>This might work well for you if you are great working with hair.</li>
            <li>A bit unconventional, but very effective &amp; attractive.</li>
            <li>so I was very happy that I was able to find it on the Amazon site.</li>
            <li>Work great to make a nice neat bun.</li>
            <li>But its of good quality</li>
            <li>It does work wonderfully, and holds hair securely without pulling or pinching.  </li>
            <li>basically, is it as good as Hairagami brand?</li>
            <li>The item isn&#x27;t as good as it use to be.</li>
            <li>But, for my hair it hold&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>and this was perfect for those quick buns to get the hair of the way when playing sports or chores.</li>
            <li>but it makes a beautiful bun and easy to.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this purchase that I have ordered 3 more today!!</li>
            <li>The first day I tried Hairagami out I hoped for the best, she returned from school and still had a bun in her hair!</li>
            <li>Add a pretty snood for elegance and you&#x27;re perfect for a night out or day at the office, PTA meeting, what-have-you.</li>
            <li>I love this thing!</li>
            <li>The product hurt me even more than the price!  </li>
            <li>Great product, cheap price.</li>
            <li>The listing was kind of misleading.  </li>
            <li>So, any time the bands snap when you&#x27;re not expecting it, you can wind up with a nice cut on your hand.</li>
            <li>The product is nice but it lacks of quality in the materials.</li>
            <li>In college this was the greatest tool ever, as far as I was concerned, for just rolling out of bed and putting my hair up out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it will be easy to work with!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fine</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re basically 2 slap bracelets (for those that remember them) sewn together with velvet like fabric.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use and makes a nice \\&quot;bun\\&quot;</li>
            <li>so if your hair isn&#x27;t layered then I&#x27;m sure it will work for you.</li>
            <li>Better to shop around for a better price.</li>
            <li>it is much better quality.</li>
            <li>I love what the hairagami can do.   </li>
            <li>I have been using this thing forever, okay like 4 years.</li>
            <li>Sure the concept is not rocket science</li>
            <li>To top it off, it does not keep hair in place.  </li>
            <li>If you roll the ends so the bun maker snaps together with ends at top of head</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like messing with my hair more</li>
            <li>Better than a sock bun</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy a couple more now</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I discovered it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this thing.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good bun maker</li>
            <li>this works great in snapping together a quick bun, though it takes some practice to figure out exactly how it will work in your hair.  </li>
            <li>It is absolutely a cheap copy, does not work and the company does not seam to be reputable.  </li>
            <li>Durable, mine is two years old and still works great.  </li>
            <li>if your in the military this is PERFECT</li>
            <li>: Works best if hair is damp to wet.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very pleased with the neat and tidy looking results.</li>
            <li>I have tried the sponge ones but they do not work as good, not for our hair anyways maybe for someone with much shorter and fine hair.</li>
            <li>the fabric wears out at the ends very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I bought it because it seemed like an easy way to get my hair up for work and dance...</li>
            <li>and I received it very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy, neat quick stylish &#x27;do.</li>
            <li>I can quickly make a perfect looking bun in minutes for a bun thats within military regulations.</li>
            <li>The Hairagami is a great hair device, but this ad implies multiple product.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy if they do become available again.</li>
            <li>great if you just want a simple bun.</li>
            <li>If you just want your hair tucked out of the way, it&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
            <li>Cheap not the original</li>
            <li>not as long as the one I had before but still great</li>
            <li>purchased Hairagami original in a drugstore</li>
            <li>This one was much more flimsy than my first.</li>
            <li>They are nothing like the original Hairagami which I owned.</li>
            <li>Useful and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is a nice product to buy but it can easily give you several paper cuts on your fingers.</li>
            <li>The very first set I had, it was thick and awesome.</li>
            <li>There is a definite learning curve, and probably not the best thing for a girl who is really only getting started on &amp;#34;fixing&amp;#34; her hair.</li>
            <li>Its exactly what I wanted and the price was really cheap</li>
            <li>As Seen On TV product) and found, no, not so much - it rolled the hair up certainly, but didn&#x27;t make anything like an elegant bun.  </li>
            <li>Other than that this product is perfect and necessary for my work</li>
            <li>Very user friendly.</li>
            <li>(surely the hot glue or super glue will unstick from the metal sooner than later).</li>
            <li>Do not buy it if you do not have super straight hair.</li>
            <li>As someone mentioned, it is tricky to use at first</li>
            <li>When I first start using this item, I did not understand exactly how to work with it.  </li>
            <li>, also I put my hair in a pony tail first</li>
            <li>I will most likely be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>I would love to order another one if only I knew it wouldn&#x27;t break as well.</li>
            <li>you can sew, just get two cheap snap bracelets (party favor section of walmart has them for cheap, and the right size too), lay them end to end with one facing down, one facing up.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend you pay a few more dollars for this much sturdier bun tool :)</li>
            <li>I love the hairagami, I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time and you can not buy them in stores anymore,</li>
            <li>This is the second one we have purchase one for wife and daughter, Works well, easy when you&#x27;re in a hurry.</li>
            <li>As such, one part is &amp;#34;open&amp;#34; and thus it&#x27;s really easy to have your hairdo fall apart before you finish putting it together, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>I noticed too that new ones snap back more</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t really know not my style and besides no hair.</li>
            <li>well my hair is at my rear (to be polite), and so I figured out that it has to be wet to make sure</li>
            <li>Ive had one of these before that worked really well with my hair</li>
            <li>Once you figure out how to do this....the contraption works much easier.</li>
            <li>We haven&#x27;t used them much.</li>
            <li>It is like a really unwieldy sadistic slap bracelet.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t pay much for it.</li>
            <li>If you want a tight bun, make sure to put your hair in a ponytail first.  </li>
            <li>You cannot use this for fine or thin hair at all-it just flops out of your hair and if you get it to stay at all, the tool is showing more than any hair wrapped around it.  </li>
            <li>How did i live without this before?!?</li>
            <li>it has to be started at the right distance from your head to turn the right number of times so that it will end up tight against your head, coiled in the right direction</li>
            <li>Gives a really cute effect just pulling hair back into simple ponytail and wrapping this around.  </li>
            <li>Took a little practice, but now it&#x27;s an easy hairstyle that looks like I spent way more time on it than the &amp;lt;</li>
            <li>yeah, if you&#x27;re expecting to make the lovely buns and twists they showed in the ads or in that little styling guide, it&#x27;s not going to happen.  </li>
            <li>On days when hair is behaving badly, this hair tool really comes in handy as you can get a stylish look in spite of unruly locks.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my wife and so far she got 4 paper cuts on her fingers thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>But when it got old it broke it wouldn&#x27;t stay straight.</li>
            <li>and soon I&#x27;ll have to buy a new hairagami.</li>
            <li>It not only holds your hair firmly in place, but creates a nice flip of the exposed hair which covers the hairagami.  </li>
            <li>It works like it&#x27;s supposed to the only thing that is hard to get is rolling it where it fits to the head perfectly and does not pull the hair too tight.</li>
            <li>I got this product due to being military and needing to put my hair up in a nice looking bun.</li>
            <li>I go to India a lot and in such hot weather this is a life saver</li>
            <li>no, it definitely doesn&#x27;t make a nice bun out of my hair, but if you pull it tight enough before letting it roll back up, it locks my hair right in place and those hairs STAY PUT.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair that&#x27;s not very thick.  </li>
            <li>Video made it look easy and very &amp;#34;neat&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s hard to get some of the looks the video shows.</li>
            <li>My hair is probably over 2feet long, thick, and abundant for reference.    </li>
            <li>really love this product - took a few tries to master it</li>
            <li>She went to remove it AFTER THE FIRST USE and the covering came off exposing a RAZOR SHARP metal band.</li>
            <li>my arms dont go that far back.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i might try making one with hot glue or superglue and felt - felt because it won&#x27;t rip through easily, is rough enough to grip hair and not be slippy, and it doesn&#x27;t fray!  </li>
            <li>It work and looks cute but poor quality.</li>
            <li>Then you have two straight pieces which are connected at one end and are open at the other end for your hair to go between the two pieces.</li>
            <li>I also have long thick hair and it held just fine.</li>
            <li>Second one I&#x27;ve bought and one reason I needed a new one is my other one wore out after two years.</li>

            <li> I noticed too that new ones snap back more</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t really know not my style and besides no hair.</li>
            <li> well my hair is at my rear (to be polite), and so I figured out that it has to be wet to make sure</li>
            <li> Ive had one of these before that worked really well with my hair</li>
            <li> Once you figure out how to do this....the contraption works much easier.</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t used them much.</li>
            <li> It is like a really unwieldy sadistic slap bracelet.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t pay much for it.</li>
            <li> If you want a tight bun, make sure to put your hair in a ponytail first.  </li>
            <li> You cannot use this for fine or thin hair at all-it just flops out of your hair and if you get it to stay at all, the tool is showing more than any hair wrapped around it.  </li>
            <li> How did i live without this before?!?</li>
            <li> it has to be started at the right distance from your head to turn the right number of times so that it will end up tight against your head, coiled in the right direction</li>
            <li> Gives a really cute effect just pulling hair back into simple ponytail and wrapping this around.  </li>
            <li> Took a little practice, but now it&#x27;s an easy hairstyle that looks like I spent way more time on it than the &amp;lt;</li>
            <li> yeah, if you&#x27;re expecting to make the lovely buns and twists they showed in the ads or in that little styling guide, it&#x27;s not going to happen.  </li>
            <li> On days when hair is behaving badly, this hair tool really comes in handy as you can get a stylish look in spite of unruly locks.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife and so far she got 4 paper cuts on her fingers thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> But when it got old it broke it wouldn&#x27;t stay straight.</li>
            <li> and soon I&#x27;ll have to buy a new hairagami.</li>
            <li> It not only holds your hair firmly in place, but creates a nice flip of the exposed hair which covers the hairagami.  </li>
            <li> It works like it&#x27;s supposed to the only thing that is hard to get is rolling it where it fits to the head perfectly and does not pull the hair too tight.</li>
            <li> I got this product due to being military and needing to put my hair up in a nice looking bun.</li>
            <li> I go to India a lot and in such hot weather this is a life saver</li>
            <li> no, it definitely doesn&#x27;t make a nice bun out of my hair, but if you pull it tight enough before letting it roll back up, it locks my hair right in place and those hairs STAY PUT.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair that&#x27;s not very thick.  </li>
            <li> Video made it look easy and very &amp;#34;neat&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s hard to get some of the looks the video shows.</li>
            <li> My hair is probably over 2feet long, thick, and abundant for reference.    </li>
            <li> really love this product - took a few tries to master it</li>
            <li> She went to remove it AFTER THE FIRST USE and the covering came off exposing a RAZOR SHARP metal band.</li>
            <li> my arms dont go that far back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i might try making one with hot glue or superglue and felt - felt because it won&#x27;t rip through easily, is rough enough to grip hair and not be slippy, and it doesn&#x27;t fray!  </li>
            <li> It work and looks cute but poor quality.</li>
            <li> Then you have two straight pieces which are connected at one end and are open at the other end for your hair to go between the two pieces.</li>
            <li> I also have long thick hair and it held just fine.</li>
            <li> Second one I&#x27;ve bought and one reason I needed a new one is my other one wore out after two years.</li>
            <li> normally I keep it short - unless I&#x27;m too lazy to go out and get it cut, in which case I prefer to have it tied back.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately I was at a small airport and too early, so no long (i.e. no inconveniencing people behind me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> -- I think if you keep it flat when you&#x27;re not using it that helps.</li>
            <li> I use the dark color (my hair is nearly black) and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> And plus because my hair is so long I dont pull it all the way to the end which</li>
            <li> I put it in my 6-year-olds wet hair in the morning and 8 hours later I take her to dance</li>
            <li> I have long sturdy hair</li>
            <li> Otherwise if you have long hair like me</li>
            <li> snapped my fingers a few times, but the first few times I haven&#x27;t had a problem</li>
            <li> But with all that being said....you could do worse for the price and it is probably worth about what I paid for them.</li>
            <li> I have recieved numerous cuts from the exposed metal until i realized just how sharp it was.</li>
            <li> If I roll it dry</li>
            <li> It can hold your hair for days and not come loose.</li>
            <li> the are sewn shut have come loose and part of the metal piece inside is coming out.</li>
            <li> Said there was two bun tails (one black and one brown) in the package, but only received one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but when I received it there was only one in black.</li>
            <li> Now I can only buy black.</li>
            <li> It came in generic packaging and while when I ordered it said I would receive one brown and one black...</li>
            <li> I took one star off because the fabric cover has started to fall apart after less than a month exposing the bun former underneath</li>
            <li> CVS recently had them half off</li>
            <li> Once I put it up, just sitting, my hair starts to fall out because the bun isn&#x27;t tight enough.</li>
            <li> But one day, looking for something to tie my hair back with and finding no hair elastics (probably stolen by my sister&#x27;s cat), I decided to just try this little device out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is much wide and thicker.  </li>
            <li> After only a few uses it has started to cut through the fabric that its enclosed in.</li>
            <li> I had the ORIGINAL from the store and have never come close to cutting my fingers..</li>
            <li> It was a little loose after all day wear but nothing a few sturdy bobby pins couldnt help with next time.</li>
            <li> I bought a few not too long ago.</li>
            <li> boy, did it work \\&quot;slick as a button\\&quot; once I figured out the basic operation.</li>
            <li> Being in the military, I need to have my hair neatly put up everyday.</li>
            <li> The metal inside seems to be thinner and the material outside also not as thick.</li>
            <li> the distance, and whether you start with the thing curved side up or curved side down, takes some practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because the bands are made from some sort of metal, the edges are very sharp.</li>
            <li> In the ad it was stated that they were selling a pack of 2 which included one brown and one black.</li>
            <li> I received one black and one brown with no option to choose from what was pictured.</li>
            <li> i have tried for almost a half hour to get it out, but to no avail.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough for my daughter&#x27;s thick hair.</li>
            <li> You have to have really thick long hair to make this work.</li>
            <li> You have to wind your hair tightly though.</li>
            <li> (so it doesn&#x27;t hang off backward) and not too tight or not wound all the way (and ending up looking like a C or donut).  </li>
            <li> its a tight bun</li>
            <li> I have very long and thick hair and have been searching for something to put my hair up to get it out of my way at work.</li>
            <li> add a few hand stitches here and there to reinforce and keep the bracelets in place</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> We have long blond (mid-back length) and VERY thick hair in the house.</li>
            <li> Small amount of money but money was wasted.</li>
            <li> so ponytail holders tend to slowly slide down as the day progresses.  </li>
            <li> With thick hair you do not see the black but thinner hair</li>
            <li> I read the past reviews and some state that your hair falls out,</li>
            <li> but I have past shoulder length thick hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is layered and its a bit hard to use it because of that</li>
            <li> it will eventually fall out of thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very happy.</li>
            <li> I have had a very hard time trying to put my daughters knee length, thick, curly hair in a bun that would hold.</li>
            <li> It still works well but is a not a good as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> but she has very thick hair.</li>
            <li> THIS IS POOR QUALITY.</li>
            <li> The fabric is quite thin and wears out within a couple of weeks and then the metal is exposed.</li>
            <li> Definately a poorly made product.</li>
            <li> Poorly made.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say she got cut</li>
            <li> THESE ARE NOT SAFE!!!!</li>
            <li> The material used to cover the snapping bands is very poorly made.   </li>
            <li> I would say these things are quite dangerous.</li>
            <li> than I have to as it&#x27;s very difficult to work with, so</li>
            <li> I was also very disappointed when I received it as I could not to do anything with it.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The listing was kind of misleading.  Said there was two bun tails (one black and one brown) in the package, but only received one.&lt;br /&gt;But the one we did receive works great.  Holds the hair in place well.</li>
            <li> but once you figure it out, this is the greatest hair-holder ever.  It not only holds your hair firmly in place, but creates a nice flip of the exposed hair which covers the hairagami.  There are several different ways to use it that produces different looks in the back.  A bit unconventional, but very effective &amp; attractive.</li>
            <li> I have had a very hard time trying to put my daughters knee length, thick, curly hair in a bun that would hold. The first day I tried Hairagami out I hoped for the best, she returned from school and still had a bun in her hair! It was a little loose after all day wear but nothing a few sturdy bobby pins couldnt help with next time. I also have long thick hair and it held just fine. Just follow the directions and it will be easy to work with! I am so pleased with this purchase that I have ordered 3 more today!! I have tried the sponge ones but they do not work as good, not for our hair anyways maybe for someone with much shorter and fine hair. I highly recommend you pay a few more dollars for this much sturdier bun tool :)</li>
            <li> Work great to make a nice neat bun.</li>
            <li> One has already broke on the second time that my daughter wears it. I&#x27;m not very happy.</li>
            <li> This is awesome. I have very long and thick hair and have been searching for something to put my hair up to get it out of my way at work. This works wonderfully. As someone mentioned, it is tricky to use at first but once you get the hang of it you won&#x27;t have a problem. You have to wind your hair tightly though. I don&#x27;t go all the way to the end of my hair because I can&#x27;t reach the ends and it works wonderful.</li>
            <li> Useful and easy to use. Great product, cheap price. Use it often. Also makes hair curly if you leave it in for awhile.</li>
            <li> not as long as the one I had before but still great</li>
            <li> Easy, neat quick stylish &#x27;do. Add a pretty snood for elegance and you&#x27;re perfect for a night out or day at the office, PTA meeting, what-have-you.</li>
            <li> Im giving this a 1 STAR because of the seller!! In the ad it was stated that they were selling a pack of 2 which included one brown and one black. I needed six so i ordered three sets of two but when I received it there was only one in black. So now I&#x27;m short 3! DON&#x27;T BE MISLEAD by this seller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is great and I would give it 5 STARS!!! I have 3 daughters with varying hair length and texture. The Hairagami is the only thing that we have found that holds their hair in a bun during their rigorous activities such as dance, cheerleading and gymnastics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would defiantly recommend purchasing this item..just not from this vender!</li>
            <li> Great concept..&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re basically 2 slap bracelets (for those that remember them) sewn together with velvet like fabric.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use and makes a nice \\&quot;bun\\&quot; but I have past shoulder length thick hair.  Once I put it up, just sitting, my hair starts to fall out because the bun isn&#x27;t tight enough.</li>
            <li> I got this product due to being military and needing to put my hair up in a nice looking bun. My hair is layered and its a bit hard to use it because of that so I had to buy a hair doughnut thingy which worked great. But its of good quality and it came in the mail in a timely manner so if your hair isn&#x27;t layered then I&#x27;m sure it will work for you.</li>
            <li> I watched the movie ad before buying the product.I was really hopefull as I always have trouble with styling my hair.I was also very disappointed when I received it as I could not to do anything with it.The add is misleading.Do not buy it if you do not have super straight hair.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough for my daughter&#x27;s thick hair.</li>
            <li> Cheap not the original</li>
            <li> The Hairagami is a great hair device, but this ad implies multiple product. Yes it says 2, but the price is so inflated that you expect what is portrayed in the photo. I received one black and one brown with no option to choose from what was pictured. Better to shop around for a better price.</li>
            <li> Being in the military, I need to have my hair neatly put up everyday. These hold my hair perfectly in place and give me the perfect bun. Since I use them daily, I have to replace them every couple months as they tend to crack.</li>
            <li> .have purchased Hairagami original in a drugstore and it is much wide and thicker.  I have cut my fingers on these twice. I had the ORIGINAL from the store and have never come close to cutting my fingers..it is much better quality. THIS IS POOR QUALITY.</li>
            <li> I got one of these probably 10 years ago and decided it was time for another.  This one was much more flimsy than my first. Also the metal inside tore threw the fabric after about 3 months.  It still works well but is a not a good as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I love what the hairagami can do.   I bought a few not too long ago. If you want a tight bun, make sure to put your hair in a ponytail first.  It can hold your hair for days and not come loose. I worn mine to bed last night and its still in there without any budge.  My hair is probably over 2feet long, thick, and abundant for reference.    HOWEVER  The material used to cover the snapping bands is very poorly made.   Because the bands are made from some sort of metal, the edges are very sharp. After only a few uses it has started to cut through the fabric that its enclosed in. So, any time the bands snap when you&#x27;re not expecting it, you can wind up with a nice cut on your hand. Has happened to me two or three times now.    Works well but shouldn&#x27;t cause you to bleed.</li>
            <li> this works great in snapping together a quick bun, though it takes some practice to figure out exactly how it will work in your hair.  it has to be started at the right distance from your head to turn the right number of times so that it will end up tight against your head, coiled in the right direction (so it doesn&#x27;t hang off backward) and not too tight or not wound all the way (and ending up looking like a C or donut).  the distance, and whether you start with the thing curved side up or curved side down, takes some practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after that it&#x27;s a snap, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT.  the fabric wears out at the ends very quickly.  someone mentioned 3 months, but i think we got 3 weeks.  i stitched it shut but it&#x27;s split again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you can sew, just get two cheap snap bracelets (party favor section of walmart has them for cheap, and the right size too), lay them end to end with one facing down, one facing up.  then what you need is a way to connect them - so fabric that envelopes them, and run a line of stitching in between so they stay separated.  to use, fold it in the middle so that they end up stacked together.  sandwich your hair in between, like in a curling iron, and roll towards your head.  snap into a \\&quot;bracelet\\&quot; to curl your hair into a bun.  voila!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i might try making one with hot glue or superglue and felt - felt because it won&#x27;t rip through easily, is rough enough to grip hair and not be slippy, and it doesn&#x27;t fray!  add a few hand stitches here and there to reinforce and keep the bracelets in place (surely the hot glue or super glue will unstick from the metal sooner than later).</li>
            <li> i have looked all over for these, and Amazon pulled through again.  really love this product - took a few tries to master it but all in all it was a great purchase - thank you amazon!</li>
            <li> We bought this for my daughter after her dance instructor suggested it for keeping her hair in a bun. She went to remove it AFTER THE FIRST USE and the covering came off exposing a RAZOR SHARP metal band. Needless to say she got cut and it was almost deep enough to require stitches. We threw them in the trash. THESE ARE NOT SAFE!!!!</li>
            <li> This is not the original!!!!!!!!  It is absolutely a cheap copy, does not work and the company does not seam to be reputable.  I have sent in a request for a return with no response.  Not please at all.  Amazon should no longer work with this company!</li>
            <li> This is the second one we have purchase one for wife and daughter, Works well, easy when you&#x27;re in a hurry. I wouldn&#x27;t really know not my style and besides no hair.</li>
            <li> There is a definite learning curve, and probably not the best thing for a girl who is really only getting started on &amp;#34;fixing&amp;#34; her hair.</li>
            <li> When I first start using this item, I did not understand exactly how to work with it.  After viewing a demo on You Tube, I realized I hadn&#x27;t been putting it on correctly.  It does work wonderfully, and holds hair securely without pulling or pinching.  Gives a really cute effect just pulling hair back into simple ponytail and wrapping this around.  Durable, mine is two years old and still works great.  I use the dark color (my hair is nearly black) and it works very well.  On days when hair is behaving badly, this hair tool really comes in handy as you can get a stylish look in spite of unruly locks.</li>
            <li> I have been using this thing forever, okay like 4 years. I read the past reviews and some state that your hair falls out, well my hair is at my rear (to be polite), and so I figured out that it has to be wet to make sure its a tight bun, also I put my hair in a pony tail first I dont do it like they do on the DVD or direction. And plus because my hair is so long I dont pull it all the way to the end which I cant anyway my arms dont go that far back. This thing is awesome, it saved me from having to do my hair when I travel. I go to India a lot and in such hot weather this is a life saver so I dont have to get so worked up doing my hair. Sure the concept is not rocket science but it makes a beautiful bun and easy to.</li>
            <li> You cannot use this for fine or thin hair at all-it just flops out of your hair and if you get it to stay at all, the tool is showing more than any hair wrapped around it.  I know a girl that it works great for but she has very thick hair.</li>
            <li> I would say these things are quite dangerous. The fabric is quite thin and wears out within a couple of weeks and then the metal is exposed. I have recieved numerous cuts from the exposed metal until i realized just how sharp it was. Definately a poorly made product. Don&#x27;t buy if they do become available again. They are nothing like the original Hairagami which I owned.</li>
            <li> The brown one tore through the covering before I even used the thing. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> just as i remember . however these are not the ones from the as seen on tv people. they ship from china with chinese packaging. no instruction booklet like the as seen on tv product. only a card with 4 styles showing and no instructions for them. great if you just want a simple bun.</li>
            <li> Ive had one of these before that worked really well with my hair but I bought it for my daughters hair. It works like it&#x27;s supposed to the only thing that is hard to get is rolling it where it fits to the head perfectly and does not pull the hair too tight. Once you figure out how to do this....the contraption works much easier.</li>
            <li> This hairgami has been nothing but a pain for me . It wont go in and it wont come out ! As i am typing this review i am sitting wwith a hairgami bun maker clamped to  my head ! i have tried for almost a half hour to get it out, but to no avail. Dont buy if you dont want a hassle.</li>
            <li> Pretty good bun maker if your in the military this is PERFECT</li>
            <li> Poorly made.  The felt ripped almost immediately.  To top it off, it does not keep hair in place.  Wish I would I saved my money.  Total garbage.</li>
            <li> This might work well for you if you are great working with hair. I bought it because it seemed like an easy way to get my hair up for work and dance...maybe the learning curve is too steep for me, but I could not work with this. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3-years. We have long blond (mid-back length) and VERY thick hair in the house. If you roll the ends so the bun maker snaps together with ends at top of head it stays in awesome. If you roll it so the ends snap underneath the bun it will eventually fall out of thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried every bun maker tool out there...this is the only one that works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Works best if hair is damp to wet. I put it in my 6-year-olds wet hair in the morning and 8 hours later I take her to dance and it stays in all through class. If I roll it dry I have to redo it one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now hairagami PLEASE bring back the blond. After 3-years I went through the 6 I had, we wore them 3-4 times a week. Now I can only buy black. With thick hair you do not see the black but thinner hair you might...bring the blond back!</li>
            <li> This is not the Hairagami brand even though it is listed as such. The metal inside seems to be thinner and the material outside also not as thick. It came in generic packaging and while when I ordered it said I would receive one brown and one black...I actually just got two blacks...which is ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So basically, is it as good as Hairagami brand? No. Will it wear out faster? Probably. But with all that being said....you could do worse for the price and it is probably worth about what I paid for them.</li>
            <li> I love the hairagami, I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time and you can not buy them in stores anymore, so I was very happy that I was able to find it on the Amazon site. Its exactly what I wanted and the price was really cheap and I received it very quickly. I will most likely be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like messing with my hair more than I have to as it&#x27;s very difficult to work with, so normally I keep it short - unless I&#x27;m too lazy to go out and get it cut, in which case I prefer to have it tied back.  It&#x27;s very fine so ponytail holders tend to slowly slide down as the day progresses.  But, my sister had gotten a set of hairagamis on the off chance that it would actually work like advertised (not our expectation, given it was an As Seen On TV product) and found, no, not so much - it rolled the hair up certainly, but didn&#x27;t make anything like an elegant bun.  But one day, looking for something to tie my hair back with and finding no hair elastics (probably stolen by my sister&#x27;s cat), I decided to just try this little device out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And no, it definitely doesn&#x27;t make a nice bun out of my hair, but if you pull it tight enough before letting it roll back up, it locks my hair right in place and those hairs STAY PUT. In college this was the greatest tool ever, as far as I was concerned, for just rolling out of bed and putting my hair up out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But yeah, if you&#x27;re expecting to make the lovely buns and twists they showed in the ads or in that little styling guide, it&#x27;s not going to happen.  If you just want your hair tucked out of the way, it&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
            <li> Second one I&#x27;ve bought and one reason I needed a new one is my other one wore out after two years. Better than a sock bun</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t used them much. Video made it look easy and very &amp;#34;neat&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s hard to get some of the looks the video shows.</li>
            <li> I love this thing! I bought one just to try out and it worked like a gem. My daughter uses them for her dance recitals and hair stays in place. I&#x27;m going to buy a couple more now that I know they work so well.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product to buy but it can easily give you several paper cuts on your fingers. I bought this product for my wife and so far she got 4 paper cuts on her fingers thanks to this product. The product is nice but it lacks of quality in the materials.</li>
            <li> I have long sturdy hair and this was perfect for those quick buns to get the hair of the way when playing sports or chores. You will need a hair tie then use this product to put up your bun. Otherwise if you have long hair like me it&#x27;s going to become undone.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Very user friendly.</li>
            <li> It took me a while but I finally figured out how to use the Hairagami bun making gizmo! In the package it looks like 2 coils connected together---kind of like a figure \\&quot;8\\&quot;. Just straighten the two coils out (they snap open when uncoiled). Then you have two straight pieces which are connected at one end and are open at the other end for your hair to go between the two pieces. Now the diagrams and instructions make sense!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And boy, did it work \\&quot;slick as a button\\&quot; once I figured out the basic operation. So far I&#x27;m very pleased with the neat and tidy looking results.</li>
            <li> The very first set I had, it was thick and awesome. But when it got old it broke it wouldn&#x27;t stay straight. So I rebought the item. And it&#x27;s the same thing all over again. The item isn&#x27;t as good as it use to be. But, for my hair it hold&#x27;s good. I would love to order another one if only I knew it wouldn&#x27;t break as well.</li>
            <li> Could not get the thing to operate properly.  Perhaps it was me but it ended up in the trash.  Small amount of money but money was wasted.</li>
            <li> How did i live without this before?!?! I&#x27;m so glad I discovered it. I can quickly make a perfect looking bun in minutes for a bun thats within military regulations. I took one star off because the fabric cover has started to fall apart after less than a month exposing the bun former underneath and soon I&#x27;ll have to buy a new hairagami. Other than that this product is perfect and necessary for my work</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this thing.  CVS recently had them half off and I picked up another one as backup.  Took a little practice, but now it&#x27;s an easy hairstyle that looks like I spent way more time on it than the &amp;lt; 3 minutes it took to make a bun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t wear it through airport security -- just got absent minded and forgot that it was metal.  Fortunately I was at a small airport and too early, so no long (i.e. no inconveniencing people behind me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I snapped my fingers a few times, but the first few times I haven&#x27;t had a problem -- I can catch it before it snaps.  I noticed too that new ones snap back more -- I think if you keep it flat when you&#x27;re not using it that helps.</li>
            <li> ...there&#x27;s a design flaw where the two parts of the hairagami don&#x27;t hook together or latch together in some way. As such, one part is &amp;#34;open&amp;#34; and thus it&#x27;s really easy to have your hairdo fall apart before you finish putting it together, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> It works fina and it keeps tide.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair that&#x27;s not very thick.  I could not make a bun at all using this.  The worst part is all the ouchies you get for trying this product.  The product hurt me even more than the price!  It is like a really unwieldy sadistic slap bracelet.</li>
            <li> You have to have really thick long hair to make this work. I was very disappointed. Good thing I didn&#x27;t pay much for it.</li>
            <li> I have had the product a week and the one of the edges the are sewn shut have come loose and part of the metal piece inside is coming out. It work and looks cute but poor quality.</li>
