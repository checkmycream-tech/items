            <li>also I liked the fact</li>
            <li>so time will tell what kind of job it does</li>
            <li>This is so nice on -</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t be effective.</li>
            <li>Great price when compaired to my original purchase in Las Vegas salon.</li>
            <li>If saving over $200 seems to good to be true</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this serum, my complexion is smoother.</li>
            <li>This product performs outstandingly</li>
            <li>This facial serum smells delicious, glides on and in 30 seconds or so, soaks into my skin...</li>
            <li>I love the lifting serum</li>
            <li>I need to use it more often</li>
            <li>This is the best facial serum.</li>
            <li>We have been quite satisfied with all Gratiae products.</li>
            <li>love this item.</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant in this purchase, but, so happy I did it.</li>
            <li>This is much better.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I really like gratiae serums, are simply awesome , specially face and eyes, i even look younger , sooo happy with this serum also peeling cream is extraordinary</li>
            <li>I have used their products for a year now and highly recommend their line to anyone who likes to pamper your skin and feel good about how you look.</li>
            <li>, the lifting serum might seem \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; at first touch, but I assure you that, it is not and it soaks into the skin nicely.</li>
            <li>but it is not and absorbs into your skin leaving it feeling smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I have used it before and it makes my skin smooth and seems to soften the wrinkles</li>
            <li>Fabulous product.</li>
            <li>So smooth on my skin.</li>
            <li>Once again I feel this product has been used since it did not have original wrapping around the box.  </li>
            <li>so I am familiar with it</li>
            <li>This is expired product and they have erased original date and re stamped it.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a good skin treatment...</li>
            <li>I have a drawer full of lotions, creams, serums....</li>
            <li>I saw results quickly and have used it faithfully ever since.</li>
            <li>I also love that it is all natural and does not contain any cancer causing elements, it does not clog the pores, and it works well with the Gratiae lifting moisturizing cream!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>, I am 47 now, and can say, these products are some of my very favs now!!</li>
            <li>Think of it this way, smearing a cream on the surface of the skin is hardly as effective as an injection; so if you truly have deep wrinkles, it might be time for a \\&quot;procedure\\&quot; instead of a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I saw a difference in even my neck skin, around my under eye area, and smile lines.</li>
            <li>It was odd as it was very inexpensive (almost too good to be true).  </li>
            <li>Gratiae lifting Facial Serum has a light, fresh fragrance and penetrates quickly.  </li>
            <li>In addition, I prefer to use both products by applying the lifting serum first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this serum for several and I love the way it feels on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Love this product for facial lines.</li>
            <li>First the box was not sealed.</li>
            <li>It is wise to ponder how you eat and whether you are drinking enough water, getting enough sleep, exercising, and not over-doing the caffeine consumption.</li>
            <li>I have been using a few of their products now and can say this is my favorite!</li>
            <li>It is very nourishing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Really, try it.</li>
            <li>This really works.  </li>
            <li>but I like it so much I tend to save it.</li>
            <li>Very greasy and did not seem to help with any lifting of lines.  </li>
            <li>Works really well under make up...</li>
            <li>but I havent seen much difference in skin tone or firmness.</li>
            <li>I have tried lots of other brands of skin care you find at high-end department stores and have not been pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>That is not possible, aging is inevitable, and you must consider the appropriate treatment for the condition.</li>
            <li>So be realistic about your skin care and your expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just a kindly reminder, as I say, because too often folks rely solely on a topical cream to fix what is actually occurring internally.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a few years and really love it.  </li>
            <li>no matter the brand, no matter the cost...that live up to all the claims.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t able to get my usual Premier product, so I tried this.  </li>
            <li>If your pocket book allows for expensive treatments than great for you, but I find when it comes to topical treatments that, it is foolish to buy high priced products.</li>
            <li>I mention this because I read reviews from some folks, and it is clear that, they are looking for a miracle in a jar.</li>
            <li>So far, I have zero</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the absorption rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A moisturizer does not make a 50 year old woman look 20, period.</li>
            <li>I really like this facial serum</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve not found any lotions or potions, or serums...</li>
            <li>and how it makes your skin feel so soft and takes away all dryness and allows the moisture to remain in the skin.</li>
            <li>and when I do I just use the facial serum over my whole face.</li>
            <li>Therefore, it is good to find a product line without such a caustic ingredient.</li>
            <li>Love trying new things but often they can get pretty darn expensive.</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re over 50, don&#x27;t you really WANT something with lifting power AND a little oil to really moisturize?</li>
            <li>Feels smooth and one of the VERY FEW items I can use around my eye area without it burning my eyes or skin if I apply immediately after using facewash on my face or an exfoliant.  </li>
            <li>- it is so smooth and silky and actually does help firm.  </li>
            <li>and I never expect miracles, but this stuff twice a day for a couple days, then alternating with some of you other favorites, absolutely maintains.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that the cap doesn&#x27;t fit properly on  the bottle, and the last time I ordered it online, the bottle arrived almost half empty.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ll soon be 71, so my youthful oily face is now generally dry, so younger skin might need this only on the cheeks and perhaps the neck.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Moreover, I have spent a fortune on more expensive product lines such as lancome and others.</li>
            <li> A moisturizer reduces signs of aging to a minimal degree only.</li>
            <li> Crow&#x27;s feet are a minor issue in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The smallest amount is needed - a bottle lasts a LONG time.  </li>
            <li> but does work at keeping wrinkles and dry lines away..</li>
            <li> its a natural product none of the usual toxins made here in the USA</li>
            <li> As a woman working (still) in a VERY dry environment, I know my skin craves some oil.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> you would think it would feel or stay greasy due to the texture?  </li>
            <li> The active non expired product is darker.  </li>
            <li> the &#x27;jowls&#x27; and cheeks, plus your neck down to your throat and below all need care...</li>
            <li> I put a little on my hand and it was extremely greasy felt like cooking oil.  </li>
            <li> Must say this is much less and works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a firm believer and consumer of oro gold products.</li>
            <li> See results within just a few days.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and have been asked by co-workers if I am seeing a dermatologist for injections!</li>
            <li> There has been a DRAMATIC improvement in my skin - my crow&#x27;s feet have diminished down to little chickadee feet.  </li>
            <li> I had concerns that since this was so heavily discounted it might be fake or out of date.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it. Makes my skin feel silky. Will buy it again</li>
            <li> I began using this product and this product line at the beginning of 2012. So far, I have zero regrets!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I love this product! I also love that it is all natural and does not contain any cancer causing elements, it does not clog the pores, and it works well with the Gratiae lifting moisturizing cream! In addition, I prefer to use both products by applying the lifting serum first and then the moisture cream. That is my night regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the lifting serum might seem \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; at first touch, but I assure you that, it is not and it soaks into the skin nicely. I was pleasantly surprised by the absorption rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As well, I think the bottom line for me is the ingredients and the effect they have on the dermal layers. After all, they are finding parabens in cosmetic products are possibly linked to cancer. The truth is any chemical that bio-accumulates should warrant concern. Therefore, it is good to find a product line without such a caustic ingredient. Yay for Gratiae!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, I have spent a fortune on more expensive product lines such as lancome and others. If your pocket book allows for expensive treatments than great for you, but I find when it comes to topical treatments that, it is foolish to buy high priced products. Think of it this way, smearing a cream on the surface of the skin is hardly as effective as an injection; so if you truly have deep wrinkles, it might be time for a \\&quot;procedure\\&quot; instead of a moisturizer. I mention this because I read reviews from some folks, and it is clear that, they are looking for a miracle in a jar. That is not possible, aging is inevitable, and you must consider the appropriate treatment for the condition. A moisturizer does not make a 50 year old woman look 20, period. A moisturizer reduces signs of aging to a minimal degree only. So be realistic about your skin care and your expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note! It is wise to ponder how you eat and whether you are drinking enough water, getting enough sleep, exercising, and not over-doing the caffeine consumption. All of those things do contribute to the quality of your skin. Just a kindly reminder, as I say, because too often folks rely solely on a topical cream to fix what is actually occurring internally.

            <li> I&#x27;m a firm believer and consumer of oro gold products. Must say this is much less and works well. See results within just a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for several and I love the way it feels on my skin.  One squeeze of the pump is all you need to cover the face, so it lasts several months.</li>
            <li> I had never used this serum before and I wasn&#x27;t able to get my usual Premier product, so I tried this.  I love it.  It is very nourishing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Love this serum, my complexion is smoother. A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> The lifting facial serum did nothing for my skin.  I was expecting to see and feel some tightening but this did not happen.  It feels greasy when initially applied to the skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product for facial lines.</li>
            <li> GRATiAE is a wonderful product line. I love using the products every day knowing it is organic and makes me feel great. I have used their products for a year now and highly recommend their line to anyone who likes to pamper your skin and feel good about how you look. When you put it on it feels like it will be greasy but it is not and absorbs into your skin leaving it feeling smooth and silky. I have tried lots of other brands of skin care you find at high-end department stores and have not been pleased with the results. GRATiAE is my go to from now on. I am very happy with the fact I found it here on Amazon! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff!&lt;br /&gt;  This product performs outstandingly [is that a word?].  It does all that it claims to do and through Amazon it is an amazing deal [ great price].</li>
            <li> I really like this facial serum - it is so smooth and silky and actually does help firm.  I use it in the mornings under foundation...and it smells so good.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few years and really love it.  The only problem is that the cap doesn&#x27;t fit properly on  the bottle, and the last time I ordered it online, the bottle arrived almost half empty.</li>
            <li> I really like gratiae serums, are simply awesome , specially face and eyes, i even look younger , sooo happy with this serum also peeling cream is extraordinary</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a clue whether it works or not, but it feels great on my skin.  We&#x27;ll see if it works over time I guess</li>
            <li> I ordered this product in error, but decided to try it. It worked wonderfully! I saw a difference in even my neck skin, around my under eye area, and smile lines.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve not found any lotions or potions, or serums...no matter the brand, no matter the cost...that live up to all the claims. This facial serum smells delicious, glides on and in 30 seconds or so, soaks into my skin...then I apply moisturizer or night cream.  It takes 3 or 4 minutes for my face to absorb it all. Daytime with moisturizer use, I can then apply mineral powder makeup with brushes and all is well.  Nothing sticky as you might expect.  Overall, it is a good skin treatment...I&#x27;ll soon be 71, so my youthful oily face is now generally dry, so younger skin might need this only on the cheeks and perhaps the neck.  Take care of your neck ladies...Crow&#x27;s feet are a minor issue in my opinion. the &#x27;jowls&#x27; and cheeks, plus your neck down to your throat and below all need care...a lesson learned through experience, lol.</li>
            <li> I love the lifting serum</li>
            <li> The smallest amount is needed - a bottle lasts a LONG time.  There has been a DRAMATIC improvement in my skin - my crow&#x27;s feet have diminished down to little chickadee feet.  Gratiae lifting Facial Serum has a light, fresh fragrance and penetrates quickly.  it feels WONDERFUL on my skin!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;m a fairly young-looking 68 and I never expect miracles, but this stuff twice a day for a couple days, then alternating with some of you other favorites, absolutely maintains. Maybe you cannot takes lots of years off, but you can look GREAT for your age! Some of the reviews complain about an oily feel. When you&#x27;re over 50, don&#x27;t you really WANT something with lifting power AND a little oil to really moisturize? As a woman working (still) in a VERY dry environment, I know my skin craves some oil. Really, try it. It&#x27;s great stuff! And since I&#x27;m retiring soon, the price will not make me sacrifice a cherished product.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have used it before and it makes my skin smooth and seems to soften the wrinkles, that&#x27;s why I am a returning customer.</li>
            <li> Wonderful!  This really works.  I need to use it more often but I like it so much I tend to save it.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended it to me so I decided to try it. I saw results quickly and have used it faithfully ever since.</li>
            <li> Once again I feel this product has been used since it did not have original wrapping around the box.  However quality of the product seems the same.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial serum. I use it everyday and have been asked by co-workers if I am seeing a dermatologist for injections! My crows feet around my eyes have diminished and I have a youthful glow.</li>
            <li> Good skin care product.</li>
            <li> We have been quite satisfied with all Gratiae products. The results have a noticeable effect in a short time. The eye cream is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I use the facial serum regularly.  It is a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have used several of their products but hadn&#x27;t tried this one until now. It works quite well and feels great.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say enough about this item.. i&#x27;ve ordered it now 4 times. love this item. and how it makes your skin feel so soft and takes away all dryness and allows the moisture to remain in the skin. great product</li>
            <li> Very greasy and did not seem to help with any lifting of lines.  Product did not absorb into my skin.  I would not order again.&lt;br /&gt;In fact I wish I could get a refund</li>
            <li> I Love this product!! always have one on back-up. I was very hesitant in this purchase, but, so happy I did it. The product does go on a bit oily at first, then soaks in and feels wonderful!! I have been using a few of their products now and can say this is my favorite! The eye cream is also just as wonderful!! I have used Lancome since I was 18, I am 47 now, and can say, these products are some of my very favs now!!</li>
            <li> Fabulous product. So smooth on my skin. Keeps my face from drying out. I&#x27;ve been using Anew clinical lift serum for years. This is much better. Love it.</li>
            <li> I have a drawer full of lotions, creams, serums.... Love trying new things but often they can get pretty darn expensive. I had concerns that since this was so heavily discounted it might be fake or out of date.  The seller assured me it was neither. I have used this product before so I am familiar with it and I didn&#x27;t notice anything to make me think otherwise. Plus the expiration date was 2015.  It&#x27;s a really nice serum to use at night. I even use it on my hands.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have used most of the product line and have had great results. Great price when compaired to my original purchase in Las Vegas salon.</li>
            <li> I 1st tried this in Las Vegas, was impressed I could see results also I liked the fact its a natural product none of the usual toxins made here in the USA I am still using it and will continue so time will tell what kind of job it does</li>
            <li> This works great... I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 as it doesn&#x27;t seem to hydrate your skin that well... but does work at keeping wrinkles and dry lines away.. .maybe it is and you just can&#x27;t feel it?  Works really well under make up... you would think it would feel or stay greasy due to the texture?  But your skin just absorbs it up.  Feels smooth and one of the VERY FEW items I can use around my eye area without it burning my eyes or skin if I apply immediately after using facewash on my face or an exfoliant.  I also use the Gratiae Lifting eye serum for just my eye area, but seem to run out of that and when I do I just use the facial serum over my whole face.</li>
            <li> i like how it makes my face feel after applying but I havent seen much difference in skin tone or firmness.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed. First the box was not sealed. It was smashed in. I did not receive a return label. I put a little on my hand and it was extremely greasy felt like cooking oil.  I will not be using this on my face. I have contacted seller asking that this be returned. It was odd as it was very inexpensive (almost too good to be true).  I definitely do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I have used it for several years and I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This is so nice on - I put it on before anti-wrinkle cream and it just is so wonderful feeling on the skin.</li>
            <li> If the expiration date is on the bottom back of the bottle it is misrepresented product. This is expired product and they have erased original date and re stamped it. The active non expired product is darker.  Do not buy. Won&#x27;t be effective. If saving over $200 seems to good to be true it&#x27;s because it is!</li>
