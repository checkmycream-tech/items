            <li>As for the cocoa butter, it smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I made my own mix with the Shea butter.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to make my own whipped body butter.  </li>
            <li>My package was delivered nicely.</li>
            <li>The packaging is really nice and is reseal-able.</li>
            <li>After a Pinterest frenzy I decided to try my hand making my own beauty products.</li>

            <li>They were each in their own plastic bag.</li>
            <li>I have been using it to make my own lotions and body butter.  </li>
            <li>I bought these for use in body butters, but will probably use the cocoa butter on its own as well.</li>

            <li>I ordered this because I was making my own body butter</li>

            <li>If you order from Practical Magic, then you will be satisfied!</li>

            <li>I have found a better supplier since this purchase but these are recommended still.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>The cocoa butter smells just fantastic!</li>

            <li>Very fresh!</li>
            <li>The shea butter was very clean.</li>
            <li>They came in zip top bags and smelled fantastic, just like chocolate.</li>
            <li>i loved the smell so much.</li>
            <li>It came in really nice sturdy packaging, was fresh and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>The customers we sold to love it so much that they requested more!</li>
            <li>Overall good value though!</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to store and use.</li>
            <li>melts easy, applies well.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easy to tell which is which.</li>
            <li>They are in resealable bags so storage is easy.</li>
            <li>the smell is so strong, even opening the bag will send waves of Shea/Cocoa through my kitchen.  </li>

            <li>The cocoa butter is nice and soft, has a nice scent, and is easy to work with.</li>
            <li>I use it as an eye cream, the fine lines have diminished.</li>
            <li>Shipped quick!</li>
            <li>I am not familiar with shea butter, so I don&#x27;t know how to tell if this is great quality or not, but it feels nice...</li>
            <li>Both are smooth and feel great when mixed into my body butters!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Came in bags that blocks out the light and reseals.</li>
            <li>The best of this product since I have been buying these products for the past 5 years</li>
            <li>I would not use cocoa butter on my face because it does have a pretty high comedogenic rating and will clog your pores, but it works good in hand creams, foot creams, lip balms, body butters and cuticle creams.</li>
            <li>I would not use cocoa butter on my face because it does have a pretty high comedogenic rating and will clog your pores, but it works good in hand creams, foot creams, lip balms, body butters and cuticle creams.</li>
            <li>The cocoa butter smells just like a dark chocolate bar and feels so good!  </li>
            <li>Oh and tasted exactly right!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t yet determine if I was given a whole pound, but it sure feels like it.</li>
            <li>The Cocoa butter is to die for but the shea butter was very gritty and didnt not feel good on my skin.</li>
            <li>The cocoa butter really does smell like chocolate :)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on harsh sunburns and it makes them go away and turn into a tan at an incredible rate, virtually overnight.</li>
            <li>The cocoa butter is unrefined and good quality but weighed only 15 oz&#x27;s (I paid for a full pound).</li>
            <li>Now I can make  the gift of an amazing lotion for my neighbors who finally got pregnant after years of trying!</li>
            <li>I am more than satisfied with my purchase and plan to continue using this product as long at it is available to purchase.</li>
            <li>Both are clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and was just as advertised.  </li>
            <li>High quality and love the way they make my skin feel.</li>
            <li>This will last one person a really long time, and the results are wonderful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased so far!</li>
            <li>I ordered Shea and cocoa butter and got exactly what I ordered!</li>
            <li>I got great customer service and got exactly what I had expected!</li>
            <li>It came packaged very well and measured out accurately.  </li>
            <li>Fresh and well packaged.  </li>
            <li>The orange smells especially yummy; keep in mind that these ingredients add a bit of fragrance on their own, too.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>The products are fresh and that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li>- I cant wait to make natural body butter :)</li>
            <li>the price was right.  </li>
            <li>works ok for lotions but has strong smell and very greenish yellow color.</li>
            <li>Just as expected, great natural product!</li>
            <li>and I swear if there ever was a true miracle cream that could really multitask it would be Shea butter.</li>
            <li>but that was probably my fault for heating them in the crockpot on warm for too long.</li>
            <li>I liked that there were some smaller bits along with the large chunks.</li>
            <li>There has been prior reviews about the quality and packaging, mine was good quality and professional packaging</li>
            <li>Got the products very fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for solid lotion bars and love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Shea butter on several batches of body butter and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I think I would prefer a more refined product and next time I will purchase one!  </li>
            <li>This was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>so I couldn&#x27;t tell there were two bags at first, but there was.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Both smelled exactly as they should.</li>
            <li>It measured out pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Zip lock the rest, place the bag in individual plastic containers and freeze til I need some more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Most local health food/beauty stores want almost 20$ a pound for these butters.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the butters!</li>
            <li>Excellent for my my entire familly, including my soon to be newbor baby, I use natural oils cut with olive oil on all my kids when they were newbies, not one diaper rash, cradle cap, or typical baby bumbs yet, and I also add the shea butter to my hair moisturizing products.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much this is my second order.</li>
            <li>The shea butter is a little grainy, but other then that they were excellent for the price .</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and arrived fast.</li>
            <li>Once the oils were completely melted, I removed the bowl from the stove and let cool for about 30 minutes, then I added the vegetable glycerine.</li>
            <li>Smartly packaged.</li>
            <li>very dissatisfied</li>
            <li>and I warn everyone who wants to take a chance with this product because it&#x27;s not usable in any form..........buyer BEWARE</li>
            <li>its packaged really well, no spills or anything.</li>
            <li>It applies fantastically and melts very well.</li>
            <li>The cocoa butter is what I really wanted.</li>
            <li>I really have a mind block against body products that smell like food (cinnamon bun, vanilla, etc.)</li>
            <li>The packaging was very unprofessional.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing it again very soon.</li>
            <li>The Shea butter I received today smells like petroleum jelly and is very whipped and refined.  </li>
            <li>I made a citrus &amp; honey soap with it and it turned out very well.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to order this very product every time I need cocoa butter and Shea</li>
            <li>I will continue to order this very product every time I need cocoa butter and Shea butter.</li>
            <li>I really would buy again.</li>
            <li>Really a necessity for customer to verify they are getting what was ordered.  </li>
            <li>The only downfall is that it is raw so they still remain some unwanted particles..but would purchase again great deal</li>
            <li>and they offered to send me a whole new unit of cocoa butter at no charge for their mistake!</li>
            <li>and they offered to send me a whole new unit of cocoa butter at no charge for their mistake!</li>
            <li>I make my own body butter with this, melting the cocoa butter, mixing in the shea butter, pure olive oil and an all natural herbal lotion or other natural oils and herbs.</li>
            <li>love the shea butter for my hands, helps with the excess washing I do as a nurse, would recommend this to any one if you don&#x27;t melting the product down</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on the quality of my products, and it&#x27;s mostly due to this source!</li>
            <li>Will definitely be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>I have been able to make luxurious batches of my lotions for next to nothing financially.  </li>
            <li>Cocoa butter appears to be of decent quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>High quality shea butter and cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>When it arrived it smelled so FRESH, shea butter was so yellow and moiste, my skin craves it.</li>
            <li>The smell the same and the brick on the right is softer.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when buying it raw.</li>
            <li>It keeps them very soft.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping-- arrived in only five days.</li>
            <li>I heated it up and added some favorite oils like vitamin e and coconut to make it softer and then poured the mixture in small mason jars.</li>
            <li>I first tried to refrigerate it for a hour, when it didn&#x27;t solid</li>
            <li>I scooped some into a jar with another brand of Shea butter and the consistency is pretty identical even though the color is different.</li>
            <li>maybe a little sticky at first but smooths right in the skin.  </li>
            <li>Each once was just in a clear ziplock</li>
            <li>and then they were both put into another clear bag.</li>
            <li>I put it in my lotion recipes and has made my skin feel silky soft.</li>
            <li>Using it to make natural skincare products.  </li>
            <li>The shea butter was nowhere near unrefined shea butter.</li>
            <li>it was soft.</li>
            <li>I starting to question if these products were the real deal.</li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t use much, just worked it into the ends and left it on overnight)</li>
            <li>Makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li>Packaging was not labeled or marked.  </li>
            <li>The next product that I&#x27;m going to buy from plant guru is their African black soap, so hopefully I will be able to write another review soon.</li>
            <li>the only thing that I didn&#x27;t care for was the high s&amp;h  price.</li>
            <li>This was exactly as pictured, and worked as I expected it to in an oil, beeswax, and fragrance balm recipe.</li>
            <li>Where I live I can only buy shea butter, which I don&#x27;t like as much.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Shea butter is yellow, unfortunately, but it&#x27;s still really good quality.</li>
            <li>chunks n shea butter came as a solid piece but because its so soft some of it did stick to the bag.</li>
            <li>Thinking of ordering this combo again in the near future...</li>
            <li>I use it to heal cuts, abrasions and rashes fast with minimal scarring.</li>
            <li>It works just as well as any other I&#x27;ve tried, including the ones that cost 1 1/2 times to twice as much.</li>
            <li>It is very oily and buttery when you melt it onto your skin, and extremely moisturizing but greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried to introducing cocoa butter to several of my other friends  but because it&#x27;s different they are not to hot on the idea of using</li>
            <li>it was easy to break down and ohhsooo aromatic!!!!</li>
            <li>The cocoa butter has an amazingly delicious chocolate smell and the raw shea does not have a bad odor as I have heard it sometimes does.  </li>
            <li>They have a strong cocoa odor and are raw with particles and specks of black within the butters.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The cocoa butter smells amazing..</li>
            <li> They smelled amazing.</li>
            <li> (and it amazingly does not make me break out--it is rated zero on the comedogenic scale)</li>
            <li> As for the cocoa butter, it smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I made my own mix with the Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to make my own whipped body butter.  </li>
            <li> My package was delivered nicely.</li>
            <li> The packaging is really nice and is reseal-able.</li>
            <li> After a Pinterest frenzy I decided to try my hand making my own beauty products.</li>
            <li> It was a good quality for that purpose and we really enjoyed the process of cosmetic making.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with my shea and cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> They were each in their own plastic bag.</li>
            <li> I have been using it to make my own lotions and body butter.  </li>
            <li> I bought these for use in body butters, but will probably use the cocoa butter on its own as well.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone making their own soap.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I was making my own body butter</li>
            <li> Glad to find it so reasonably priced and to get both in a combo is great!</li>
            <li> it smells very strong in the bag</li>
            <li> If you order from Practical Magic, then you will be satisfied!</li>
            <li> Adds a wonderful chocolate smell with the cocoa butter that seems strong at first</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, completely raw/natural and unrefined.  </li>
            <li> I made my own body butters and retail them at a local shop, these whip great!</li>

            <li> It is very important for me to get the best price for Cocoa and Shea Butters especially since the price range is extreme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the smell of the coca butter.</li>
            <li> is on top in a separate package.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great product</li>

            <li> I love that even as I type I still feel moisturized.</li>
            <li> Ok I guessed.</li>

            <li> Besides that, I love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product...</li>
            <li> the fact that its a combo at the price it is makes it even greater...</li>
            <li> I have found a better supplier since this purchase but these are recommended still.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter smells just fantastic!</li>
            <li> the price was  better then</li>
            <li> bec your body will absorb it better.</li>

            <li> Excellent product that last like forever!</li>
            <li> but overall I am very happy with it and can not wait to use it.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells too.  </li>
            <li> it would be Shea butter for sure.</li>
            <li> Use it to make lotion love it</li>
            <li> nothing more to it.</li>
            <li> Product seems ok for what its intended purpose is.</li>
            <li> Smells good and so fresh.</li>
            <li> Very fresh!</li>
            <li> The shea butter was very clean.</li>
            <li> They came in zip top bags and smelled fantastic, just like chocolate.</li>
            <li> i loved the smell so much.</li>
            <li> It came in really nice sturdy packaging, was fresh and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> The customers we sold to love it so much that they requested more!</li>
            <li> Overall good value though!</li>
            <li> Makes it easy to store and use.</li>
            <li> melts easy, applies well.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easy to tell which is which.</li>
            <li> They are in resealable bags so storage is easy.</li>
            <li> the smell is so strong, even opening the bag will send waves of Shea/Cocoa through my kitchen.  </li>
            <li> Shea butter has a strong scent.</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter is nice and soft, has a nice scent, and is easy to work with.</li>
            <li> I use it as an eye cream, the fine lines have diminished.</li>
            <li> Shipped quick!</li>
            <li> I am not familiar with shea butter, so I don&#x27;t know how to tell if this is great quality or not, but it feels nice...</li>
            <li> Both are smooth and feel great when mixed into my body butters!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Came in bags that blocks out the light and reseals.</li>
            <li> The best of this product since I have been buying these products for the past 5 years</li>
            <li> I would not use cocoa butter on my face because it does have a pretty high comedogenic rating and will clog your pores, but it works good in hand creams, foot creams, lip balms, body butters and cuticle creams.</li>
            <li> I would not use cocoa butter on my face because it does have a pretty high comedogenic rating and will clog your pores, but it works good in hand creams, foot creams, lip balms, body butters and cuticle creams.</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter smells just like a dark chocolate bar and feels so good!  </li>
            <li> Oh and tasted exactly right!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t yet determine if I was given a whole pound, but it sure feels like it.</li>
            <li> The Cocoa butter is to die for but the shea butter was very gritty and didnt not feel good on my skin.</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter really does smell like chocolate :)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on harsh sunburns and it makes them go away and turn into a tan at an incredible rate, virtually overnight.</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter is unrefined and good quality but weighed only 15 oz&#x27;s (I paid for a full pound).</li>
            <li> Now I can make  the gift of an amazing lotion for my neighbors who finally got pregnant after years of trying!</li>
            <li> I am more than satisfied with my purchase and plan to continue using this product as long at it is available to purchase.</li>
            <li> Both are clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and was just as advertised.  </li>
            <li> High quality and love the way they make my skin feel.</li>
            <li> This will last one person a really long time, and the results are wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased so far!</li>
            <li> I ordered Shea and cocoa butter and got exactly what I ordered!</li>
            <li> I got great customer service and got exactly what I had expected!</li>
            <li> It came packaged very well and measured out accurately.  </li>
            <li> Fresh and well packaged.  </li>
            <li> The orange smells especially yummy; keep in mind that these ingredients add a bit of fragrance on their own, too.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> The products are fresh and that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> - I cant wait to make natural body butter :)</li>
            <li> the price was right.  </li>
            <li> works ok for lotions but has strong smell and very greenish yellow color.</li>
            <li> Just as expected, great natural product!</li>
            <li> and I swear if there ever was a true miracle cream that could really multitask it would be Shea butter.</li>
            <li> but that was probably my fault for heating them in the crockpot on warm for too long.</li>
            <li> I liked that there were some smaller bits along with the large chunks.</li>
            <li> There has been prior reviews about the quality and packaging, mine was good quality and professional packaging</li>
            <li> Got the products very fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for solid lotion bars and love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Shea butter on several batches of body butter and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I think I would prefer a more refined product and next time I will purchase one!  </li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> so I couldn&#x27;t tell there were two bags at first, but there was.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Both smelled exactly as they should.</li>
            <li> It measured out pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Zip lock the rest, place the bag in individual plastic containers and freeze til I need some more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Most local health food/beauty stores want almost 20$ a pound for these butters.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the butters!</li>
            <li> Excellent for my my entire familly, including my soon to be newbor baby, I use natural oils cut with olive oil on all my kids when they were newbies, not one diaper rash, cradle cap, or typical baby bumbs yet, and I also add the shea butter to my hair moisturizing products.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much this is my second order.</li>
            <li> The shea butter is a little grainy, but other then that they were excellent for the price .</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and arrived fast.</li>
            <li> Once the oils were completely melted, I removed the bowl from the stove and let cool for about 30 minutes, then I added the vegetable glycerine.</li>
            <li> Smartly packaged.</li>
            <li> very dissatisfied</li>
            <li> and I warn everyone who wants to take a chance with this product because it&#x27;s not usable in any form..........buyer BEWARE</li>
            <li> its packaged really well, no spills or anything.</li>
            <li> It applies fantastically and melts very well.</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter is what I really wanted.</li>
            <li> I really have a mind block against body products that smell like food (cinnamon bun, vanilla, etc.)</li>
            <li> The packaging was very unprofessional.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing it again very soon.</li>
            <li> The Shea butter I received today smells like petroleum jelly and is very whipped and refined.  </li>
            <li> I made a citrus &amp; honey soap with it and it turned out very well.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to order this very product every time I need cocoa butter and Shea</li>
            <li> I will continue to order this very product every time I need cocoa butter and Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I really would buy again.</li>
            <li> Really a necessity for customer to verify they are getting what was ordered.  </li>
            <li> The only downfall is that it is raw so they still remain some unwanted particles..but would purchase again great deal</li>
            <li> and they offered to send me a whole new unit of cocoa butter at no charge for their mistake!</li>
            <li> and they offered to send me a whole new unit of cocoa butter at no charge for their mistake!</li>
            <li> I make my own body butter with this, melting the cocoa butter, mixing in the shea butter, pure olive oil and an all natural herbal lotion or other natural oils and herbs.</li>
            <li> love the shea butter for my hands, helps with the excess washing I do as a nurse, would recommend this to any one if you don&#x27;t melting the product down</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on the quality of my products, and it&#x27;s mostly due to this source!</li>
            <li> Will definitely be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> I have been able to make luxurious batches of my lotions for next to nothing financially.  </li>
            <li> Cocoa butter appears to be of decent quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> High quality shea butter and cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> When it arrived it smelled so FRESH, shea butter was so yellow and moiste, my skin craves it.</li>
            <li> The smell the same and the brick on the right is softer.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when buying it raw.</li>
            <li> It keeps them very soft.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping-- arrived in only five days.</li>
            <li> I heated it up and added some favorite oils like vitamin e and coconut to make it softer and then poured the mixture in small mason jars.</li>
            <li> I first tried to refrigerate it for a hour, when it didn&#x27;t solid</li>
            <li> I scooped some into a jar with another brand of Shea butter and the consistency is pretty identical even though the color is different.</li>
            <li> maybe a little sticky at first but smooths right in the skin.  </li>
            <li> Each once was just in a clear ziplock</li>
            <li> and then they were both put into another clear bag.</li>
            <li> I put it in my lotion recipes and has made my skin feel silky soft.</li>
            <li> Using it to make natural skincare products.  </li>
            <li> The shea butter was nowhere near unrefined shea butter.</li>
            <li> it was soft.</li>
            <li> I starting to question if these products were the real deal.</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t use much, just worked it into the ends and left it on overnight)</li>
            <li> Makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> Packaging was not labeled or marked.  </li>
            <li> The next product that I&#x27;m going to buy from plant guru is their African black soap, so hopefully I will be able to write another review soon.</li>
            <li> the only thing that I didn&#x27;t care for was the high s&amp;h  price.</li>
            <li> This was exactly as pictured, and worked as I expected it to in an oil, beeswax, and fragrance balm recipe.</li>
            <li> Where I live I can only buy shea butter, which I don&#x27;t like as much.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Shea butter is yellow, unfortunately, but it&#x27;s still really good quality.</li>
            <li> chunks n shea butter came as a solid piece but because its so soft some of it did stick to the bag.</li>
            <li> Thinking of ordering this combo again in the near future...</li>
            <li> I use it to heal cuts, abrasions and rashes fast with minimal scarring.</li>
            <li> It works just as well as any other I&#x27;ve tried, including the ones that cost 1 1/2 times to twice as much.</li>
            <li> It is very oily and buttery when you melt it onto your skin, and extremely moisturizing but greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried to introducing cocoa butter to several of my other friends  but because it&#x27;s different they are not to hot on the idea of using</li>
            <li> it was easy to break down and ohhsooo aromatic!!!!</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter has an amazingly delicious chocolate smell and the raw shea does not have a bad odor as I have heard it sometimes does.  </li>
            <li> They have a strong cocoa odor and are raw with particles and specks of black within the butters.  </li>
            <li> For this brand in particular, The one I got is pale beige to white in color.</li>
            <li> very stong raw odor.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappoint because I specifically wanted raw unrefined Shea butter.  </li>
            <li> They didnt last very long when making my products</li>
            <li> It feels very grainy and soft as opposed to the other firmer, raw shea butters I&#x27;ve purchased from other sellers.</li>
            <li> $20 for a pound of pure cocoa butter and a pound of Shea butter is hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The harder on is yellow.</li>
            <li> It is in a raw state - chunks in a sealed bag, It needs to be gently melted to mix with other ingredients.</li>
            <li> It came in a long, wide black plastic container with a clear lid.</li>
            <li> It is unprofessionally packed in a standard black takeout food container and the cocoa butter is packed in a standard kitchen ziplock baggy.</li>
            <li> I mixed with other oils thatsvwhat I use for my body</li>
            <li> My skin was no longer dry.</li>
            <li> I finally take the shea butter out and parts of the package is missing almost like they cut the bag open purposely.</li>
            <li> I use it as a hand cream every night which doubles as a cuticle cream, on my dry feet under socks, if I have patches of very dry skin, on a scab or healing blemish, as a soothing balm on shaving rashes, for chapped lips, to prevent stretch marks, on my acne prone face if it gets dry</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter came in hard ivory piece and the Shea butter was soft and a dark yellow color.</li>
            <li> It was not properly sealed my product is all over the place this is mess, never again.</li>
            <li> I could imagine it would have been a big mess in the Florida heat.  </li>
            <li> It is very hard and you really need to melt it before using it.</li>
            <li> In other words my hands are really dry.</li>
            <li> Bags were a little smaller than i expected but whatever</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Both came promptly in unprocessed blocks just as advertised.</li>
            <li> It smells heavenly, though I separated it into batches and added a few drops of different LorAnn oils (lorAnn.com) to each one.</li>
            <li> The color was a pale yellow when finished</li>
            <li> Product comes in plastic bags so transfer to a sturdier container will be necessary to avoid mess and waste.</li>
            <li> Each actually weighed in at a few grams OVER a pound!</li>
            <li> When I took them out they were melted and had leeked onto each other.</li>
            <li> May require adding other scents/fragrances to balance the cocoa.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was the combination between the oils or if the Shea butter had a yellow dye add to it.</li>
            <li> any other&#x27;s that I saw.</li>
            <li> It works just as well as the other two brands Ive tried.</li>
            <li> I ordered raw Shea and Cocoa Butter and received the Shea butter but got the African Black soap instead</li>
            <li> They both seemed to be the same color and the only way I could tell the Cocoa Butter from the Shea Butter was because Cocoa Butter usually feels really hard.</li>
            <li> When the cream hardened it was&lt;br /&gt;much too hard even though essential oils were introduced.</li>
            <li> Not only did this product arrive 2 days late, buy it was all melted and leaking out the box.</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter was good quality but the shea is DISGUSTINGLY GARBAGE.....</li>
            <li> I melt the both of these items down and add olive oil and organic coconut oil to it.</li>
            <li> After the mixture had cooled down it no longer had that smell.</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter had a slight odor that didn&#x27;t agree with my allergies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black and</li>
            <li> Packaging was just as other reviewers stated plain plastic baggy.</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter was a little overpowering, but I like the smell of chocolate.  </li>
            <li> I was thrown off a little at the packaging</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very pleased with the quality of the shea butter.</li>
            <li> Melt in the microwave for a few seconds for use.</li>
            <li> Which is a waste of my product.</li>
            <li> I was super stoked when I ordered this, but once I recieved it I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very odd</li>
            <li> they are in chunks I am not sure if they would fill the 16oz container in aother form( melted)</li>
            <li> The company that I ordered from was Plant guru, and they have a small businesses online.</li>
            <li> I strained the oil in a cheese cloth and then placed the oil in a small glass jar.</li>
            <li> Raw, unrefined stock!</li>
            <li> the cocoa butter is hard and in chunks...</li>
            <li> And this one was hard as a rock.</li>
            <li> My skin sucks them up.</li>
            <li> i mean covered in shea butter.</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter that I received is hard and difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> I just would have preferred they came in containers as opposed to thin plastic storage bags.</li>
            <li> Then the side of it was cracked and the broken plastic was embedded in the cut shea butter.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe there was anything wrong with the product it just doesn&#x27;t agree with me.</li>
            <li> so I was unable to identify them until keeping them stored separately  (which is not what I planned)</li>
            <li> The oils had a weird smell to it.</li>
            <li> Unable to mash with a fork to make creamy mix.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was blown away by their customer service and promptness in dealing with the problem.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was blown away by their customer service and promptness in dealing with the problem.</li>
            <li> I have never left a horrible review before and this is one I had to emphasize on how horrible the product was.....</li>
            <li> One out of two isnt so bad i guess.</li>
            <li> My husband and my family go crazy over this stuff!</li>
            <li> So unhappy!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Amazon!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The shea butter was very clean. My hands are always in water. It keeps them very soft. Love the smell of the coca butter. I made my own mix with the Shea butter. And cocoa butter. Its great,</li>
            <li> I ordered raw Shea and Cocoa Butter and received the Shea butter but got the African Black soap instead I don&#x27;t know what to do with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess I&#x27;ll be experimenting.</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter was good quality but the shea is DISGUSTINGLY GARBAGE.....I have never left a horrible review before and this is one I had to emphasize on how horrible the product was.....the shea was the scrapings from the bottom of their PROCESSED shea butter....grainy and Orange not yellow but orange in color.....very dissatisfied and I warn everyone who wants to take a chance with this product because it&#x27;s not usable in any form..........buyer BEWARE</li>
            <li> I purchased this to make my own whipped body butter.  In my opinion, it was packaged well and was as described in terms of the product weight.  I also did not experience any problems with melting and didn&#x27;t find find them to grainy or low quality at all.  I am more than satisfied with my purchase and plan to continue using this product as long at it is available to purchase.</li>
            <li> My package just came yesterday i opened it today and i see a plastic back. I take the bag out its cover i mean covered in shea butter. I open the bag and the cocoa butter is on top in a separate package. But that too is covered in shea butter. I finally take the shea butter out and parts of the package is missing almost like they cut the bag open purposely. It was not properly sealed my product is all over the place this is mess, never again.</li>
            <li> I recommend this products to DIY lotion makers!! The only downfall is that it is raw so they still remain some unwanted particles..but would purchase again great deal</li>
            <li> Came in 2 seperate 16oz buckets. Makes it easy to store and use. the cocoa butter is hard and in chunks... the shea butter is the same but easier to melt.&lt;br /&gt;because they are in chunks I am not sure if they would fill the 16oz container in aother form( melted)</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great product</li>
            <li> for sure, the  butters were great! I did have to put them through a cheesecloth to do away with some of nature&#x27;s elements (i.e.- shells and such). However, it smelled fresh and feels great!</li>
            <li> I ordered mine for $19.99 from EXTREMEK and its so lovely!! its packaged really well, no spills or anything. The shea butter came wrapped in a paper that felt similar to wax, then packaged in the zip-lock style bag, which I thought was wonderful. I can&#x27;t yet determine if I was given a whole pound, but it sure feels like it. The cocoa butter smells amazing! melts easy, applies well. Shea butter is yellow, unfortunately, but it&#x27;s still really good quality. It applies fantastically and melts very well.</li>
            <li> My package was delivered nicely. I got to say as soon as i got homeI made a recipe with these two. I love that even as I type I still feel moisturized. This beats the body shops body butter. Smells like Palmers Cocoa butter. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> One of the containers had a split in the side!</li>
            <li> The smell the same and the brick on the right is softer. I am told by the QandAs that the softer one is Shea but it&#x27;s not yellow. The harder on is yellow. Which is which?!?!</li>
            <li> This is the best, bought from someone else, didn&#x27;t care for it. Can&#x27;t go wrong with Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> The Cocoa butter is to die for but the shea butter was very gritty and didnt not feel good on my skin. One out of two isnt so bad i guess.</li>
            <li> Ok I guessed. Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when buying it raw.</li>
            <li> Love love love it..i use the Shea butter for my hair..on my face for wrinkles,  my lips..there are so many uses.  The cocoa butter smells amazing..it&#x27;s a hefty amount so it will last an eternity. Would def recommend and would purchase it again. You may want to put  butters in separate tupperware containers. Melt in the microwave for a few seconds for use. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Good stuff!  It came packaged very well and measured out accurately.  This is where I will get my shea and cocoa butter in the future!</li>
            <li> This is really great stuff!  I&#x27;ve been using it for solid lotion bars and love it.  The cocoa butter has an amazingly delicious chocolate smell and the raw shea does not have a bad odor as I have heard it sometimes does.  The packaging is really nice and is reseal-able.</li>
            <li> Great for diy projects. Very fresh! Shipped quick!</li>
            <li> The cocoa smells great and both are perfect to use as moisturizers. The regular body heat melts them as you rub them on, or you can put them in the bath.</li>
            <li> I bought this a while ago and I just love this product. It&#x27;s great for my skin. Buying again in the future. The quality of both products were amazing!</li>
            <li> This was a great deal. I combined both and made a body cream for my family</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product.  Packaging was just as other reviewers stated plain plastic baggy. Didn&#x27;t seem to hurt the product in any way but had I not been home to collect the box at delivery I could imagine it would have been a big mess in the Florida heat.  I&#x27;ve used the Shea butter on several batches of body butter and will be ordering more. The cocoa butter had a slight odor that didn&#x27;t agree with my allergies. I don&#x27;t believe there was anything wrong with the product it just doesn&#x27;t agree with me.</li>
            <li> The product itself is good but it arrived in a cracked plastic container. Overall good value though!</li>
            <li> Great products. They came in zip top bags and smelled fantastic, just like chocolate. Worked great in the lotion I made.</li>
            <li> This deal was too good to pass up.  It is very important for me to get the best price for Cocoa and Shea Butters especially since the price range is extreme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im very happy with the products for my soapmaking and homemade beauty products.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping-- arrived in only five days. A lot of product of the price; this is a VERY good deal! Will definitely be ordering more in the future. Product comes in plastic bags so transfer to a sturdier container will be necessary to avoid mess and waste.</li>
            <li> very stong raw odor.  I bought to make soaps and cosmetic products with these butters.  They have a strong cocoa odor and are raw with particles and specks of black within the butters.  I think I would prefer a more refined product and next time I will purchase one!  Just not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have only used the cocoa butter but I love how it smells. I heated it up and added some favorite oils like vitamin e and coconut to make it softer and then poured the mixture in small mason jars. It firmed up to a softer consistency and now I use everyday on my whole body.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.  Two bags, one with Cocoa butter, one with shea butter.  Excellent for homemade lotions and more.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed to make my body butters and at a great price! Both smell wonderful. I liked that there were some smaller bits along with the large chunks. Made it easier when I was making smaller batches of test products.</li>
            <li> Great natural products ,using them to make my own lotions and soaps</li>
            <li> It was great! And yes they smell. But all unrefined does. Made lotions and I love them. No they don&#x27;t come labeled but it&#x27;s easy to tell which is which. Will order again.</li>
            <li> After a Pinterest frenzy I decided to try my hand making my own beauty products. Scanned Amazon and came upon this item. It came in really nice sturdy packaging, was fresh and easy to work with. I&#x27;m pleased so far!</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter is what I really wanted. Where I live I can only buy shea butter, which I don&#x27;t like as much.&lt;br /&gt;I sent the combo to my friend she LOVES them both.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried to introducing cocoa butter to several of my other friends  but because it&#x27;s different they are not to hot on the idea of using it.&lt;br /&gt;This combo will last me for a while.</li>
            <li> This was the best decision I have made! I decided to stop putting chemicals in mine and my daughter&#x27;s hair. I melt the both of these items down and add olive oil and organic coconut oil to it. I mix it in a mixer and it turns into the softest moisturizing lotion for hair and body! My husband and my family go crazy over this stuff!</li>
            <li> I Loved this purchase. It went a lot further than we thought to make lotions, butters and soaps. It was a good quality for that purpose and we really enjoyed the process of cosmetic making. The customers we sold to love it so much that they requested more!</li>
            <li> This is the best deal and quality I have found for a cocoa butter/shea butter combo.  I made my own body butters and retail them at a local shop, these whip great!</li>
            <li> Great quality products!  The cocoa butter smells amazing!  the shea butter is so silky and great for my homemade creams.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with my shea and cocoa butter. Both came promptly in unprocessed blocks just as advertised. They were each in their own plastic bag. Each actually weighed in at a few grams OVER a pound!</li>
            <li> The Shea butter is sticky and doesn&#x27;t react like any shea butter I&#x27;ve ever used before. Once melted it won&#x27;t harden again. Very odd</li>
            <li> Good. Just need to double sack it because it leaked out allot by the time I got it. Which isn&#x27;t companies fault. It rode in a fedex truck in 105 degree weather.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted. Each butter came in a separate plastic bag and coco butter was double baged. Coco butter came in chunks n shea butter came as a solid piece but because its so soft some of it did stick to the bag. Great for making your own body butter.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as described.  Fresh and well packaged.  I have been using it to make my own lotions and body butter.  Adds a wonderful chocolate smell with the cocoa butter that seems strong at first but once it soaks into the skin is gone.  Combined with the healing properties of the Shea Butter I have been able to make luxurious batches of my lotions for next to nothing financially.  Great buy and as soon as I need more I will be contacting this vendor again!</li>
            <li> Awesome quality. I just would have preferred they came in containers as opposed to thin plastic storage bags. Besides that, I love it.</li>
            <li> This product was perfect for making homemade gifts during the holidays! Came in bags that blocks out the light and reseals. Very nice since I didn&#x27;t use it all up yet. The two bags were wrapped up together so I couldn&#x27;t tell there were two bags at first, but there was.</li>
            <li> I have not had a chance to use it for lotion yet but I like the packaging, two zip-top bags. The cocoa butter smells amazing! I really have a mind block against body products that smell like food (cinnamon bun, vanilla, etc.) but this cocoa butter made me want to bathe in it! Looking forward to making these products.</li>
            <li> This is a great combo. I needed both shea and cocoa butter to make some lotion, and this is high-quality product. They are in resealable bags so storage is easy. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> If you order from Practical Magic, then you will be satisfied! I got great customer service and got exactly what I had expected! Cocoa butter smells amazing! Now I can make  the gift of an amazing lotion for my neighbors who finally got pregnant after years of trying!</li>
            <li> Great deal! Nice products! The cocoa butter smells amazing &amp; the Shea is perfect too! Shipping was prompt!</li>
            <li> I was super stoked when I ordered this, but once I recieved it I was disappointed. The packaging was very unprofessional. Each once was just in a clear ziplock and then they were both put into another clear bag. When I took them out they were melted and had leeked onto each other. The products themselves are good. The shea butter is a little grainy, but other then that they were excellent for the price .</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!!!!  The cocoa butter really does smell like chocolate :)  I use both of these products in CP soap and they work perfectly.  Thank you for offering them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> High quality shea butter and cocoa butter. I put it in my lotion recipes and has made my skin feel silky soft.</li>
            <li> The best of this product since I have been buying these products for the past 5 years</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, completely raw/natural and unrefined.  Using it to make natural skincare products.  the smell is so strong, even opening the bag will send waves of Shea/Cocoa through my kitchen.  I get so many compliments on the quality of my products, and it&#x27;s mostly due to this source!</li>
            <li> Not only did this product arrive 2 days late, buy it was all melted and leaking out the box.</li>
            <li> Best I have bought, good product and excellent price......Thanks!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product... They smell awesome and the fact that its a combo at the price it is makes it even greater... Thinking of ordering this combo again in the near future...</li>
            <li> Product was delivered promptly.  I used it to make body butter as a Christmas gift, and it came out great.  The cocoa butter was a little overpowering, but I like the smell of chocolate.  May require adding other scents/fragrances to balance the cocoa.  I would recommend this product to others.  I will be purchasing it again very soon.</li>
            <li> Great for DIYs!  Good product!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and arrived fast.</li>
            <li> This came with Shea and coco butter... I have not used my Shea but I love the coco butter so far....makes wonderful lip balm and hand lotion...it smells very strong in the bag but when you use it the scent is perfect.</li>
            <li> The Shea butter I received today smells like petroleum jelly and is very whipped and refined.  It is unprofessionally packed in a standard black takeout food container and the cocoa butter is packed in a standard kitchen ziplock baggy. I am very disappoint because I specifically wanted raw unrefined Shea butter.  The cocoa butter is unrefined and good quality but weighed only 15 oz&#x27;s (I paid for a full pound). I will return this product and will not order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> They smelled amazing. A lil grainy after melting but that was probably my fault for heating them in the crockpot on warm for too long. They didnt last very long when making my products b/c i loved the smell so much. I have found a better supplier since this purchase but these are recommended still.</li>
            <li> This was junk! The shea butter was nowhere near unrefined shea butter. I would not EVER recommend this. Not to mention the shea butter was put into a plastic microwave container that you would receive from a  to go order at a restaurant. Then the side of it was cracked and the broken plastic was embedded in the cut shea butter. The mango butter was in a bag that looks like it is covered with mango butter all over the inside. Which is a waste of my product. I would never purchase again. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the picture of shea butter because it does not look like that from this purchaser! Its cut! So unhappy!😡</li>
            <li> I like the product but neither bar is labeled so I was unable to identify them until keeping them stored separately  (which is not what I planned)</li>
            <li> Was very pleased..product is awesome...will be ordering from you again soon..thank you...</li>
            <li> This was exactly as pictured, and worked as I expected it to in an oil, beeswax, and fragrance balm recipe. It smells heavenly, though I separated it into batches and added a few drops of different LorAnn oils (lorAnn.com) to each one. Lemon, orange and cinnamon are what I started with. The orange smells especially yummy; keep in mind that these ingredients add a bit of fragrance on their own, too.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t use a lot in comparison to the oil (4 oz) and beeswax (2 oz), about an ounce of each. This will last one person a really long time, and the results are wonderful. Keep in mind that these will both add a bit of color; my mix was a creamy yellow. If you want white products, these may not be what you need.</li>
            <li> Got the products very fast. High quality and love the way they make my skin feel. My skin sucks them up. Not a greasy product. I love the smell of the cocoa butter. Shea butter has a strong scent. I&#x27;ve been trying different things to cover the smell. I wish the seller would drop a note to give some info on how to help cover the Oder thing with the Shea. The products are fresh and that&#x27;s a plus. I will order again and recomemd to others that it is a fair product for the price and quality. Well packaged. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I received my butters today. They came on schedule  which is always a plus. I would have preferred the butters to be labeled. They both seemed to be the same color and the only way I could tell the Cocoa Butter from the Shea Butter was because Cocoa Butter usually feels really hard. And this one was hard as a rock. Because they were in the same package they both smelled like the Cocoa Butter.</li>
            <li> Just as expected, great natural product! Used it for body butter and shave cream!</li>
            <li> Like the product but I do not know which one is which. They just put one in a container and another in a bag. Wish they would label the product</li>
            <li> I love this product so much this is my second order. I bought to share with my sister because she never used it before.  I like the quality of both of the products and the price was right.  Not over price. I have been referring people to this seller. It is awesome.</li>
            <li> Great quality shea and cocoa butter. It is in a raw state - chunks in a sealed bag, It needs to be gently melted to mix with other ingredients. It could be filtered too if you wish but I have not found any debris in this order. Both are clean and fresh. The cocoa butter smells just fantastic! My whole room is filled with the delicious cocoa butter smell. Both are smooth and feel great when mixed into my body butters!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy from them again!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best product I ever bought from Amazon. My job requires me to work around food all the time. I have to wash my hands about a thousand times a day and wear plastic food gloves. In other words my hands are really dry. I thought that I would give this a try. The company that I ordered from was Plant guru, and they have a small businesses online. The Shea and cocoa butter came in a box with the Shea and cocoa butter package in individual plastic bags. The cocoa butter came in hard ivory piece and the Shea butter was soft and a dark yellow color. I combined the Shea butter and cocoa butter with coconut oil and vegetable glycerine together. On low heat I used the double boiler method. Once the oils were completely melted, I removed the bowl from the stove and let cool for about 30 minutes, then I added the vegetable glycerine. I strained the oil in a cheese cloth and then placed the oil in a small glass jar. I first tried to refrigerate it for a hour, when it didn&#x27;t solid I place it in the freezer for about 20 minutes. The mixture did get solid like coconut oil, but after it reach room temperature it was soft. I starting to question if these products were the real deal. I decided to use it and after two days I could see a big difference. My skin was no longer dry. The only problem I had with this product was when melting it. The oils had a weird smell to it. I&#x27;m not sure if it was the combination between the oils or if the Shea butter had a yellow dye add to it. After the mixture had cooled down it no longer had that smell. I have used now Shea butter and and Ah Shayh whipped Shea with Sonoma grape seed oil. Both are good products but they take longer to moisturize.The next product that I&#x27;m going to buy from plant guru is their African black soap, so hopefully I will be able to write another review soon.</li>
            <li> This product came in great, re-sealable packaging.  Product smelt great and looked great - I cant wait to make natural body butter :)</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter is nice and soft, has a nice scent, and is easy to work with. The Shea Butter that I received is hard and difficult to work with. Unable to mash with a fork to make creamy mix. Needed to melt it to make it serviceable.When the cream hardened it was&lt;br /&gt;much too hard even though essential oils were introduced.</li>
            <li> I ordered Shea and cocoa butter and got exactly what I ordered! Raw, unrefined stock! Both smelled exactly as they should. Nutty and chocolaty! You won&#x27;t be disappointed! Oh and tasted exactly right! lol</li>
            <li> Great Product and a good value for soapers!</li>
            <li> it came on time and both the products smelt so good!  the price was  better then any other&#x27;s that I saw. the only thing that I didn&#x27;t care for was the high s&amp;h  price. I  have already told my niece about this product!</li>
            <li> This has my skin glowing. I like to use it when I get out of the shower bec your body will absorb it better.</li>
            <li> I am not familiar with shea butter, so I don&#x27;t know how to tell if this is great quality or not, but it feels nice...maybe a little sticky at first but smooths right in the skin.  The cocoa butter smells just like a dark chocolate bar and feels so good!  I bought these for use in body butters, but will probably use the cocoa butter on its own as well.</li>
            <li> I used this shea butter this last weekend for making homemade soap.  It arrived in a shatter-proof jar.  It measured out pretty well.  I should have placed it in the microwave for about 30 seconds to soften it.  I made a citrus &amp; honey soap with it and it turned out very well.  The color was a pale yellow when finished so I didn&#x27;t have to add any color to the recipe.  I would recommend this for anyone making their own soap.</li>
            <li> This was an awesome buy for me! I ordered this because I was making my own body butter it was easy to break down and ohhsooo aromatic!!!!</li>
            <li> I make my own body butter with this, melting the cocoa butter, mixing in the shea butter, pure olive oil and an all natural herbal lotion or other natural oils and herbs. Zip lock the rest, place the bag in individual plastic containers and freeze til I need some more. Excellent for my my entire familly, including my soon to be newbor baby, I use natural oils cut with olive oil on all my kids when they were newbies, not one diaper rash, cradle cap, or typical baby bumbs yet, and I also add the shea butter to my hair moisturizing products. When it arrived it smelled so FRESH, shea butter was so yellow and moiste, my skin craves it. Lol, a friend of mines picked my kids up and began hugging and sniffing all over them exclaiming how she wanted to eat my kids up because they smelled so chocolatey!!! I&#x27;m black and she&#x27;s white so I thought that was cute since they smell how they look. Excellent product that last like forever!</li>
            <li> Everything was great n on time.</li>
            <li> I was thrown off a little at the packaging but overall I am very happy with it and can not wait to use it. The Cocoa Butte smells AMAZING! I could even smell it through the packaging :D</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and was just as advertised.  Used in my body butter and they melted and whipped together perfectly.  Wonderful smell and good packaging.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> I used these for my own lotion and they worked great!  I love the way it smells too.  I had no issues with it when warming it up or when it cooled back down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I have used these items on  hair and skin. My family enjoys the incredible smoothness and unscented Shea butter.  The cocoa butter is also great for the body . I mix it with  the Shea and olive oil also for scalp massaging.</li>
            <li> works ok for lotions but has strong smell and very greenish yellow color.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality cocoa butter and Shea butter for a very nice price. I have ordered several different sellers&#x27; Shea butter and they all seem to be a slightly different consistency. It works just as well as any other I&#x27;ve tried, including the ones that cost 1 1/2 times to twice as much. I use Shea butter for literally EVERYTHING. I use it to heal cuts, abrasions and rashes fast with minimal scarring. I&#x27;ve used it on harsh sunburns and it makes them go away and turn into a tan at an incredible rate, virtually overnight. I use it as an eye cream, the fine lines have diminished. I use it as a hand cream every night which doubles as a cuticle cream, on my dry feet under socks, if I have patches of very dry skin, on a scab or healing blemish, as a soothing balm on shaving rashes, for chapped lips, to prevent stretch marks, on my acne prone face if it gets dry (and it amazingly does not make me break out--it is rated zero on the comedogenic scale) I&#x27;ve used it in my hair as a moisturizing mask (I didn&#x27;t use much, just worked it into the ends and left it on overnight) and I swear if there ever was a true miracle cream that could really multitask it would be Shea butter. If I could only buy one lotion or face cream it would be Shea butter for sure. For this brand in particular, The one I got is pale beige to white in color. It came in a long, wide black plastic container with a clear lid. I scooped some into a jar with another brand of Shea butter and the consistency is pretty identical even though the color is different. It works just as well as the other two brands Ive tried. What makes this one great is the price! $20 for a pound of pure cocoa butter and a pound of Shea butter is hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As for the cocoa butter, it smells AMAZING. Mine came in a square mold shape in a ziplock bag inside a sealed silver bag. It is very hard and you really need to melt it before using it. It is very oily and buttery when you melt it onto your skin, and extremely moisturizing but greasy feeling. I would not use cocoa butter on my face because it does have a pretty high comedogenic rating and will clog your pores, but it works good in hand creams, foot creams, lip balms, body butters and cuticle creams. Mine weighed in at 1.5 oz short and I contacted the seller (Aspen Naturals) and they offered to send me a whole new unit of cocoa butter at no charge for their mistake! Needless to say I was blown away by their customer service and promptness in dealing with the problem. I will continue to order this very product every time I need cocoa butter and Shea butter.but greasy feeling.

            <li> I love the products! I really would buy again. The packaging was great, and it held up to what I thought.</li>
            <li> Use it to make lotion love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very pleased with the quality of the shea butter. It feels very grainy and soft as opposed to the other firmer, raw shea butters I&#x27;ve purchased from other sellers. Cocoa butter appears to be of decent quality.</li>
            <li> holds up to expectations: nice an pure Cocoa and shea butter perfect for making your own cosmetics. nothing more to it. Bags were a little smaller than i expected but whatever</li>
            <li> Most local health food/beauty stores want almost 20$ a pound for these butters. Glad to find it so reasonably priced and to get both in a combo is great! It came sealed in a plastic bag, would&#x27;ve like to see it in a tub, but that&#x27;s just preference.</li>
            <li> bought this for my daughters baby belly, loved cocoa butter when I was pregnant and this was an excellent deal. love the shea butter for my hands, helps with the excess washing I do as a nurse, would recommend this to any one if you don&#x27;t melting the product down</li>
            <li> I used both to make whiped body butter. Cocoa butter smells so good. The batch i made from the shea butter i put vannila scent in and smells just like a cupcake. Makes your skin so soft. My kids love it and it makes a great gift ideal.</li>
            <li> Packaging was not labeled or marked.  Really a necessity for customer to verify they are getting what was ordered.  Product seems ok for what its intended purpose is.</li>
            <li> There has been prior reviews about the quality and packaging, mine was good quality and professional packaging like I would expect from a store. Will definitely order again! Thanks for the butters!</li>
            <li> Shea butter has a very low melting point. It came just as pictured. If it was summer I would appreciate a plastic take out container since it melts when touched. Loved it and will buy it again. The best price I could find anywhere!</li>
            <li> Smartly packaged. Definitely would recommend to a friend. Smells good and so fresh. Will buy again  I mixed with other oils thatsvwhat I use for my body</li>
