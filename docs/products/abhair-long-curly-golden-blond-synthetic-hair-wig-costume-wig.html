            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect length, except it tangles easily.</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t look good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn this wig as is, with a beanie, and as braided pigtails, and all 3 ways looked very cute and not wig-like at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Buy with confidence - came quickly - great product for one night or many.</li>
            <li>I really love it!</li>
            <li>My grand daughter wanted to wear it!  </li>
            <li>I love this wig!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than Halloween wigs from department stores though! ^^</li>
            <li>Looks amazing for $10</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light ,and I feel so happy, wearing it...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m unsure of why this wig has many good reviews.</li>
            <li>My daughter and grand daughter loved it...</li>
            <li>It was perfect for my outfit, and I had people ask me if it was my real hair.</li>
            <li>It stays on your head nicely with no movement.</li>
            <li>I have not received the wig yet but looks like it will be a nice wig.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something fun and a good price, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>If it does tangle, it is very easy to brush through.</li>
            <li>Brushes out very easily..</li>
            <li>It worked very nicely for my cosplay, and everyone was amazed that it wasn&#x27;t real hair!</li>
            <li>I know I really love it..</li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t had that many wigs</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not awful!  </li>
            <li>my daughter is 28 and my grand daughter 3.  </li>
            <li>, they thought it was more extensions.</li>
            <li>Maybe it would look better on someone else.</li>
            <li>I have just received this wig, and I have to say that the quality is great and it does feel like real hair.</li>
            <li>The picture makes it look very natural and beautiful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bangs are long and perfect for sweeping to one side, which is how I like it, but you could also trim them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is an elastic strap on the inside that makes it easy to keep the wig on your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Is my favorite wig, of all my wigs, right now!</li>
            <li>The curves of the hair is beautiful and the color is a little bit darker, but it still looks nice.</li>
            <li>and I keep them pinned to the side which works fine.</li>
            <li>I am wearing it every day, and it is so comfortable..  </li>
            <li>I have naturally light to medium brown hair</li>
            <li>,I have light to medium beige skin and woof, this color was not how it appeared online</li>
            <li>This wig is easy to clean and comb.</li>
            <li>Putting it in water helps very much :)</li>
            <li>This is the first wig I ever bought, and I&#x27;m so glad I chose this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Originally the shipping was estimated for 4 weeks but arrived in 5 days.</li>
            <li>Definetely worth the money!</li>
            <li>Even after 6 hours of hard wear, it still looked perfect.  </li>
            <li>no no no - BAD.  </li>
            <li>It looks very natural, with warm golden and strawberry tones.</li>
            <li>but, I have fine hair, so it looks more natural.</li>
            <li>I wore it out for a night to &#x27;test drive&#x27; it before I had to wear it to a costuming event and it was comfortable and due to the straps in the back for perfect fit, it didn&#x27;t slide off.  </li>
            <li>In reality it was extremely obvious that it was a wig, and looked pretty goofy instead of elegant.</li>
            <li>The colour is the same as the picture if you&#x27;re in natural or bright light.</li>
            <li>Its not overly shiny especially after a wash and the curls hold up AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Such a nice deal.</li>
            <li>This wig is so soft and bouncy, I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>it feels like clean healthy human hair!</li>
            <li>It looks real and is a good idea to get if you are thinking about dying your hair blonde but want an idea of what it will look like first.</li>
            <li>I looked all over amazon for the right wig.</li>
            <li>This wig for me was the right one.</li>
            <li>Extremely comfortable and realistic for the price.</li>
            <li>I bought 3 wigs in the past month and this is by far the best one.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and much better than many other wigs I have had, felt like real hair!</li>
            <li>The color is darker than it shows, on the pictures.., more of a strawberry darker blonde,</li>
            <li>I pulled this out of the bag, and immediately was struck by the softness and the very bouncy curls!</li>
            <li>My friends and family say it looks real, not like a wig, at all!</li>
            <li>I used this for a Pepper Potts costume for Motor City Comic Con.</li>
            <li>This is my first wig.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It can get hot</li>
            <li>, its not going to be totally perfect when your wearing fake hair.</li>
            <li>It looks real!</li>
            <li>and it looks exactly as it is pictured here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Bangs are done really nicely, there curls need to fall out because they&#x27;re a little cra cra right now</li>
            <li>I first took it out of the package, it was very curly.</li>
            <li>You can style the wig pretty much any way you like.</li>
            <li>But ,it is a very realistic color..</li>
            <li>This wig is super soft, and the color is just as depicted.</li>
            <li>Better quality than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li>Also, It hasn&#x27;t shed or tangled, much....</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am getting ready to have chemo.  </li>
            <li>This wig does not look real at all.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to receiving it after reading reviews.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>What really sold me also was the customer who sent a picture of her self wearing wig</li>
            <li>Only thing good so far is I only paid 3 bucks for it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the hair itself looks and feels realistic, the wig just doesn&#x27;t look like the picture on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The hair is very natural looking--I&#x27;ve had people who have known me for a while ask me if it&#x27;s real.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Just the normal shedding and tangling ,for a  synthetic wig.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s way more strawberry blonde than natural blonde, which is what I was going for.  </li>
            <li>If you plan to wear this for everyday use, I think you&#x27;ll be better off looking elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the itching was very minor and was more heat related than anything else.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically, it&#x27;s way better than I expected, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m attempting to save this wig and make it wearable, but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll be able to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with the purchase and would definitely consider purchasing other wigs in this brand.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this wig, but it&#x27;s somewhat thin and tangles very easily.</li>
            <li>The material is synthetic but, looks and feels like well taken care of natural hair.</li>
            <li>The overall feel and look of the hair deserves that much, but the style does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>The only part I don&#x27;t really care for is the bangs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it a while now, and it&#x27;s still shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>The color looks natural which is a perk.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cap is too small&lt;br /&gt;Bangs are super long and the wig is assembled in such a way that the side swept look is not achievable so you have to do a blunt bang &lt;--</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this wig everyday other than when sleeping or showering and its holding up nicely.</li>
            <li>It was amazingly realistic, especially given the price!  </li>
            <li>This wig however is very high quality for such a low price!</li>
            <li>There appears to be too much hair in the front of the wig, but not enough hair in the back.</li>
            <li>Obviously my close friends and family know its not my real hair as mine is very short</li>
            <li>I will never go back to extensions again, i am fully converted thanks to this wig and am ordering my second one today!</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;hair\\&quot; is very soft and easy to brush, it seems kinda thin at the crown but when its on your head you cannot tell.</li>
            <li>I used a straightener on low heat to calm down the curls a bit.</li>
            <li>I always used human hair extensions, the remy ones too and was never very impressed with the way the hair held up even tho human is supposed to be better.</li>
            <li>The bangs are FAR too long.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Cap is too small&lt;br /&gt;Bangs are super long and the wig is assembled in such a way that the side swept look is not achievable so you have to do a blunt bang &lt;--</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this wig everyday other than when sleeping or showering and its holding up nicely.</li>
            <li> It was amazingly realistic, especially given the price!  </li>
            <li> This wig however is very high quality for such a low price!</li>
            <li> There appears to be too much hair in the front of the wig, but not enough hair in the back.</li>
            <li> Obviously my close friends and family know its not my real hair as mine is very short</li>
            <li> I will never go back to extensions again, i am fully converted thanks to this wig and am ordering my second one today!</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;hair\\&quot; is very soft and easy to brush, it seems kinda thin at the crown but when its on your head you cannot tell.</li>
            <li> I used a straightener on low heat to calm down the curls a bit.</li>
            <li> I always used human hair extensions, the remy ones too and was never very impressed with the way the hair held up even tho human is supposed to be better.</li>
            <li> The bangs are FAR too long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;19.99 is a little high for this</li>
            <li> I had to cut them cuz they were so long</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;ve been wearing it outside on 90 degree days and its really no hotter than i would be otherwise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been an extensions kinda girl but was sick of having to cut my own hair after all the damage from the extensions.</li>
            <li> What a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, all I had to do was shake it a few times to untangle the curls and it was 100% wearable instantly.  </li>
            <li> but that is to be expected i guess</li>
            <li> The bangs are a little long, but shifting the wig back slightly or pinning them to the side takes care of the issue.</li>
            <li> Only a few comments that said not true color.</li>
            <li> I am somewhat of a novice when it comes to owning wigs, but I know that this wasn&#x27;t the wig I was expecting based on the other reviews.</li>
            <li> and I will be purchasing from other manufacturers..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty dark, makes me sad</li>
            <li> The color is slightly darker than shown in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> like listed in the subject, the color is off.</li>
            <li> I also used my Instyler ,on the bangs, just a little, to make them less poofy..</li>
            <li> a little conditioner with half cup of water) .</li>
            <li> Well made wig, did she&#x27;d a little here and there</li>
            <li> Still, because the hair is thick in front and thin at the back....</li>
            <li> I was going to use it for a cosplay :/</li>
            <li> Mine was curled in all different directions, making it look extremely awkward and uneven.</li>
            <li> I thought for 20 bucks i was probably buying a total fake looking piece of crap but was very surprised with the quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the thin side</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really want to have one option and figured Halloween is coming up if it was awful.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed that it looks so different from the picture.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical as I have bought wigs before</li>
            <li> It looked awful on me and very fake.</li>

            <li> Extremely comfortable and realistic for the price. Posted pictures wearing it and several people thought I dyed my hair. Better quality than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> Looks amazing for $10</li>
            <li> Such a nice deal. My pic will show anything.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product a couple of days prior. The delivery was quite prompt!! I&#x27;ve ordered wigs before and this one was definitely packaged correctly. The colour is the same as the picture if you&#x27;re in natural or bright light. There were no tangles or damage. The material is synthetic but, looks and feels like well taken care of natural hair. If it does tangle, it is very easy to brush through. It&#x27;s a little on the thin side but, I have fine hair, so it looks more natural. The price cannot be beat! I will definitely order from this seller again!!</li>
            <li> I received this wig in 4 days! I was SO happy! I ordered several wigs ,from another company, way before this one,and they STILL aren&#x27;t here! I really love it! The color is darker than it shows, on the pictures.., more of a strawberry darker blonde, But ,it is a very realistic color.. I pulled this out of the bag, and immediately was struck by the softness and the very bouncy curls! Just beautiful! I am wearing it every day, and it is so comfortable..  It&#x27;s so light ,and I feel so happy, wearing it...My friends and family say it looks real, not like a wig, at all! Also, It hasn&#x27;t shed or tangled, much.... Just the normal shedding and tangling ,for a  synthetic wig. Brushes out very easily.. I also used my Instyler ,on the bangs, just a little, to make them less poofy.. And ,it worked great! I  definitely recommend getting this wig.. I know I really love it.. Is my favorite wig, of all my wigs, right now!</li>
            <li> I have naturally light to medium brown hair,I have light to medium beige skin and woof, this color was not how it appeared online, it&#x27;s way more strawberry blonde than natural blonde, which is what I was going for.  Bangs are done really nicely, there curls need to fall out because they&#x27;re a little cra cra right now</li>
            <li> This is the first wig I ever bought, and I&#x27;m so glad I chose this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first took it out of the package, it was very curly. I shook it out and brushed it through with my fingers and it became wavy as shown in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an elastic strap on the inside that makes it easy to keep the wig on your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bangs are long and perfect for sweeping to one side, which is how I like it, but you could also trim them. The hair is very natural looking--I&#x27;ve had people who have known me for a while ask me if it&#x27;s real. I&#x27;ve worn this wig as is, with a beanie, and as braided pigtails, and all 3 ways looked very cute and not wig-like at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, it&#x27;s way better than I expected, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> This wig is so soft and bouncy, I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it. It&#x27;s wonderful! i haven&#x27;t had that many wigs but this one makes me look so much younger and I am so happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unsure of why this wig has many good reviews. I bought it simply for a Halloween costume, and I&#x27;m unsure I&#x27;ll even wear it for that. If you plan to wear this for everyday use, I think you&#x27;ll be better off looking elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the hair itself looks and feels realistic, the wig just doesn&#x27;t look like the picture on Amazon. No amount of styling will change that. Mine was curled in all different directions, making it look extremely awkward and uneven. The bangs are FAR too long. There appears to be too much hair in the front of the wig, but not enough hair in the back. The color is slightly darker than shown in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m attempting to save this wig and make it wearable, but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll be able to. I&#x27;ve straightened it out, and I&#x27;m planning to put curls in it myself. Still, because the hair is thick in front and thin at the back.... I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to work out very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider my review 2.5 stars. The overall feel and look of the hair deserves that much, but the style does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  In the end, I didn&#x27;t wear this wig. I just didn&#x27;t look good. Maybe I got a bad/defective one.</li>
            <li> no no no - BAD.  i should have known but i thought i&#x27;d give it a try.  only buy this for Halloween purposes.</li>
            <li> For the price, awesome!  I am getting ready to have chemo.  Don&#x27;t really want to have one option and figured Halloween is coming up if it was awful.  It&#x27;s not awful!  My daughter and grand daughter loved it... I am 48 my daughter is 28 and my grand daughter 3.  My grand daughter wanted to wear it!  Thinking I will be giving the wig to her when I am done.  Buy with confidence - came quickly - great product for one night or many.</li>
            <li> The wig is great for the price. Originally the shipping was estimated for 4 weeks but arrived in 5 days. It looks real and is a good idea to get if you are thinking about dying your hair blonde but want an idea of what it will look like first. I recommend this product 100%</li>
            <li> I purchased this wig as a performance costume piece, and I am very impressed with the quality for the price. It looks very natural, with warm golden and strawberry tones. The bangs are a little long, but shifting the wig back slightly or pinning them to the side takes care of the issue. I&#x27;m really pleased with the purchase and would definitely consider purchasing other wigs in this brand.</li>
            <li> like listed in the subject, the color is off. i will work for the costume but not as we hoped</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical as I have bought wigs before and they felt like barbie hair and tangled immediately. This wig however is very high quality for such a low price! it feels like clean healthy human hair! I will definitely be buying this brand again, I am thinking red for my next one! It looks just like the picture except the curls are a bit tighter but I assume they will straighten out after wearing it for a bit!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe at the quality of this wig for what I paid.  When it arrived, all I had to do was shake it a few times to untangle the curls and it was 100% wearable instantly.  I wore it out for a night to &#x27;test drive&#x27; it before I had to wear it to a costuming event and it was comfortable and due to the straps in the back for perfect fit, it didn&#x27;t slide off.  Even after 6 hours of hard wear, it still looked perfect.  I finger combed it, put it back in the hairnet it was shipped in so it would retain its shape and rebagged it.  I love this wig!</li>
            <li> I used this for a Pepper Potts costume for Motor City Comic Con. It was perfect for my outfit, and I had people ask me if it was my real hair. I used a straightener on low heat to calm down the curls a bit. I will be using it again.</li>
            <li> If you are going for the sunday school teacher/conservative perfectionist look, then this wig will be perfect for you. It is darker and shorter than the picture. I&#x27;ve tried brushing and tugging on the curls to loosen them up and add some length to the wig, but no luck. You feel like a foolish goody goody in this one. Very disappointed that it looks so different from the picture.</li>
            <li> This wig is super soft, and the color is just as depicted. It&#x27;s the perfect length, except it tangles easily. Putting it in water helps very much :)</li>
            <li> The picture makes it look very natural and beautiful. In reality it was extremely obvious that it was a wig, and looked pretty goofy instead of elegant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty dark, makes me sad I was going to use it for a cosplay :/</li>
            <li> This is my first wig. I&#x27;ve always been an extensions kinda girl but was sick of having to cut my own hair after all the damage from the extensions. I thought for 20 bucks i was probably buying a total fake looking piece of crap but was very surprised with the quality. Obviously my close friends and family know its not my real hair as mine is very short but they couldn&#x27;t believe it was a wig, they thought it was more extensions. The \\&quot;hair\\&quot; is very soft and easy to brush, it seems kinda thin at the crown but when its on your head you cannot tell. The only part I don&#x27;t really care for is the bangs. I&#x27;m not used to having bangs so its irratating to me. I had to cut them cuz they were so long and I keep them pinned to the side which works fine. I&#x27;ve been wearing this wig everyday other than when sleeping or showering and its holding up nicely. Its not overly shiny especially after a wash and the curls hold up AMAZING. If you ever wanted those perfect beach goddess waves this is the wig for you! I highly recommend it. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it. I&#x27;ve had a gazillion compliments on it and only one person told me it looked \\&quot;fake\\&quot; but I think that was just her being a bitch cuz everyone else just raves about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can get hot but i&#x27;ve been wearing it outside on 90 degree days and its really no hotter than i would be otherwise. it started to itch a tiny bit around the ears and nape of neck but that is to be expected i guess, its not going to be totally perfect when your wearing fake hair. But the itching was very minor and was more heat related than anything else. I always used human hair extensions, the remy ones too and was never very impressed with the way the hair held up even tho human is supposed to be better. I will never go back to extensions again, i am fully converted thanks to this wig and am ordering my second one today! So if your unsure and have read a million reviews that all say something different, i know how you feel, but buy this wig as your starter. you will not be dissapointed!</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for my Alice costume and it suited quite well. This wig is easy to clean and comb. The curves of the hair is beautiful and the color is a little bit darker, but it still looks nice. I recommend to comb the wig with some conditioner(mix a little conditioner with half cup of water) .</li>
            <li> I bought this as a joke, but it turned out to fool a lot of people.  It was amazingly realistic, especially given the price!  If you are looking for something fun and a good price, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> Very nice! It worked very nicely for my cosplay, and everyone was amazed that it wasn&#x27;t real hair! I&#x27;ve had it a while now, and it&#x27;s still shiny and soft. The color is a bit darker than in the picture, but still a very good wig!</li>
            <li> This wig does not look real at all. I was really looking forward to receiving it after reading reviews. Are you kidding me! What a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 wigs in the past month and this is by far the best one. It looks real! and it looks exactly as it is pictured here on Amazon. It stays on your head nicely with no movement. Definetely worth the money! 5 stars amazon!</li>
            <li> Really great quality, great value! Exactly what I wanted and much better than many other wigs I have had, felt like real hair!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it. It looked awful on me and very fake. Maybe it would look better on someone else. I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> I have not received the wig yet but looks like it will be a nice wig. Only a few comments that said not true color. Well hope its close. Only thing good so far is I only paid 3 bucks for it.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this wig, but it&#x27;s somewhat thin and tangles very easily. I am somewhat of a novice when it comes to owning wigs, but I know that this wasn&#x27;t the wig I was expecting based on the other reviews. It&#x27;s better than Halloween wigs from department stores though! ^^</li>
            <li> I have just received this wig, and I have to say that the quality is great and it does feel like real hair.</li>
            <li> Pros -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color&lt;br /&gt;Style&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cap is too small&lt;br /&gt;Bangs are super long and the wig is assembled in such a way that the side swept look is not achievable so you have to do a blunt bang &lt;-- Not what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;19.99 is a little high for this and I will be purchasing from other manufacturers..</li>
            <li> Well made wig, did she&#x27;d a little here and there but for the price it was a good buy!  It shipped in about a week even to Hawaii</li>
            <li> I looked all over amazon for the right wig. This wig for me was the right one. The wig is adjustable. You can style the wig pretty much any way you like. The color looks natural which is a perk. The price is reasonable. What really sold me also was the customer who sent a picture of her self wearing wig so thank you to that customer.</li>
