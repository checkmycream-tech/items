            <li>It&#x27;s such a great summer color.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m an experienced nail polish purchaser and paint my nails constantly -</li>
            <li>So pretty!!</li>
            <li>brad new, love the price!</li>
            <li>Pairs pretty with a glitter top coat.</li>
            <li>The picture truly does show the true color.  </li>
            <li>Completely true to color from the picture you see.</li>
            <li>Loved this baby blue polish.  </li>
            <li>Mild sparkle</li>
            <li>This is a very pretty color.</li>
            <li>My new favorite color for summer.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and easy.</li>
            <li>This color is so so pretty!</li>
            <li>i love this color, it looks professionally done every time!</li>
            <li>So nice for the summer especially!</li>
            <li>Love this blue.</li>
            <li>which I personally think is better.</li>
            <li>but its still a pretty color</li>
            <li>Next time I will check inside of a cosmetic store to make sure I like the color.</li>
            <li>the color is more grey and takes like three coats</li>
            <li>The color is more of a purple hue other than a light blue, but it is still really pretty.</li>
            <li>It is very purply &amp; that&#x27;s not what I wanted</li>
            <li>Highly recommended seller!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Only thing is that you need to put on 2 coats to get the color shown, but to me thats a given considering its a light color.</li>
            <li>Sparkles don&#x27;t really transfer to the nail</li>
            <li>Price is much cheaper than a store.</li>
            <li>Such a pretty blue with a cute name.</li>
            <li>My daughter wanted this particular color</li>
            <li>the nail polish came very fast but it was not the light blue i expected</li>
            <li>still the most expensive nail polish i&#x27;ve bought, but it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li>so you can shimmer without looking 10 years old.  </li>
            <li>Color is not the same as the picture it got here fast</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very pretty with a little shimmer.</li>
            <li>There ain&#x27;t no other way to out it.</li>
            <li>Came in mail on time, but there was nail polish all on the sides of the bottle, obviously used and thinned out with nail polish remover, and sold for the same price of a new bottle that hadn&#x27;t been tampered with.</li>
            <li>There is a little bit of shimmer to it, but not so much and nothing that is off putting.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Definitely not the color as the picture. It is very purply &amp; that&#x27;s not what I wanted :/ I&#x27;m sad</li>
            <li> Love this color.  I had already used the color at a salon so I knew what to expect.  The picture truly does show the true color.  There is a little bit of shimmer to it, but not so much and nothing that is off putting.</li>
            <li> I LOVED this nail polish, I had seen it around the blogosphere and was so excited to try it! I ordered three different essie polishes, and they arrived before scheduled time! Highly recommended seller!</li>

            <li> Completely true to color from the picture you see. It is a periwinkle blue. Very beautiful color, applies well in two coats and lasts!</li>
            <li> Compared to the fair skinned model hand, I am tan and the color still looks great.  Enjoy the product and the quality.</li>
            <li> Great color for summer pedicures.  A little tricky to apply as many Essie shades are but not prohibitive from using it for at home mani and pedis.  So glad I treated myself :)</li>
            <li> perfect. love the color. love the way it goes on. I just love it. I use it all of the time!</li>
            <li> Love this blue. Subtle enough for every day (including office) wear. Pairs pretty with a glitter top coat. This polish will definitely be in my regular rotation.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is gorgeous even though it is more of a lavendar color. I still love it!!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about the nail polish at first because i saw some bad reviews, but this nail polish is actually really good. The shipping came within the time period it said. The color is more of a purple hue other than a light blue, but it is still really pretty. I put two coats on and it looks really nice. I suggest getting this nail polish if you are looking for a good summer color!</li>
            <li> Omg this is WAY too expensive. Not the polish itself but the shipping and handling!!!! $25!!!! What do you say in that?so In total $30!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty color. It looked more lavender than it does in the picture..like a lavender periwinkle. I would just look up swatches to see what I&#x27;m saying but it&#x27;s very pretty with a little shimmer. Much lighter than china glazes secret periwinkle though....which I personally think is better. Love it!!</li>
            <li> love love love this color. I got lots of compliments on it. you should get this, its so amazing. :)</li>
            <li> Loved this color on my co-workers nails so I had to buy a bottle for myself. great color! Love Essie!</li>
            <li> Product was just as expected. Was not old or tampered with. Great way to get this Essie product at a fraction of the cost, AND out of season (:</li>
            <li> Loved this baby blue polish.  It&#x27;s like walking around with a picture of the sky on your hands.  Would def. buy again.</li>
            <li> brad new, love the price!</li>
            <li> Great color, looks neat!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Essie nailpolish! It&#x27;s a gorgeous color, I&#x27;ve been really into the kind of \\&quot;pop\\&quot; colors, and this was perfect. still the most expensive nail polish i&#x27;ve bought, but it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Nothing i dislike about this color, its very cute. Only thing is that you need to put on 2 coats to get the color shown, but to me thats a given considering its a light color.</li>
            <li> I wear this all the time!!!</li>
            <li> Great Color. I bought this for my daughter for a Christmas present and I am sure she will love it.</li>
            <li> Such a pretty blue with a cute name. Looks like a cornflower blue but lighter the Essie&#x27;s lapiz of luxury. Sparkles don&#x27;t really transfer to the nail but I&#x27;m not a shimmery nail polish kinda of girl anyway so it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Came in mail on time, but there was nail polish all on the sides of the bottle, obviously used and thinned out with nail polish remover, and sold for the same price of a new bottle that hadn&#x27;t been tampered with.</li>
            <li> the nail polish came very fast but it was not the light blue i expected, it was more of an indigo. but its still a pretty color</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this particular color and I ordered it for her. I have to admit that it looks phenomenal. The periwinkle color is out of this world and looks elegant and appropriate with practically any outfit.</li>
            <li> This nail polish has already gotten me countless compliments. The shipping was fast and easy. I RECOMMEND for the trendy nail polish seekers! The color is very bright and perfect for spring/summer. Does not easily chip and lasts pretty long. I&#x27;m an experienced nail polish purchaser and paint my nails constantly - so - I know what makes a good nail polish good...and this is it!</li>
            <li> Asoft periwinkle color. I always get complements on the polish when I wear it. Its a unique color and great for the summer!</li>
            <li> This color is absolutely beautiful. There ain&#x27;t no other way to out it. Out of all my Essie polishes this one lasts an abnormal amount of time on my nails it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Love it for summer or winter.  Mild sparkle so you can shimmer without looking 10 years old.  This is my 2nd bottle and its because is EMPTY it.  Very few bottles do EMPTY, rather than it just get old and dry out.</li>
            <li> i love it! I get compliments on my nail color all the time.</li>
            <li> My new favorite color for summer.  To accomplish the look in the photo apply (3) coats.  I love this nail color.</li>
            <li> Color is not the same as the picture it got here fast and before the date posted the color is more grey and takes like three coats</li>
            <li> The exact color I wanted, and good quality! I actually found this at a Target but didn&#x27;t want to spend $9 on nail polish!  You get what you pay for on this one-I love it!</li>
            <li> Is not the same color in the picture. It is purple/blue. I was expecting a baby blue. Next time I will check inside of a cosmetic store to make sure I like the color. Everything else was fine. Price is much cheaper than a store.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not creme, it is shimmer which was a surprise for me.&lt;br /&gt;Applies easily with no brush marks.&lt;br /&gt;Good addition to my blue collection.</li>
            <li> i love this color its georgous buy this for sure!! its a even a great gift if thats what you were looking to get</li>
