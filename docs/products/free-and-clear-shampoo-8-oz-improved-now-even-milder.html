            <li>so finding a product that worked was wonderful.  </li>
            <li>and I was very impressed.</li>
            <li>and it cleans his hair great.</li>
            <li>We used this ever since and it has been good.  </li>
            <li>so I rotate this and my medicated shampoo and it keeps things under good control.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>the result is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Having significant allergies, this shampoo works great for me.  </li>
            <li>I used to love this product.  </li>
            <li>I have to avoid most of the ingredients this product keeps out -fragrance, parabens, etc.</li>
            <li>Love the conditioner and gel as well.</li>
            <li>Overall great!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo for my son.</li>
            <li>He has eczema and can not use most products.</li>
            <li>Products were wrapped and packaged appropriately.  </li>
            <li>A great product when you have allergy sensitive skin like me.  </li>
            <li>This product is very mild and does not have any scent.  </li>
            <li>Not only is this great for those of us with sensitivities to scents, but it&#x27;s also safe for people with peanut and tree nut allergies.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo has worked beautifully and the dermatitis that I was suffering with is actually improving.  </li>
            <li>And they are fragrance free, so</li>
            <li>Hello,    I used the old formula of this shampoo for years and loved it.  </li>
            <li>My hair has not felt this smooth and clean in years.  </li>
            <li>It takes forever to get a drugstore to respond to a special order.  </li>
            <li>Free and Clear shampoo is a great product for those that are sensitive to shampooes.</li>
            <li>I then switched to a baby shampoo which is still mild, but seems to actually clean my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and will highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>But these products left it clean, smooth!, shiny and really easy to brush out.  </li>
            <li>the old formula left my hair and scalp feeling &amp; looking great.  </li>
            <li>So glad Amazon offers so much.  </li>
            <li>My son has eczema and found that out because daycare thought it was ringworm at first.  </li>
            <li>and this is the only really safe product line that I trust</li>
            <li>I contacted the company who makes free and clear and found out that these bottles are from 2006.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks  Free &amp; Clear....</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair clean and shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I am very very pleased and will be using indefinitely due to new allergies.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this shampoo/conditioner!</li>
            <li>Its a bit expensive, but so far, this is the best (and non-smelly) product I&#x27;ve used for this condition.</li>
            <li>I purchased this shampoo after finding out I was allergic to many ingredients in other shampoos.  </li>
            <li>So many products contain almond oil, shea butter, and other allergens.  </li>
            <li>This free and clear hairspray was recommended for people who break out from regular hairspray use.  </li>
            <li>This is a shampoo that is free and clear - - at last!</li>
            <li>So far no results.</li>
            <li>Hair was manageable, shinny and soft.</li>
            <li>I have extremly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Refreshing tingle and smell but left a residue on my scalp --- the opposite of what I expected.</li>
            <li>I have psoriaisis and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I use this for my 3 year old who has ezcema and is sensitive to everything.  </li>
            <li>This is so gently, and his dandruff is finally going away.</li>
            <li>I wish they would go back to the old formula.</li>
            <li>But recently the formula was totally changed - virtually ALL new ingredients.   </li>
            <li>I am so sorry they had to mess with a great shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Finding a fragrance free shampoo that really works has been a long and difficult process.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I purchased this shampoo after finding out I was allergic to many ingredients in other shampoos.  This shampoo has worked beautifully and the dermatitis that I was suffering with is actually improving.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this shampoo/conditioner!</li>
            <li> I hope this will send psoriasis into remission. I have used it very little, however. So far no results.</li>
            <li> Hello,    I used the old formula of this shampoo for years and loved it.  I have sensitivities to chemicals and this shampoo never gave me a problem.  Then they decided to change it.  I immediately knew there was a problem because my hair felt like straw; very dry and brittle.  Then I started to have terrible headaches from it.  I am so sorry they had to mess with a great shampoo.  I wish they would go back to the old formula.</li>
            <li> I used to love this product.  I have to avoid most of the ingredients this product keeps out -fragrance, parabens, etc. so finding a product that worked was wonderful.  the old formula left my hair and scalp feeling &amp; looking great.  But recently the formula was totally changed - virtually ALL new ingredients.   Using the shampoo left my hair like straw and my scalp and skin broken out and itchy.   what a disappointment!  Back to searching for something that works.</li>
            <li> This free and clear hairspray was recommended for people who break out from regular hairspray use.  I have been very unhappy with it.  I do not see any difference in it and regular spray.  I would still like to find something that would not irritate my neck.</li>
            <li> My son has eczema and found that out because daycare thought it was ringworm at first.  Follow up doctor visit next day, and turns out it is eczema.  His scalp was in a bad condition (dry and flaky), and I thought was just really bad cradle cap.  Used some cream for his eczema. Our doctor gave us samples of this shampoo for him.  We used this ever since and it has been good.  He still has some spots of eczema here and there on his head once a while.  This product is very mild and does not have any scent.  I like it.</li>
            <li> Having significant allergies, this shampoo works great for me.  Love the conditioner and gel as well. Cleans hair, doesn&#x27;t weight down.  Overall great!</li>
            <li> Not only is this great for those of us with sensitivities to scents, but it&#x27;s also safe for people with peanut and tree nut allergies.  So many products contain almond oil, shea butter, and other allergens.  This is a shampoo that is free and clear - - at last!</li>
            <li> Hair was still oily and smelly after using this shampoo.  I alternated using this and another shampoo until it was gone.  I then switched to a baby shampoo which is still mild, but seems to actually clean my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> Free and Clear shampoo is a great product for those that are sensitive to shampooes. Hair was manageable, shinny and soft.</li>
            <li> I recommend all Vanicream products. I have extremly sensitive skin and this is the only really safe product line that I trust</li>
            <li> My goodness this stuff works wonders!  My hair has not felt this smooth and clean in years.  Finding a fragrance free shampoo that really works has been a long and difficult process.  But I found my shampoo, and I don&#x27;t see any reason why I should change brands ever again.  Combined with the conditioner the result is amazing.  My hair reaches below my waist and has been a challenge to brush after washing.  But these products left it clean, smooth!, shiny and really easy to brush out.  And they are fragrance free, so no perfume left in my hair or in my house.  Nothing short of a miracle.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo for my son. He has eczema and can not use most products. This one does not bother his skin at all and it cleans his hair great. It only takes a small amount so it last for awhile.</li>
            <li> I worked well and I was very impressed. My head was doing the seasonal itching and it was stopped</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  Refreshing tingle and smell but left a residue on my scalp --- the opposite of what I expected.</li>
            <li> Products were wrapped and packaged appropriately.  Order was correct and arrived even earlier than the estimated delivery date.  Would definitely do business with again.</li>
            <li> My product was too thick and did not suds well.  I contacted the company who makes free and clear and found out that these bottles are from 2006.  They don&#x27;t make 8 oz anymore.  I was disappointed that these would be sold when they should be disposed of.  My money was refunded. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I found this shampoo initially at Walgreens. I love it! I have psoriaisis and sensitive skin so I rotate this and my medicated shampoo and it keeps things under good control. Its a bit expensive, but so far, this is the best (and non-smelly) product I&#x27;ve used for this condition.</li>
            <li> A great product when you have allergy sensitive skin like me.  It leaves my hair clean and shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> My husband needs this shampoo.  It takes forever to get a drugstore to respond to a special order.  Amazon is a welcomed resource.  So glad Amazon offers so much.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> A life saver product to say the least.  I am very very pleased and will be using indefinitely due to new allergies.   Thanks  Free &amp; Clear....</li>
            <li> I use this for my 3 year old who has ezcema and is sensitive to everything.  I can&#x27;t get his dandruff under control and everything burns or hurts.  This is so gently, and his dandruff is finally going away. And his ezcema doesn&#x27;t get flared up like other shampoos do to him.  I love this shampoo and will highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
