            <li>I had to buy one to clean my nail brushes.</li>

            <li>She was pleased just the same.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted what can I say</li>

            <li>Makes keeping several cleaned brushes handy without wet brushes laying on your table surface (and maybe damaging it if it isn&#x27;t glass, or maybe soaking through your towel).</li>
            <li>I know is not super necessary to use special cup for clean brushes</li>
            <li>I do have a set of nail art brushes, but I use it to clean my little boy&#x27;s paint brushes too.</li>
            <li>I just wish I hadn&#x27;t screwed the lid super tight.</li>
            <li>the only complaint i have is that i wish the top screwed on.</li>

            <li> I won&#x27;t wait so long next time.</li>
            <li> this is basically what i expected.</li>
            <li> The cap seems a little loose but it&#x27;ll be stored upright anyways</li>
            <li> Not worth buying, it is just a cup with a lid that does not even stay on.</li>
            <li> you cannot push the sides in like some cheaper plastics, feels slightly bottom heavy even without liquid (makes me believe it won&#x27;t topple over with an accidental tap).  </li>
            <li> It has little clips that hold brushes, but you mind as well just buy a cup to soak brushes in.</li>
            <li> so you have to buy that separate, and that is not easy to find.</li>
            <li> A very simple oin expensive plastic ocntainer with lid that has cutouts for the brushes.</li>
            <li> I think I might have broken the threads of the lid.</li>
            <li> The lid fits poorly, the liquid evaporates.  </li>
            <li> I was being careless.</li>

            <li> fast delivery love it</li>
            <li> I like that it holds your brushes around the rim.  Makes keeping several cleaned brushes handy without wet brushes laying on your table surface (and maybe damaging it if it isn&#x27;t glass, or maybe soaking through your towel).</li>
            <li> I read the descrition worng and i thought it was the actual solution. I had to buy one to clean my nail brushes. when i got the solution the cup is handy and works for the brushes</li>
            <li> My girlfriend says it a great cleaner so its all good.That&#x27;s all there is to it.</li>
            <li> Just needed a cup to clean out my nail art brushes. This works perfectly. The cap seems a little loose but it&#x27;ll be stored upright anyways so I&#x27;m not worried.</li>
            <li> A very simple oin expensive plastic ocntainer with lid that has cutouts for the brushes. It works perfectly.  Sometiems the simple approach is the best approach.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cup for putting alcohol for cleaning alcohol based tattoo ink off of brushes. It&#x27;s a good cup. I just wish I hadn&#x27;t screwed the lid super tight. I think I might have broken the threads of the lid. I was being careless. Anyway, I would get a this cup again because I like that it holds brushes and it has grooves at the bottom to help clean the brush. I&#x27;m going to get a replacement one now.</li>
            <li> Great for what I need.</li>
            <li> its a cup...lol.  durable plastic for soaking and cleaning off acrylic brushes..</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do for a great price. Keeps my brushes clean and ready for next use.</li>
            <li> I actually use this to clean my makeup brushes, and it works great! I let them sit overnight in a solution and I like the rails at the bottom to scrub them!</li>
            <li> I received this in a timely manner. Very useful.</li>
            <li> It was okay, it doesn&#x27;t come with any of the cleaner liquid so you have to buy that separate, and that is not easy to find.</li>
            <li> I use mine to clean acrylic out of my nail brushes. I like the grooved bottom and extra holders.</li>
            <li> The products were just what I needed.</li>
            <li> this is basically what i expected. the bottom of the cup is grooved to help clean brushes quickly and efficiently. the only complaint i have is that i wish the top screwed on.</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying cleaner... It is just a cup to hold brushes while you soak them. There is a great piece inside that allows you to space the brushes out and holds them in place.</li>
            <li> This is a clever little item  - makes it so easy to clean brushes.</li>
            <li> I have not personally tried the product out yet,but look forward to seeing if it holds the brushes really good along with if it  does not tip over with being so short in height. The price was fair and the shipping was swift. My brushes should be here any day now and until then I won&#x27;t know how it stands up to a five star rating or not.</li>
            <li> Love the idea...holds my brushes in place w/out disfiguring the ends of the brush.</li>
            <li> Have not used.  Gift for my daughter.  Upon inspection:  has ridges on bottom to separate bristles and remove debris, has multi sized holes to accomodate different sized brushes to \\&quot;squeeze\\&quot; them clean and then to hang and soak, has screw on lid (so no spills when brushes aren&#x27;t being cleaned), it is not a thin plastic...you cannot push the sides in like some cheaper plastics, feels slightly bottom heavy even without liquid (makes me believe it won&#x27;t topple over with an accidental tap).  I purchased this without a shipping charge and it was the best priced on Amazon. Was delivered in perfect condition before the scheduled date...who doesn&#x27;t like that?</li>
            <li> Our teenage daughter loved this product and said this is what she needed for the many nail brushes she owns.</li>
            <li> keeps her nail brushes clean and keeps her brushes out of her baby brother&#x27;s hands.&lt;br /&gt;Mother and Grandmother glad she has the cleaner cup</li>
            <li> I missed the description on this one.  Thought I would be receiving a cup with brush cleaner in it. I guess it is handy in that my daughter won&#x27;t take dishes or cups from my kitchen for this purpose. Like a specimen cup from the doctor&#x27;s office. Though priced low, still seems pricey for what it is.</li>
            <li> This is the best way to clean ur brush after doing acrylic nails! I like the way it holds all sizes of brushes.</li>
            <li> The lid fits poorly, the liquid evaporates.  I do like the brush holder and scrubber in the bottom. The outside printing comes off if you have accid tone on your hands..</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use, its nice that it has the holders to keep brushes upright and easy to clean and store.  And it has a lid so if you have cleaner in it and knock it over it wont spill all over your  carpet or work space.  Im very pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li> I use this thing for all sorts of stuff!  I know it&#x27;s a simple idea, but it&#x27;s handy.  I do have a set of nail art brushes, but I use it to clean my little boy&#x27;s paint brushes too.</li>
            <li> I gave this product to the same person I gave the &amp;#34;Black Face Man Cast Iron Wall Mount Bottle Opener&amp;#34; to. I didn&#x27;t have anything to put in it when I got it. My own fault, I shouldn&#x27;t have waited so long to order these things. I won&#x27;t wait so long next time. She was pleased just the same.</li>
            <li> Not worth buying, it is just a cup with a lid that does not even stay on. It has little clips that hold brushes, but you mind as well just buy a cup to soak brushes in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I received my item thank you!</li>
            <li> I know is not super necessary to use special cup for clean brushes&lt;br /&gt;but I like this because hold each one in one place</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted what can I say</li>
            <li> This product is a great solution to the problem of cleaning your brushes and takes the work out, your handles will no longer be ruined from slipping into the acetone and you can do it quickly!</li>
            <li> Love it. Thanks for your fast service.</li>
