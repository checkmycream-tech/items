            <li> I got five beautiful set of brushes.. Yes they are small but it&#x27;s perfect. It does it&#x27;s job well. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> They seem pretty okay. They came two days before the &amp;#34;expected delivery date&amp;#34;. I got all the brushes &amp; case shown in the photo. Got the color I chose, pink! Took about a month, literally 4 weeks. $3 and free shipping. I guess its worth it.</li>
            <li> Small not at all what I expected however will work for travel</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this makeup brushes. Very convenient to use and very durable also. The bristles are very soft and it does a wonderful job in blending. I definitely purchased another set of this in the future.</li>
            <li> I received this product today, instead of getting the product that I paid for and wanted I received 1 makeup brush. I would definitely not recommend purchasing this</li>

            <li> Cheap and not even worth trying to use.Total waste of money</li>
            <li> I gave this a 3 stars because one it&#x27;s so so so soft and the bad thing about this was I thought I was going to get pink and I got black but it does look like a Mac brush and I thought it was going to get them in a set but I only got 1 and it&#x27;s a blush brush</li>
            <li> They have a funny smell to them at first. But I washed them earlier and they are all still in one piece and work great!</li>
