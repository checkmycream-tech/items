            <li>/&gt;First of all, floss threaders are great for the front teeth, but so difficult to use in the back.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>they do not fit well between first two teeth, overall not as easy to use as others designed for braces.</li>
            <li>As a new braces wearer, trying to floss the old fashioned way was a hug time consuming chore.  </li>
            <li>My 8 year old just got braces.</li>
            <li>My 12-year old son with braces is flossing without even being coaxed.  </li>
            <li>My 11 year old with braces</li>
            <li>The only problem is that when the string is used more than once, the end will stick out and not fit under the braces.</li>

            <li> So much easier to use these instead of threaders.</li>

            <li> Great for anyone with braces!</li>
            <li> I recently got braces in my 30s.&lt;br /&gt;At the ortho office, I was told to use floss and floss threaders.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, floss threaders are great for the front teeth, but so difficult to use in the back.&lt;br /&gt;The Plackers Orthopick is amazing. It didnt break, and it made flossing so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;It is difficult enough to deal with flossing without braces, and the pain/throbbing, flossing should at least be easy. Right?</li>

Just wen to dentist for the first time after getting them for a cleaning and they were happy to see how well cared for my gums were as the braces make that more difficult.

            <li> 24 packs are $1.57 at Walmart!  These are nearly double the price!</li>
            <li> Got these for my son who wears braces as the orthodontist recommended them. He was enthusiastic at first about using them but now the novelty has worn off and I don&#x27;t think he really need these special picks.</li>

            <li> excellent product, helps my son keep his teeth clean with braces. Worth getting. We have been very impressed with its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> These save me so much time when flossing around my braces. Will never go back to the traditional way of flossing. Thank you Plackers!</li>
            <li> This is the floss our orthodontist recommends.  You can string it through your braces, etc. do floss everywhere needed.  I can&#x27;t find it in my local drug store, so buying it on Amazon is so convenient.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my kids who are wearing braces. Our orthodontist recommended it. Seems they work fine.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected.</li>
            <li> These are too big and pull on the wire on my braces.  Not happy.</li>
            <li> Love them Adult braces are hard enough but this is the best product in the world</li>
            <li> Orthodontic flossers are difficult to find in stores...these work great and at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to purchase until the braces come off!</li>
