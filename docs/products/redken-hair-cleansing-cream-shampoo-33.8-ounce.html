            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It DESTROYED my healthy blond hair.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this cleansing shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>What more do you want a shampoo to do?  </li>
            <li>I am able to no longer go to the salon and gets Malibu&#x27;s to remove the rust in my hair.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great price</li>
            <li>It also works wonders for my hair which gets a healthy dose of hairspray every day.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent of this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>My hair gets oily very quickly since I exercise a lot</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent.</li>
            <li>I use it once a week and my hair is free of product residue.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re looking for a great cleansing shampoo to remove buildup on your scalp, I would definitely recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, it smells great, DOES remove regular build up.</li>
            <li>It &amp;#34;cleans&amp;#34; my hair soooo much that it dries it more than is safe.</li>
            <li>this shampoo, I was having to shampoo twice until my hair felt clean.</li>
            <li>Great smooth claryfing shampoo, recommended for swimmers, it was recommended for my children who both go to swimming lesson twice a week, very concentrated ( it last) and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have found that if I use it more than once every couple of weeks, I get a dry scalp, but it is quite effective in shampooing my hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>and it was causing my hair to get greasy quickly at the roots.</li>
            <li>The value is good, the product does what it said it would, however please use it not even every other time as it is very, very powerful.</li>
            <li>Same product you find at beauty supply stores, good price and convenient to have it shipped straight to my house!</li>
            <li>I should say to certainly pair this with a good strengthening conditioner to avoid drying out your hair - and also you shouldn&#x27;t use this daily - it should be used once or twice a week.  </li>
            <li>Regardless, the money was worth the results.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair super soft &amp; light.</li>
            <li>My hair shines, and is full of body, so much easyier to style almost like it controlls the oil.</li>
            <li>This is the only shampoo I&#x27;ve ever found that cleanses the oil and shampoo deposits from my hair effectively yet gently.</li>
            <li>Before this product I was getting build up very fast..</li>
            <li>Great for those who have hard we&#x27;ll water.</li>
            <li>This is the only product in 3 years that we have been looking that cleans the chlorine out and lets her have healthy hair.</li>
            <li>Since it was my first time using it, I decided to leave it on for 5 minutes, like the directions suggested.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize this when I first went to squeeze it out of the bottle</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>Love this product, especially during swimming pool season.</li>
            <li>I love this product but recommended doing a deep conditioning after.</li>
            <li>I was going through so many smaller bottles of Redken&#x27;s Cleansing Cream,</li>
            <li>Otherwise I am pleased with it overall.</li>
            <li>It smells really good too unlike other cleansing shampoos!!!</li>
            <li>Could really tell the difference as far as how clean my hair felt after using this Cleansing Shampoo.</li>
            <li>If you use it more than twice in a row it will dry your hair out.</li>
            <li>as I use Wen regularly but still like to clarify once a week due to other hair products, it&#x27;s good to have a nice large bottle.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>it really works by cleaning out your hair.</li>
            <li>Deep cleasing and smooth hair, it woths the Price.</li>
            <li>Works really well</li>
            <li>it really gets oil or buildup out of hair without stripping it,</li>
            <li>In my mind, reasonably priced in that you don&#x27;t need a lot for it to do its job</li>
            <li>It really cleans residue out of hair.  </li>
            <li>I love to use this after several regular shampoos.  </li>
            <li>and I took way too much out and ended up dropping some right above my eye, just as the directions warned.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use too many styling products, but during the week I generally use shampoo, conditioner, dry shampoo, heat protectant, and sometimes a shine spray or oil.</li>
            <li>Your hair will feel very dry after washing it, so I recommend using a good deep conditioner if you have dry hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once, but it does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>I searched high and low and spent $20 on a tiny bottle of this at a salon (I didn&#x27;t know any better at the time).  </li>
            <li>I was so surprised at the speedy delivery.</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t your average clarifying shampoo and could easily be used without hurting my hair regularly unlike some.  </li>
            <li>Please use this product, if you have fine hair like I do, perhaps every 5-10 shampoos, no more often.</li>
            <li>Really helps taking yellow out of white hair.</li>
            <li>I only wash my hair 2-3 times a week and this shampoo does an amazing job of cutting through all the product build-up and grime.&lt;br /&gt;Before</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Just a small amount will totally remove any styling products that I&#x27;ve used without damaging my hair!!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m an active person.  </li>
            <li> There are daily shampoos designed for hard water that work well in between clarifying treatments.  </li>
            <li> My hair would be flat and hard to manage.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday in my hair and it removes a lot of the rust buildup!</li>
            <li> I have very harsh water.</li>
            <li> Until I searched online for some tips on hard water and was told a clarifying shampoo would do the trick.  </li>
            <li> I have really hard water at my home (rental without a water softening system).  </li>
            <li> The water softener hardly touches the hardness of the water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for at least 10 years</li>
            <li> I moved to TN recently and learned that hard way how horrible the water is down here.  </li>
            <li> For people with hard water problems, I recommend this product over the rest!</li>
            <li> I have a well with very hard water even with a home filtration system.</li>
            <li> as a side note, it&#x27;s very thick.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My hair would be flat and hard to manage. My stylist recommended this product to remove build up of styling products. It works great. I use it once a week and my hair is free of product residue. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I use this once a week...it really works by cleaning out your hair.</li>
            <li> Only product I&#x27;ve found that removes even heavy grease in a single pass without harming the hair.</li>
            <li> Really Love it. My daughter swims and has extremely think hair. This is the only product in 3 years that we have been looking that cleans the chlorine out and lets her have healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but it does exactly what it says. I used it because I was getting product buildup on my scalp and it was causing my hair to get greasy quickly at the roots. I don&#x27;t use too many styling products, but during the week I generally use shampoo, conditioner, dry shampoo, heat protectant, and sometimes a shine spray or oil. The dry shampoo can especially build up on your hair even after it&#x27;s been washed out. Your hair will feel very dry after washing it, so I recommend using a good deep conditioner if you have dry hair. I used Aussie 3 Minute Miracle on the ends of my hair for conditioner. Since it was my first time using it, I decided to leave it on for 5 minutes, like the directions suggested. I think that may have helped. So if you&#x27;re looking for a great cleansing shampoo to remove buildup on your scalp, I would definitely recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as a side note, it&#x27;s very thick. I didn&#x27;t realize this when I first went to squeeze it out of the bottle and I took way too much out and ended up dropping some right above my eye, just as the directions warned. So I figured I would warn you so you don&#x27;t make the same dumb mistake that I did and put way too much on your hand and end up dropping it almost in your eye. Also, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent. It&#x27;s almost minty. So the scent should not bother you.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I love it. I am going to engaged with this shampoo. Deep cleasing and smooth hair, it woths the Price.</li>
            <li> I moved to TN recently and learned that hard way how horrible the water is down here.  It DESTROYED my healthy blond hair.  It was greasy and dull and completely unmanageable.  Until I searched online for some tips on hard water and was told a clarifying shampoo would do the trick.  I searched high and low and spent $20 on a tiny bottle of this at a salon (I didn&#x27;t know any better at the time).  Regardless, the money was worth the results.  My head felt like it was breathing!  My hair felt like and had volume again!  I LOVED this stuff.  Of note I should say to certainly pair this with a good strengthening conditioner to avoid drying out your hair - and also you shouldn&#x27;t use this daily - it should be used once or twice a week.  There are daily shampoos designed for hard water that work well in between clarifying treatments.  Overall, I think this is FANTASTIC! It totally saved my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product, especially during swimming pool season.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing. I&#x27;ve been looking for a good product for my hair and this is it. Great for those who have hard we&#x27;ll water.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this product locally in any of our salons. I have been told that the water was what was making my hair turn orange. This product is supposed to help remove the minerals as well as build up that would cause my hair to turn color.&lt;br /&gt;Well, my haircolor still is having issues. But, it smells great, DOES remove regular build up.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this cleansing shampoo. It leaves my hair super soft &amp; light. It smells really good too unlike other cleansing shampoos!!!</li>
            <li> I was so surprised at the speedy delivery. Even though the package was torn at one end it was double package so it arrived intack. I reated this shampoo so highly due to the condition of my hair, oily. My hair shines, and is full of body, so much easyier to style almost like it controlls the oil. I have use this shampoo for years. Have tryed others and always come back to Redken.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo I&#x27;ve ever found that cleanses the oil and shampoo deposits from my hair effectively yet gently. I have found that if I use it more than once every couple of weeks, I get a dry scalp, but it is quite effective in shampooing my hair.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time. Love this shampoo. It does a great job of eradicating grease in my hair.</li>
            <li> Like the title says.  What more do you want a shampoo to do?  It is just a shampoo, after all.</li>
            <li> I only wash my hair 2-3 times a week and this shampoo does an amazing job of cutting through all the product build-up and grime.&lt;br /&gt;Before this shampoo, I was having to shampoo twice until my hair felt clean. This shampoo does the job in one step. Love it!</li>
            <li> Really helps taking yellow out of white hair. I use it about two times a week. Leaves my hair in good condition.</li>
            <li> LOVE this shampoo!  Just a small amount will totally remove any styling products that I&#x27;ve used without damaging my hair!!</li>
            <li> I am able to no longer go to the salon and gets Malibu&#x27;s to remove the rust in my hair.</li>
            <li> Since I swim three times a week, my hairdresser recommended to use Redken Hair Cleansing cream shampoo.  I have been using it now for more than four years, and must say that it does a great job.</li>
            <li> Salon Quality Salon Quantity. Redken cleansing cleansing cream once every 2 weeks does the job. I love this product but recommended doing a deep conditioning after.</li>
            <li> I was going through so many smaller bottles of Redken&#x27;s Cleansing Cream, as I use Wen regularly but still like to clarify once a week due to other hair products, it&#x27;s good to have a nice large bottle.  This product isn&#x27;t your average clarifying shampoo and could easily be used without hurting my hair regularly unlike some.  My hair is growing out and I&#x27;m using a bunch of different products.. so while I love Wen Six Thirteen (delicious), I&#x27;ll always have a bottle of CC in my shower.  I&#x27;ve been using for at least 10 years and it&#x27;s a superior product.</li>
            <li> I have really hard water at my home (rental without a water softening system).  Before this product I was getting build up very fast.. within the same day!! It has cut back down again and I can go back to washing my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have a well with very hard water even with a home filtration system. This shampoo is the best for removing chemicals and ratchets so well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great price</li>
            <li> Works really well hairdresser compliments nice texture of my hair after using this,  it really gets oil or buildup out of hair without stripping it,</li>
            <li> I have very harsh water. The water softener hardly touches the hardness of the water. I use this everyday in my hair and it removes a lot of the rust buildup! For people with hard water problems, I recommend this product over the rest!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this when I complained that nothing I tried would return my daughters&#x27; hair to being soft and manageable after a week of swimming in an indoor pool.  This did the trick.  I could finally get a brush through their hair again.  It also works wonders for my hair which gets a healthy dose of hairspray every day.  I use this product almost every day, and it never leaves my hair feeling dry.  Great product!</li>
            <li> My favorite cleansing shampoo!</li>
            <li> The value is good, the product does what it said it would, however please use it not even every other time as it is very, very powerful. It &amp;#34;cleans&amp;#34; my hair soooo much that it dries it more than is safe. Please use this product, if you have fine hair like I do, perhaps every 5-10 shampoos, no more often. Otherwise I am pleased with it overall.</li>
            <li> Same product you find at beauty supply stores, good price and convenient to have it shipped straight to my house!</li>
            <li> She should be writing this.  I can only tell you she will use nothing but this shampoo, plus other Redken products.</li>
            <li> Could really tell the difference as far as how clean my hair felt after using this Cleansing Shampoo. In my mind, reasonably priced in that you don&#x27;t need a lot for it to do its job</li>
            <li> Great smooth claryfing shampoo, recommended for swimmers, it was recommended for my children who both go to swimming lesson twice a week, very concentrated ( it last) and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love to use this after several regular shampoos.  It really cleans residue out of hair.  If you use it more than twice in a row it will dry your hair out.</li>
            <li> My hair gets oily very quickly since I exercise a lot and I&#x27;m an active person.  I love the scent of this shampoo.  It leaves my hair feeling fresh and clean.  I alternate it with my regular shampoo.  Gets rid of the chlorine green from swimming on my daughter&#x27;s blonde hair.</li>
