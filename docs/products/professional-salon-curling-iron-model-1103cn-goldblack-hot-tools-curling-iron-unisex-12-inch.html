            <li>I was very pleased when I opened the package and discovered the curling iron was exactly as I visioned it would be.  </li>
            <li>Very elegant, my first curler</li>

            <li>Love, love, love Hot Tools.</li>
            <li>It is a very quick heat up curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>and I can easily just the temperature.</li>
            <li>Heats very quickly.  </li>
            <li>its amazing its my first one</li>
            <li>It heats very quickly and is easy and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>I like how fine you can make your settings for heat</li>
            <li>I used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair by using large sections of hair and it produced nice spiral curls.  </li>
            <li>- I like the range of temperature settings, and the barrel size works great for my short, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>The different settings available make it easy to keep from burning very fine hair and the higher settings are excellent for that fast pick me up.</li>
            <li>Great for short hair that gives some curl but not a lot.</li>
            <li>It heats up nicely and the temperature control really helps you regulate the heat on any type of hair.</li>
            <li>Feels comfortable in your hand.  </li>
            <li>This curling iron is great for short hair styles.  </li>
            <li>I especially appreciated longer cord.</li>
            <li>and it is smooth.</li>
            <li>Liked it so much ordered one for home, too.  </li>
            <li>This hair curling iron was a gift - it is easily a salon grade tool with he long cord and great controls.  </li>
            <li>This curling iron is quick heating and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, I love Hot Tools.  </li>
            <li>Love the Hot Tools.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, professional model that really holds the heat and the iron lasts for years.</li>
            <li>As of right now my curls have lasted a full 24 hours!</li>
            <li>My hair is hard to curl so this is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>If you need a 1/2 inch curling iron (hard to find in stores), this is one is excellent.  </li>
            <li>thanks so much!!!!</li>
            <li>Grabs strands tightly on first try, making it easy and quick to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also quick to heat up.  </li>
            <li>This iron is sleek and beyond all expectations, heats quickly; and echo others who caution to use lowest setting ( quite sufficient).</li>
            <li>Heats quickly and&lt;br /&gt;cools quickly.  </li>
            <li>It does get very hot, so you probably won&#x27;t even need the highest setting.</li>
            <li>It does get very hot</li>
            <li>I gets hot super fast, and even better?  </li>
            <li>It heats up fast and the curls stay without using any hair sprays!!</li>
            <li>It seems to be well made, and they even included an extra spring mechanism in case the one on it breaks (and that does seem to be the part of curling irons that breaks most often!)  </li>
            <li>i jurt wrap my hair around it for cute natural or beachy waves.</li>
            <li>I was amazed when I saw it on Amazon for such a spectacular price.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it worked fine, nice long cord, reasonable price.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>This was right before xmas, and I mentioned it to my youngest son.  </li>
            <li>Heats up very quickly and gives you nice tight curls.</li>
            <li>I have used Hot Tools Professional Curling Irons for many years, this one that I just bought the 1/2 &amp;#34; barrel works</li>
            <li>There are __ mini __ irons, (very short ) however would not find suitable.</li>
            <li>I have very fine short hair</li>
            <li>It even holds my very fine short hair when I curl it.  </li>
            <li>If you have never tried hot Tools and have hard to curl hair I strongly suggest purchasing!!!</li>
            <li>quick fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.......warms quickly</li>
            <li>Another quality product from Hot Tools.</li>
            <li>When I first curled my hair</li>
            <li>Does not get as hot as the iron I replaced.</li>
            <li>Have been using hot tools for years.  </li>
            <li>This is not the first time I have used this product.</li>
            <li>I have used Hot Tools for years</li>
            <li>The Hot Tools curling iron has met all my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally impressed, I would totally recommend this to anyone who can&#x27;t stand the stickiness of hairspray and those who appreciate long lasting curls!</li>
            <li>They are very cute tight waves.</li>
            <li>Gets hot fast.</li>
            <li>Ok, I&#x27;ll admit, I haven&#x27;t bought a new curling iron for about ten years.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>fast to heat and fast to curl</li>
            <li>Two additional springs included in package much appreciated and sign of quality product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real winner.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and has a quarantee.</li>
            <li>and I find that these tools are very durable.</li>
            <li>Who would have thought the technology would have changed so much?  </li>
            <li>The service was fast and efficient.</li>
            <li>I is very convenient to order.</li>
            <li>I have short, super straight hair and need to just touch the tips.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so thankful I was able to purchase from your company, as this size and brand is one I could not do my fine, thin hair without.  </li>
            <li>Long barrel, sturdy spring, and a nice long cord.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend..</li>
            <li>This is my second product that I purchased from Hot Tools and would recommend any of their products!</li>
            <li>Does not really work on short hair--would work best on hair that is at least 2 1/2&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This is exactly like all the other reliable Hot Tools curling irons!</li>
            <li>Hot rollers and curling iron curls only last about 2 hours if im lucky.</li>
            <li>This is a very professional high quality product.</li>
            <li>I wash it, use a curl activator, let it thoroughly dry, then curl bits, especially on the top that isn&#x27;t as curly, spray with some hairspray</li>
            <li>Would not ever buy another Curling Iron other that the Hot Tools! !</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take very much to make a curl and the curls really last.  </li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and makes a nice tight small curl.</li>
            <li>and I just noticed last week that it&#x27;s the exact model my hairstylist uses at the salon which tells me</li>
            <li>Way too small, I returned it for the 3/4 inch one - much better.  </li>
            <li>It has a wide range of temperatures, heats up quickly, comes with replacement springs.  </li>
            <li>it is soft and does not kink the swivel works</li>
            <li>so much I am going to order it in a different rod size!</li>
            <li>Who says kids (even adult ones) don&#x27;t listen?  </li>
            <li>The barrel is thin enough to wrap my hair all the way around twice to get a good curl</li>
            <li>The first one I used  daily for over 3 years until finally, the cord connection became unreliable.  </li>
            <li>This seems like a decent curling iron, I have permed hair, the perm is starting to fade</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long cord is also very helpful.</li>
            <li>The only product I used was heat protectant and a little strong hold hairspray and gently brushed the waves out.</li>
            <li>For my thick wavy hair, it works better than a flat iron.  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser uses Hot tools and she recommended the brand to me a few years ago.</li>
            <li>I immediately ordered a new one; no need to research other replacements.</li>

            <li> I like how fine you can make your settings for heat</li>
            <li> I used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair by using large sections of hair and it produced nice spiral curls.  </li>
            <li> - I like the range of temperature settings, and the barrel size works great for my short, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> The different settings available make it easy to keep from burning very fine hair and the higher settings are excellent for that fast pick me up.</li>
            <li> Great for short hair that gives some curl but not a lot.</li>
            <li> It heats up nicely and the temperature control really helps you regulate the heat on any type of hair.</li>
            <li> Feels comfortable in your hand.  </li>
            <li> This curling iron is great for short hair styles.  </li>
            <li> I especially appreciated longer cord.</li>
            <li> and it is smooth.</li>
            <li> Liked it so much ordered one for home, too.  </li>
            <li> This hair curling iron was a gift - it is easily a salon grade tool with he long cord and great controls.  </li>
            <li> This curling iron is quick heating and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, I love Hot Tools.  </li>
            <li> Love the Hot Tools.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, professional model that really holds the heat and the iron lasts for years.</li>
            <li> As of right now my curls have lasted a full 24 hours!</li>
            <li> My hair is hard to curl so this is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> If you need a 1/2 inch curling iron (hard to find in stores), this is one is excellent.  </li>
            <li> thanks so much!!!!</li>
            <li> Grabs strands tightly on first try, making it easy and quick to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also quick to heat up.  </li>
            <li> This iron is sleek and beyond all expectations, heats quickly; and echo others who caution to use lowest setting ( quite sufficient).</li>
            <li> Heats quickly and&lt;br /&gt;cools quickly.  </li>
            <li> It does get very hot, so you probably won&#x27;t even need the highest setting.</li>
            <li> It does get very hot</li>
            <li> I gets hot super fast, and even better?  </li>
            <li> It heats up fast and the curls stay without using any hair sprays!!</li>
            <li> It seems to be well made, and they even included an extra spring mechanism in case the one on it breaks (and that does seem to be the part of curling irons that breaks most often!)  </li>
            <li> i jurt wrap my hair around it for cute natural or beachy waves.</li>
            <li> I was amazed when I saw it on Amazon for such a spectacular price.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it worked fine, nice long cord, reasonable price.</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> This was right before xmas, and I mentioned it to my youngest son.  </li>
            <li> Heats up very quickly and gives you nice tight curls.</li>
            <li> I have used Hot Tools Professional Curling Irons for many years, this one that I just bought the 1/2 &amp;#34; barrel works</li>
            <li> There are __ mini __ irons, (very short ) however would not find suitable.</li>
            <li> I have very fine short hair</li>
            <li> It even holds my very fine short hair when I curl it.  </li>
            <li> If you have never tried hot Tools and have hard to curl hair I strongly suggest purchasing!!!</li>
            <li> quick fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.......warms quickly</li>
            <li> Another quality product from Hot Tools.</li>
            <li> When I first curled my hair</li>
            <li> Does not get as hot as the iron I replaced.</li>
            <li> Have been using hot tools for years.  </li>
            <li> This is not the first time I have used this product.</li>
            <li> I have used Hot Tools for years</li>
            <li> The Hot Tools curling iron has met all my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally impressed, I would totally recommend this to anyone who can&#x27;t stand the stickiness of hairspray and those who appreciate long lasting curls!</li>
            <li> They are very cute tight waves.</li>
            <li> Gets hot fast.</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;ll admit, I haven&#x27;t bought a new curling iron for about ten years.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> fast to heat and fast to curl</li>
            <li> Two additional springs included in package much appreciated and sign of quality product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real winner.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and has a quarantee.</li>
            <li> and I find that these tools are very durable.</li>
            <li> Who would have thought the technology would have changed so much?  </li>
            <li> The service was fast and efficient.</li>
            <li> I is very convenient to order.</li>
            <li> I have short, super straight hair and need to just touch the tips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so thankful I was able to purchase from your company, as this size and brand is one I could not do my fine, thin hair without.  </li>
            <li> Long barrel, sturdy spring, and a nice long cord.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend..</li>
            <li> This is my second product that I purchased from Hot Tools and would recommend any of their products!</li>
            <li> Does not really work on short hair--would work best on hair that is at least 2 1/2&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is exactly like all the other reliable Hot Tools curling irons!</li>
            <li> Hot rollers and curling iron curls only last about 2 hours if im lucky.</li>
            <li> This is a very professional high quality product.</li>
            <li> I wash it, use a curl activator, let it thoroughly dry, then curl bits, especially on the top that isn&#x27;t as curly, spray with some hairspray</li>
            <li> Would not ever buy another Curling Iron other that the Hot Tools! !</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take very much to make a curl and the curls really last.  </li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and makes a nice tight small curl.</li>
            <li> and I just noticed last week that it&#x27;s the exact model my hairstylist uses at the salon which tells me</li>
            <li> Way too small, I returned it for the 3/4 inch one - much better.  </li>
            <li> It has a wide range of temperatures, heats up quickly, comes with replacement springs.  </li>
            <li> it is soft and does not kink the swivel works</li>
            <li> so much I am going to order it in a different rod size!</li>
            <li> Who says kids (even adult ones) don&#x27;t listen?  </li>
            <li> The barrel is thin enough to wrap my hair all the way around twice to get a good curl</li>
            <li> The first one I used  daily for over 3 years until finally, the cord connection became unreliable.  </li>
            <li> This seems like a decent curling iron, I have permed hair, the perm is starting to fade</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long cord is also very helpful.</li>
            <li> The only product I used was heat protectant and a little strong hold hairspray and gently brushed the waves out.</li>
            <li> For my thick wavy hair, it works better than a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses Hot tools and she recommended the brand to me a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I immediately ordered a new one; no need to research other replacements.</li>
            <li> 3 months later, I got it back out to use and the black soft grip was tacky, sticky, like it was deteriorating!</li>
            <li> Really like the extra spring, because that is what usually gives out on the cheaper products.</li>
            <li> They heat instantly and seem to have a long life span.</li>
            <li> They work well and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I thought my curls were going to just fall flat after a couple of hours</li>
            <li> Given how frequently it was used, I did not find this troubling as it is a common problem over time with frequently used curling irons.</li>
            <li> The wire does not seem to be twisting on itself and is quite long.</li>
            <li> My hair is really thick and straight</li>
            <li> I bought an other brand for about the same money</li>
            <li> I have very short grey hair and need to add waves or a little curl.  </li>
            <li> I have straight very hard to curl hair even when I sleep with curlers in.</li>
            <li> and it was a little too big for the look I want.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, short to medium hair that has natural wave/curl.  </li>
            <li> so if you want it to actually curl your hair you may want at least a 1 inch rod.  </li>
            <li> It cools down almost immediately once it is unplugged.  </li>
            <li> I had been looking for a half inch curling iron for a number of months</li>
            <li> Cut curl time to fraction of any previously owned  iron.</li>
            <li> The size is a little small...creates tight corkscrews.  </li>
            <li> but they were not available in any of the stores.</li>
            <li> I had tried multiple small curling irons (did I mention my hair is very thick?).  </li>
            <li> Will curl very tight curls.  </li>
            <li> Head conductor of electricity is small</li>
            <li> Need to return as to small</li>
            <li> and I wanted a curling iron with a small barrel to give me ringlets, until we can perm it again.</li>
            <li> Hard to find this size curling iron in the stores.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is now past the date to return.</li>
            <li> It has been difficult for me to find a curing iron of this size in the usual places.  </li>
            <li> and I left it somewhere when I was traveling :(</li>
            <li> What a comparison to another curling iron I bought recently and hated.</li>
            <li> Very hard to find but not on Amazon!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the 1/2 inch barrel. Very hard to find but not on Amazon! Great for short hair that gives some curl but not a lot.</li>
            <li> Only brand of curling iron I have used in probably 10 years. You will love it.</li>
            <li> The Curling Iron arrived in excellent condition.  My hair is hard to curl so this is perfect for me. The multi-heat control lets me adjust the heat.  I am very pleased with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Betty Kelly</li>
            <li> If you need a 1/2 inch curling iron (hard to find in stores), this is one is excellent.  It has a wide range of temperatures, heats up quickly, comes with replacement springs.  This is my second of this model.  The first one I used  daily for over 3 years until finally, the cord connection became unreliable.  The heat would come on and off as I was using it.  Given how frequently it was used, I did not find this troubling as it is a common problem over time with frequently used curling irons. I immediately ordered a new one; no need to research other replacements.</li>
            <li> This is the best curling iron ever made.  The different settings available make it easy to keep from burning very fine hair and the higher settings are excellent for that fast pick me up.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase.  I had been looking for a half inch curling iron for a number of months but they were not available in any of the stores.</li>
            <li> not enough heat returned for credit</li>
            <li> Great product, just what was described, my daughter in law loved it for Christmas, she had it on her wish list.  I love Amazon wish lists, they are so helpful.  thanks so much!!!!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this curling iron. It heats up nicely and the temperature control really helps you regulate the heat on any type of hair. This is my second product that I purchased from Hot Tools and would recommend any of their products!</li>
            <li> I used this curling iron for about a month, then put it up when I decided to staighten my hair for a change. 3 months later, I got it back out to use and the black soft grip was tacky, sticky, like it was deteriorating! I never used hairspray or anything that I can attribute this to.  Unfortunately, it is now past the date to return. Otherwise, it worked fine, nice long cord, reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is the very same one my hairdresser uses in her salon on her clients.  Was recommended by her.  It is a very quick heat up curling iron.  Feels comfortable in your hand.  Easy to work with.  Will curl very tight curls.  I used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair by using large sections of hair and it produced nice spiral curls.  It does get very hot, so you probably won&#x27;t even need the highest setting.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron.  For my thick wavy hair, it works better than a flat iron.  Great for the price and I just noticed last week that it&#x27;s the exact model my hairstylist uses at the salon which tells me it&#x27;s a good choice.  It&#x27;s also quick to heat up.  Just as a note,  I purchased the 1/2 inch rod which of course is a smaller size so if you want it to actually curl your hair you may want at least a 1 inch rod.  Have no complaints though and may buy another one for spair.</li>
            <li> This is the only place I could find this size curling iron which I have used for years as I have really short hair. It&#x27;s great, professional model that really holds the heat and the iron lasts for years. I bought two to be on the \\&quot;safe\\&quot; side. Prompt shipment and great price. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Love it. I love the on/off switch and the way it curls my hair. It heats up super quick and does a great job. I even ordered another size in this line because it works so well, very happy.</li>
            <li> This is the best value , most comfortable iron ever used, don&#x27;t know why it is not promoted as the best most comfortable iron on the market.....no need to spend more money.....Roy</li>
            <li> hi&lt;br /&gt;its very good item&lt;br /&gt;but&lt;br /&gt;the Head conductor of electricity is small&lt;br /&gt;so you should buy another big head to can you use the iron.</li>
            <li> Received 2/5/15, and it totally quit working on 2/26/15.  It was a great curling iron, when it worked!</li>
            <li> Need to return as to small</li>
            <li> This is  a product I&#x27;ve had difficulty finding in this mini size.  I&#x27;m so thankful I was able to purchase from your company, as this size and brand is one I could not do my fine, thin hair without.  By far, it&#x27;s the best!!!</li>
            <li> This curling iron is great for short hair styles.  It heats very quickly and is easy and comfortable to use.  I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This seems like a decent curling iron, I have permed hair, the perm is starting to fade and I wanted a curling iron with a small barrel to give me ringlets, until we can perm it again. I wash it, use a curl activator, let it thoroughly dry, then curl bits, especially on the top that isn&#x27;t as curly, spray with some hairspray and it&#x27;s good to go. Then I don&#x27;t wash it for a couple of days, just add a bit of water to reactivate the curl, maybe recurl a strand or two and that&#x27;s it!</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron. Gets hot fast.</li>
            <li> Another quality product from Hot Tools.</li>
            <li> Product was for my wife who loves it.  Can curl hair a lot faster than the store bought curling irons.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing curling iron! I dont use the clamp..i jurt wrap my hair around it for cute natural or beachy waves. My waves holds all day and i dont have to use any hairspray at all. I get looks/smiles from guys all the time and compliments when i use this iron haha. Thats a PLUS! But what i love the most is the thought that i got a professional salon curling iron for a great price! xoxo</li>
            <li> would not do without this iron and recommend it very highly  only wish i could get it in canada for the same price</li>
            <li> I use the four stars, the heating element could have a hotter setting, to receive five stars from me.  I do like the iron.</li>
            <li> I had been having trouble finding this size barrel, so I went straight to the source. My hairdresser uses Hot tools and she recommended the brand to me a few years ago. I have larger size barrels and they last forever. A great purchase.</li>
            <li> I have straight very hard to curl hair even when I sleep with curlers in. Hot rollers and curling iron curls only last about 2 hours if im lucky. I recently cut my hair off to my shoulders and am determined to achieve the wavy bob look. I bought the 1&amp;#34; from Walmart and it was a little too big for the look I want. I decided to try the 1/2&amp;#34;. As of right now my curls have lasted a full 24 hours! They are very cute tight waves. When I first curled my hair it was too curly when using the clip. I tried again by wrapping my hair around without using the clip like you would for a wand it came out perfect. The only product I used was heat protectant and a little strong hold hairspray and gently brushed the waves out. I am in shock for how well these look on day 2!!! If you have never tried hot Tools and have hard to curl hair I strongly suggest purchasing!!! And Amazon has the best prices I have seen. :)</li>
            <li> It is imperative to have a curling iron that has varying temperatures &amp; this curling iron has that feature.  Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Im in love with this curling iron its amazing its my first one and i plan to buy more to add to my collection!! It heats up fast and the curls stay without using any hair sprays!!</li>
            <li> I have very fine short hair and this is the best curling iron I have ever used. The barrel is thin enough to wrap my hair all the way around twice to get a good curl and I can easily just the temperature.</li>
            <li> I needed a curling iron which heated up well, to set the curls in my wavy hair.  This is a nice curling iron, which also has a temperature/heat control feature.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a mini half-inch rod curling iron, this the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Does not get as hot as the iron I replaced.</li>
            <li> fast to heat and fast to curl</li>
            <li> Does not really work on short hair--would work best on hair that is at least 2 1/2&amp;#34;. Definitely should not be used on fine&lt;br /&gt;fair even at the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> Excellent tool! Highly recommend..</li>
            <li> All the claims are accurate!  This is a terrific product.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Have been using hot tools for years.  They heat instantly and seem to have a long life span.</li>
            <li> Just love this!  Grabs strands tightly on first try, making it easy and quick to curl my hair.  What a comparison to another curling iron I bought recently and hated.</li>
            <li> This curling iron heats up so fast it is used in most beauty shops great product</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a very good grip.</li>
            <li> Unsure why the mini.  designation -- as barrel is 6 inches  with 1 inch tip finger protection.  Perfect 1/2 inch barrel just right. There are __ mini __ irons, (very short ) however would not find suitable. This iron is sleek and beyond all expectations, heats quickly; and echo others who caution to use lowest setting ( quite sufficient). Holds hair with fine grip and curls short hair wonderfully. I especially appreciated longer cord. Cut curl time to fraction of any previously owned  iron. Two additional springs included in package much appreciated and sign of quality product. Packing great and received ASAP.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this curling iron - I like the range of temperature settings, and the barrel size works great for my short, fine hair.  It seems to be well made, and they even included an extra spring mechanism in case the one on it breaks (and that does seem to be the part of curling irons that breaks most often!)  I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron. It&#x27;s a real winner. Heats up quickly and makes a nice tight small curl. It&#x27;s long cord is also very helpful.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is quick heating and easy to use.  It has been difficult for me to find a curing iron of this size in the usual places.  I had to order it online.  This is the best operating curling iron I have owned in 50 years.  Reliable and the heat setings are many.  I have very short hair and it is perfect for just a little lift on the top of the head.</li>
            <li> quick fast delivery. Item perfect. thanks</li>
            <li> I have used Hot Tools Professional Curling Irons for many years, this one that I just bought the 1/2 &amp;#34; barrel works&lt;br /&gt;wonders for my short hair.  Would not ever buy another Curling Iron other that the Hot Tools! !</li>
            <li> I was very pleased when I opened the package and discovered the curling iron was exactly as I visioned it would be.  I would order again and again.  Happy with this purchase..</li>
            <li> This hair curling iron was a gift - it is easily a salon grade tool with he long cord and great controls.  I would be surprised if this was not the number one iron for its size - my wife was totally impressed that I found this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I bought the 1/2 inch curling iron but the barrel is more like 1/4 inch.  Way too small, I returned it for the 3/4 inch one - much better.  Otherwise, I love Hot Tools.  I have been using their products for years.  They work well and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have short, super straight hair and need to just touch the tips. Love, love, love Hot Tools. Will definitely buy again!!! And Again!!</li>
            <li> The best curling iron you can get if you want a hot one that heats up quickly!</li>
            <li> This is a very professional high quality product. The price is reasonable and has a quarantee.</li>
            <li> The best curling iron out there! I had one for years and I left it somewhere when I was traveling :( So I had to buy another one. There is nothing else like this one. LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Very elegant, my first curler so I have nothing to compare it to, maybe I just don&#x27;t know better! Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li> My hair is really thick and straight and I was so impressed with this hair curler! I thought my curls were going to just fall flat after a couple of hours but they stayed curly for hours! I didn&#x27;t even use hair spray for this. I&#x27;m totally impressed, I would totally recommend this to anyone who can&#x27;t stand the stickiness of hairspray and those who appreciate long lasting curls!</li>
            <li> This was turned on the lowest dial, and literally burned instanly through my hair...I was left holding a chunk of my burned off hair...um...I am guessing this is a malfunction??</li>
            <li> Nice curling iron. Long barrel, sturdy spring, and a nice long cord.</li>
            <li> This is not the first time I have used this product. I love it and the price was better than Sallys</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.......warms quickly</li>
            <li> This is exactly like all the other reliable Hot Tools curling irons! I love it! Heats up very quickly and gives you nice tight curls.</li>
            <li> I have used Hot Tools for years and I do love them you can control the temp and they are well made I especially like the electrical cord it is soft and does not kink the swivel works well so no cord tangles</li>
            <li> I like how fine you can make your settings for heat and I find that these tools are very durable.</li>
            <li> Love the Hot Tools.  Will purchase again when needed.</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;ll admit, I haven&#x27;t bought a new curling iron for about ten years.  Who would have thought the technology would have changed so much?  I LOVE this curling iron.  I gets hot super fast, and even better?  It cools down almost immediately once it is unplugged.  Great feature when fixing your hair before heading to the airport!  The size is a little small...creates tight corkscrews.  I love the curling iron so much I am going to order it in a different rod size!</li>
            <li> Best curling iron I ever bought! And I&#x27;ve bought lots!!  It even holds my very fine short hair when I curl it.  Has a great swivel end; the cord doesn&#x27;t turn the whole bottom does and it is smooth. I bought an other brand for about the same money and it wouldn&#x27;t even hold my hair.</li>
            <li> The Hot Tools curling iron has met all my expectations.  The service was fast and efficient.I is very convenient to order.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Very good quality.  Heats very quickly.  Doesn&#x27;t take very much to make a curl and the curls really last.  I have very short grey hair and need to add waves or a little curl.  This works perfectly.  May even buy another.  Really like the extra spring, because that is what usually gives out on the cheaper products.</li>
            <li> Very good curling iron!  The best yet!  Works good and came swiftly. I would recommend it to anyone&lt;br /&gt;Thank you..</li>
            <li> I have very thick, short to medium hair that has natural wave/curl.  I don&#x27;t wash my hair daily, so need a style that will last 2-3 days.  I had tried multiple small curling irons (did I mention my hair is very thick?).  None of them did the job.  I needed a curling iron to simply finish my style, and have it last.  My stylist recommended this brand.  She offered to get it for me when they went on sale.  I was amazed when I saw it on Amazon for such a spectacular price.  This was right before xmas, and I mentioned it to my youngest son.  Who says kids (even adult ones) don&#x27;t listen?  I got this amazing curling iron and could not be happier.  I expect many &amp;#34;good hair days&amp;#34; from what I&#x27;ve experienced so far.  BTW, I use the highest setting because of the thickness of my hair.  I have never had any problems at this temperature.  I would simply caution...know your hair before using.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. It does get very hot so you need to adjust time but works well.  The wire does not seem to be twisting on itself and is quite long.</li>
            <li> Hard to find this size curling iron in the stores.  Sent one to my daughter&#x27;s for when I stay there.  Heats quickly and&lt;br /&gt;cools quickly.  Liked it so much ordered one for home, too.  Reader 6</li>
