            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it, probably won&#x27;t be buying it again</li>
            <li>and it looks amazing on me!</li>
            <li>It is a good product though</li>
            <li>I use this in conjunction with the light bronzer palette for a perfect look.</li>
            <li>This is good stuff.  </li>
            <li>It is a good product.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this as a good buy.</li>
            <li>The color is great and goes on nicely.  </li>
            <li>The price is a good value as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found a good blush that is inexpensive and looks good all day.</li>
            <li>but it just looks okay on me!</li>
            <li>Yields a nice rosy, healthy glow that enhances my fair skin tone.</li>
            <li>Nice color.</li>
            <li>I swirl my own brush (I never use the included ones) and blow off the excess and blend, blend, blend.  </li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>Nice blush.</li>
            <li>But by applying with a very light touch is seems to be ok.</li>
            <li>I love this palette of blush.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for years and love it.</li>
            <li>The extra mini brush was a very pleasant bonus!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love how it goes on.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite blush.</li>
            <li>definitely one the best powder blush-ons I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I love all of their products because they tend to stay on all day.  </li>
            <li>Wish they made this color in a cream......a better choice for drier skin.</li>
            <li>I love Physician Formula products and will continue to buy from them.</li>
            <li>But i am most satisfied with physicians formula&#x27;s blush.  </li>
            <li>and this shade looks perfect with my skin tone in summer with a tan or in winter when I am very white.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t powdery or cakey, its a perfect middle zone.</li>
            <li>the Blushing Rose gives me the right balance of color without the clown like appearance.  </li>
            <li>Nothing impressive just a pretty standard blush.</li>
            <li>The mixture is just perfect for a soft natural looking blush.</li>
            <li>sometimes the color pallet you want is not always available, so I found it at Amazon.</li>
            <li>on smooth.</li>
            <li>Animal cruelty free.</li>
            <li>So far so good though.</li>
            <li>The quality is great, and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;Blushing Rose is a beautiful light pink, and it looks natural.</li>
            <li>It does not last more than 4-5 hours, but I would rather reapply my blush than have redness from zits!</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and this is way to pink for me.</li>
            <li>I love it, the color is a natural blush color.</li>
            <li>Love the natural feel and look of this blush.</li>
            <li>Is not harsh, more so to add colour to your face.</li>
            <li>This goes on at just the right shade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of the little brush that comes with it, but the color is just perfect.</li>
            <li>It has a very nice shade of pink and looks very natural.</li>
            <li>You really only need a very light dusting to get the rosy glow, otherwise you will look like a sunburnt clown.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I love the palette blush rather than a single color blush.</li>
            <li>Somewhat lighter than I expected, but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li>Just be careful to not drop it, because like many compacts, the blush will shatter.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality product that I would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li>That makes it unusual for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m use to light to sheer blushes...</li>
            <li>Beautiful nuanced  pink that works year round.</li>
            <li>Add less, because you can always layer more if needed.</li>
            <li>I particularly like their blush line.  </li>
            <li>Like the powder, but may try a cream as I am older, also would go with a peachier color</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been super basic when it comes to make up (foundation + mascara)</li>
            <li>I tended to wear my blush too dark and looked for a product that would be more natural.</li>
            <li>Bought this because a few pale ladies on here said it worked great for their skin</li>
            <li>It has a very natural hue and the color lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>I tried something different when I ran out of the first palette, and it didn&#x27;t compare , so I ordered this again</li>
            <li>First off makeup is a very personal product.</li>
            <li>so I was looking for a blush that felt natural.</li>
            <li>Nice product, but the compact was broken upon arrival.</li>
            <li>Works for me without breakouts, Not sure that I am getting older though that I will be able to use this dry product.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product especially since I usually buy the most expensive name brand products.</li>
            <li>This blend is a little too pink even for me with my light skin tone, so i haven&#x27;t used it much.</li>
            <li>I am a natural blonde with lighter skin and this is working well for me</li>
            <li>Looks natural on mu cheeks and it is last longer.</li>
            <li>I have used blush from all kinds of companies including Chanel and other high end name brands.</li>
            <li>I was a little disappointed in this product in that it didn&#x27;t go on as smoothly as I would have liked it too.</li>

            <li> It has a very nice shade of pink and looks very natural. I only gave it four stars because I found that it didn&#x27;t transfer well to the brush. There was also a little scuff mark on the package, but that&#x27;s not really a big deal. The extra mini brush was a very pleasant bonus!</li>
            <li> covers well with no break outs.  product is affordable. I love it.</li>
            <li> Love how it goes on.  The color works well for me.  I don&#x27;t think I will need a summer blush and and winter blush, I think I can use it all year round.</li>

            <li> definitely one the best powder blush-ons I&#x27;ve tried. Looks natural on mu cheeks and it is last longer. Definitely a spot on!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clump. It stays in cake form.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on smooth. I&#x27;ve used this before and like it for my coloring.</li>
            <li> I always buy Physicians Formula for my blush and coverup. The quality is great, and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;Blushing Rose is a beautiful light pink, and it looks natural. Just be careful to not drop it, because like many compacts, the blush will shatter.</li>
            <li> Beautiful blush! This goes on at just the right shade. I tended to wear my blush too dark and looked for a product that would be more natural. This is perfect and a great price. Doesn&#x27;t take a lot of product to get the shade you want. Will use this for now on.</li>
            <li> I am 65 years old and have been using Physicians Formula products for the past 5 years.  I love all of their products because they tend to stay on all day.

            <li> I have used this product for years. Works for me without breakouts, Not sure that I am getting older though that I will be able to use this dry product. Don&#x27;t want it get stuck in my wrinkles. So far so good though.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and this is way to pink for me. However, that&#x27;s my fault. I love Physician Formula products and will continue to buy from them.</li>

            <li> Great blush that has excellent longevity. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Perfect shade</li>
            <li> Great product line!  This is the touch of color you are looking for.  Not too noticeable, yet does the job!</li>
            <li> Slept with the blush still on and my skin did not break out the next day. I find this blush is too pink and so I just brush a little bit each time. I use this along with the PF bronzer.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff.  I like it.  It is a good product.  I would recommend this as a good buy.</li>
            <li> Great color mixture for my olive skin tone!</li>
            <li> First off makeup is a very personal product. I found this to be a little harsh with my skin tone. But by applying with a very light touch is seems to be ok.</li>
            <li> Another great product by Physicians Formula!  The color is great and goes on nicely.  I only wish a mirror was attached.</li>
            <li> I love it, the color is a natural blush color. It isn&#x27;t powdery or cakey, its a perfect middle zone. I am very satisfied with this product especially since I usually buy the most expensive name brand products. I saved a lot of money purchasing this instead. I&#x27;m glad I found a good blush that is inexpensive and looks good all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m use to light to sheer blushes... This one has some serious pigment. You really only need a very light dusting to get the rosy glow, otherwise you will look like a sunburnt clown. Not complaining though, this blush will go a long way for the money. Perfect shade too.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect blush I&#x27;m very fair skinned and it looks amazing on me! Deff recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> Like the powder, but may try a cream as I am older, also would go with a peachier color I think, I apply with this with a slanted Koboki brush.</li>
            <li> Love the natural feel and look of this blush. The price is a good value as well.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in this product in that it didn&#x27;t go on as smoothly as I would have liked it too.</li>
            <li> Nice blush. Is not harsh, more so to add colour to your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been super basic when it comes to make up (foundation + mascara) so I was looking for a blush that felt natural. I&#x27;m not a big fan of the little brush that comes with it, but the color is just perfect.</li>
