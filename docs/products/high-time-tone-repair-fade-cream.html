    <ol>
            <li>Very happy.</li>
            <li>She got great results in two weeks with this cream.</li>
            <li>Product works great</li>
            <li>I liked that it worked well under my makeup too</li>
            <li>I put a dab of it on one finger and spread it mostly under my neck, and also on my cheeks</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon, for being product wh###s. :P</li>
            <li>and this product has a pleasant fragrance this tone repair does just that and is very affordable for those pesky spots</li>
            <li>It seems to be a good moisturiser but can&#x27;t really tell any tone change.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve really liked it since the first day.</li>
            <li>She recommends it 100%, says the price for the product is great and it outperforms brands such as L&#x27;oreal, Neutrogena, etc.</li>
            <li>When I first saw this product it was at a local Wal-Mart, so i bought it, tried it, and was impressed quickly.</li>
            <li>I am surprised to say that I actually really liked this product.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work for my skin, it was okay.</li>
            <li>Do not use this by the palm full and spread it everywhere like face lotion because it&#x27;s not lotion, and you will run out of it quickly.</li>
            <li>Quickly.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t it so don&#x27;t expect those blemishes to fade away so quickly.</li>
            <li>Also, the ingredients are not the most natural so you can create health issues for your skin over time.</li>
            <li>I tried several tone repair products but none of them seem to work effectively.  </li>
            <li>I used up the first jar and didnt see any results.</li>
            <li>First of all, I started using this because I was look for a tone control product.</li>
            <li>It really helped with my dry skin right away, my skin was smooth and mosturised with one use.</li>
            <li>Also for me, this little jar lasts a good while and I will explain later.</li>
            <li>Decent fade cream but no more advanced or special than anything ambi offers in the stores.  </li>
            <li>Toooooo Pricey , more than usual ....</li>
            <li>The only caution I would give is that I would not use this product with depilatories (e.g. Magic Shave, or other razor-less chemicals).  </li>
            <li>You can also look into natural soaps that have alpha hydroxy acids in them or a lotion that you can apply to your body.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I could understand if it was a fast acting fade cream with the fading power of whatever Michael Jackson used.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty bad acne scars and this didn&#x27;t do anything to them, it kind of helps the razor redness mark things</li>
            <li>I was surprised because I am a Caucasian female and though this product is for men I thought I&#x27;d try it anyway.</li>
            <li>Repaired dark areas from years of shaving on my neck very well!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very inexpensive compared to other tone repairs</li>
    </ol>

            <li> i haven&#x27;t much luck with creams in the past, this one is no exception, i threw it away after a while, won&#x27;t buy it again</li>

            <li> I would reccomend this product especially if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been so hard to find a product that really does what it says that it&#x27;s going to do when it comes to skin discoloration.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product off and on for a long time and it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I ordered it once from another store, but the two jars lasted so long</li>

            <li> The reason why this little jar last is because I on need to use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not a fan of using these kinds of creams because they come in a little jar so you can only use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> This is a small jar and so it won&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s average, so</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dark spots and it does not work at all for me.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no special scent to it</li>
            <li> Then I take another small dab and spread it on my forehead to correct the somewhat dark spot below my hairline.</li>
            <li> I am not pleased at all, still no results...  </li>
            <li> but it really is not good not worth the money look around for something else.</li>
            <li> not sure what that&#x27;s all about</li>
            <li> Wal-Mart no longer stocks it, in my area at least.</li>
            <li> But when I got the product from the mail it is very small, in my opinion it isn&#x27;t work $7.</li>
            <li> They dark areas started out real subtle but over the years of continuous shaving I could tell they were getting worse.</li>
            <li> but the smell is weird for lotion.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to spend some money</li>
            <li> This is a very very disappointing product, since I haven&#x27;t tried it yet</li>

            <li> First off, when i recieved this product in the mail i thought it was something else because it was very small, not much bigger than a carmex jar. I used up the first jar and didnt see any results. I know it takes a while for a product to work sometimes so i went ahead and purchased another jar. I am not pleased at all, still no results...  Do not buy this.</li>
            <li> I am surprised to say that I actually really liked this product. I was surprised because I am a Caucasian female and though this product is for men I thought I&#x27;d try it anyway. I bought it about 3 weeks ago and I&#x27;ve really liked it since the first day. It really helped with my dry skin right away, my skin was smooth and mosturised with one use. I liked that it worked well under my makeup too, I didn&#x27;t have to use primer because this worked as one : my makeup stuck to it like glue. I didnt notice my dark spots fading right away but now that I have been useing it for a few weeks I am starting to see my skin has begun to even out and the spots are beginning to fade. I would reccomend this product especially if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I saw the effects almost immediatley and this product has a pleasant fragrance this tone repair does just that and is very affordable for those pesky spots</li>
            <li> I have been using this product off and on for a long time and it works as advertised. Also for me, this little jar lasts a good while and I will explain later. First of all, I started using this because I was look for a tone control product. The skin on my face darkened over time, I guess from shaving. When I first saw this product it was at a local Wal-Mart, so i bought it, tried it, and was impressed quickly. Quickly. The reason why this little jar last is because I on need to use it sparingly. I put a dab of it on one finger and spread it mostly under my neck, and also on my cheeks -where I shave. Then I take another small dab and spread it on my forehead to correct the somewhat dark spot below my hairline. That&#x27;s it. 2 dabs is all you need. Do not use this by the palm full and spread it everywhere like face lotion because it&#x27;s not lotion, and you will run out of it quickly. My review today is because I was looking for it. Wal-Mart no longer stocks it, in my area at least. I ordered it once from another store, but the two jars lasted so long I forgot where I found it. Thanks Amazon, for being product wh###s. :P</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for my skin, it was okay. It worked a tiny bit. There&#x27;s no special scent to it, it&#x27;s average, so next time I buy tone repair I&#x27;m buying another product.</li>
            <li> I actually use this product for dark spots from acne scars and other discoloration of my skin and I&#x27;ve already seen a difference just after 5 days!  It&#x27;s been so hard to find a product that really does what it says that it&#x27;s going to do when it comes to skin discoloration. I like that it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and it also seems to act as a moisturizer on my problem areas. I understand that this product was marketed for male use but I&#x27;ve gotten the results I was looking for, and will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I feel like this product is working but it takes a while. I use it with my micro needle roller.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t much luck with creams in the past, this one is no exception, i threw it away after a while, won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> Didnt work the way I thought it would work and I dont know if it works the way it should work. No no no no no no no nope!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it. She recommends it 100%, says the price for the product is great and it outperforms brands such as L&#x27;oreal, Neutrogena, etc. She got great results in two weeks with this cream.</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad acne scars and this didn&#x27;t do anything to them, it kind of helps the razor redness mark things but it really is not good not worth the money look around for something else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not a fan of using these kinds of creams because they come in a little jar so you can only use it sparingly. Also, the ingredients are not the most natural so you can create health issues for your skin over time. I would suggest going to a dermatologist. You can also look into natural soaps that have alpha hydroxy acids in them or a lotion that you can apply to your body. Don&#x27;t be afraid to spend some money or you may never fix your skin ailment.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dark spots and it does not work at all for me.Maybe it&#x27;s because I have sensitive skin but it didn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> Toooooo Pricey , more than usual ....Product works great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream works and does even the tone of your skin but u must use as directed to</li>
            <li> I used it regularly but the dark spots did not disappear completely. I have since used another. Trial and error I guess.</li>
            <li> Repaired dark areas from years of shaving on my neck very well! The item worked within 3 days of use. Very happy.</li>
            <li> I am an African-American male, and over time since I have been shaving I have developed some dark areas on my face and head.  They dark areas started out real subtle but over the years of continuous shaving I could tell they were getting worse. I tried several tone repair products but none of them seem to work effectively.  I decided to give this product a try and within 2 weeks I could see a noticeable difference.  I use the product in the morning and at night.  It&#x27;s very inexpensive compared to other tone repairs and I do not have use a lot to cover my head and face.  The only caution I would give is that I would not use this product with depilatories (e.g. Magic Shave, or other razor-less chemicals).  The chemicals in those products mixed with this product could cause a reverse reaction on your skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very very disappointing product, since I haven&#x27;t tried it yet I&#x27;ll give it a two star product. But when I got the product from the mail it is very small, in my opinion it isn&#x27;t work $7. The product says it&#x27;s 1.6 oz... nope that is a BIG FAT LIE! When I got the product it is only .5 oz. Beware buyers... it&#x27;s a scam!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and if you wanted to return the item, you have to pay for the shipping itself!</li>
            <li> It seems to be a good moisturiser but can&#x27;t really tell any tone change. It smells like food cooking ..... not sure what that&#x27;s all about but the smell is weird for lotion.</li>
            <li> Decent fade cream but no more advanced or special than anything ambi offers in the stores.  This is a small jar and so it won&#x27;t last very long.  I could understand if it was a fast acting fade cream with the fading power of whatever Michael Jackson used.  This isn&#x27;t it so don&#x27;t expect those blemishes to fade away so quickly.</li>
