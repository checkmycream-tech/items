            <li>We love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful to find one that I feel safe using, especially in my mouth.</li>

            <li>I love the dispenser colors too.</li>
            <li>I love this floss.  </li>
            <li>This incredibly gentle floss has a puffy texture that has to be experienced.</li>
            <li>and I can visibly see much more &amp;#34;junk and plaque&amp;#34; on the string than with</li>
            <li>Now go enjoy this amazing cloth-like floss.</li>
            <li>Simply the best floss in existence.</li>
            <li>The colorful packaging is so cute!</li>
            <li>The best part of this floss for me is that the fibers fan out really wide when between the teeth</li>
            <li>Not exaggerating, it is really that good.</li>
            <li>so this is easy to hold onto while flossing as well as getting it out of the container.)</li>
            <li>The container is designed so it is easy to tear off the floss without problems.  </li>
            <li>It also has a very mild, pleasant, natural flavor and is easily dispensed.  </li>
            <li>The way it expands between my teeth makes it so much easier to get a good clean feeling and get out any debris.</li>
            <li>As it turns out, the inconvenience had a silver lining because this floss is hands down the best floss out there.</li>
            <li>and we go through it quickly), but found some even cheaper bulk options on amazon!</li>
            <li>In addition to being more effective, they use natural waxes instead of petrochemical wax.      </li>
            <li>This is fabulous floss.</li>
            <li>I told him that I was already inconvenienced and did not have camera available.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s kind of gross, but when I compare what kind of gunk</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great sensation and makes flossing, dare I say, actually fun?!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried another brand of expanding floss before and didn&#x27;t care for it, but this stuff is much more pleasant to use and doesn&#x27;t snag or break between rough teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>also feel like it is eons more effective at actually flossing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s close to the dental floss your dentist uses when you have a pro clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>I like how the packaging slides shut to keep the floss clean when it&#x27;s in your purse or when you&#x27;re traveling.  </li>
            <li>Non-waxy and perfect for getting the hard stuff out.</li>
            <li>We used to buy these at Whole Foods (they give a 10% discount if you buy 12 or more</li>
            <li>My gums feel super clean after using this floss.  </li>
            <li>You can never use any other floss once you have experienced this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have been using floss for 45 years and this is hands down the best not only because it does a better job than any floss I have ever tried</li>
            <li>The floss can basically change from something fluffy to something taut which is excellent as it removes plaque and food more better than other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My order arrived quickly and intact.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I was so happy to discover Dr.  Tung&#x27;s natural floss with natural cardamom flavoring.  </li>
            <li>First I love the container itself, then I love the flavor, and last the floss itself is fantastic-the right density/thickness for my teeth and hands</li>
            <li>They must have improved their floss because it rarely shreds anymore.</li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s pricy, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Came pretty quick too.</li>
            <li>This floss keeps them trouble free!!!</li>
            <li>Can get stringy, but comes right out of teeth.</li>
            <li>Really cleans the gumline cleanly.</li>
            <li>I picked this floss up in the pharmacy initially because I was intrigued by the cardomom flavour, and loved it because of its comfort and the fact that it picks up more plaque and debris than other flosses.  </li>
            <li>The 12 pack is the way to go, really a smart choice!</li>
            <li>I am a flossing addict and for all flossing addicts, I recommend Dr. Tung&#x27;s Smart Floss!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and easy on the gums.</li>
            <li>There is not much to say about this product, other than it&#x27;s the best floss I have ever tried, by miles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also gentle on your gums, and rarely shreds or gets caught.    </li>
            <li>Personal care products have so many synthetic chemicals.</li>
            <li>My dentist first introduced me to this product.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I couldn&#x27;t believe it when I first used it.  </li>
            <li>The flavor is refreshing and different.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting better dental checkups and some of the gum pockets are getting smaller.</li>
            <li>Much better than the &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; thread I find in my local stores.</li>
            <li>the Dr Tung&#x27;s floss does SUCH A BETTER JOB.  </li>
            <li>The fluffy texture makes flossing so much more comfortable on my fingers.  </li>
            <li>This floss actually manages to get there and clean!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d be great if they could figure out a way to be even less package intensive, but otherwise, I can&#x27;t really find a major issue with it.      </li>
            <li>Dr. Tung&#x27;s Smart Floss is in a class by itself.  </li>
            <li>I chose the Smart Floss</li>
            <li>textured Dr. Tung&#x27;s Smart Floss -</li>
            <li>Bought a jumbo pack because both myself and my husband can&#x27;t live without it!!</li>
            <li>Dr. Tung&#x27;s Smart Floss isn&#x27;t sold at the Whole Foods where I shop</li>
            <li>I advise this product if you really care about your teeth.</li>
            <li>Really, just try it you will be a convert.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, the floss is extremely gentle on my gums.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I feel that it cleans really well.  </li>
            <li>when I used to buy this product, it used to shredded a lot because my teeth are spaced very close together.  </li>
            <li>I am just more careful not to let it touch the pointy parts of my teeth</li>
            <li>After eating lunch at Whole Foods, I realized I had forgotten to replenish my stock of dental floss in my car.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Besides being coated naturally, the floss is super high quality and does not shred during use.</li>
            <li>I first bought this floss while on a business trip in New York City.</li>
            <li>It always cleans things out way more than any other floss I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>recommended by dentist&#x27;s office and works better than dental floss I have used from four other manufacturers.</li>
            <li>Not like most other flosses which make you feel as if you&#x27;re flossing with a fishing line!.  </li>
            <li>It also stretches slightly (expands to cover most of your tooth).  </li>
            <li>I have been flossing regularly for twenty years with the standard flosses that most drugstores carry.  </li>
            <li>Wide, picks up everything, never hurts, strong.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it (as I do buying it in bulk to save costs).</li>
            <li>I only got this a couple days ago, but I&#x27;m already sure I won&#x27;t be going back to my old standby, Glide.</li>
            <li>With normal floss, I have to use tape because my teeth tear the wimpy stuff apart.</li>
            <li>(The airline had lost my luggage, forcing me to buy new toiletry items.)</li>
            <li>If you have small spaces between teeth, this floss will get stuck and trying to get it out with more floss</li>
            <li>Use this for a month and you won&#x27;t be able to go back to any other brands.  </li>
            <li>The only wariness I have heard about this expanding teeth floss is that its quite hard to use it if you have close together teeth in your mouth, but as I am using this floss for one year now, I find it perfect for the job, in spite of having no larger than half a millimeter gaps between the teeth.</li>
            <li>but Dr Tung&#x27;s uses a natural coating (plant and beeswax, not petroleum/solvent based wax).</li>
            <li>found this floss at the natural store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There were a few selections available.  </li>
            <li>I have had adult braces, so</li>
            <li>my teeth are fairly close, but probably not as tight as those that complained about shredding.  </li>
            <li>It stretches and is wide enough to get into deep places, and removes more matter than any other floss I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Since my adult braces experience some of my gaps are larger - a tooth was pulled and everything rearranged.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s better than the thin stuff, for me anyway.</li>
            <li>The price was just under $5 including tax, which seemed comparable to the other options at Whole Foods.  </li>
            <li>It gets in between teen no other floss can.</li>
            <li>Love that it expands in between your teeth due to the nature of the \\&quot;thick, fluffy\\&quot; thread.</li>
            <li>This floss works great, but if you have very tight teeth (as I do), it DOES tend to shred between the really tightly spaced teeth, no matter what the other folks say who THINK they have tightly spaced teeth.  </li>
            <li>It is a little more expensive but not so much</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s also gentle on your gums, and rarely shreds or gets caught.    </li>
            <li> Personal care products have so many synthetic chemicals.</li>
            <li> My dentist first introduced me to this product.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I couldn&#x27;t believe it when I first used it.  </li>
            <li> The flavor is refreshing and different.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting better dental checkups and some of the gum pockets are getting smaller.</li>
            <li> Much better than the &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; thread I find in my local stores.</li>
            <li> the Dr Tung&#x27;s floss does SUCH A BETTER JOB.  </li>
            <li> The fluffy texture makes flossing so much more comfortable on my fingers.  </li>
            <li> This floss actually manages to get there and clean!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d be great if they could figure out a way to be even less package intensive, but otherwise, I can&#x27;t really find a major issue with it.      </li>
            <li> Dr. Tung&#x27;s Smart Floss is in a class by itself.  </li>
            <li> I chose the Smart Floss</li>
            <li> textured Dr. Tung&#x27;s Smart Floss -</li>
            <li> Bought a jumbo pack because both myself and my husband can&#x27;t live without it!!</li>
            <li> Dr. Tung&#x27;s Smart Floss isn&#x27;t sold at the Whole Foods where I shop</li>
            <li> I advise this product if you really care about your teeth.</li>
            <li> Really, just try it you will be a convert.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, the floss is extremely gentle on my gums.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I feel that it cleans really well.  </li>
            <li> when I used to buy this product, it used to shredded a lot because my teeth are spaced very close together.  </li>
            <li> I am just more careful not to let it touch the pointy parts of my teeth</li>
            <li> After eating lunch at Whole Foods, I realized I had forgotten to replenish my stock of dental floss in my car.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Besides being coated naturally, the floss is super high quality and does not shred during use.</li>
            <li> I first bought this floss while on a business trip in New York City.</li>
            <li> It always cleans things out way more than any other floss I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> recommended by dentist&#x27;s office and works better than dental floss I have used from four other manufacturers.</li>
            <li> Not like most other flosses which make you feel as if you&#x27;re flossing with a fishing line!.  </li>
            <li> It also stretches slightly (expands to cover most of your tooth).  </li>
            <li> I have been flossing regularly for twenty years with the standard flosses that most drugstores carry.  </li>
            <li> Wide, picks up everything, never hurts, strong.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it (as I do buying it in bulk to save costs).</li>
            <li> I only got this a couple days ago, but I&#x27;m already sure I won&#x27;t be going back to my old standby, Glide.</li>
            <li> With normal floss, I have to use tape because my teeth tear the wimpy stuff apart.</li>
            <li> (The airline had lost my luggage, forcing me to buy new toiletry items.)</li>
            <li> If you have small spaces between teeth, this floss will get stuck and trying to get it out with more floss</li>
            <li> Use this for a month and you won&#x27;t be able to go back to any other brands.  </li>
            <li> The only wariness I have heard about this expanding teeth floss is that its quite hard to use it if you have close together teeth in your mouth, but as I am using this floss for one year now, I find it perfect for the job, in spite of having no larger than half a millimeter gaps between the teeth.</li>
            <li> but Dr Tung&#x27;s uses a natural coating (plant and beeswax, not petroleum/solvent based wax).</li>
            <li> found this floss at the natural store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There were a few selections available.  </li>
            <li> I have had adult braces, so</li>
            <li> my teeth are fairly close, but probably not as tight as those that complained about shredding.  </li>
            <li> It stretches and is wide enough to get into deep places, and removes more matter than any other floss I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Since my adult braces experience some of my gaps are larger - a tooth was pulled and everything rearranged.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s better than the thin stuff, for me anyway.</li>
            <li> The price was just under $5 including tax, which seemed comparable to the other options at Whole Foods.  </li>
            <li> It gets in between teen no other floss can.</li>
            <li> Love that it expands in between your teeth due to the nature of the \\&quot;thick, fluffy\\&quot; thread.</li>
            <li> This floss works great, but if you have very tight teeth (as I do), it DOES tend to shred between the really tightly spaced teeth, no matter what the other folks say who THINK they have tightly spaced teeth.  </li>
            <li> It is a little more expensive but not so much</li>
            <li> At first, the floss was a bit thick and difficult to get used to, but soon after I began to love it.</li>
            <li> It will last me to long time.  </li>
            <li> For one thing, I love the cardamom flavor and how it doesn&#x27;t leave a weird minty wax on my fingers as the other brands tend</li>
            <li> I will never go back to those other standard brands.  </li>
            <li> One way I learned to minimize shredding is to floss straight up and down in those tight spaces - meaning, I don&#x27;t floss at an angle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, yet stretches and really scrubs as you slide the floss between and around the teeth.  </li>
            <li> Other brands of floss will either snap and break or simply get stuck between some of my teeth.</li>
            <li> After one use with this floss and you&#x27;ll never go back to other flosses ever again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that this one may clean better (if you don&#x27;t get it stuck) -- but be careful, since it is a painful, horrible experience to have it shred.</li>
            <li> Once you try it there won&#x27;t be any going back to the other brands!</li>
            <li> The floss itself is high grade, no wax, thin enough to get between crowded teeth, and does not shred.</li>
            <li> The first try was with another vendor who sent the wrong quantity then requiring an return and refund process that caused delay and extra hassle.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t count how many times I would floss with other big name brands and would get bloody gums.</li>
            <li> Will not use any other brands of floss anymore.  </li>
            <li> I searched and found some other brands like Tom&#x27;s</li>
            <li> other brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed that it usually shreds in my back molars where the space is tightest.  </li>
            <li> When I called the seller to complain could barely understand the person answering the phone as his Indian accent was so thick.</li>
            <li> So you have to be very, very careful when you floss between those teeth, or you&#x27;ll end up with pieces stuck between your teeth that you can&#x27;t get out.</li>
            <li> I get out imbetween my teeth using regular, thin, flat floss to the thick(er)</li>
            <li> I just spent about 20 minutes doing nothing but trying to get it out from between my teeth with little success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is NOT worth it.</li>
            <li> I have a couple trouble spots that other flosses didn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li> It was half the price there that it is on here</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stretchy so you can pull it taut to get into tight places between your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I was given this product by my dentist, and I will probably buy it to have it on hand, but there are times that I just want to use my Crest GLIDE product or something smoother, one that gets out the food bits from really tightly spaced teeth without worrying about getting it stuck.</li>
            <li> It stretches a little too, so it can get into really tight spots.</li>
            <li> Not coated with crap and does a better job of scraping off the gunk because it isn&#x27;t so slick and is braided.</li>
            <li> It did take me a little while to get used to using the dispenser.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fluffy and stretchy, so you can pull it taught to get into tight spaces, but once in there, there&#x27;s a lot of surface area to pick everything up.  </li>
            <li> I bought this in bulk to ensure I have this floss all year round.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this floss for the past 3 years.</li>
            <li> Gets caught and breaks up into small strands  between your teeth.  </li>
            <li> THis floss is soft and pliable and manages to pick up a lot of gunk without cutting into my gums.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that it is so hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> Gets in those hard to reach spots you never knew you had.</li>
            <li> So maybe they also need to hire people with common sense!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to use other brands of floss for many years but then found out that they use artificial flavors/ingredients to coat the floss and was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like the cardamom flavor, but it&#x27;s a little weird if you are used to cinnamon or mint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also a fan of Oral B&#x27;s complete-Deep Celan Ultra floss for teeth that are hard to get in between, it&#x27;s a thin cotton (?)</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about this floss?</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive body and do not like those nasty artificial &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; flavorings in conventional flosses.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy them in bulk and goes through them like crazy because I ended up giving them out to friends and coworkers.</li>
            <li> FYI, the scent/flavoring is very subtle if you&#x27;re worried about the cardamom, etc.      </li>
            <li> I have to floss often ever since a crowning went a bit wrong.  </li>
            <li> and I think that prevents cutting of the floss.</li>
            <li> Salad greens, chicken, etc</li>
            <li> but was disappointed but its performance and thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do yourself a favor and switch to Dr. Tungs, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> One of the worst products I have ever used (not just dental products).  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This is the only floss I will use.  It has a texture that gets in and removes more stuff!!  I have a couple trouble spots that other flosses didn&#x27;t help.  This floss keeps them trouble free!!!</li>
            <li> I only got this a couple days ago, but I&#x27;m already sure I won&#x27;t be going back to my old standby, Glide. For one thing, I love the cardamom flavor and how it doesn&#x27;t leave a weird minty wax on my fingers as the other brands tend to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also feel like it is eons more effective at actually flossing. The way it expands between my teeth makes it so much easier to get a good clean feeling and get out any debris. I&#x27;ve tried another brand of expanding floss before and didn&#x27;t care for it, but this stuff is much more pleasant to use and doesn&#x27;t snag or break between rough teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the cute container. I&#x27;m definitely not going back to Glide.</li>
            <li> Best teeth floss I have tried out so far. I am very pleased with this make. It does remove dental plaque and remains of food between the teeth at its best. I advise this product if you really care about your teeth. The only wariness I have heard about this expanding teeth floss is that its quite hard to use it if you have close together teeth in your mouth, but as I am using this floss for one year now, I find it perfect for the job, in spite of having no larger than half a millimeter gaps between the teeth.</li>
            <li> This unique floss is the best. Love that it expands in between your teeth due to the nature of the \\&quot;thick, fluffy\\&quot; thread. Bought a jumbo pack because both myself and my husband can&#x27;t live without it!!</li>
            <li> There is not much to say about this product, other than it&#x27;s the best floss I have ever tried, by miles.So you can stop reading reviews and JUST GET IT!</li>
            <li> I have been using this floss for the past 3 years. I&#x27;ve never thought of switching to a different type of floss ever since.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best floss you will ever use. My dental check-ups have improved drastically after using this product.</li>
            <li> It is just ok. I feel it was over hyped. I prefer the reach rope floss over this one.</li>
            <li> First I love the container itself, then I love the flavor, and last the floss itself is fantastic-the right density/thickness for my teeth and hands (I have arthritis so this is easy to hold onto while flossing as well as getting it out of the container.)</li>
            <li> One of the worst products I have ever used (not just dental products).  Gets caught and breaks up into small strands  between your teeth.  If you have small spaces between teeth, this floss will get stuck and trying to get it out with more floss only compounds the problem.  I just spent about 20 minutes doing nothing but trying to get it out from between my teeth with little success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have larger spaces between your teeth, this product may work well.  Otherwise, avoid it even if your alternative is not flossing at all.  It is NOT worth it.</li>
            <li> Happily, this order was promptly and correctly filled by the vendor.  The first try was with another vendor who sent the wrong quantity then requiring an return and refund process that caused delay and extra hassle.</li>
            <li> Will never buy another brand of floss again after using these. Non-waxy and perfect for getting the hard stuff out.</li>
            <li> I picked this floss up in the pharmacy initially because I was intrigued by the cardomom flavour, and loved it because of its comfort and the fact that it picks up more plaque and debris than other flosses.  The pharmacy stopped carrying it so I found it online here;  I&#x27;ve had no problems with the seller - all 12 reels arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> My favorite floss EVER! Even gave one to a coworker who was glad I did not use the clip strip. Will always buy in bulk.</li>
            <li> I Love this floss!  I swear by it.  Will not use any other brands of floss anymore.  Great thickness, really cleans between teeth.</li>
            <li> We love this stuff. Not coated with crap and does a better job of scraping off the gunk because it isn&#x27;t so slick and is braided. With normal floss, I have to use tape because my teeth tear the wimpy stuff apart. Not so with Dr. Tung&#x27;s. It stretches a little too, so it can get into really tight spots. Nice container too. It is a little more expensive but not so much if you buy the 12 pack.</li>
            <li> This is the best floss I have ever used! It gets in between teen no other floss can. Other brands of floss will either snap and break or simply get stuck between some of my teeth. This floss actually manages to get there and clean! I wish I had found this brand years ago.</li>
            <li> Floss made in Italy by a Hawaiian company?  Who would have thought...  After using this floss, we can&#x27;t go back to the regular stuff.      1) It&#x27;s the most effective floss we&#x27;ve found.  It&#x27;s fluffy and stretchy, so you can pull it taught to get into tight spaces, but once in there, there&#x27;s a lot of surface area to pick everything up.  It&#x27;s also gentle on your gums, and rarely shreds or gets caught.    2) It&#x27;s healthier.  In addition to being more effective, they use natural waxes instead of petrochemical wax.      3) It&#x27;s eco-friendlier with its biodegradable container and non-petro-based wax.    FYI, the scent/flavoring is very subtle if you&#x27;re worried about the cardamom, etc.      It&#x27;d be great if they could figure out a way to be even less package intensive, but otherwise, I can&#x27;t really find a major issue with it.      We used to buy these at Whole Foods (they give a 10% discount if you buy 12 or more and we go through it quickly), but found some even cheaper bulk options on amazon!</li>
            <li> This is the best floss on the market!  Use this for a month and you won&#x27;t be able to go back to any other brands.  I usually buy them in bulk and goes through them like crazy because I ended up giving them out to friends and coworkers.</li>
            <li> I have been using floss for 45 years and this is hands down the best not only because it does a better job than any floss I have ever tried but Dr Tung&#x27;s uses a natural coating (plant and beeswax, not petroleum/solvent based wax). Personal care products have so many synthetic chemicals. It&#x27;s wonderful to find one that I feel safe using, especially in my mouth.</li>
            <li> The container is designed so it is easy to tear off the floss without problems.  The floss itself is high grade, no wax, thin enough to get between crowded teeth, and does not shred.</li>
            <li> This is life changing dental floss.  It works like nothing I have ever experienced.  Really, just try it you will be a convert.  I cannot use regular floss anymore.  I don&#x27;t like that it is so hard to find in stores.  I check every store I go to and have only seen it in one.  It was half the price there that it is on here so I bought every package they had.  Not exaggerating, it is really that good.</li>
            <li> We love this floss!  It&#x27;s the only one that doesn&#x27;t cause our gums to bleed.</li>
            <li> After one use with this floss and you&#x27;ll never go back to other flosses ever again. The ingenuity of this product lies in the quality of the floss.  It&#x27;s soft and easy on the gums. Not like most other flosses which make you feel as if you&#x27;re flossing with a fishing line!.  It also stretches slightly (expands to cover most of your tooth).  I bought this in bulk to ensure I have this floss all year round.  I never thought flossing could be so enjoyable.</li>
            <li> My dentist first introduced me to this product.  I have been flossing regularly for twenty years with the standard flosses that most drugstores carry.  I will never go back to those other standard brands.  Dr. Tung&#x27;s Smart Floss is in a class by itself.  Great product!</li>
            <li> When you start using Dr Tung&#x27;s floss, you realize what flossing should be. It&#x27;s close to the dental floss your dentist uses when you have a pro clean your teeth. Be forewarned. Once you start using Dr Tung&#x27;s floss, there&#x27;s no going back to commercial dental flosses. There&#x27;s just no comparison. Best floss bar none. I&#x27;ll be a lifetime happy user.</li>
            <li> I first bought this floss while on a business trip in New York City. (The airline had lost my luggage, forcing me to buy new toiletry items.) As it turns out, the inconvenience had a silver lining because this floss is hands down the best floss out there. I love everything about it.  (1) The colorful packaging is so cute! And it&#x27;s biodegradable!  (2) I like how the packaging slides shut to keep the floss clean when it&#x27;s in your purse or when you&#x27;re traveling.  (3) This floss does NOT shred and does NOT get snagged in between your teeth!  (4) The cardamon flavor is very mild and pleasant.  (5) My gums feel super clean after using this floss.  (6) The fluffy texture makes flossing so much more comfortable on my fingers.  (7) It&#x27;s stretchy so you can pull it taut to get into tight places between your teeth.  (8) No petroleum-based wax coatings.  Dr. Tung&#x27;s Smart Floss isn&#x27;t sold at the Whole Foods where I shop so I&#x27;m grateful that I can buy it in bulk on Amazon.com.  The only bad thing about this floss? Once you try it there won&#x27;t be any going back to the other brands! Get it now...Your teeth and gums will thank you for it.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but am compelled to do so for Dr. Tungs floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Tungs floss is excellent! I used to use other brands of floss for many years but then found out that they use artificial flavors/ingredients to coat the floss and was very disappointed. I searched and found some other brands like Tom&#x27;s but was disappointed but its performance and thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I found Dr. Tungs. At first, the floss was a bit thick and difficult to get used to, but soon after I began to love it. Besides being coated naturally, the floss is super high quality and does not shred during use. Additionally, the floss is extremely gentle on my gums. I can&#x27;t count how many times I would floss with other big name brands and would get bloody gums. The floss can basically change from something fluffy to something taut which is excellent as it removes plaque and food more better than other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and switch to Dr. Tungs, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very nice and cheap because it&#x27;s a pack of 12.  It will last me to long time.  Came pretty quick too.</li>
            <li> I love to use this floss because it works so well. I was happy to be able to buy it in bulk. My order arrived quickly and intact.</li>
            <li> The best floss ever, Just wish I can find it in the drug stores.  Also try this with Dr. Tung tooth brush.  These are great products.</li>
            <li> I have to floss often ever since a crowning went a bit wrong.  THis floss is soft and pliable and manages to pick up a lot of gunk without cutting into my gums.  It also has a very mild, pleasant, natural flavor and is easily dispensed.  It did take me a little while to get used to using the dispenser.  I love the dispenser colors too.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best floss ever.  It is the best I&#x27;ve discovered so far.  It stretches and is wide enough to get into deep places, and removes more matter than any other floss I&#x27;ve used.  In fact, I couldn&#x27;t believe it when I first used it.  It was incredibly amazing.  I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is all natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this floss at the natural store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is fabulous floss. The flavor is refreshing and different.</li>
            <li> Since my adult braces experience some of my gaps are larger - a tooth was pulled and everything rearranged.  My dentist suggested this and it&#x27;s better than the thin stuff, for me anyway.</li>
            <li> As described and on time. Thanks</li>
            <li> Husband loves this floss</li>
            <li> Gets in those hard to reach spots you never knew you had. Can get stringy, but comes right out of teeth.</li>
            <li> I love this floss.  I feel that it cleans really well.  I&#x27;m getting better dental checkups and some of the gum pockets are getting smaller.</li>
            <li> When I called the seller to complain could barely understand the person answering the phone as his Indian accent was so thick. He could not understand what I was telling him. I asked to speak to a supervisor to take care of the problem and get a refund. He refused to do so. He asked me to read him the code on the individual packages; then he told me that he did not know what I was speaking of - then asked me to send him pictures of the product and email it to them. I told him that I was already inconvenienced and did not have camera available. He told me that my refund depended on my taking a picture of what was in the package.&lt;br /&gt;I told him that as they were selling the product they should already have a picture of it. (I can see it now as I am writing this rating of this company selling through Amazon.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe they should hire people who can read English to fill the orders. Four individual dental flosses do not cost $77.28. So maybe they also need to hire people with common sense!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not purchase from this company!</li>
            <li> This floss works great, but if you have very tight teeth (as I do), it DOES tend to shred between the really tightly spaced teeth, no matter what the other folks say who THINK they have tightly spaced teeth.  So you have to be very, very careful when you floss between those teeth, or you&#x27;ll end up with pieces stuck between your teeth that you can&#x27;t get out. I was given this product by my dentist, and I will probably buy it to have it on hand, but there are times that I just want to use my Crest GLIDE product or something smoother, one that gets out the food bits from really tightly spaced teeth without worrying about getting it stuck. I&#x27;m sure that this one may clean better (if you don&#x27;t get it stuck) -- but be careful, since it is a painful, horrible experience to have it shred. I like the cardamom flavor, but it&#x27;s a little weird if you are used to cinnamon or mint.</li>
            <li> This dental floss is the best I&#x27;ve used! Really cleans the gumline cleanly. It dosen&#x27;t fray, break or get caught in your teeth.  The 12 pack is the way to go, really a smart choice!</li>
            <li> This incredibly gentle floss has a puffy texture that has to be experienced. You can never use any other floss once you have experienced this stuff. Great non-mint flavor!</li>
            <li> Great floss.  Much better than the &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; thread I find in my local stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of flosses out there and this is super mega-miles the best.  I have a very sensitive body and do not like those nasty artificial &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; flavorings in conventional flosses.  They make my gums burn.  I used to use the &amp;#34;unflavored High-Tech&amp;#34; generic floss at CVS pharmacy but they stopped carrying it and only have the mint version - arrrhhhh- no mint! That&#x27;s why I was so happy to discover Dr.  Tung&#x27;s natural floss with natural cardamom flavoring.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my gums.  The best part of this floss for me is that the fibers fan out really wide when between the teeth and I can visibly see much more &amp;#34;junk and plaque&amp;#34; on the string than with other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Some people are complaining of shredding.  Here&#x27;s my tip: a couple of years ago when I used to buy this product, it used to shredded a lot because my teeth are spaced very close together.  They must have improved their floss because it rarely shreds anymore. Just maybe 20% of the time I used it.  I noticed that it usually shreds in my back molars where the space is tightest.  One way I learned to minimize shredding is to floss straight up and down in those tight spaces - meaning, I don&#x27;t floss at an angle. I have found that this almost always minimizes the shredding.  Also, some of my molars have pointy ends, so I&#x27;m wondering if this is just tearing the floss when it comes into contact with the jagged ends?  I am just more careful not to let it touch the pointy parts of my teeth and I think that prevents cutting of the floss. Now go enjoy this amazing cloth-like floss. It&#x27;s such a great sensation and makes flossing, dare I say, actually fun?!</li>
            <li> I am a flossing addict and for all flossing addicts, I recommend Dr. Tung&#x27;s Smart Floss! I have tried every floss on the market and Dr. Tung&#x27;s reigns as the King of Floss. I&#x27;m also a fan of Oral B&#x27;s complete-Deep Celan Ultra floss for teeth that are hard to get in between, it&#x27;s a thin cotton (?) strand and stretches like Dr. Tung&#x27;s so, the 2 together make great flossing companions.</li>
            <li> After eating lunch at Whole Foods, I realized I had forgotten to replenish my stock of dental floss in my car.  Salad greens, chicken, etc...If you floss, you  get it.  There were a few selections available.  I chose the Smart Floss and I was very pleased.  It&#x27;s thick, yet stretches and really scrubs as you slide the floss between and around the teeth.  I didn&#x27;t get a big cardamom flavor, just a hint of freshness.  I wouldn&#x27;t have even guessed cardamom had it not been stated on the package.  The price was just under $5 including tax, which seemed comparable to the other options at Whole Foods.  My teeth feel so great after I use it.  I have had adult braces, so my teeth are fairly close, but probably not as tight as those that complained about shredding.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Simply the best floss in existence. Wide, picks up everything, never hurts, strong. Will always use it.</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d write a glowing review for dental floss, but OMG this stuff gets my teeth noticably cleaner than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used. Yes it&#x27;s pricy, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s kind of gross, but when I compare what kind of gunk I get out imbetween my teeth using regular, thin, flat floss to the thick(er) textured Dr. Tung&#x27;s Smart Floss - the Dr Tung&#x27;s floss does SUCH A BETTER JOB.  It always cleans things out way more than any other floss I&#x27;ve used.  I highly recommend it (as I do buying it in bulk to save costs).</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described.&lt;br /&gt;Item recommended by dentist&#x27;s office and works better than dental floss I have used from four other manufacturers.</li>
