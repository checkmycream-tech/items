            <li>and he said it make it so easy.  </li>
            <li>I agree with the 4 previous excellent reviews of this nail clipper:  </li>
            <li>The Wide Jaw Toenail Clipper is a very good product, cuts well and is strong and sturdy.</li>
            <li>Clean cut, easy to hold and collects nails.  </li>
            <li>I got it from a seller named victor4877 for $11.25 with FREE SHIPPING.</li>
            <li>I bought this clipper primarily for the cover to catch nail clippings.  </li>
            <li>In short, these are the best toenail clippers I&#x27;ve ever found, and resolve most all the problems I&#x27;ve ever had with toenail clippers in general.      </li>
            <li>It is made of strong stainless steel which should last many years without rusting (unlike cheap chrome-plated steel).</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the slanted tip would prefer an rounded tip.</li>
            <li>I have a tiny cheap $1 clipper that works better.     </li>
            <li>The clipper is sturdy, reliable and worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Seems durable, too, and worth the money.</li>
            <li>But the right toe did not do as it was supposed to and</li>
            <li>I hurried and ordered it and to my surprise it came right away.</li>
            <li>Right now a   nurse does my toenails.  </li>
            <li>Though more expensive, the Mehaz works well because of its large opening, does a good, clean job of trimming.</li>
            <li>NOW----ALL THANKS TO MEHAZ!</li>
            <li>I eventually got them back together, but apparently &#x27;falling apart&#x27; wasn&#x27;t a good thing.  </li>
            <li>It cuts through the thickest nails very well!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t hurt that it comes with an easy grip and a file to help smooth the rough edges.</li>
            <li>Great product for older people or anyone with thick toenails.</li>
            <li>Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Now the whole family is using them.  </li>
            <li>This clipper couldn&#x27;t get around my nail in one shot, but it was much wider than the clippers at the neighborhood drugstore.  </li>
            <li>My wife ordered this for me and to my surprise it really works.  </li>
            <li>I tried to clip it with the regular clippers, but they were too close and wouldn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>It really does its job -</li>
            <li>&quot; you may have bought and buy a real man&#x27;s clipper.  </li>
            <li>They are the real deal.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for a quality product.  </li>
            <li>Better than any other i have used.</li>
            <li>The wide jaw goes over my toe nails easily.</li>
            <li>For certain combinations of hand and foot (e.g., right hand and left foot)</li>
            <li>Older people beware.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>Highly reccommended.</li>
            <li>We highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>This little clipper does its job, so what more can I say, except:  </li>
            <li>I was pleasently suprised that this little clipper was able to easily handle my super thick toenails...</li>
            <li>They are easy to hold, are very sharp, and it is easy to slip the claws between the wide jaw of the clipper.  </li>
            <li>the angle works great; for other combinations (e.g., right hand and right foot) you may have to hold the clippers in an uncomfortable position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The left big toe did fine</li>
            <li>very sharp and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>If you have thick wide toenails, great.  </li>
            <li>My 76 year old father loves this clipper so much that he had me send one to his 74 year old brother.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using an angled nail clipper, my initial impression is I have no idea</li>
            <li>I bought 2 pairs for my office and home and probably should have ordered the MEHAZ 660 Professional Nail Clipper (Model: 9MC0660), but I was looking for clippers that would catch the nails instead of shooting them across the room!  </li>
            <li>the old toenail fused with the new instead of falling off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m returning this primarily because of the bad nail catching cover and because I don&#x27;t particularly like the angled clipper and don&#x27;t imagine myself getting used to it.</li>
            <li>It is heavy duty and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The slanted cutting edge and wide jaws enable you to cut toenails much more easily than most other toenail clippers on the market.  </li>
            <li>, the old toenail fell off and healed</li>
            <li>The thing I like most about these is that I have exceptionally thick toenails and these just \\&quot;foot\\&quot; the bill.  </li>
            <li>Due to the angle of the blades, almost all the clippings are ejected through the hole at front right (as you look at the clippers from above).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And this clipper is 4\\&quot; long and very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I knew there had to be a way to get my toenail back to normal.</li>
            <li>I works like no other.  </li>
            <li>Just becareful when you first use them, they are sharp and cut swiftly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li>The blades are sharp, and the wide handle and the non-slip blue grips allow you to hold on securely.</li>
            <li>As you can see at [[ASIN:B0033EUIO8 the other listing]], the blades are straight instead of curved (crescent-shaped).</li>
            <li>I gave this four stars instead of five due to the curved blade - if it were a straight across nipper I would have given it five</li>
            <li>Large nail clippers didn&#x27;t open wide enough.  </li>
            <li>I found with age comes harder toe nails and normal toe clippers just was not working.</li>
            <li>Razor sharp, easy to use, no more bent nails.  </li>
            <li>Normal toenail clippers aren&#x27;t wide enough jawed.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t expensive, arrived quickly and REALLY works.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wide enough (with most others, you have to clip one side and then the other because they aren&#x27;t wide enough for the toenail, and if you&#x27;re like me, you can wind up making a bit of a mess) and strong enough to cut even tough nails.  </li>
            <li>It is sharp and can easily cut thick toenails.  </li>
            <li>It was sharp and strong and big mouthed enough to enable me to nibble the thick nail down to looking normal.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m returning this primarily because of the bad nail catching cover and because I don&#x27;t particularly like the angled clipper and don&#x27;t imagine myself getting used to it.</li>
            <li> It is heavy duty and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The slanted cutting edge and wide jaws enable you to cut toenails much more easily than most other toenail clippers on the market.  </li>
            <li> , the old toenail fell off and healed</li>
            <li> The thing I like most about these is that I have exceptionally thick toenails and these just \\&quot;foot\\&quot; the bill.  </li>
            <li> Due to the angle of the blades, almost all the clippings are ejected through the hole at front right (as you look at the clippers from above).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And this clipper is 4\\&quot; long and very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I knew there had to be a way to get my toenail back to normal.</li>
            <li> I works like no other.  </li>
            <li> Just becareful when you first use them, they are sharp and cut swiftly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp, and the wide handle and the non-slip blue grips allow you to hold on securely.</li>
            <li> As you can see at [[ASIN:B0033EUIO8 the other listing]], the blades are straight instead of curved (crescent-shaped).</li>
            <li> I gave this four stars instead of five due to the curved blade - if it were a straight across nipper I would have given it five</li>
            <li> Large nail clippers didn&#x27;t open wide enough.  </li>
            <li> I found with age comes harder toe nails and normal toe clippers just was not working.</li>
            <li> Razor sharp, easy to use, no more bent nails.  </li>
            <li> Normal toenail clippers aren&#x27;t wide enough jawed.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t expensive, arrived quickly and REALLY works.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wide enough (with most others, you have to clip one side and then the other because they aren&#x27;t wide enough for the toenail, and if you&#x27;re like me, you can wind up making a bit of a mess) and strong enough to cut even tough nails.  </li>
            <li> It is sharp and can easily cut thick toenails.  </li>
            <li> It was sharp and strong and big mouthed enough to enable me to nibble the thick nail down to looking normal.  </li>
            <li> With time I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if I got used to it and found other handles skinny and crappy.  </li>
            <li> What one finds in a drugstore, or other general store doesn&#x27;t compare to this device and often those clippers have a curved blade which doesn&#x27;t work well with the big toe toenails that are shaped differently!  </li>
            <li> As far as cutting, it seemed fine.  </li>
            <li> After buying several inferior products from drugstores, I finally purchased the Mehaz 668 wide jaw clipper at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I was not only able to clip that ugly, thick toenail, but with the wide jaw I was able to use it like a trimmer to trim away the ugly top layer.</li>
            <li> But the main issue was the small store bought clippers just could NOT do the job.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also larger than I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> Several months ago I ordered the MEHAZ 668 Pro Wide Angled Clippers through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Powerful cutting compared to the weak, tiny cutters available in drug stores.</li>
            <li> After years of searching I finally found a toenail clipper that has a straight edge, large opening and sharp cutting edge.  </li>
            <li> Very well made in Japan with stainless steel cutting edges.</li>
            <li> I finally looked up a toenail clipper that might have a wide jaw and found the MEHAZ 668 Pofessional Wide Jaw Toenail Clipper.</li>
            <li> BUT: if Amazon is still using one of the sellers with outlandish shipping charges (like $8 or $10 for an item that would actually cost less than $1 to ship), try ebay instead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several types of toenail clippers in the past, looking for the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; one, and I&#x27;ve finally found it in the Mehaz Wide Jaw Toenail Clipper.  </li>
            <li> They stopped cutting and instead took up crushing.  </li>
            <li> For many years I had trouble cutting my toe nails .</li>
            <li> You DO have to be a bit careful with these wide jaw clippers, however.  </li>
            <li> Note that it&#x27;s rather wide, so</li>
            <li> Finally a quality toenail clipper that is razor sharp and cuts with little effort.  </li>
            <li> The sharp blade really does power through tough hardened toe nails.  </li>
            <li> They are sharp, so be careful when using them.  </li>
            <li> I admit I was a bit skeptical in using it at first,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other clippers advertised, but these seem to address my problem.  </li>
            <li> But, caution notice, the blades are extremely sharp.</li>
            <li> As you can see at [[ASIN:B0033EUIO8 the other listing]], the blades are angled instead of perpendicular to the body of the clippers.</li>
            <li> However, due to this clipper being angled there is an opening on one side where the cover does not extend to.    </li>
            <li> These clippers be sharp.  </li>
            <li> :  (1) It cuts even the thickest toenails very cleanly.</li>
            <li> It felt a bit odd holding it, but is certainly not a deal breaker.  </li>
            <li> It became impossible to cut it with standard clippers or even one available at a chain pharmacy ,  advertised for thick nails, at a cost of about $4.00.</li>
            <li> This clipper does what others don&#x27;t: cuts through thick, gnarly nails that regular clippers can&#x27;t even grip.</li>
            <li> The angle of the blade is so straight that it is difficult to cut the nails because finger and toe nails are curved slightly.  </li>
            <li> Nothing slows them down.  </li>
            <li> Sharp!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very very sharp so use caution when using.</li>
            <li> I bought them here for $11 + $8 shipping , then saw them for almost half the price in a foot care catalog that came to our home a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my husband at Christmas for a little stocking stuffer.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to get too aggressive with them and snip a little piece of \\&quot;toe\\&quot; along with the nail.</li>
            <li> The angled blade clipping style take a little time to get used to, but you will get the hang of it in no time.  </li>
            <li> but I have a little trouble using it with the curve in the blade.</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble clipping my toe nails-</li>
            <li> Waste of money on my part.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because I expected the clippers to actually catch the nails in the cover like a pair (different brand) that I already had.  </li>
            <li> my toe nails are tough to be cut - for a long time i was struggling - have the solution now!</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and work well on thick nails.  </li>
            <li> We would have returned it for a refund, but the cost of postage made it not worthwhile.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the jaw is angled, but I&#x27;ve had no problems adapting to it.  </li>
            <li> Usually a dr had to do it.  </li>
            <li> and I have had no more issues with it.</li>
            <li> I thought I was having a hard time cutting my toe nails because I&#x27;m getting old and weak.  </li>
            <li> We no longer have to soak our feet before trying to clip our hard nails.</li>
            <li> they were so hard and thick.  </li>
            <li> When I got this product in the mail  , within 10 minutes of opening my toe nails were the shortest they had been in at least 20 years .     </li>
            <li> These Mehaz clippers worked well for thick nails.  </li>
            <li> But for fingernails or thin narrow toenails you run the risk of accidentally pinching your skin.  </li>
            <li> This is just what I&#x27;ve been looking for to deal with the combination of thick toenails and arthritis.</li>
            <li> It cut through my thick toe nails with ease.      </li>
            <li> Bought these for my elderly father who has thick nails.</li>
            <li> No more bent or broken toe nails.  </li>
            <li> The broad non-slip handle and base make it easier to manipulate the clippers in areas and angles where it is sometimes hard for some of us to reach.</li>
            <li> :  (1) You can buy toenail clippers at your local drug store for about one-fifth the price of these.</li>
            <li> It clipped my thick toe-nail with ease!</li>
            <li> I have dealt with the embarrassment of a thick, twisted toenail for years.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re like the Ginsu Knives of the toenail world - - dangerous in the wrong hands, but will work wonders if you&#x27;re careful.    </li>
            <li> Tough toe nails run in the family!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, four stars.he clippers in an uncomfortable position.    </li>
            <li> Then, after cutting off a piece of my husband&#x27;s toe, the nail clipper fell apart.  </li>
            <li> and it just felt awkward.      </li>
            <li> With these clippers its like cutting butter.</li>
            <li> THAT MIGHT BE EITHER PLUSES OR MINUSES:  (1)</li>
            <li> Classify me as one VERY unhappy customer.</li>
            <li> The pliers type of clippers generated very painful torque.  </li>
            <li> The drawback: outrageous shipping charges.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Am very satisfied!  This is a great little product, which comes with its own LIFETIME  GUARANTEE!  I admit I was a bit skeptical in using it at first, but then I got the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think for the price I paid ($12.90, no tax, and free shipping), I got a good deal!  This little clipper does its job, so what more can I say, except:  I&#x27;M TRULY LOOKING FORWARD TO SANDALS AND SUMMERTIME, BECAUSE TOESIES&#x27; NAILS LOOK SO MUCH BETTER NOW----ALL THANKS TO MEHAZ!</li>
            <li> Bought these for my husband at Christmas for a little stocking stuffer.  Now the whole family is using them.  They work great and are good quality.  My sister-in-law is buying a pair now.  Tough toe nails run in the family!  These will cut through even the toughest nails!</li>
            <li> For many years I had trouble cutting my toe nails . I am over weight as well so that didnt help either . But the main issue was the small store bought clippers just could NOT do the job.    When I got this product in the mail  , within 10 minutes of opening my toe nails were the shortest they had been in at least 20 years .     It cuts so easily and handles like a tool .     It even cut my finger nails and they look awesome     Thank god i found this great product     COACHERNIE</li>
            <li> My wife has a bwauty salon and she loves these.  Yes she used them on me too!  Theres a definite click when they cut.  She did a great job on me.  And this clipper is 4\\&quot; long and very sturdy.</li>
            <li> My toenails have greater curvature and are thicker as time goes on.  Normal toenail clippers aren&#x27;t wide enough jawed.  These Mehaz clippers worked well for thick nails.  They are sharp, so be careful when using them.  You can cut the beneath the nail.  I&#x27;ve seen other clippers advertised, but these seem to address my problem.  The plastic portion of the clippers helps you maintain your grip.  I have only had them a short while; so I can&#x27;t estimate their durability.</li>
            <li> Toe nail clipper works better than anything purchased at the drug store or grocery store.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this toenail clipper for my husband. Personally I never like these type of clippers, but this is the best! I works like no other.  My husband has nails of stone and he said it make it so easy.  I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> very sharp and easy to use.  Not crazy about the slanted tip would prefer an rounded tip.</li>
            <li> Excellent toenail clipper; works exactly as advertised; requires a very, very minimum effort to use.  But, caution notice, the blades are extremely sharp.</li>
            <li> These clippers are the best I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Nothing slows them down.  They&#x27;re like the Ginsu Knives of the toenail world - - dangerous in the wrong hands, but will work wonders if you&#x27;re careful.    The drawback: outrageous shipping charges.  I bought them here for $11 + $8 shipping , then saw them for almost half the price in a foot care catalog that came to our home a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> Note: this product appears identical to [[ASIN:B0033EUIO8 Mehaz Professional Wide Jaw Slant Edge Toenail Clipper]]; see the Customer Images there for photos helping to explain my opinions below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These toenail clippers have five pluses, two minuses, and three features that might be either pluses or minuses.  Here goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLUSES:  (1) It cuts even the thickest toenails very cleanly. The blades are sharp, and the wide handle and the non-slip blue grips allow you to hold on securely. (2) It is made of strong stainless steel which should last many years without rusting (unlike cheap chrome-plated steel). (3) The package says \\&quot;LIFETIME GUARANTEE / For Service Information, Call 888.225.6342.\\&quot; (4) On the top side of the handle is a nail file for smoothing edges.  (5) As of January 2011, shipping is free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MINUSES:  (1) You can buy toenail clippers at your local drug store for about one-fifth the price of these. (2) If you expect the clipping catcher to actually work, you&#x27;re out of luck.  Due to the angle of the blades, almost all the clippings are ejected through the hole at front right (as you look at the clippers from above).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES THAT MIGHT BE EITHER PLUSES OR MINUSES:  (1) The blades are about 4mm apart in resting position.  If you have thick wide toenails, great.  But for fingernails or thin narrow toenails you run the risk of accidentally pinching your skin.  (2) As you can see at [[ASIN:B0033EUIO8 the other listing]], the blades are straight instead of curved (crescent-shaped). If you want to cut your toenails straight across, great. But if you want rounded nails, you need to clip numerous times, and even so the end results are rather polygonal. (3) As you can see at [[ASIN:B0033EUIO8 the other listing]], the blades are angled instead of perpendicular to the body of the clippers. For certain combinations of hand and foot (e.g., right hand and left foot) the angle works great; for other combinations (e.g., right hand and right foot) you may have to hold the clippers in an uncomfortable position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, four stars.he clippers in an uncomfortable position.    Overall, four stars.</li>
            <li> I bought this nail clipper for my husband based on good reviews.  The nail clipper is not as advertised.  It didn&#x27;t collect the nail clippings as promised - they just fell on the floor.  Then, after cutting off a piece of my husband&#x27;s toe, the nail clipper fell apart.  We would have returned it for a refund, but the cost of postage made it not worthwhile.    Don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
            <li> Large nail clippers didn&#x27;t open wide enough.  The pliers type of clippers generated very painful torque.  This clipper couldn&#x27;t get around my nail in one shot, but it was much wider than the clippers at the neighborhood drugstore.  It was sharp and strong and big mouthed enough to enable me to nibble the thick nail down to looking normal.  Highly reccommended.</li>
            <li> In pharmacies I have purchased several Toenail Clippers in my life and this is one of the best.  Clean cut, easy to hold and collects nails.  I recommend this Toenail Clippers anyone.</li>
            <li> Following jogging injuries where I lost a nail on a big toe, the nail grew back with a fungal infection, causing thickening over the years. It became impossible to cut it with standard clippers or even one available at a chain pharmacy ,  advertised for thick nails, at a cost of about $4.00. Though more expensive, the Mehaz works well because of its large opening, does a good, clean job of trimming. Some complain the catcher doesn&#x27;t work well, which to me is nitpicking.</li>
            <li> These clippers are the best.  I bought 3, one for my mother, sister and myself.  We no longer have to soak our feet before trying to clip our hard nails.</li>
            <li> After buying several inferior products from drugstores, I finally purchased the Mehaz 668 wide jaw clipper at Amazon.  This is just what I&#x27;ve been looking for to deal with the combination of thick toenails and arthritis. I&#x27;m very pleased with the product as well as the speed of delivery when ordering through Amazon. I&#x27;m not sure why the jaw is angled, but I&#x27;ve had no problems adapting to it.  In short .. a sturdy,superior product at an acceptable price.</li>
            <li> Powerful cutting compared to the weak, tiny cutters available in drug stores. Wish they had a second model with a more curved blade, i&#x27;d get both, but this is very good.</li>
            <li> This clipper does what others don&#x27;t: cuts through thick, gnarly nails that regular clippers can&#x27;t even grip. BUT: if Amazon is still using one of the sellers with outlandish shipping charges (like $8 or $10 for an item that would actually cost less than $1 to ship), try ebay instead. I got it from a seller named victor4877 for $11.25 with FREE SHIPPING.</li>
            <li> I actually bought these clippers to use for my 2 cats&#x27; claws.  They work great!  They are easy to hold, are very sharp, and it is easy to slip the claws between the wide jaw of the clipper.  I am very pleased with them, and would recommend them to others.</li>
            <li> Received the item and am very pleased with it.  Being a cosmetologist I need the best products for the field.  Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> After having no luck finding nail clippers for my elderly father in our local drug stores I began searching online.  These clippers work great and my father was extreemly happy with them. They are very sharp and work well on thick nails.  We highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> The Wide Jaw Toenail Clipper is a very good product, cuts well and is strong and sturdy.</li>
            <li> After years of searching I finally found a toenail clipper that has a straight edge, large opening and sharp cutting edge.  It works especially well on the big toe toenail.  What one finds in a drugstore, or other general store doesn&#x27;t compare to this device and often those clippers have a curved blade which doesn&#x27;t work well with the big toe toenails that are shaped differently!  Congratulations to MEHAZ!!</li>
            <li> I bought this clipper primarily for the cover to catch nail clippings.  However, due to this clipper being angled there is an opening on one side where the cover does not extend to.    It&#x27;s also larger than I expected it to be.  It felt a bit odd holding it, but is certainly not a deal breaker.  With time I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if I got used to it and found other handles skinny and crappy.  The nail filer is also built into the handle.  This is my first time using an angled nail clipper, my initial impression is I have no idea what&#x27;s the point of it.  I felt I had to work more to maneuver the clipper around my nails and it just felt awkward.      As far as cutting, it seemed fine.  It cut through my thick toe nails with ease.      I&#x27;m returning this primarily because of the bad nail catching cover and because I don&#x27;t particularly like the angled clipper and don&#x27;t imagine myself getting used to it.</li>
            <li> These clippers do everything they are advertised to do.  The broad non-slip handle and base make it easier to manipulate the clippers in areas and angles where it is sometimes hard for some of us to reach. The slanted cutting edge and wide jaws enable you to cut toenails much more easily than most other toenail clippers on the market.  For years, I&#x27;ve been looking for a better toenail clipper.  In short, these are the best toenail clippers I&#x27;ve ever found, and resolve most all the problems I&#x27;ve ever had with toenail clippers in general.      You DO have to be a bit careful with these wide jaw clippers, however.  You don&#x27;t want to get too aggressive with them and snip a little piece of \\&quot;toe\\&quot; along with the nail.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my elderly father who has thick nails. They work great and he loves them which is saying a lot.</li>
            <li> My wife ordered this for me and to my surprise it really works.  It wasn&#x27;t expensive, arrived quickly and REALLY works.  I am very happy...and she is too.</li>
            <li> Several months ago I ordered the MEHAZ 668 Pro Wide Angled Clippers through Amazon.  The day I received them they fell apart.  I eventually got them back together, but apparently &#x27;falling apart&#x27; wasn&#x27;t a good thing.  They stopped cutting and instead took up crushing.  I figured the egdes weren&#x27;t lined-up so I put them aside and retried them occasionally hoping they might realign themselves.  They never did.  I have a tiny cheap $1 clipper that works better.     Classify me as one VERY unhappy customer.</li>
            <li> I rec. the clippers way before they were suppose to be here.  I love them.  I have always had trouble clipping my toe nails- they were so hard and thick.  Usually a dr had to do it.  The wide jaw goes over my toe nails easily. and no problem.  Also has a lifetime guarantee..  I am actually happy over a pair of toenail clippers.  I now can cut my toenails myself.  Don&#x27;t look any further.  These are the ones you should buy.</li>
            <li> I have been using these clippers for almost 6 months now.  They are spectacular and do an amazing job with thicker nails.  The sharp blade really does power through tough hardened toe nails.  The angled blade clipping style take a little time to get used to, but you will get the hang of it in no time.  Just becareful when you first use them, they are sharp and cut swiftly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Great product for older people or anyone with thick toenails. It&#x27;s very easy to hold onto, and it&#x27;s very strong. My 76 year old father loves this clipper so much that he had me send one to his 74 year old brother.</li>
            <li> The jaw opening is sufficient to trim the thickest toe nail. Also, the lever arm is able to exert the force needed to do the job. Better than any other i have used.</li>
            <li> I agree with the 4 previous excellent reviews of this nail clipper:  Razor sharp, easy to use, no more bent nails.  My father who is over 70 borrowed my nail clipper and told me it&#x27;s the best he&#x27;s ever used and to quickly find him one!  Note that it&#x27;s rather wide, so for smaller toe nails, one might wish to use a narrower clipper.</li>
            <li> I was pleasently suprised that this little clipper was able to easily handle my super thick toenails...</li>
            <li> Finally a quality toenail clipper that is razor sharp and cuts with little effort.  No more bent or broken toe nails.  Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several types of toenail clippers in the past, looking for the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; one, and I&#x27;ve finally found it in the Mehaz Wide Jaw Toenail Clipper.  It&#x27;s wide enough (with most others, you have to clip one side and then the other because they aren&#x27;t wide enough for the toenail, and if you&#x27;re like me, you can wind up making a bit of a mess) and strong enough to cut even tough nails.  It also has a good angle.  It makes toenail care a breeze.</li>
            <li> I gave this four stars instead of five due to the curved blade - if it were a straight across nipper I would have given it five but I have a little trouble using it with the curve in the blade. It&#x27;s very very sharp so use caution when using.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because I expected the clippers to actually catch the nails in the cover like a pair (different brand) that I already had.  The angle of the blade is so straight that it is difficult to cut the nails because finger and toe nails are curved slightly.  I bought 2 pairs for my office and home and probably should have ordered the MEHAZ 660 Professional Nail Clipper (Model: 9MC0660), but I was looking for clippers that would catch the nails instead of shooting them across the room!  Waste of money on my part.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for our son as he was always using ours.  It is sharp and can easily cut thick toenails.  Great product and quick delivery!</li>
            <li> Years ago, I suffered with ingrown toenails. After trying all I could to relieve the pain, I had both big toes operated on to get rid of the problem. The left big toe did fine, the old toenail fell off and healed and I have had no more issues with it. But the right toe did not do as it was supposed to and the old toenail fused with the new instead of falling off. I have dealt with the embarrassment of a thick, twisted toenail for years. Even the podiatrist just clipped it and that was that. I knew there had to be a way to get my toenail back to normal. I love to wear sandals, but with my toe looking the way it did, I refused to do so. Even nail polish didn&#x27;t help. I tried to clip it with the regular clippers, but they were too close and wouldn&#x27;t fit. I finally looked up a toenail clipper that might have a wide jaw and found the MEHAZ 668 Pofessional Wide Jaw Toenail Clipper. What a Godsend! I hurried and ordered it and to my surprise it came right away. I was not only able to clip that ugly, thick toenail, but with the wide jaw I was able to use it like a trimmer to trim away the ugly top layer. Now my toenail is growing back the way it should and my friends have noticed that I&#x27;m back to wearing my peep-toe shoes again. I would suggest that every home should have one because you never know when there may be need for it. I hope no one has to go through what I did, but if you find you have a toenail situation like I did, The MEHAZ 668 is your answer. It didn&#x27;t hurt that it comes with an easy grip and a file to help smooth the rough edges. I am so glad I found it and my feet never looked better.</li>
            <li> It really does its job - my toe nails are tough to be cut - for a long time i was struggling - have the solution now!</li>
            <li> The clipper is sturdy, reliable and worth the money.  I&#x27;m amazed of the transformation of my home-made pedicure; the clipper did excactly what the product claimed to do.  It clipped my thick toe-nail with ease! I would reccomend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these clippers. I found with age comes harder toe nails and normal toe clippers just was not working. With these clippers its like cutting butter. Love these clippers!</li>
            <li> You have to have bought a pair of these clippers to find out what they are all about.  They are great!  Sharp!  The thing I like most about these is that I have exceptionally thick toenails and these just \\&quot;foot\\&quot; the bill.  No pun intended.  Throw away those \\&quot;cheapies\\&quot; you may have bought and buy a real man&#x27;s clipper.  Older people beware.  Let someone else clip your toenails with these or you may have issues.  These clippers be sharp.  No deflection.  They are the real deal.  Thanks Amazon for a quality product.  Great price and service also.</li>
            <li> After years and years of using a cheap nail clipper, this clipper is a marvelous find.  Don&#x27;t hesitate, buy it! I thought I was having a hard time cutting my toe nails because I&#x27;m getting old and weak.  Turns out I had a crummy clipper all along.  This clipper works great.    Also, shipping time was very short.</li>
            <li> Very well made in Japan with stainless steel cutting edges. It&#x27;s easy to use because it allows good leverage to thumb and forefinger.</li>
            <li> It appears to be a very strong toenail clipper.  I am looking forward to using it.  Right now a   nurse does my toenails.  With this clipper I might   be able to do them myself.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.It cuts through the thickest nails very well! Seems durable, too, and worth the money. I was glad to find it.</li>
            <li> This product meets all the hype: it is easy to use, rugged, attractively priced, and very effective in attacking thickened nails.</li>
            <li> This is a good toe nail clipper.  It is heavy duty and easy to use.  I would but another one if I ever need to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charles</li>
