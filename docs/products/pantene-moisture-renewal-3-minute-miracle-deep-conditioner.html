    <ol>
            <li>I am very impressed by this.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m happy that I&#x27;ve found a brand that I don&#x27;t have to think about.</li>
            <li>But works great for my cjildrens hair.</li>
            <li>This conditioner works great.</li>
            <li>I have to say it works great.</li>
            <li>Pantene is a great budget priced hair conditioner that works.  </li>
            <li>This Moisture Renewal Hydrating formula from Pantene is great conditioning for a variety of hair types.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and works great.  </li>
            <li>The texture and scent are great, but the results you see are amazing!  </li>
            <li>But this...this stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m five-star thrilled!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a pleasant smell that doesn&#x27;t linger and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>shampoo works best when you don&#x27;t really have to think about, and this achieves that!</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I think it&#x27;s great that Pantene is continuously trying to improve their products and add new lines, sometimes what they already have is very good.</li>
            <li>and I was so happy to see that I could try it out for free through Amazon Vine.</li>
            <li>I believe this is a nice conditioner</li>
            <li>but it is a nice conditioner.</li>
            <li>and I like the Pantene line of hair care as it is cost effective compared to salon products.</li>
            <li>They both liked the smell of it, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The daughter with fine hair struggles with flyaways and dryness, and she thought this did a good job with both issues.  </li>
            <li>It appears to be able to hydrate my hair more effectively and adds a nice sheen to it as well.</li>
            <li>With the shampoo my hair feels clean after rinsing which is good and the conditioner soaks in, but doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of residue once rinsed out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing to me how many fine products are given to Vine Reviewers.</li>
            <li>hair care aisles at grocery and drug stores are often, quite frankly, bewildering with so many options out there.  </li>
            <li>See is quite pleased with this Pro-V product.</li>
            <li>I also love the scent.</li>
            <li>So eventually I figured out the quantity and the timing which led to better results.</li>
            <li>hair is bristly and I would love to be bald</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Like most Pantene Pro-V products this works well.  </li>
            <li>Likewise, I love the upside-down bottle style of this conditioner.</li>
            <li>On top of the texture, my hair is colored</li>
            <li>I love this Pantene Pro-V Moisturizing shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love what this does for my hair.</li>
            <li>Pantene has been my go-to hair care product line since its introduction many years ago.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light clean fragrance that I like.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several Pantene shampoos and conditioners and they all seem to be very good</li>
            <li>My husband has a great Old Man of the sea or salty captain look going on.  </li>
            <li>morning it was quite wild looking, which look great on one of my brothers, but not me.  </li>
            <li>So while it is not a miracle maker, it is a good choice at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Works really well, can be had for a good price.</li>
            <li>My hair feels amazing afterwards plus has a nice soft scent.</li>
            <li>The bottle has the opening on the bottom and it is easy to handle.</li>
            <li>others have noted, I like the &#x27;upside-down&#x27; bottle orientation that makes the shampoo easy to squeeze out.</li>
            <li>Once out of the shower brushing my hair is easy and I don&#x27;t have to use any leave in treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a fairly strong fruity floral aroma.</li>
            <li>Volume is the biggest challenge I have with my fine color treated hair.</li>
            <li>I am most apt to get in the pool and have my hair be dryer than normal.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and keeps my hair looking nice (and not dry!)</li>
            <li>This kind of conditioner really helped to give my hair a smooth look and feel.</li>
            <li>The scent is also light and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does not leave it as smooth as I would like.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product</li>
            <li>This formula from Pantene does a fantastic job of restoring moisture to our hair and keeping it manageable.  </li>
            <li>It may be just right for many people.</li>
            <li>Very nice product that I’ll definitely purchase again when I run</li>
            <li>The conditioner applies smoothly and rinses out fairly cleanly.</li>
            <li>I expect shampoo to be easy to rinse and leave an overall smooth feeling, and this did a good job on both counts.</li>
            <li>I am now buying only cruelty free products and finding them to be better in many cases!</li>
            <li>I really like that the flip top cap is on the bottom, so the shampoo comes out easily.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this I didn&#x27;t think it did much more than increase the volume of my hair.</li>
            <li>It smells so lovely and really conditions my hair!</li>
            <li>Many people tell him he looks like Einstein and that look certainly doesn’t become me at all.  </li>
            <li>and I think most people will really like it.  </li>
            <li>for my actual results, they were as good as I had anticipated.</li>
            <li>I’m really quite pleased with the results because it softened it and has made it quite manageable.  </li>
            <li>I have shoulder length, fine curly hair that gets weighed down easily by conditioners, so I had my two daughters try it with me for a fair review.  </li>
            <li>We love Pantene products and this one is specially nice for long hair!</li>
            <li>hair was very silky and fine, and she thought the hydrating qualities were superb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This variety of Pantene Conditioner is definitely worth a shot to try for a couple of weeks,  so you can see a difference.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used conditioners before, many different brands and most of them do a fairly decent job, but nothing to feel elated about.  </li>
            <li>My usual conditioner is the Pro-V Conditioner, Hydrating Curls, so I happy to try out this Moisture Renewal Hydrating</li>
            <li>I use it along with a regular Pantene shampoo instead of the recommended Moisture Renewal Hydrating Shampoo from the same line, and the results are still great.</li>
            <li>Without having to apply a lot, like many other products I&#x27;ve used, this one gives me a smooth and youthful hair.  </li>
            <li>My friend has very curly hair and uses the &amp;#34;curly girl&amp;#34; method for her hair in that she rarely washes it with soap.</li>
            <li>The end result was soft, silky, smooth hair.</li>
            <li>It figures my first attempt was operation error.</li>
            <li>but I think it would probably work even better if I used it along with the Daily Moisture Renewal Shampoo.</li>
            <li>Right about now it certainly needed some help</li>
            <li>However, my hair is also dry and very fine.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and easily gets weighed down.</li>
            <li>This particular variety, Moisture Renewal Hydrating Conditioner seems to be a bit more moisturising than the regular one.  </li>
            <li>pretty much stays in place all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Procter &amp; Gamble and thanks Amazon Vine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is very hydrating conditioner.</li>
            <li>Also I ended up figuring out you also need to use twice as much.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this product</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t smell it.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really need conditioner for tangles.</li>
            <li>so I really need moisturizing hair</li>
            <li>I like it, but I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it kind of seemed to make my hair heavy, if that makes any sense.  </li>
            <li>The daughter with thick hair loved it because she struggles with tangles and dryness and this conditioner left her hair smooth, tangle-free and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a challenge to find a good conditioner that leave my hair soft without leaving it limp.</li>
            <li>My college daughter has long hair and a busy life--this conditioner is thick and leaves her hair feeling wonderful all day.</li>
            <li>The best part is how affordable Pantene&#x27;s products are, and  how well they work with other products if you want to switch things up and use a different shampoo or other hair-care products.</li>
            <li>Quite often when a company makes their products they suggest they work better in combination with each other.</li>
            <li>That being said, I can&#x27;t say it performed any better than any other decent conditioner.</li>
            <li>But after my shower, I comb it out carefully into a becoming &amp;#34;do&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>scent is nice but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Pro-V Daily Mositure Renewal Hair Conditioner left my hair looking very shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li>The Pro-V daily moisture renewal conditioner does a great job at keeping my hair from getting too dry while at the same time not making my scalp any oilier than it is naturally.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks vibrant and healthier.</li>
            <li>My wife has very long, wavy &amp; thick hair that is quite beautiful, but can be quite a challenge for her to keep manageable.</li>
            <li>This was highly recommended to me by a friend</li>
            <li>Though we did not see the results of  its claims that it erases the damage of one hundrede blow drys,  it did  leave hair softer and a bit less dry looking, which my wife loved.</li>
            <li>Just a small amount goes a long way, and we both love the smell which is a bit of a light fruity scent</li>
            <li>This conditioner works great for my thick and dry hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is easy to brush and style and never feels greasy, oily, or weighed down by product.</li>
            <li>It may be a minimal improvement but at the budget friendly price that this comes in, you don&#x27;t have to think twice.</li>
            <li>only shampoo my hair every other day, any more</li>
            <li>This may just be a way to get you to buy more of their products or it might have some truth, but I usually don&#x27;t see any difference?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent of Pantene products are a little too strong for me (reason for 4 stars instead of 5) but the product works well.</li>
            <li>It rinsed out well and left my hair feeling soft and easy to comb, but I had to wash my hair again the next day because it looked flat and over conditioned.  </li>
            <li>I try to use natural products, and this is just about as far from natural as you can get.</li>
            <li>you are going 100% natural in your products, then this won&#x27;t be a product you&#x27;ll want to use: Water, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Citrate, Cocamide Mea, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Dimethicone, Fragrance, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Polyquaternium-76, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium Edta, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Panthenol, Panthenyl Ethyl Ether, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone.</li>
            <li>Also, they are inexpensive, come in very generous amounts and can be found in any big box or drugstore chain if I happen to be travelling and leave mine at home.</li>
            <li>drys\\&quot; when used with the complete system.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair looking shiny and feeling soft; indeed, there was no discernible difference between it and the pricier salon brands that I could notice.  </li>
            <li>I have used Pro-V for so long that I couldn&#x27;t even tell you what year I first tried it.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>On hot day my hair does not turn brittle and dry, from the sun.</li>
            <li>Upon using, I did not have tangles and my hair was easy to dry and style without having to use any other hair products.</li>
            <li>One of them has really thick, very long straight hair, and one has mid length, fine, straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that I can really tell the difference between this line and the curly line, so I&#x27;ll probably just continue to buy which ever one I see first.</li>
            <li>I did use it for a couple of weeks along with various other shampoos I have, and it does provide some moisture that reduces flyaway and dryness, but it is not as effective as an overall serious dryness treatment or as restorative as hot oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using it a few times this week, my hair is less frizzy and more soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair which I blow dry everyday.</li>
            <li>It keep her locks soft &amp; moisturized while helping immensely with the manageability issues.</li>
            <li>This conditioner left my hair feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have thick coarse hair and it leaves my hair soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner was a bit heavy, but worth it for the moisture it provides.</li>
            <li>My hair tends to dry out a lot if washed frequently.</li>
            <li>Frequent shampooing helps but tends to leave hair dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li>I have thick wavy hair and my daughter has very thin, fine hair that is prone to getting tangled easily.  </li>

            <li> for my actual results, they were as good as I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> I’m really quite pleased with the results because it softened it and has made it quite manageable.  </li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, fine curly hair that gets weighed down easily by conditioners, so I had my two daughters try it with me for a fair review.  </li>
            <li> We love Pantene products and this one is specially nice for long hair!</li>
            <li> hair was very silky and fine, and she thought the hydrating qualities were superb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This variety of Pantene Conditioner is definitely worth a shot to try for a couple of weeks,  so you can see a difference.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used conditioners before, many different brands and most of them do a fairly decent job, but nothing to feel elated about.  </li>
            <li> My usual conditioner is the Pro-V Conditioner, Hydrating Curls, so I happy to try out this Moisture Renewal Hydrating</li>
            <li> I use it along with a regular Pantene shampoo instead of the recommended Moisture Renewal Hydrating Shampoo from the same line, and the results are still great.</li>
            <li> Without having to apply a lot, like many other products I&#x27;ve used, this one gives me a smooth and youthful hair.  </li>
            <li> My friend has very curly hair and uses the &amp;#34;curly girl&amp;#34; method for her hair in that she rarely washes it with soap.</li>
            <li> The end result was soft, silky, smooth hair.</li>
            <li> It figures my first attempt was operation error.</li>
            <li> but I think it would probably work even better if I used it along with the Daily Moisture Renewal Shampoo.</li>
            <li> Right about now it certainly needed some help</li>
            <li> However, my hair is also dry and very fine.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and easily gets weighed down.</li>
            <li> This particular variety, Moisture Renewal Hydrating Conditioner seems to be a bit more moisturising than the regular one.  </li>
            <li> pretty much stays in place all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Procter &amp; Gamble and thanks Amazon Vine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is very hydrating conditioner.</li>
            <li> Also I ended up figuring out you also need to use twice as much.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this product</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t smell it.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really need conditioner for tangles.</li>
            <li> so I really need moisturizing hair</li>
            <li> I like it, but I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it kind of seemed to make my hair heavy, if that makes any sense.  </li>
            <li> The daughter with thick hair loved it because she struggles with tangles and dryness and this conditioner left her hair smooth, tangle-free and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a challenge to find a good conditioner that leave my hair soft without leaving it limp.</li>
            <li> My college daughter has long hair and a busy life--this conditioner is thick and leaves her hair feeling wonderful all day.</li>
            <li> The best part is how affordable Pantene&#x27;s products are, and  how well they work with other products if you want to switch things up and use a different shampoo or other hair-care products.</li>
            <li> Quite often when a company makes their products they suggest they work better in combination with each other.</li>
            <li> That being said, I can&#x27;t say it performed any better than any other decent conditioner.</li>
            <li> But after my shower, I comb it out carefully into a becoming &amp;#34;do&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> scent is nice but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Pro-V Daily Mositure Renewal Hair Conditioner left my hair looking very shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li> The Pro-V daily moisture renewal conditioner does a great job at keeping my hair from getting too dry while at the same time not making my scalp any oilier than it is naturally.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks vibrant and healthier.</li>
            <li> My wife has very long, wavy &amp; thick hair that is quite beautiful, but can be quite a challenge for her to keep manageable.</li>
            <li> This was highly recommended to me by a friend</li>
            <li> Though we did not see the results of  its claims that it erases the damage of one hundrede blow drys,  it did  leave hair softer and a bit less dry looking, which my wife loved.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount goes a long way, and we both love the smell which is a bit of a light fruity scent</li>
            <li> This conditioner works great for my thick and dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is easy to brush and style and never feels greasy, oily, or weighed down by product.</li>
            <li> It may be a minimal improvement but at the budget friendly price that this comes in, you don&#x27;t have to think twice.</li>
            <li> only shampoo my hair every other day, any more</li>
            <li> This may just be a way to get you to buy more of their products or it might have some truth, but I usually don&#x27;t see any difference?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent of Pantene products are a little too strong for me (reason for 4 stars instead of 5) but the product works well.</li>
            <li> It rinsed out well and left my hair feeling soft and easy to comb, but I had to wash my hair again the next day because it looked flat and over conditioned.  </li>
            <li> I try to use natural products, and this is just about as far from natural as you can get.</li>
            <li> you are going 100% natural in your products, then this won&#x27;t be a product you&#x27;ll want to use: Water, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Citrate, Cocamide Mea, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Dimethicone, Fragrance, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Polyquaternium-76, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium Edta, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Panthenol, Panthenyl Ethyl Ether, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone.</li>
            <li> Also, they are inexpensive, come in very generous amounts and can be found in any big box or drugstore chain if I happen to be travelling and leave mine at home.</li>
            <li> drys\\&quot; when used with the complete system.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair looking shiny and feeling soft; indeed, there was no discernible difference between it and the pricier salon brands that I could notice.  </li>
            <li> I have used Pro-V for so long that I couldn&#x27;t even tell you what year I first tried it.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> On hot day my hair does not turn brittle and dry, from the sun.</li>
            <li> Upon using, I did not have tangles and my hair was easy to dry and style without having to use any other hair products.</li>
            <li> One of them has really thick, very long straight hair, and one has mid length, fine, straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that I can really tell the difference between this line and the curly line, so I&#x27;ll probably just continue to buy which ever one I see first.</li>
            <li> I did use it for a couple of weeks along with various other shampoos I have, and it does provide some moisture that reduces flyaway and dryness, but it is not as effective as an overall serious dryness treatment or as restorative as hot oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using it a few times this week, my hair is less frizzy and more soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair which I blow dry everyday.</li>
            <li> It keep her locks soft &amp; moisturized while helping immensely with the manageability issues.</li>
            <li> This conditioner left my hair feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse hair and it leaves my hair soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner was a bit heavy, but worth it for the moisture it provides.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to dry out a lot if washed frequently.</li>
            <li> Frequent shampooing helps but tends to leave hair dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and my daughter has very thin, fine hair that is prone to getting tangled easily.  </li>
            <li> This worked for keeping his hair soft and manageable, but unfortunately, it made his hair kind of heavy.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long with natural curl; however, it has a tendency to get dry and fly-away during the summer months (while my scalp gets oily.)  </li>
            <li> I don’t blow dry my hair, but it is fine, thin and sometimes quite unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner makes my hair feel silky soft and actually adds some body to it rather than weighing it down.</li>
            <li> and I use flat irons</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time user and obvious fan of Pantene products.</li>
            <li> I have straight colored hair and sometimes the hair ends get a little rough looking.</li>
            <li> My hair is coarse and dry.</li>
            <li> my very dry (blow dry/dyed) hair needs this on a daily basis to keep it from looking like straw.</li>
            <li> works decent on my long thick and coarse hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite the fact that I probably should not wash my hair everyday, I know that it is unlikely that I&#x27;ll skip a day or two, and I feel like using a good conditioner helps a little bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the gamut of conditioners, ranging from dirt cheap, through shampoo/conditioner combos, to expensive salon conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and have used Pantene products for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Undoubtedly, I will be using this for as long as it&#x27;s on the market!</li>
            <li> My wife does blow dry and straighten her hair with an iron.  </li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t over-powering and once my hair is dry</li>
            <li> If not, then I am left with a tangled, dry mess.</li>
            <li> Both of us tend to have very dry hair from the chlorine in the pool.  </li>
            <li> You need to leave this in your hair longer than other conditioners.</li>
            <li> I especially like that it doesn&#x27;t leave a dull residue on my hair, as I often got with the shampoo/conditioner combos like Pert.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I expected, this conditioner was too heavy for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Foremost, the thick, creamy formula smooths my long, slightly wavy hair but does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> It can be quite a frizzy flyaway mess depending on the time of year.  </li>
            <li> I have dry hair and hard water.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the conditioner for a couple days now and my hair is as moisturized as it usually is with the other conditioner.</li>
            <li> Today is one day I don’t have to put on a little had to disguise the flyaway Einstein look.  </li>
            <li> Even when I accidentally applied it closer to the roots of my hair than I wanted to, it didn&#x27;t leave it limp or greasy.</li>
            <li> I have used  This conditioner for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t build up until I have a limp mass, either.</li>
            <li> I usually don’t use a conditioner, but rather just a shampoo and that seems to tame it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The conditioner itself is thinner, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and doesn&#x27;t feel like it leaves an oil slick in your hair and on your hands after you&#x27;re done using it.  </li>
            <li> I like his hair when it is all wild and crazy.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the products that both my late wife and I have used and liked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No fruity, flowery fragrance here (at least, to me).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of dry, flyaway, sad looking hair.  </li>
            <li> -- it is very hard to manage.</li>
            <li> Between coloring and blow-drying, it can get really bad</li>
            <li> because I know I&#x27;m not going to change my lifestyle and bad habits.</li>

            <li> This conditioner works great for my thick and dry hair. Without having to apply a lot, like many other products I&#x27;ve used, this one gives me a smooth and youthful hair.  The scent is also light and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have dry hair and hard water.  Need I say more?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used conditioners before, many different brands and most of them do a fairly decent job, but nothing to feel elated about.  But this...this stuff is amazing!  After just two uses, I noticed a difference in my hair.  I plan on purchasing the shampoo to go along with this.  The texture and scent are great, but the results you see are amazing!  I&#x27;m tired of dry, flyaway, sad looking hair.  This stuff does the trick, locking in moisture and repairing damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m five-star thrilled!</li>
            <li> I believe this is a nice conditioner and I think most people will really like it.  I like it, but I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it kind of seemed to make my hair heavy, if that makes any sense.  Maybe it&#x27;s because dryer hair is lighter and this conditioner hydrates and thickens the way hair feels, but I didn&#x27;t entirely like that.  I do think Pantene products are generally very good and this one probably is also.  It may be just right for many people.</li>
            <li> This was highly recommended to me by a friend and I was so happy to see that I could try it out for free through Amazon Vine. My friend has very curly hair and uses the &amp;#34;curly girl&amp;#34; method for her hair in that she rarely washes it with soap. This is her go to co-wash conditioner. Since her hair always smells great and looks amazing, we decided to give it a try and have been very happy with it. I&#x27;ve never found a Pantene product that I didn&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are going 100% natural in your products, then this won&#x27;t be a product you&#x27;ll want to use: Water, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Citrate, Cocamide Mea, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Dimethicone, Fragrance, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Polyquaternium-76, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium Edta, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Panthenol, Panthenyl Ethyl Ether, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone.</li>
            <li> There is a reason why I return to Pantene conditioners time and time again. In a nutshell, they work. Also, they are inexpensive, come in very generous amounts and can be found in any big box or drugstore chain if I happen to be travelling and leave mine at home. I have fine hair which I blow dry everyday. It&#x27;s a challenge to find a good conditioner that leave my hair soft without leaving it limp. This one does that. Even when I accidentally applied it closer to the roots of my hair than I wanted to, it didn&#x27;t leave it limp or greasy. I am very impressed by this. Another winner.</li>
            <li> My college daughter has long hair and a busy life--this conditioner is thick and leaves her hair feeling wonderful all day. The Pro-V Daily Moisture Renewal Hydrating Conditioner helps her go through campus life even in the Minnesota weather! We love Pantene products and this one is specially nice for long hair!</li>
            <li> This is very hydrating conditioner. I have straight colored hair and sometimes the hair ends get a little rough looking. This kind of conditioner really helped to give my hair a smooth look and feel. The scent of Pantene products are a little too strong for me (reason for 4 stars instead of 5) but the product works well. Recommended overall.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised. After using it a few times this week, my hair is less frizzy and more soft and silky. It appears to be able to hydrate my hair more effectively and adds a nice sheen to it as well. I use it along with a regular Pantene shampoo instead of the recommended Moisture Renewal Hydrating Shampoo from the same line, and the results are still great. My hair tends to dry out a lot if washed frequently. This conditioner has helped and I could see the difference.</li>
            <li> Volume is the biggest challenge I have with my fine color treated hair. Frequent shampooing helps but tends to leave hair dry and frizzy. This version of Pantene promises to \\&quot;erase the damage of 100 blow drys\\&quot; when used with the complete system. Don&#x27;t know about that but it is a nice conditioner. It has a fairly strong fruity floral aroma. The bottle has the opening on the bottom and it is easy to handle. The conditioner applies smoothly and rinses out fairly cleanly. The end result was soft, silky, smooth hair. That being said, I can&#x27;t say it performed any better than any other decent conditioner. So while it is not a miracle maker, it is a good choice at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I use and have used a variety of Pantene hair conditioners over the years.  My hair is long with natural curl; however, it has a tendency to get dry and fly-away during the summer months (while my scalp gets oily.)  The Pro-V daily moisture renewal conditioner does a great job at keeping my hair from getting too dry while at the same time not making my scalp any oilier than it is naturally.  I do wash and condition my hair every day, so this is a great conditioner for the times of the year I am most apt to get in the pool and have my hair be dryer than normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the gamut of conditioners, ranging from dirt cheap, through shampoo/conditioner combos, to expensive salon conditioners.  Pantene is my shampoo and conditioner brand of choice, because it represents the best combination of value and cost that I have found.  It leaves my hair looking shiny and feeling soft; indeed, there was no discernible difference between it and the pricier salon brands that I could notice.  I especially like that it doesn&#x27;t leave a dull residue on my hair, as I often got with the shampoo/conditioner combos like Pert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair care aisles at grocery and drug stores are often, quite frankly, bewildering with so many options out there.  I&#x27;m happy that I&#x27;ve found a brand that I don&#x27;t have to think about.</li>
            <li> My wife has very long, wavy &amp; thick hair that is quite beautiful, but can be quite a challenge for her to keep manageable. See is quite pleased with this Pro-V product. It keep her locks soft &amp; moisturized while helping immensely with the manageability issues. She has had nothing but glowing things to say about this Pantene conditioner. An excellent choice!</li>
            <li> works decent on my long thick and coarse hair. It does not leave it as smooth as I would like. But works great for my cjildrens hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works great. I have used  This conditioner for a few weeks. I have to say it works great. On hot day my hair does not turn brittle and dry, from the sun. My hair looks vibrant and healthier. I also love the scent. I have allergies and this conditioner will not irritate it. Overall a great product</li>
            <li> Love it!  I have thick coarse hair and it leaves my hair soft and smooth.  It takes away some of the coarseness without leaving that nasty build-up on your hair.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this I didn&#x27;t think it did much more than increase the volume of my hair. I almost decided not to use it again but thought I should give this a second chance. It figures my first attempt was operation error. You need to leave this in your hair longer than other conditioners. Also I ended up figuring out you also need to use twice as much. So eventually I figured out the quantity and the timing which led to better results. So this does increase shine and volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
            <li> My hair is over-processed. Between coloring and blow-drying, it can get really bad so I am always using different conditioners to try to minimize some of the damaging effects -- because I know I&#x27;m not going to change my lifestyle and bad habits. I like this moisturizing conditioner but I think it would probably work even better if I used it along with the Daily Moisture Renewal Shampoo. I did use it for a couple of weeks along with various other shampoos I have, and it does provide some moisture that reduces flyaway and dryness, but it is not as effective as an overall serious dryness treatment or as restorative as hot oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the fact that I probably should not wash my hair everyday, I know that it is unlikely that I&#x27;ll skip a day or two, and I feel like using a good conditioner helps a little bit. I really like the smell of this product and I like the Pantene line of hair care as it is cost effective compared to salon products. I&#x27;ll keep using this and might even buy the shampoo to see if there&#x27;s any difference using both in combination.</li>
            <li> Pantene is a great budget priced hair conditioner that works.  This particular variety, Moisture Renewal Hydrating Conditioner seems to be a bit more moisturising than the regular one.  My wife does blow dry and straighten her hair with an iron.  Though we did not see the results of  its claims that it erases the damage of one hundrede blow drys,  it did  leave hair softer and a bit less dry looking, which my wife loved. This variety of Pantene Conditioner is definitely worth a shot to try for a couple of weeks,  so you can see a difference.  It may be a minimal improvement but at the budget friendly price that this comes in, you don&#x27;t have to think twice.</li>
            <li> This conditioner left my hair feeling soft and moisturized. My hair is fine and easily gets weighed down. This conditioner was a bit heavy, but worth it for the moisture it provides. I just use it once a week when I&#x27;m planning on wearing my hair up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing to me how many fine products are given to Vine Reviewers. This is one of the products that both my late wife and I have used and liked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her hair was very silky and fine, and she thought the hydrating qualities were superb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is bristly and I would love to be bald -- it is very hard to manage. But after my shower, I comb it out carefully into a becoming &amp;#34;do&amp;#34;. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It pretty much stays in place all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Procter &amp; Gamble and thanks Amazon Vine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert C. Ross&lt;br /&gt;April 2015</li>
            <li> This Moisture Renewal Hydrating formula from Pantene is great conditioning for a variety of hair types.  I have thick wavy hair and my daughter has very thin, fine hair that is prone to getting tangled easily.  Both of us tend to have very dry hair from the chlorine in the pool.  This formula from Pantene does a fantastic job of restoring moisture to our hair and keeping it manageable.  Just a small amount goes a long way, and we both love the smell which is a bit of a light fruity scent but it isn&#x27;t over-powering and once my hair is dry I really don&#x27;t smell it.  The best part is how affordable Pantene&#x27;s products are, and  how well they work with other products if you want to switch things up and use a different shampoo or other hair-care products.</li>
            <li> Like most Pantene Pro-V products this works well.  The conditioner itself is thinner, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and doesn&#x27;t feel like it leaves an oil slick in your hair and on your hands after you&#x27;re done using it.  Smells nice and keeps my hair looking nice (and not dry!) every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pantene has multiple lines of products, and this seems to be their &#x27;standard&#x27; line with just the standard moisturizing selling point.  Works really well, can be had for a good price.</li>
            <li> I have used Pro-V for so long that I couldn&#x27;t even tell you what year I first tried it. Foremost, the thick, creamy formula smooths my long, slightly wavy hair but does not weigh it down. It always leaves my hair bouncy, shiny, and entirely touchable. Likewise, I love the upside-down bottle style of this conditioner. It allows me to get every last bit (without doing that &amp;#34;add-water-and-shake&amp;#34; thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, do know that the smell is entirely unisex. No fruity, flowery fragrance here (at least, to me). So, if you are a man in need of a burst of hydration, give this a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Undoubtedly, I will be using this for as long as it&#x27;s on the market! Great conditioner!</li>
            <li> loveeee this conditioner! It smells so lovely and really conditions my hair!</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, fine curly hair that gets weighed down easily by conditioners, so I had my two daughters try it with me for a fair review.  One of them has really thick, very long straight hair, and one has mid length, fine, straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I expected, this conditioner was too heavy for my hair.  It rinsed out well and left my hair feeling soft and easy to comb, but I had to wash my hair again the next day because it looked flat and over conditioned.  The daughter with thick hair loved it because she struggles with tangles and dryness and this conditioner left her hair smooth, tangle-free and hydrated.  The daughter with fine hair struggles with flyaways and dryness, and she thought this did a good job with both issues.  They both liked the smell of it, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the ingredients on the bottle and I&#x27;m turned off by all the chemicals in it.  I try to use natural products, and this is just about as far from natural as you can get.</li>
            <li> I have really short hair so I don&#x27;t really need conditioner for tangles. However, my hair is also dry and very fine. This conditioner makes my hair feel silky soft and actually adds some body to it rather than weighing it down. It has a nice light clean fragrance that I like. I&#x27;ve used several Pantene shampoos and conditioners and they all seem to be very good products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Water, Stearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Fragrance, Benzyl Alcohol, Dicetyldimonium Chloride, Disodium Edta, Histidine, Panthenylethylether, Citric Acid, Methylchloroisothiazolinone,  Methylisothiazolinone.</li>
            <li> The Pantene Pro-V Daily Moisture Renewal Hydrating line is just what I was looking for. My hair is coarse and dry. On top of the texture, my hair is colored and I use flat irons so I really need moisturizing hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice but not overwhelming. It advertises that it locks in hydration from root to tip. My hair does feel nurtured and moisturized when I use Pantene’s Hydrating line.</li>
            <li> I expect shampoo to be easy to rinse and leave an overall smooth feeling, and this did a good job on both counts. It&#x27;s got a pleasant smell that doesn&#x27;t linger and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others have noted, I like the &#x27;upside-down&#x27; bottle orientation that makes the shampoo easy to squeeze out. Seems like this design shift happened recently, and it makes sense!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A shampoo works best when you don&#x27;t really have to think about, and this achieves that!</li>
            <li> I love this Pantene Pro-V Moisturizing shampoo. It smells great and works great.  I really like that the flip top cap is on the bottom, so the shampoo comes out easily.</li>
            <li> Love what this does for my hair. My hair feels amazing afterwards plus has a nice soft scent.</li>
            <li> My husband has a great Old Man of the sea or salty captain look going on.  I like his hair when it is all wild and crazy.  This worked for keeping his hair soft and manageable, but unfortunately, it made his hair kind of heavy.  It seems a lot flatter.  Softer, but flatter.</li>
            <li> Pantene has been my go-to hair care product line since its introduction many years ago. The Pro-V Daily Moisture Renewal Hydrating Shampoo and Conditioners do their job: my very dry (blow dry/dyed) hair needs this on a daily basis to keep it from looking like straw. But it doesn&#x27;t build up until I have a limp mass, either. My hair is easy to brush and style and never feels greasy, oily, or weighed down by product.</li>
            <li> Such a shame that in this day and age, companies still test on animals.  I am now buying only cruelty free products and finding them to be better in many cases!</li>
            <li> This is a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;I like pantene&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time user and obvious fan of Pantene products. I have naturally curly hair and it is a necessity to have a conditioner that actually works. If not, then I am left with a tangled, dry mess. My usual conditioner is the Pro-V Conditioner, Hydrating Curls, so I happy to try out this Moisture Renewal Hydrating Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only shampoo my hair every other day, any more and it dries my hair out beyond help which makes my conditioner a bigger part of my daily routine. I will note that I went ahead and purchased the Pantene Pro-V Moisture Renewal Hydrating Shampoo to use along with the conditioner. Quite often when a company makes their products they suggest they work better in combination with each other. This may just be a way to get you to buy more of their products or it might have some truth, but I usually don&#x27;t see any difference?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my actual results, they were as good as I had anticipated. I&#x27;ve been using the conditioner for a couple days now and my hair is as moisturized as it usually is with the other conditioner. With the shampoo my hair feels clean after rinsing which is good and the conditioner soaks in, but doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of residue once rinsed out. Once out of the shower brushing my hair is easy and I don&#x27;t have to use any leave in treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I think it&#x27;s great that Pantene is continuously trying to improve their products and add new lines, sometimes what they already have is very good. I&#x27;m not sure that I can really tell the difference between this line and the curly line, so I&#x27;ll probably just continue to buy which ever one I see first.</li>
            <li> I don’t blow dry my hair, but it is fine, thin and sometimes quite unmanageable.  I don’t have hat hair, but rather hair that needs to go under a hat.  It can be quite a frizzy flyaway mess depending on the time of year.  Right about now it certainly needed some help and I decided to try the Pantene.  I usually don’t use a conditioner, but rather just a shampoo and that seems to tame it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning it was quite wild looking, which look great on one of my brothers, but not me.  Many people tell him he looks like Einstein and that look certainly doesn’t become me at all.  I used my regular shampoo and then used the Pantene.  I’m really quite pleased with the results because it softened it and has made it quite manageable.  Today is one day I don’t have to put on a little had to disguise the flyaway Einstein look.  Very nice product that I’ll definitely purchase again when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Stearyl Alcohol, Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetyl Alcohol, Fragrance, Benzyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Panthenol, Panthenyl Ethyl Ether, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and have used Pantene products for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pro-V Daily Mositure Renewal Hair Conditioner left my hair looking very shiny and healthy.  Upon using, I did not have tangles and my hair was easy to dry and style without having to use any other hair products.</li>
