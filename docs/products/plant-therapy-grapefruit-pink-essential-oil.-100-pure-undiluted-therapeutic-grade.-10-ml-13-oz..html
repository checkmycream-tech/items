            <li>and I LOVE the scent.  </li>
            <li>If you are using this to make up a lot of sugar scrubs or salts I reccommend getting two bottles even though I was able to make a lot of sugar scrubs (20 containers)</li>

            <li>It smells like candy i love it.</li>
            <li>I love Plant Therapy products.</li>
            <li>Others may love this though.</li>
            <li>I myself prefer Citrus Burst better.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love....</li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>This is an awesome essential oil.  </li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love the smell -</li>
            <li>I also added it to some foul smelling skin lotion, and am thoroughly pleased with the result.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just found what I think will be the perfect double boiler for the project here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li>Fantastic company to do business with!</li>
            <li>I love the smell too.  </li>
            <li>Grapefruit oil must be one of the most cheerful-smelling things on the planet.</li>
            <li>I love it in water while at work or at home.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell, but you have to use a lot of it in the diffuser.</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t much more than I can say about it.</li>
            <li>makes me want to drink more water.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>but I had eleven more words to use..</li>
            <li>I love using it in my Plant Therapy oil diffuser.</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This company went out of their way to make sure I was pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read many of the reviews on this product, and I haven&#x27;t seen anyone mention that it smells more like oranges than grapefruit.</li>
            <li>I did replace the lid with a dropper I had on hand &amp; am glad I have that, but I hadn&#x27;t tried the lid it came with before.</li>
            <li>love the smell</li>
            <li>I have added it to many household things.</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful fresh smell that I just love -- the smell of real grapefruit.  </li>
            <li>It is one of the best essential oils that I have had, and plan to buy more from this company.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, clean smell.  </li>
            <li>I have tried using essential oils alone in the warmer dish and found that the scents fade rather quickly, but using the melted wax which no longer gave off it&#x27;s own scent, was an excellent carrier for diffusing the grapefruit oil.  </li>
            <li>I have a pretty good nose for smells, not a fan.</li>
            <li>This came packaged nicely and quickly.  </li>
            <li>I liked the scent, it&#x27;s fresh and authentic, but it lasts for all of three seconds.</li>
            <li>and I am very sensitive to overpowering scents (I greatly dislike perfume, musky type</li>
            <li>I love the smell of grapefruit, and this essential oil perfectly captures that refreshing citrus scent of a freshly cut grapefruit.</li>
            <li>Smells absolutely amazing like the peel of a fresh grapefruit (great since that&#x27;s where the yummy oils live).  </li>
            <li>But this is a very sweet and organic smell to it.</li>
            <li>AND I AM PLEASANTLY SURPRISED AND HAPPY</li>
            <li>The scent was light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>, I enjoy many oils.</li>
            <li>I also ordered a rose essential oil from another supplier and the scent is excellent AND it lasts very well.</li>
            <li>My co-workers and friends loved the scent so much.</li>
            <li>This was more than fantastic as I needed them very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, I sometimes open the container just to smell it, it smells so good!</li>
            <li>Great shipping and love essential oils!</li>
            <li>It drops easily from the supplied bottle.</li>
            <li>The oil arrived here fast and the dropper on the top was handy.</li>
            <li>(not artificial) smell of a grapefruit and nice smooth texture.</li>
            <li>It smells really sweet and citrusy, which I love - but - UGH</li>
            <li>Clean smell, great disinfectant, and natural.</li>
            <li>The Grapefruit Oil is amazing, smells wonderful, great tasting, usually add a few drops (daily) in my water bottle, excellent for maintaining weight.</li>
            <li>This essential oil is very strong (in a good way).  </li>
            <li>Ordered 2 bottles and though the scent is wonderful when first opened it does not last once applied.</li>
            <li>you have to enjoy citrus to like this, it&#x27;s quite strong but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Great, fresh smell, true to what grapefruits really smell like.</li>
            <li>It smelled great, but wore off incredibly quickly, and felt more like a water based product than the essential oil it claimed to be.</li>
            <li>The scent is quite accurate though.</li>
            <li>The reviews from others in addition to the quality of ingredients used were a huge factor that assisted me.  </li>
            <li>This is fantastic oil.</li>
            <li>Great product, use 3 drops in my daily water to help with dehydration.</li>
            <li>Perfect, just as nice as much more expensive oils.</li>
            <li>Additionally it arrived very quickly in secure packaging.</li>
            <li>It still cleans streak free so this is not effecting my solution.</li>
            <li>would recommend to anyone looking for some great essential</li>
            <li>smells fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely happy and would definitely order again.  </li>
            <li>I especially appreciate the identification sticker on top of the cap, eliminating the need to make my own top label.</li>
            <li>I only bought it to make sugar scrubs but it works really great for that purpose.</li>
            <li>Is great in making at home lotions, hair treatments, or facial treaments!!!</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>This is a fine product with a very nice citrus scent - an important addition to add to an essential oils collection...</li>
            <li>Fast Shipment!!!</li>
            <li>All of them smell very nice, and the citronella mixed with skin oil kept the mosquitos away.</li>
            <li>I use a few drops with water to clean my room and it smells so wonderful.</li>
            <li>I use this in my homemade skin products and really love the scent which is exactly like sticking your nose into a fresh juicy grapefruit :)</li>
            <li>Plant Therapy is a wonderful source for high quality essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I USE THIS MAINLY FOR MY OWN</li>
            <li>...it is a strong scent, but not in a make you sick kind of way - it&#x27;s more of a can&#x27;t help but continuing to inhale kind of way...very pleasant &amp; refreshing.</li>
            <li>It has a crisp refreshing citrus scent</li>
            <li>Everyone loves the clean citrus scent.</li>
            <li>I used it to make bath salts and sugar scrubs to I did not have to be super precise.  </li>
            <li>And the rug was clean too.</li>
            <li>and wow it has so many uses!</li>
            <li>I use it in my face masks and mixed with baking soda for shower tabs for a bright &amp; awakening scent in the morning.</li>
            <li>great for many uses; on dryer balls, in Ball jar w/baking soda for natural air freshner, homemade facial spray.  </li>
            <li>Almost sweet.</li>
            <li>Is real grapefruit (potent smell).</li>
            <li>Seems like its true to its description.</li>
            <li>I bought a really good diffuser through Amazon a couple months ago and playing around with different oils.</li>
            <li>This can be used for a lot of things, but I use it as a &amp;#34;cologne.&amp;#34; It doesn&#x27;t smell as tho you are wearing something edible, but rather fresh and cheerful.</li>
            <li>I think it has a cheerful fresh effect.</li>
            <li>The scent is so true, I was amazed.  </li>
            <li>Smells so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I recommend you find another more reputable source for your essential oil.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>a plus, the shipping was done quickly and arrived to me in record time.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and packaged soundly - I like the smell, its crisp and fruity.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a nice clean, fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li>It smells EXACTLY like peeling a fresh grapefruit!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful true pink grapefruit scent - smells just like you cut open a fresh grapefruit or poured a glass of grapefruit juice.</li>
            <li>The smell is clean and crisp.  </li>
            <li>euro dropper works fine for my purposes, and I have no problems with it coming out too fast.</li>
            <li>I use a few drops of this in my sodastream carbonated water for a great taste.  </li>
            <li>Makes a nice addition to my home-made counter cleaner, and also a drop or two on my low watt lightbulb</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite scent that I use in my body butters and lotions.</li>
            <li>For the price and the smell of this product, it definitely is worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>I LOVE grapefruit and never owned a grapefruit oil before, but it expected better consistency.</li>
            <li>yep, smells just like a freshly peeled grapefruit, I can almost taste it....</li>
            <li>I am using it to sprinkle around my vanity for a nice smell and in some facial soap to fight breakouts.</li>
            <li>I used this oil in all natural body and face scrubs with coconut oil and the smell is wonderfully refreshing.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>I put a drop of this oil in the trash can in my powder room, and it fills the room with a fresh grapefruity scent all day.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell of pink grapefruit; use this in my bath oils more than anything.</li>
            <li>could be stronger smelling, buy nice enough</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually using this as a nice scent for some home-made greener cleaners for my home.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently been making lots of my own cleaners and beauty products.</li>
            <li>I rarely get compliments from my brother, tho</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells like you just cut into a fresh grapefruit.</li>
            <li>So far, I have used it mixed into coconut oil as a great body moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This oil smells wonderful and mixes well with other oils to make toners and facial sprays.</li>
            <li>Really made the soap smell fresh and clean</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much it smells like a fresh grapefruit!</li>
            <li>The price was right</li>
            <li>a go eat one right now....</li>
            <li>Received my order right on time.</li>
            <li>and it is just the right scent not to over poweringand not wimpy...</li>
            <li>you want a true grapefruit scent, as pure as the fruit itself, this oil is the one to pick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell of this oil smells exactly like fresh cut grapefruit.  </li>
            <li>Smells more like real, fresh grapefruit that other&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Seriously makes your mouth water, it smells so good!</li>
            <li>Does not appear to be diluted and smells very crisp and pure.</li>
            <li>It was used in combination with other ingredients in making my own lotion and the fragrance is mild.</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery, product just as described.</li>
            <li>Rather than a nice single drop, they gush out.  </li>
            <li>This essential oil arrived quickly and just in time to make up some spray to clean the mats in my yoga class!  </li>
            <li>Exactly as it should be.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, but it is definately not quite the pink grapefruit that I was expecting.</li>
            <li>This one smells just like real grapefruit, makes your mouth water!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>and I think it will scent it exactly how I imagined</li>
            <li>should I ever take the initiative to actually get started on these projects :)</li>
            <li>Product was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME ORDERING THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li>, I really like the lean fresh smell.</li>
            <li>I love essential oils, but the prices can get exorbitant.  </li>
            <li>It came in time and smells more like red orange</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s a feature of any grapefruit essential oil, but just be prepared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love essential oils</li>
            <li>but nonetheless I&#x27;ve ordered this brand before and the quality is comparable to higher end oils.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>It only lasts a couple of days on the cotton, though, so I will have to find a better way to diffuse it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more when this bottle runs out.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is the first Plant Therapy I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Item was exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>I use Scentsy products around my house and LOVE grapefruit scents, which are harder to come by in a &#x27;true&#x27; scent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried several Plant Therapy essential oils, but they have been wonderful products.  </li>
            <li>It smells exactly like a grapefruit.  </li>
            <li>I love all of the Plant Therapy essential oils.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was after.  </li>
            <li>I really like this oil!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more from this company.</li>
            <li>I make my own lotions, and pink grapefruit is my all-time favorite essential oil for summer.  </li>
            <li>Works great combine with other products !!!!</li>
            <li>and yes, when I say happy I mean it.</li>
            <li>good but not necessarily strong enough…</li>
            <li>The scent itself is not quite as sharp as the real thing, but other than that it is very pleasant and not artificial smelling at all.</li>
            <li>I love that they are pure essential oils.</li>
            <li>The grapefruit adds a nice scent to glass and other cleaners.</li>
            <li>It is a smell that is clean without having to directly call cleaning products to mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A good essential oil is a key ingredient in almost all my recipes.</li>
            <li>I prefer strong scents so this is just mine &amp; my families personal opinion.</li>
            <li>They put this teeny bottle in a LARGE box.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s 100% pure.</li>
            <li>Smells so pure</li>
            <li>I enjoy plant therapy 100% pure Essential oil.</li>
            <li>I love pink grapefruit scent in shampoos and shower gels and though the real thing in my diffuser will be heavenly...</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing essential oils, and I was very pleased with the quality of the pink grapefruit oil.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;BE WARNED: I did discover that grapefruit essential oil can stain light colored fabrics, it has a noticeable orange hue.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is only my third essential oil, in addition to lemon-eucalyptus and tea tree, and I feel like this bright, fresh scent rounded out my collection.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast and was well packaged too.</li>
            <li>I bought this to scent some homemade dishwasher soap and it worked very well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks goes to all the people who took the time to post their reviews.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It drips out of the bottle fast.  </li>
            <li>This Grapefruit is very pleasing to the senses.</li>
            <li>she loves it so much</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot to say about the oil since I didn&#x27;t really do anything with it.</li>
            <li>I love pink grape fruit and when I found this oil...</li>
            <li>I make my own all purpose cleaning solution with boiled water, lemon essential oil, and grapefruit essential oil.  </li>
            <li>To be fair, their other oils (ginger, petigrain, lemongrass) did make a good impression on me, so I would be open to ordering other types of EOs from this company in the future.</li>
            <li>I am just starting with making my own natural lotions and cleaning products and this was my first purchase of essential oils.</li>
            <li>This essential oil smells just like fresh grapefruit!</li>
            <li>Every oil I have purchased smells way better then other brands I have purchased</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on a strict budget and cannot afford a lot of doTerra oils (I highly recommend their Peppermint because no other brand rids of my migraines so quickly as theirs) so I ordered this item to test out this company.  </li>
            <li>I clean only with vinegar</li>
            <li>In my opinion, situations like this merit expiration dates on bottles of certain, more volatile essential oils such as this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not sure it&#x27;s doing anything for my brain, but it smells nice.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Plant Therapy Brand is my New Fav!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent was not as strong as i would have liked but not due to the oil but due to the other ingredients.</li>
            <li>The cap has a dropper, seals tightly, and is labeled on top.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>so wonderful if you add a few drops and rub your hands together and add to wet or dry hair..</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with grapefruit essential oil, so maybe it&#x27;s my lack of experience with it, but I also own orange essential oil from the same company, and I tell you, they both smell EXACTLY the same!...</li>
            <li>My second goto brand is Eden&#x27;s Garden which seems slightly higher quality and EG often has certain oils that PTE don&#x27;t have.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The grapefruit oil smells exactly like a fresh ripe pink grapefruit.</li>
            <li>This is one of those fun essential oil smells.</li>
            <li>The only issue we had is that we used this to give a fresh scent to our homemade fabric softener and the color did show up in the whites.  </li>
            <li>I do not think this specific product has a strong enough smell...</li>
            <li>ok but not a strong smell</li>
            <li>This grapefruit is so refreshing and their other singles and synergy oils are of equal high quality.</li>
            <li>The grapefruit scent was as expected clean, and fruity.</li>
            <li>I really find it to be very uplifting and use it daily.</li>
            <li>The top dispenses at a faster rate than I thought it would and made counting individual drops harder, but it may take some practice.</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh and strong, and only a few drops are required.</li>
            <li>This pink grapefruit essential oil smells wonderful in the bottle, but the scent is much too subtle when used in my (topical) recipes as well as for room sprays/freshening.</li>
            <li>Although the smell is really good, it goes away in a matter of minutes, very very quickly :(</li>
            <li>The batch I received doesn&#x27;t seem to have much in common with what the other reviewers experienced.</li>
            <li>however the shipping cost more than the product and the bottle is so small</li>
            <li>They may not be as certified as those other two big business brands, but it certainly is more affordable.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be exploring a &#x27;Pin&#x27; that I found on Pinterest showing how to make your own scented waxes for diffusing essential oils by mixing them with wax and pouring them into the empty Scentsy bar mold.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, its pure essential oil.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and was what I expected.</li>
            <li>I like pink grapefruit with lemon), but the scent tends to get lost fairly quickly used alone or blended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My nearly 9 year old son adores this scent!  </li>
            <li>thought it was a nice grapefruit-y smell, but too weak.</li>
            <li>I mix a little with the same company&#x27;s fractionated coconut oil for some very light post-shower moisture.</li>
            <li>The only two that were 100% pure were the Plant Therapy and Young Living ones.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised at the consistency of this oil.</li>
            <li>Really watery and the scent dissapears almost instantly.</li>
            <li>Bought this to make a natural perfume and it met my expectations.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using this product (Grapefruit (Pink) Essential Oil) through Plant Therapy Essential Oils.</li>
            <li>Very close to an actual grapefruit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;we were planning to use in natural fabric softener application</li>
            <li>All the bottles were packaged very neatly in individually wrapped bubble wrap; there was no breakage or leakage.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last when I add it to lotions, or diffusers, or carrier oils--the very air seems to dilute this stuff.</li>
            <li>I used this stuff so frequently that I ran out.</li>
            <li>Oil or scent does not irritate my childs sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I really appreciated their personal touch.  </li>
            <li>They could be used interchangably as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li>simply because first of all it smells lovely (even if it smells like oranges) and second because I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s not suppose to smell like this.</li>
            <li>Just like a fresh, pink, juicy grapefruit.</li>
            <li>I added half a bottle to several gallons of homemade laundry detergent and it results in a faint, but refreshing and pleasant, scent in the final product.</li>
            <li>I use it regularly in a spray bottle mixed with healthy water sometimes adding other drops like lavender or peppermint to soothe my skin.</li>
            <li>Only a few drops of it are needed so it will last a long time, and I also love that it is somewhat of a natural preservative if used in the right proportions.</li>
            <li>Just starting to dabble with essential oils and not ready to spend big money on the top 2 &amp;#34;pyramid&amp;#34; brands.</li>
            <li>It curbs your hunger like no other!</li>
            <li>It was a huge surprise when it actually arrived in a day and a half.  </li>
            <li>I had read in Maratha Stewart&#x27;s new book about putting Grapefruit essential oil on your forehead, temples and by nose in the morning to give you a perky feeling of wake-up and refreshment</li>
            <li>It is a strong product so a little bit does go a long way.</li>
            <li>He inhales the aroma and calms right down.  </li>
            <li>Mixed with ginger, lemon and lavender is wow!</li>
            <li>This product smells yummy and sweet, very reminiscent of pink grapefruit- definitely recommend for any grapefruit or citrus lovers ...</li>
            <li>It is more expensive, but you get the high quality that you want.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need overpriced oils such as Young Living in order to get quality.  </li>
            <li>The only complaint with this one is that it didn&#x27;t seem quite potent enough.</li>
            <li>Overall, considering the very faint scent of the oil once out of the bottle and how quickly it fades, it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li>I was first amazed by how quick the products arrived because in the notification it said it would arrive approximately 4 days later from the order date.  </li>
            <li>The patchouli oil I used on the other half of the batch is holding up just fine.</li>
            <li>Well, first off, this product ended up costing me close to $12, including packaging (which accounted for half of the cost.)</li>
            <li>It is never good to get any other kind of essential oils.</li>
            <li>the smell is pretty weak and doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;hit&amp;#34; you.</li>

            <li> Taste is very appealing and fresh!  </li>
            <li> I wish I could have put more oil in them as it is naturally a very light  scent.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m a huge fan!</li>
            <li> 1-2 oz would have been better for the price.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of it, but got a rash from it after a bit.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE the scent.  </li>
            <li> If you are using this to make up a lot of sugar scrubs or salts I reccommend getting two bottles even though I was able to make a lot of sugar scrubs (20 containers)</li>
            <li> and it cleans well, too :)</li>
            <li> I used this in a body scrub and loved the fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Love this oil.</li>
            <li> this is a great product and really brightens up the room with citrusy goodness.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand</li>
            <li> It smells like candy i love it.</li>
            <li> I love Plant Therapy products.</li>
            <li> Others may love this though.</li>
            <li> I myself prefer Citrus Burst better.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Love....</li>
            <li> love</li>
            <li> This is an awesome essential oil.  </li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love the smell -</li>
            <li> I also added it to some foul smelling skin lotion, and am thoroughly pleased with the result.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just found what I think will be the perfect double boiler for the project here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> Fantastic company to do business with!</li>
            <li> I love the smell too.  </li>
            <li> Grapefruit oil must be one of the most cheerful-smelling things on the planet.</li>
            <li> I love it in water while at work or at home.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell, but you have to use a lot of it in the diffuser.</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t much more than I can say about it.</li>
            <li> makes me want to drink more water.  </li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> but I had eleven more words to use..</li>
            <li> I love using it in my Plant Therapy oil diffuser.</li>
            <li> I love it...</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This company went out of their way to make sure I was pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read many of the reviews on this product, and I haven&#x27;t seen anyone mention that it smells more like oranges than grapefruit.</li>
            <li> I did replace the lid with a dropper I had on hand &amp; am glad I have that, but I hadn&#x27;t tried the lid it came with before.</li>
            <li> love the smell</li>
            <li> I have added it to many household things.</li>
            <li> It has a wonderful fresh smell that I just love -- the smell of real grapefruit.  </li>
            <li> It is one of the best essential oils that I have had, and plan to buy more from this company.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice, clean smell.  </li>
            <li> I have tried using essential oils alone in the warmer dish and found that the scents fade rather quickly, but using the melted wax which no longer gave off it&#x27;s own scent, was an excellent carrier for diffusing the grapefruit oil.  </li>
            <li> I have a pretty good nose for smells, not a fan.</li>
            <li> This came packaged nicely and quickly.  </li>
            <li> I liked the scent, it&#x27;s fresh and authentic, but it lasts for all of three seconds.</li>
            <li> and I am very sensitive to overpowering scents (I greatly dislike perfume, musky type</li>
            <li> I love the smell of grapefruit, and this essential oil perfectly captures that refreshing citrus scent of a freshly cut grapefruit.</li>
            <li> Smells absolutely amazing like the peel of a fresh grapefruit (great since that&#x27;s where the yummy oils live).  </li>
            <li> But this is a very sweet and organic smell to it.</li>
            <li> AND I AM PLEASANTLY SURPRISED AND HAPPY</li>
            <li> The scent was light and refreshing.</li>
            <li> , I enjoy many oils.</li>
            <li> I also ordered a rose essential oil from another supplier and the scent is excellent AND it lasts very well.</li>
            <li> My co-workers and friends loved the scent so much.</li>
            <li> This was more than fantastic as I needed them very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, I sometimes open the container just to smell it, it smells so good!</li>
            <li> Great shipping and love essential oils!</li>
            <li> It drops easily from the supplied bottle.</li>
            <li> The oil arrived here fast and the dropper on the top was handy.</li>
            <li> (not artificial) smell of a grapefruit and nice smooth texture.</li>
            <li> It smells really sweet and citrusy, which I love - but - UGH</li>
            <li> Clean smell, great disinfectant, and natural.</li>
            <li> The Grapefruit Oil is amazing, smells wonderful, great tasting, usually add a few drops (daily) in my water bottle, excellent for maintaining weight.</li>
            <li> This essential oil is very strong (in a good way).  </li>
            <li> Ordered 2 bottles and though the scent is wonderful when first opened it does not last once applied.</li>
            <li> you have to enjoy citrus to like this, it&#x27;s quite strong but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Great, fresh smell, true to what grapefruits really smell like.</li>
            <li> It smelled great, but wore off incredibly quickly, and felt more like a water based product than the essential oil it claimed to be.</li>
            <li> The scent is quite accurate though.</li>
            <li> The reviews from others in addition to the quality of ingredients used were a huge factor that assisted me.  </li>
            <li> This is fantastic oil.</li>
            <li> Great product, use 3 drops in my daily water to help with dehydration.</li>
            <li> Perfect, just as nice as much more expensive oils.</li>
            <li> Additionally it arrived very quickly in secure packaging.</li>
            <li> It still cleans streak free so this is not effecting my solution.</li>
            <li> would recommend to anyone looking for some great essential</li>
            <li> smells fabulous.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely happy and would definitely order again.  </li>
            <li> I especially appreciate the identification sticker on top of the cap, eliminating the need to make my own top label.</li>
            <li> I only bought it to make sugar scrubs but it works really great for that purpose.</li>
            <li> Is great in making at home lotions, hair treatments, or facial treaments!!!</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> This is a fine product with a very nice citrus scent - an important addition to add to an essential oils collection...</li>
            <li> Fast Shipment!!!</li>
            <li> All of them smell very nice, and the citronella mixed with skin oil kept the mosquitos away.</li>
            <li> I use a few drops with water to clean my room and it smells so wonderful.</li>
            <li> I use this in my homemade skin products and really love the scent which is exactly like sticking your nose into a fresh juicy grapefruit :)</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy is a wonderful source for high quality essential oils.  </li>
            <li> I USE THIS MAINLY FOR MY OWN</li>
            <li> ...it is a strong scent, but not in a make you sick kind of way - it&#x27;s more of a can&#x27;t help but continuing to inhale kind of way...very pleasant &amp; refreshing.</li>
            <li> It has a crisp refreshing citrus scent</li>
            <li> Everyone loves the clean citrus scent.</li>
            <li> I used it to make bath salts and sugar scrubs to I did not have to be super precise.  </li>
            <li> And the rug was clean too.</li>
            <li> and wow it has so many uses!</li>
            <li> I use it in my face masks and mixed with baking soda for shower tabs for a bright &amp; awakening scent in the morning.</li>
            <li> great for many uses; on dryer balls, in Ball jar w/baking soda for natural air freshner, homemade facial spray.  </li>
            <li> Almost sweet.</li>
            <li> Is real grapefruit (potent smell).</li>
            <li> Seems like its true to its description.</li>
            <li> I bought a really good diffuser through Amazon a couple months ago and playing around with different oils.</li>
            <li> This can be used for a lot of things, but I use it as a &amp;#34;cologne.&amp;#34; It doesn&#x27;t smell as tho you are wearing something edible, but rather fresh and cheerful.</li>
            <li> I think it has a cheerful fresh effect.</li>
            <li> The scent is so true, I was amazed.  </li>
            <li> Smells so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I recommend you find another more reputable source for your essential oil.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> a plus, the shipping was done quickly and arrived to me in record time.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and packaged soundly - I like the smell, its crisp and fruity.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a nice clean, fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li> It smells EXACTLY like peeling a fresh grapefruit!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful true pink grapefruit scent - smells just like you cut open a fresh grapefruit or poured a glass of grapefruit juice.</li>
            <li> The smell is clean and crisp.  </li>
            <li> euro dropper works fine for my purposes, and I have no problems with it coming out too fast.</li>
            <li> I use a few drops of this in my sodastream carbonated water for a great taste.  </li>
            <li> Makes a nice addition to my home-made counter cleaner, and also a drop or two on my low watt lightbulb</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite scent that I use in my body butters and lotions.</li>
            <li> For the price and the smell of this product, it definitely is worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> I LOVE grapefruit and never owned a grapefruit oil before, but it expected better consistency.</li>
            <li> yep, smells just like a freshly peeled grapefruit, I can almost taste it....</li>
            <li> I am using it to sprinkle around my vanity for a nice smell and in some facial soap to fight breakouts.</li>
            <li> I used this oil in all natural body and face scrubs with coconut oil and the smell is wonderfully refreshing.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> I put a drop of this oil in the trash can in my powder room, and it fills the room with a fresh grapefruity scent all day.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell of pink grapefruit; use this in my bath oils more than anything.</li>
            <li> could be stronger smelling, buy nice enough</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually using this as a nice scent for some home-made greener cleaners for my home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently been making lots of my own cleaners and beauty products.</li>
            <li> I rarely get compliments from my brother, tho</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells like you just cut into a fresh grapefruit.</li>
            <li> So far, I have used it mixed into coconut oil as a great body moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This oil smells wonderful and mixes well with other oils to make toners and facial sprays.</li>
            <li> Really made the soap smell fresh and clean</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much it smells like a fresh grapefruit!</li>
            <li> The price was right</li>
            <li> a go eat one right now....</li>
            <li> Received my order right on time.</li>
            <li> and it is just the right scent not to over poweringand not wimpy...</li>
            <li> you want a true grapefruit scent, as pure as the fruit itself, this oil is the one to pick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell of this oil smells exactly like fresh cut grapefruit.  </li>
            <li> Smells more like real, fresh grapefruit that other&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Seriously makes your mouth water, it smells so good!</li>
            <li> Does not appear to be diluted and smells very crisp and pure.</li>
            <li> It was used in combination with other ingredients in making my own lotion and the fragrance is mild.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery, product just as described.</li>
            <li> Rather than a nice single drop, they gush out.  </li>
            <li> This essential oil arrived quickly and just in time to make up some spray to clean the mats in my yoga class!  </li>
            <li> Exactly as it should be.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, but it is definately not quite the pink grapefruit that I was expecting.</li>
            <li> This one smells just like real grapefruit, makes your mouth water!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> and I think it will scent it exactly how I imagined</li>
            <li> should I ever take the initiative to actually get started on these projects :)</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME ORDERING THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li> , I really like the lean fresh smell.</li>
            <li> I love essential oils, but the prices can get exorbitant.  </li>
            <li> It came in time and smells more like red orange</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s a feature of any grapefruit essential oil, but just be prepared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love essential oils</li>
            <li> but nonetheless I&#x27;ve ordered this brand before and the quality is comparable to higher end oils.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> It only lasts a couple of days on the cotton, though, so I will have to find a better way to diffuse it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more when this bottle runs out.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is the first Plant Therapy I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li> I use Scentsy products around my house and LOVE grapefruit scents, which are harder to come by in a &#x27;true&#x27; scent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried several Plant Therapy essential oils, but they have been wonderful products.  </li>
            <li> It smells exactly like a grapefruit.  </li>
            <li> I love all of the Plant Therapy essential oils.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was after.  </li>
            <li> I really like this oil!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more from this company.</li>
            <li> I make my own lotions, and pink grapefruit is my all-time favorite essential oil for summer.  </li>
            <li> Works great combine with other products !!!!</li>
            <li> and yes, when I say happy I mean it.</li>
            <li> good but not necessarily strong enough…</li>
            <li> The scent itself is not quite as sharp as the real thing, but other than that it is very pleasant and not artificial smelling at all.</li>
            <li> I love that they are pure essential oils.</li>
            <li> The grapefruit adds a nice scent to glass and other cleaners.</li>
            <li> It is a smell that is clean without having to directly call cleaning products to mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A good essential oil is a key ingredient in almost all my recipes.</li>
            <li> I prefer strong scents so this is just mine &amp; my families personal opinion.</li>
            <li> They put this teeny bottle in a LARGE box.</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s 100% pure.</li>
            <li> Smells so pure</li>
            <li> I enjoy plant therapy 100% pure Essential oil.</li>
            <li> I love pink grapefruit scent in shampoos and shower gels and though the real thing in my diffuser will be heavenly...</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing essential oils, and I was very pleased with the quality of the pink grapefruit oil.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;BE WARNED: I did discover that grapefruit essential oil can stain light colored fabrics, it has a noticeable orange hue.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is only my third essential oil, in addition to lemon-eucalyptus and tea tree, and I feel like this bright, fresh scent rounded out my collection.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and was well packaged too.</li>
            <li> I bought this to scent some homemade dishwasher soap and it worked very well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks goes to all the people who took the time to post their reviews.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It drips out of the bottle fast.  </li>
            <li> This Grapefruit is very pleasing to the senses.</li>
            <li> she loves it so much</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot to say about the oil since I didn&#x27;t really do anything with it.</li>
            <li> I love pink grape fruit and when I found this oil...</li>
            <li> I make my own all purpose cleaning solution with boiled water, lemon essential oil, and grapefruit essential oil.  </li>
            <li> To be fair, their other oils (ginger, petigrain, lemongrass) did make a good impression on me, so I would be open to ordering other types of EOs from this company in the future.</li>
            <li> I am just starting with making my own natural lotions and cleaning products and this was my first purchase of essential oils.</li>
            <li> This essential oil smells just like fresh grapefruit!</li>
            <li> Every oil I have purchased smells way better then other brands I have purchased</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on a strict budget and cannot afford a lot of doTerra oils (I highly recommend their Peppermint because no other brand rids of my migraines so quickly as theirs) so I ordered this item to test out this company.  </li>
            <li> I clean only with vinegar</li>
            <li> In my opinion, situations like this merit expiration dates on bottles of certain, more volatile essential oils such as this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s doing anything for my brain, but it smells nice.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy Brand is my New Fav!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent was not as strong as i would have liked but not due to the oil but due to the other ingredients.</li>
            <li> The cap has a dropper, seals tightly, and is labeled on top.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> so wonderful if you add a few drops and rub your hands together and add to wet or dry hair..</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with grapefruit essential oil, so maybe it&#x27;s my lack of experience with it, but I also own orange essential oil from the same company, and I tell you, they both smell EXACTLY the same!...</li>
            <li> My second goto brand is Eden&#x27;s Garden which seems slightly higher quality and EG often has certain oils that PTE don&#x27;t have.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The grapefruit oil smells exactly like a fresh ripe pink grapefruit.</li>
            <li> This is one of those fun essential oil smells.</li>
            <li> The only issue we had is that we used this to give a fresh scent to our homemade fabric softener and the color did show up in the whites.  </li>
            <li> I do not think this specific product has a strong enough smell...</li>
            <li> ok but not a strong smell</li>
            <li> This grapefruit is so refreshing and their other singles and synergy oils are of equal high quality.</li>
            <li> The grapefruit scent was as expected clean, and fruity.</li>
            <li> I really find it to be very uplifting and use it daily.</li>
            <li> The top dispenses at a faster rate than I thought it would and made counting individual drops harder, but it may take some practice.</li>
            <li> The scent is fresh and strong, and only a few drops are required.</li>
            <li> This pink grapefruit essential oil smells wonderful in the bottle, but the scent is much too subtle when used in my (topical) recipes as well as for room sprays/freshening.</li>
            <li> Although the smell is really good, it goes away in a matter of minutes, very very quickly :(</li>
            <li> The batch I received doesn&#x27;t seem to have much in common with what the other reviewers experienced.</li>
            <li> however the shipping cost more than the product and the bottle is so small</li>
            <li> They may not be as certified as those other two big business brands, but it certainly is more affordable.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be exploring a &#x27;Pin&#x27; that I found on Pinterest showing how to make your own scented waxes for diffusing essential oils by mixing them with wax and pouring them into the empty Scentsy bar mold.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, its pure essential oil.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and was what I expected.</li>
            <li> I like pink grapefruit with lemon), but the scent tends to get lost fairly quickly used alone or blended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My nearly 9 year old son adores this scent!  </li>
            <li> thought it was a nice grapefruit-y smell, but too weak.</li>
            <li> I mix a little with the same company&#x27;s fractionated coconut oil for some very light post-shower moisture.</li>
            <li> The only two that were 100% pure were the Plant Therapy and Young Living ones.</li>
            <li> and I was surprised at the consistency of this oil.</li>
            <li> Really watery and the scent dissapears almost instantly.</li>
            <li> Bought this to make a natural perfume and it met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this product (Grapefruit (Pink) Essential Oil) through Plant Therapy Essential Oils.</li>
            <li> Very close to an actual grapefruit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;we were planning to use in natural fabric softener application</li>
            <li> All the bottles were packaged very neatly in individually wrapped bubble wrap; there was no breakage or leakage.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last when I add it to lotions, or diffusers, or carrier oils--the very air seems to dilute this stuff.</li>
            <li> I used this stuff so frequently that I ran out.</li>
            <li> Oil or scent does not irritate my childs sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I really appreciated their personal touch.  </li>
            <li> They could be used interchangably as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li> simply because first of all it smells lovely (even if it smells like oranges) and second because I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s not suppose to smell like this.</li>
            <li> Just like a fresh, pink, juicy grapefruit.</li>
            <li> I added half a bottle to several gallons of homemade laundry detergent and it results in a faint, but refreshing and pleasant, scent in the final product.</li>
            <li> I use it regularly in a spray bottle mixed with healthy water sometimes adding other drops like lavender or peppermint to soothe my skin.</li>
            <li> Only a few drops of it are needed so it will last a long time, and I also love that it is somewhat of a natural preservative if used in the right proportions.</li>
            <li> Just starting to dabble with essential oils and not ready to spend big money on the top 2 &amp;#34;pyramid&amp;#34; brands.</li>
            <li> It curbs your hunger like no other!</li>
            <li> It was a huge surprise when it actually arrived in a day and a half.  </li>
            <li> I had read in Maratha Stewart&#x27;s new book about putting Grapefruit essential oil on your forehead, temples and by nose in the morning to give you a perky feeling of wake-up and refreshment</li>
            <li> It is a strong product so a little bit does go a long way.</li>
            <li> He inhales the aroma and calms right down.  </li>
            <li> Mixed with ginger, lemon and lavender is wow!</li>
            <li> This product smells yummy and sweet, very reminiscent of pink grapefruit- definitely recommend for any grapefruit or citrus lovers ...</li>
            <li> It is more expensive, but you get the high quality that you want.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need overpriced oils such as Young Living in order to get quality.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint with this one is that it didn&#x27;t seem quite potent enough.</li>
            <li> Overall, considering the very faint scent of the oil once out of the bottle and how quickly it fades, it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> I was first amazed by how quick the products arrived because in the notification it said it would arrive approximately 4 days later from the order date.  </li>
            <li> The patchouli oil I used on the other half of the batch is holding up just fine.</li>
            <li> Well, first off, this product ended up costing me close to $12, including packaging (which accounted for half of the cost.)</li>
            <li> It is never good to get any other kind of essential oils.</li>
            <li> the smell is pretty weak and doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;hit&amp;#34; you.</li>
            <li> I have one small warmer in the bathroom and have discovered that adding a few drops of this essential oil delivers a wonderfully rich scent to the air.  </li>
            <li> i love this aroma in my house when feeling tired and need little extra to pick me up!</li>
            <li> There was no need to use to much when making body scrubs, a small amount goes along way.</li>
            <li> so it didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I bought a few different brands of oil and did the construction paper test where you put a tiny drop on the construction paper and if it goes away completely you know</li>
            <li> Tried it in a diffuser and the scent didn&#x27;t last very long either.</li>
            <li> my only complaint about it is that it doesn&#x27;t have much staying power, but that doesn&#x27;t keep me from giving it five stars.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no big deal if you want 20 drops, but when you only want 2 or 3 drops, you need to be careful.  </li>
            <li> Being that citrus essential oils are expeller pressed and not distilled, they do have a limited shelf life..</li>
            <li> But like other reviewers, the dropper in the top of the bottle is difficult to use and adjust the amount.  </li>
            <li> It may be overpowering so you may want to use a little less than expected, then slowly add more.</li>
            <li> I like the subtle scent it adds and am positive it makes my hands softer.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still not certain if I would suffer any internal damage!</li>
            <li> When I initially ordered I was afraid the scent might be too strong</li>
            <li> It cost too much to lose even the little that leaked, but it is not worth returning for another with the delay in delivery due to an ice storm.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to make homemade dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> for being &#x27;pure&#x27; the smell was weak and stained the inside of my humidifer.</li>
            <li> This is slightly perfumed oil, not essential oil.</li>
            <li> Not overpowering, but definitely noticeable from only a small amount.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten so used to fake grapefruit scent that I expected this to smell different from orange, and to my nose, the citrusy scent is very close to orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I bought some pink grapefruit oil.  </li>
            <li> Come as expected.</li>
            <li> I received my pink grapefruit oil promptly.  </li>
            <li> I mixed a few drops into a couple ounces of water and I am using it in a spray bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This oil was exactly as I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> If you plan to use it as an additive to other oils or by itself as a perfume, it&#x27;s hopeless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to other recipes I can use it in.</li>
            <li> I bought this brand due to the price.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure that this would be the only brand I would recommend.  </li>
            <li> When I want something a little different, I also use a few drops of lavender oil.</li>
            <li> yes, it smells like pink grapefruit, for a  while....  still can&#x27;t find something like the Williams Sonoma pink grapefruit oil of a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint with Plant Therapy would be the drip lids.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a very strong smelling oil, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> If you need to know what that smells like, go to the grocery store, purchase a grapefruit, cut it in half and take a whiff - that&#x27;s what this smells</li>
            <li> the relatively faint scent led me to wonder if this bottle of grapefruit EO was perhaps older stock.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t release the oil in drops, it just pours out and makes a mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like summer in a little bottle.</li>
            <li> The Plant Therapy brand is much, much less expensive than Young Living</li>
            <li> but it is heavily diluted, probably in a ration of 1 to 30.</li>
            <li> I add a few drops of this to my homemade hand soap.</li>
            <li> I dilute a few drops into coconut oil and use it as a moisturizer/perfume.</li>
            <li> I have bought and used quite a few plant therapy oils.</li>
            <li> I got introduced to doTerra after I ordered this and wished I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money on this.</li>
            <li> I add a few drops to coconut oil and use it on my legs and butt to help with cellulite and decongest my skin.</li>
            <li> My husband has trouble sleeping, so I am going to make a blissful sleep salve for his feet.</li>
            <li> I ordered a few oils through Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I mix it a few drops with a few of the lemon oil and orange oil that came in my kit....</li>
            <li> so I drop a few drops of this in my cleaning water</li>
            <li> I put a few drops in my diffuser and it helps curb my appetite -</li>
            <li> I put a few drops on cotton balls and leave them all over the house.</li>
            <li> It was slowly leaking inside the bubble wrap that was around the bottle and still sealed closed.  </li>
            <li> I also put a few drops in my water.</li>
            <li> Weak scent compared to other companies.</li>
            <li> I have it 4 stars because there was excessive packaging when this item shipped separately.</li>
            <li> but when I added a small amount of another essential oil it became difficult to smell.  </li>
            <li> The USPS did a terrible job cramming 2 other packages that belong to someone from the next block and not delivering the other item I had ordered on the same date as this item.  </li>
            <li> We felt that we had to use a slightly excessive amount to acheive the scent we were looking for.</li>
            <li> I use a little under my nose whenever I feel tense.  </li>
            <li> The item arrived with the safety seal broken indicating that it had previously had the lid completely twisted open.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t tried grapefruit scents in the past, because I never really liked them.</li>
            <li> I use vinegar/water as an all-purpose cleaner, and was getting tired of the smell.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately the essence was just not there.  </li>
            <li> Sorry,</li>
            <li> also found that it stung my skin very painfully when added liberally to a bath, so be careful!</li>
            <li> - it loses a star because of the stupid dispenser.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t wrong!  </li>
            <li> When applied to a cotton ball, it is very difficult to smell 2 feet away.</li>
            <li> The price isn&#x27;t too bad either.</li>
            <li> BUT all of them have bad quality dispensers.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed by any of them.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> This was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> , cuts that nasty vinegar smell!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It smells good but it is heavily diluted, probably in a ration of 1 to 30. This is slightly perfumed oil, not essential oil. I recommend you find another more reputable source for your essential oil.</li>
            <li> Exactly as it should be.</li>
            <li> Used it when making shaving cream....it was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;The scent was not as strong as i would have liked but not due to the oil but due to the other ingredients.</li>
            <li> I read an article recently about the powers of smell on the brain. Grapefruit oil was supposed to increase alrertness, so in a (admittedly fruity) moment, I purchased the oil. Not sure it&#x27;s doing anything for my brain, but it smells nice.</li>
            <li> Wonderful pure oil. Dr. Oz  said that smelling grapefruit oil when hungry disminish the appetite.</li>
            <li> The oil arrived here fast and the dropper on the top was handy. The smell is nice, but it is definately not quite the pink grapefruit that I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil to mix in with some others. It has a wonderful citrus smell. Almost sweet. The price isn&#x27;t too bad either.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty good nose for smells, not a fan.</li>
            <li> Great shipping and love essential oils!</li>
            <li> Weak scent compared to other companies.</li>
            <li> Bought this to use in homemade cosmetics and cleaners and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. The scent is fresh and strong, and only a few drops are required.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this oil! It smells great. Is real grapefruit (potent smell). The shipping was fast. I would have rated it 5 stars however the shipping cost more than the product and the bottle is so small so it didn&#x27;t last long. 1-2 oz would have been better for the price.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and packaged soundly - I like the smell, its crisp and fruity. Makes a nice addition to my home-made counter cleaner, and also a drop or two on my low watt lightbulb sends a nice waft of scent in my bathroom</li>
            <li> This is fantastic oil. I like it a lot. The product works great, smells wonderful, and is exactly what you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li> Great product, use 3 drops in my daily water to help with dehydration. Would recommend to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed by the quality of this product. It has a wonderful aroma and everything that I have put it in (soaps, bath salts, etc) has turned out beautifully. Highly recommend it for anyone looking for a good quality product at a very fair price.</li>
            <li> smell good !  The oil arrived as indicated and will buy again.</li>
            <li> This oil smells wonderful and mixes well with other oils to make toners and facial sprays. Great for the skin!</li>
            <li> This essential oil smells just like fresh grapefruit! The concentration is awesome so the aroma lasts. I used it in some glycerin soap I was making and yum what a yummy fragrance. Mixed with ginger, lemon and lavender is wow! Very nice combination.</li>
            <li> The Grapefruit Oil is amazing, smells wonderful, great tasting, usually add a few drops (daily) in my water bottle, excellent for maintaining weight.</li>
            <li> Citrus smells make you feel refreshed and energized. i love this aroma in my house when feeling tired and need little extra to pick me up! This one smells just like real grapefruit, makes your mouth water!</li>
            <li> Very nice and uplifting scent...you have to enjoy citrus to like this, it&#x27;s quite strong but not overpowering. I use it in my face masks and mixed with baking soda for shower tabs for a bright &amp; awakening scent in the morning.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite scent that I use in my body butters and lotions. Everyone loves the clean citrus scent.</li>
            <li> I add a few drops of this to my homemade hand soap. I like the subtle scent it adds and am positive it makes my hands softer.</li>
            <li> Item was just as described, and perfect for my needs!  Smells great and arrived quickly. Very pleased with the product.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a massage therapist who uses essential oils in my massages.  This grapefruit is a wonderful oil.  The smell is clean and crisp.  Just as you would expect a quality oil to be.  I ordered others as well.  I&#x27;m a very pleased customer.  I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> For the price and the smell of this product, it definitely is worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> Well, first off, this product ended up costing me close to $12, including packaging (which accounted for half of the cost.) They put this teeny bottle in a LARGE box. It made me wonder whether Amazon does this on purchase, to upcharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product...eh. I collect essential oils and I was surprised at the consistency of this oil. Really watery and the scent dissapears almost instantly. I LOVE grapefruit and never owned a grapefruit oil before, but it expected better consistency.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of it, but got a rash from it after a bit. Sure smells great though!</li>
            <li> I dilute a few drops into coconut oil and use it as a moisturizer/perfume. The scent is refreshing and wonderful. When I want something a little different, I also use a few drops of lavender oil.</li>
            <li> Dr. Oz claims that smelling grapefruit essence reduces appetite.  Didn&#x27;t work for me.  Tried it in a diffuser and the scent didn&#x27;t last very long either.</li>
            <li> Good quality product. Product was exactly as described. Bought this to make a natural perfume and it met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I am a newbie when it comes to the world of essential oils.  This seems to be a good quality item though and I LOVE the scent.  Now all I need to do is get to working on some of the DIY stuff I have been intending to make.  I bought this one for a moisturizer  and I sugar scrub I want to make and I think it will scent it exactly how I imagined should I ever take the initiative to actually get started on these projects :)</li>
            <li> I like to dab this on like perfume. I am impressed with oil. I have bought and used quite a few plant therapy oils.</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing essential oils, and I was very pleased with the quality of the pink grapefruit oil. It has a crisp refreshing citrus scent and I plan to use it in my homemade powdered laundry detergent.</li>
            <li> Perfect, just as nice as much more expensive oils.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Shipped quickly and packaged well. Good quality</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I was looking for. The grapefruit oil smells exactly like a fresh ripe pink grapefruit. Additionally it arrived very quickly in secure packaging. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This smells good but isn&#x27;t that strong. I got introduced to doTerra after I ordered this and wished I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money on this. Nothing compares to doTerra.</li>
            <li> The price was right but unfortunately the essence was just not there.  Sorry, but I would not purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> I use this in my homemade skin products and really love the scent which is exactly like sticking your nose into a fresh juicy grapefruit :) No additives or anything.  Only a few drops of it are needed so it will last a long time, and I also love that it is somewhat of a natural preservative if used in the right proportions.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME ORDERING THE PRODUCT AND I AM PLEASANTLY SURPRISED AND HAPPY WITH&lt;br /&gt;IT AND WOULD ORDER THIS AGAIN. I USE ANOTHER&lt;br /&gt;BRAND ALSO. I USE THIS MAINLY FOR MY OWN&lt;br /&gt;AROMATHERAPY TO CREATE A SOOTHING, CALMING&lt;br /&gt;EFFECT IN MY ROOM OR BATH. ALSO I WEAR THIS&lt;br /&gt;COMBINED WITH MY COCONUT OIL WHICH MAKES FOR&lt;br /&gt;A CLEAN AND PLEASANT BUT NOT OVERPOWERING&lt;br /&gt;SCENT AND I RECEIVE ALOT OF COMPLIMENTS.&lt;br /&gt;GOOD SERVICE AND GREAT PRODUCT AS WELL.&lt;br /&gt;AMAZON NEVER DISAPPOINTS!</li>
            <li> If you are using this to make up a lot of sugar scrubs or salts I reccommend getting two bottles even though I was able to make a lot of sugar scrubs (20 containers) I wish I could have put more oil in them as it is naturally a very light  scent.  I liked the scent much more than I thought I would.  It was a miscalculation on my part but my scrubs still turned out nice.</li>
            <li> I make my own floor cleaner and I add this , I really like the lean fresh smell. It still cleans streak free so this is not effecting my solution.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil for homemade sugar scrubs and wanted something that smelled fresh and delicious. I can&#x27;t believe how much it smells like a fresh grapefruit! It arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> It smells great but it doesn&#x27;t last at all. If you plan to use it as an additive to other oils or by itself as a perfume, it&#x27;s hopeless. The smell dissipates within 5 min.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Great product and great value. Will definitely buy again when I need to add to my essential oil stash!</li>
            <li> Smells Great!  That&#x27;s all I ask of a scented oil and this one doesn&#x27;t disappoint. Wish it came in a larger size.</li>
            <li> This is a fine product with a very nice citrus scent - an important addition to add to an essential oils collection...</li>
            <li> I make my own all purpose cleaning solution with boiled water, lemon essential oil, and grapefruit essential oil.  I love the smell of this! and it cleans well, too :)</li>
            <li> yep, smells just like a freshly peeled grapefruit, I can almost taste it.... mouth watering, Ima go eat one right now....</li>
            <li> I used this in a body scrub and loved the fresh scent. It is a strong product so a little bit does go a long way.</li>
            <li> I love essential oils, but the prices can get exorbitant.  This brand seems to be very good without the high price tag.  It&#x27;s not a very strong smelling oil, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> The smell of the grapefruit oil is so refreshing!  I really find it to be very uplifting and use it daily.</li>
            <li> It came in time and smells more like red orange but that is what I want. I use it in a mixture for my face and also when I want my room to smell Happy. and yes, when I say happy I mean it. The scent gives me energy, happiness and joy. Love it. will buy from this seller again def))</li>
            <li> I love the smell. Just like a fresh, pink, juicy grapefruit. I am using it to sprinkle around my vanity for a nice smell and in some facial soap to fight breakouts.</li>
            <li> The grapefruit oil works great I feel great when I take it take it in some water the oils I&#x27;ve been taking have helped my body a lot Thanks.</li>
            <li> This has all the features I want in an essential oil. The cap has a dropper, seals tightly, and is labeled on top. Most importantly, it smells great! Very refreshing in the morning! I like to put a drop on the front of my shirt to take the smell with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE WARNED: I did discover that grapefruit essential oil can stain light colored fabrics, it has a noticeable orange hue. I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s a feature of any grapefruit essential oil, but just be prepared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found that it stung my skin very painfully when added liberally to a bath, so be careful! The bottle has a warning for potential skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this, it smells great, and I fully recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great for home made laundry detergent.  I wouldn&#x27;t eat it.  I&#x27;d just buy a grapefruit.  That is all.  Good luck.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t tried grapefruit scents in the past, because I never really liked them. But this is a very sweet and organic smell to it. I love that they are pure essential oils. It is never good to get any other kind of essential oils. It is more expensive, but you get the high quality that you want.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. It drops easily from the supplied bottle. I have it 4 stars because there was excessive packaging when this item shipped separately. This may have been Amazon&#x27;s fault. The smallest shipping box should be size of a letter versus a box for books!</li>
            <li> Received my order right on time. The scent smells just like when you cut into a grapfruit. It may be overpowering so you may want to use a little less than expected, then slowly add more. Can&#x27;t wait to use it with my bodywash.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful true pink grapefruit scent - smells just like you cut open a fresh grapefruit or poured a glass of grapefruit juice. I used this oil in all natural body and face scrubs with coconut oil and the smell is wonderfully refreshing.</li>
            <li> Love essential oils but I am picky about what company I order from.  I researched and found many good things about Plant Therapy so I bought some pink grapefruit oil.  this is a great product and really brightens up the room with citrusy goodness.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need overpriced oils such as Young Living in order to get quality.  This is my favorite brand and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed by any of them.  My second goto brand is Eden&#x27;s Garden which seems slightly higher quality and EG often has certain oils that PTE don&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Grapefruit is very good, has nice highlights, and is very fresh.  There are some studies implying that grapefruit essential oil destroys some cancer cells like skin cancers.</li>
            <li> It smells like candy i love it. I use a few drops with water to clean my room and it smells so wonderful. I highly recommend this, its pure essential oil.</li>
            <li> Smells absolutely amazing like the peel of a fresh grapefruit (great since that&#x27;s where the yummy oils live).  Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin (wrist) when used without a carrier oil. I also used it in a batch of solid lotion I made but when I added a small amount of another essential oil it became difficult to smell.  I think I just need to work on my ratio though.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love Plant Therapy products. I think they are high quality &amp; an excellent price. I will say that I feel Grapefruit is not one of their stronger scents. I prefer strong scents so this is just mine &amp; my families personal opinion. Others may love this though. The prices are good so it&#x27;s worth a try. I myself prefer Citrus Burst better.</li>
            <li> Great if I had received it on time but nonetheless I&#x27;ve ordered this brand before and the quality is comparable to higher end oils. I add a few drops to coconut oil and use it on my legs and butt to help with cellulite and decongest my skin. Nice fragrance, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery, product just as described. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is a great scent, and is not overpowering at all. This was exactly what I ordered. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about a month, and I have tried to use it as a appetite suppressor and just for it&#x27;s pleasant fragrance. I do not think this specific product has a strong enough smell... the smell is pretty weak and doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;hit&amp;#34; you. Not my favorite.</li>
            <li> It takes a lot of this to create fragrance and I find it very short lasting. I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I use a few drops of this in my sodastream carbonated water for a great taste.  I love it.  I will keep a supply on hand.</li>
            <li> Love....love....love it...using to make my own oils and it is just the right scent not to over poweringand not wimpy...</li>
            <li> I have to agree with another reviewer. I used this product to scent homemade laundry soap. It faded. The patchouli oil I used on the other half of the batch is holding up just fine.</li>
            <li> Have been using it to flavor water. So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Love this oil thank you!</li>
            <li> I put a drop of this oil in the trash can in my powder room, and it fills the room with a fresh grapefruity scent all day.  Love it!  I also put some in a spray bottle with water &amp; witch hazel to use wherever.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of pink grapefruit; use this in my bath oils more than anything. The citrus smell of grapefruit is so refreshing!</li>
            <li> Just as described. Can&#x27;t wait to use it with the essential oils I ordered. My husband has trouble sleeping, so I am going to make a blissful sleep salve for his feet.</li>
            <li> This came quickly as promised and a very nice product. Seems like its true to its description. Nice tasting and smelling.</li>
            <li> could be stronger smelling, buy nice enough</li>
            <li> This essential oil is very strong (in a good way).  Does not appear to be diluted and smells very crisp and pure.</li>
            <li> Great article. Come as expected.</li>
            <li> I have gotten so used to fake grapefruit scent that I expected this to smell different from orange, and to my nose, the citrusy scent is very close to orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is only my third essential oil, in addition to lemon-eucalyptus and tea tree, and I feel like this bright, fresh scent rounded out my collection. It is a smell that is clean without having to directly call cleaning products to mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it to soak cotton balls and leave them in rooms where we spend a lot of time, especially in the winter when we can&#x27;t open windows here in the Northeast. It only lasts a couple of days on the cotton, though, so I will have to find a better way to diffuse it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a nice scent to add to one&#x27;s collection.</li>
            <li> But like other reviewers, the dropper in the top of the bottle is difficult to use and adjust the amount.  I used it to make bath salts and sugar scrubs to I did not have to be super precise.  The scent was light and refreshing.</li>
            <li> This was a good product, exactly as described and I used it to create my own room spray.  Smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> yes, it smells like pink grapefruit, for a  while....  still can&#x27;t find something like the Williams Sonoma pink grapefruit oil of a few years ago.  oh, well.</li>
            <li> Right from the bottle it smelled wonderful. There was no need to use to much when making body scrubs, a small amount goes along way.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make my own body washes and scrubs.  The product was described&lt;br /&gt;accurately and arrived on time as promised.  I would buy this product again as it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome essential oil.  So happy I got it!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to anyone looking for some great essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;I use it with my dryer balls from Norwex...awesome smell!</li>
            <li> This essential oil arrived quickly and just in time to make up some spray to clean the mats in my yoga class!  Spraying my mat, and those of my students with the grapefruit extract makes everything smell so good!  My students look forward to using my mat spray after every class!  I will definitely order more when this bottle runs out.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> The grapefruit scent was as expected clean, and fruity. I have 2 diffusers in my home, I enjoy many oils. The grapefruit is great for the kitchen.</li>
            <li> I love the scent, and the quality of this oil is great.  I make my own household cleaning products, and this cleans beautifully and makes everything smell wonderful as well.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this product (Grapefruit (Pink) Essential Oil) through Plant Therapy Essential Oils. Clean smell, great disinfectant, and natural.</li>
            <li> It curbs your hunger like no other! Take a whiff at night to avoid night snacking and in the morning before breakfast or your workout.</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy is a wonderful source for high quality essential oils.  This grapefruit is so refreshing and their other singles and synergy oils are of equal high quality.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. Smells more like real, fresh grapefruit that other&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried. Arrived fast and was well packaged too.</li>
            <li> ok but not a strong smell</li>
            <li> This is one of those fun essential oil smells. I have heard good things about Plant Therapy. They may not be as certified as those other two big business brands, but it certainly is more affordable. This is the first Plant Therapy I&#x27;ve tried. It seems to do what it&#x27;s supposed to. Seriously makes your mouth water, it smells so good!</li>
            <li> Love the smell - it&#x27;s perfectly like grapefruit (not all of them are!)</li>
            <li> We are very pleased with your grapefruit essentials, we use it in our citrus seasalt scrub.  Great scent. Lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> good for my skin and uplifts me during the winter SADs</li>
            <li> Wonderful paired with rose oil! Strong aroma!</li>
            <li> Tastes great and got to me quickly and securely!</li>
            <li> Although the smell is really good, it goes away in a matter of minutes, very very quickly :(</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more delighted with the scent of this oil. It smells EXACTLY like peeling a fresh grapefruit! Your nose cannot tell the difference!&lt;br /&gt;If you want a true grapefruit scent, as pure as the fruit itself, this oil is the one to pick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a plus, the shipping was done quickly and arrived to me in record time.</li>
            <li> Scent is true to life and very refreshing! I have purchased this repeatedly.</li>
            <li> love this, has a great fresh smell.</li>
            <li> the scent is refreshing and soothing.&lt;br /&gt;i sprinkle it in my dusting powder to make my own scented powder. sprinkle and let it stand overnight; the powder will absorb it.&lt;br /&gt;next morning break up any clumps.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and amazing service!</li>
            <li> Being that citrus essential oils are expeller pressed and not distilled, they do have a limited shelf life..the relatively faint scent led me to wonder if this bottle of grapefruit EO was perhaps older stock. In my opinion, situations like this merit expiration dates on bottles of certain, more volatile essential oils such as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was a nice grapefruit-y smell, but too weak. Still, I will use it until it is gone, and then not order citrus oils from Plant Therapy again. To be fair, their other oils (ginger, petigrain, lemongrass) did make a good impression on me, so I would be open to ordering other types of EOs from this company in the future.</li>
            <li> I ordered a few oils through Amazon.com. They got to me in fairly quick time, were wrapped well, and the oils themselves are of very good quality. I did grapefruit, citronella and eucalyptus. All of them smell very nice, and the citronella mixed with skin oil kept the mosquitos away.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as a supplement to help prevent liver damage.  On the bottle it said for external use.  I had consumes this product orally, prior to reading the label.  The company of this product should be sued for misleading advertisement.  This is day 2 and I&#x27;m still not certain if I would suffer any internal damage!</li>
            <li> I use vinegar/water as an all-purpose cleaner, and was getting tired of the smell.  This grapefruit oil did the trick.  I also added it to some foul smelling skin lotion, and am thoroughly pleased with the result.  It&#x27;s a nice, clean smell.  Not overpowering, but definitely noticeable from only a small amount.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually using this as a nice scent for some home-made greener cleaners for my home. The grapefruit adds a nice scent to glass and other cleaners. I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly what I ordered.  It was used in combination with other ingredients in making my own lotion and the fragrance is mild.</li>
            <li> I use Scentsy products around my house and LOVE grapefruit scents, which are harder to come by in a &#x27;true&#x27; scent.  I have one small warmer in the bathroom and have discovered that adding a few drops of this essential oil delivers a wonderfully rich scent to the air.  I have tried using essential oils alone in the warmer dish and found that the scents fade rather quickly, but using the melted wax which no longer gave off it&#x27;s own scent, was an excellent carrier for diffusing the grapefruit oil.  I&#x27;ve only tried several Plant Therapy essential oils, but they have been wonderful products.  I just opted to try adding their Tranquil blend to the larger Scentsy burner that I keep in the living room.  I will definitely be exploring a &#x27;Pin&#x27; that I found on Pinterest showing how to make your own scented waxes for diffusing essential oils by mixing them with wax and pouring them into the empty Scentsy bar mold.  I&#x27;ve already been saving my &#x27;faded&#x27; Scentsy wax to make emergency candles or fire starters, but now I&#x27;ll be adding this use to the repertoire.  I&#x27;ve just found what I think will be the perfect double boiler for the project here on Amazon.  Hopefully the link for that will show up also.  It&#x27;s following here, just in case you are looking for one  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007SPKRZI/ref&#x3D;ox_sc_act_title_8?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&amp;smid&#x3D;A2NVEKMQTGKOW8</li>
            <li> I bought this as an addition to a 14 pack essential oil kit I had recently purchased also from Plant Therapy.  (Loved that, too...see my review!)  I love pink grapefruit scent in shampoos and shower gels and though the real thing in my diffuser will be heavenly...I wasn&#x27;t wrong!  It is a great scent, citrusy, clean...energizing.  Sometimes I mix it a few drops with a few of the lemon oil and orange oil that came in my kit....love it!  Will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> This oil has a very pleasant and real! (not artificial) smell of a grapefruit and nice smooth texture. I use this oil as a skin moisturizer. I like this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to make homemade dry shampoo.  It worked perfectly and i love the smell.  Quick shipping and was what I expected.</li>
            <li> I bought a really good diffuser through Amazon a couple months ago and playing around with different oils. Grapefruit smells real good. Try it.</li>
            <li> This product smells yummy and sweet, very reminiscent of pink grapefruit- definitely recommend for any grapefruit or citrus lovers ...</li>
            <li> Very close to an actual grapefruit. The scent itself is not quite as sharp as the real thing, but other than that it is very pleasant and not artificial smelling at all. I bought this to scent some homemade dishwasher soap and it worked very well.  The top dispenses at a faster rate than I thought it would and made counting individual drops harder, but it may take some practice.</li>
            <li> smells fabulous.  Just starting to dabble with essential oils and not ready to spend big money on the top 2 &amp;#34;pyramid&amp;#34; brands. so far very happy with Plant Therapy products.</li>
            <li> good but not necessarily strong enough…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;we were planning to use in natural fabric softener application but it just wasn&#x27;t there, otherwise a great product.  Would buy again.  We ended up using the eucalyptus instead.</li>
            <li> The only issue we had is that we used this to give a fresh scent to our homemade fabric softener and the color did show up in the whites.  The scent is quite accurate though.</li>
            <li> i will never buy this again.  for being &#x27;pure&#x27; the smell was weak and stained the inside of my humidifer.</li>
            <li> I have not tried this seller&#x27;s product, yet after thorough research I did make a purchase. The reviews from others in addition to the quality of ingredients used were a huge factor that assisted me.  Thanks goes to all the people who took the time to post their reviews.  I was first amazed by how quick the products arrived because in the notification it said it would arrive approximately 4 days later from the order date.  It was a huge surprise when it actually arrived in a day and a half.  This was more than fantastic as I needed them very quickly.  All the bottles were packaged very neatly in individually wrapped bubble wrap; there was no breakage or leakage.  I am extremely happy and would definitely order again.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I used this in my homemade laundry soap.  Really made the soap smell fresh and clean&lt;br /&gt;So happy I tried it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently been making lots of my own cleaners and beauty products. A good essential oil is a key ingredient in almost all my recipes. This oil fulfilled all my expectations -I will definitely be buying from them again!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents. Fantastic company to do business with!</li>
            <li> I rarely get compliments from my brother, tho he is a sweetie. But, when he took me out for his birthday and gave me a hug he said, &amp;#34;You smell good!&amp;#34; LOL. I told him what it was and he was puzzled. This can be used for a lot of things, but I use it as a &amp;#34;cologne.&amp;#34; It doesn&#x27;t smell as tho you are wearing something edible, but rather fresh and cheerful. As an oil, it stays on longer. Quite a nice, inexpensive to add to your fragrances. I combine it with Argan oil, tho you don&#x27;t need to. I&#x27;ll be a return customer for this seller.</li>
            <li> It drips out of the bottle fast.  It&#x27;s no big deal if you want 20 drops, but when you only want 2 or 3 drops, you need to be careful.  Otherwise, I sometimes open the container just to smell it, it smells so good!</li>
            <li> The batch I received doesn&#x27;t seem to have much in common with what the other reviewers experienced. I liked the scent, it&#x27;s fresh and authentic, but it lasts for all of three seconds. It doesn&#x27;t last when I add it to lotions, or diffusers, or carrier oils--the very air seems to dilute this stuff. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I clean only with vinegar so I drop a few drops of this in my cleaning water and it&#x27;s great, cuts that nasty vinegar smell!!</li>
            <li> Yummy smell - I put a few drops in my diffuser and it helps curb my appetite - I love the smell too.  People always wonder what I am diffusing.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product and the time of delivery. :)It smells wonderful and I use it during the summer during my massage therapy.</li>
            <li> My order shows that I ordered the 10-ml bottle, but I actually received a 30-ml bottle, which was probably a mistake but I&#x27;m not complaining. Grapefruit oil must be one of the most cheerful-smelling things on the planet. I mix a little with the same company&#x27;s fractionated coconut oil for some very light post-shower moisture. Yum.</li>
            <li> I used this stuff so frequently that I ran out. It smells really sweet and citrusy, which I love - but - UGH - it loses a star because of the stupid dispenser. It doesn&#x27;t release the oil in drops, it just pours out and makes a mess. This company has great scents and I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of them BUT all of them have bad quality dispensers.</li>
            <li> I bought this essential oil to use as part of my anticellulite lotion recipe I found on Pinterest.  It has a pleasant smell and works great for what I bought it for.  I&#x27;m looking forward to other recipes I can use it in.</li>
            <li> I enjoy plant therapy 100% pure Essential oil. This Grapefruit is very pleasing to the senses. I use it regularly in a spray bottle mixed with healthy water sometimes adding other drops like lavender or peppermint to soothe my skin. I also use it in my washing machine to add some zest to the clothing. I recommend this oil and will purchase it again.Give it a try you will be uplifted with the soothing scent.</li>
            <li> Really nice scent. I put a few drops on cotton balls and leave them all over the house. It&#x27;s such a nice clean, fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought this brand due to the price.  I&#x27;m on a strict budget and cannot afford a lot of doTerra oils (I highly recommend their Peppermint because no other brand rids of my migraines so quickly as theirs) so I ordered this item to test out this company.  My nearly 9 year old son adores this scent!  He says it smells like candy.  Every day he begs for the candy oil for his wrists.  He inhales the aroma and calms right down.  He just loves it!  My only complaint with Plant Therapy would be the drip lids.  Rather than a nice single drop, they gush out.  But a simple remedy to this would be to buy a 50 cent dropper lid.  That way the amount of oil is controlled.  Still saving money!</li>
            <li> I put two drops in my water. Nice flavor</li>
            <li> This is a perfect scent.  When I initially ordered I was afraid the scent might be too strong and I am very sensitive to overpowering scents (I greatly dislike perfume, musky type scents)...and since we don&#x27;t have smellinet (yet)...I took the risk and placed the order.  I love it!  It smells exactly like a grapefruit.  If you need to know what that smells like, go to the grocery store, purchase a grapefruit, cut it in half and take a whiff - that&#x27;s what this smells like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...it is a strong scent, but not in a make you sick kind of way - it&#x27;s more of a can&#x27;t help but continuing to inhale kind of way...very pleasant &amp; refreshing.</li>
            <li> I received my pink grapefruit oil promptly.  It smells very good.  I use a little under my nose whenever I feel tense.  Thank you for supplying the world with a wonderful product! Cindy</li>
            <li> I am not sure that this would be the only brand I would recommend.  I like Grapefruit Essential Oil and use it in place of parfume or together with it.  And, ladies, it is said that it will make you look five years younger in the eyes of the opposite sex...</li>
            <li> The item arrived with the safety seal broken indicating that it had previously had the lid completely twisted open.  It was slowly leaking inside the bubble wrap that was around the bottle and still sealed closed.  The outer envelope did not appear to have been tampered with in transit which makes me believe the item was either a return or opened by the sender and sent to me open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, I&#x27;m not planning to use it in anything that would make me fear contamination, but I won&#x27;t use this vendor again.  It cost too much to lose even the little that leaked, but it is not worth returning for another with the delay in delivery due to an ice storm. The USPS did a terrible job cramming 2 other packages that belong to someone from the next block and not delivering the other item I had ordered on the same date as this item.  If given a choice of shipping, I would choose a vendor using UPS next time.</li>
            <li> I mixed a few drops into a couple ounces of water and I am using it in a spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It smells like you just cut into a fresh grapefruit. I think it has a cheerful fresh effect.</li>
            <li> this was bought as a gift for my cousin.  she loves it so much, she called me to rave about it.  i already have some and this is one of the most beautiful citrus fragrances i&#x27;ve ever experienced.  my only complaint about it is that it doesn&#x27;t have much staying power, but that doesn&#x27;t keep me from giving it five stars.  good stuff!</li>
            <li> Purchased this product to add to home made laundry detergent. Has a very nice scent. Oil or scent does not irritate my childs sensitive skin. Very happy with and would recommend.</li>
            <li> This was very disappointing. It smelled great, but wore off incredibly quickly, and felt more like a water based product than the essential oil it claimed to be.</li>
            <li> This is a nice quality product. Great, fresh smell, true to what grapefruits really smell like. I added half a bottle to several gallons of homemade laundry detergent and it results in a faint, but refreshing and pleasant, scent in the final product.</li>
            <li> Was all that I wanted.  I love it in water while at work or at home.  It&#x27;s  taste is great</li>
            <li> speedy delivery,  nice product</li>
            <li> Love the smell, but you have to use a lot of it in the diffuser. I also put a few drops in my water. It had helped me kick the Coke Zero habit!</li>
            <li> This oil was exactly as I expected it to be.  It makes my room smell good. There really isn&#x27;t much more than I can say about it.</li>
            <li> Smells so fresh and clean. I use it in lip balms and bath salts. It&#x27;s like summer in a little bottle.</li>
            <li> i put a drop in my water.  makes me want to drink more water.  Taste is very appealing and fresh!  I love it!</li>
            <li> The smell of this oil smells exactly like fresh cut grapefruit.  I thought I could get away with using it on a cotton ball, but that&#x27;s not working.  I think I need a diffuser,  . . . any suggestions?</li>
            <li> Great oil scent for the price.  Used to make homemade pre-shave oil.  Not overpowering,  and does not irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> Use to scent all my homemade products</li>
            <li> I recieved the oil within 2 days. I am satisfied with the product. I prefer a bigger bottle is my only wish.</li>
            <li> This pink grapefruit essential oil smells wonderful in the bottle, but the scent is much too subtle when used in my (topical) recipes as well as for room sprays/freshening. When applied to a cotton ball, it is very difficult to smell 2 feet away. It works nicely for blending, (I like pink grapefruit with lemon), but the scent tends to get lost fairly quickly used alone or blended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The euro dropper works fine for my purposes, and I have no problems with it coming out too fast. I especially appreciate the identification sticker on top of the cap, eliminating the need to make my own top label. Overall, considering the very faint scent of the oil once out of the bottle and how quickly it fades, it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> great for many uses; on dryer balls, in Ball jar w/baking soda for natural air freshner, homemade facial spray.  Great smell.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Smells great. I ordered it for a sugar scrub recipe I wanted to try. It worked perfectly! It is very refreshing!</li>
            <li> The only complaint with this one is that it didn&#x27;t seem quite potent enough. We felt that we had to use a slightly excessive amount to acheive the scent we were looking for.</li>
            <li> i do not like grapefruit, but know their are benefits. That is why I use this instead of eating grapefruit, which i find to be gross.</li>
            <li> I love all of the Plant Therapy essential oils. I bought a few different brands of oil and did the construction paper test where you put a tiny drop on the construction paper and if it goes away completely you know that it&#x27;s 100% pure. I tried five different brands. The only two that were 100% pure were the Plant Therapy and Young Living ones. The Plant Therapy brand is much, much less expensive than Young Living so I&#x27;m a huge fan!</li>
            <li> This came packaged nicely and quickly.  This stuff smells delicious and we can&#x27;t wait to use it in our candles!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was after.  The scent is so true, I was amazed.  Will definitely buy again when needed.</li>
            <li> Great service! Great product!</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy Brand is my New Fav! Every oil I have purchased smells way better then other brands I have purchased, I am a customer for life unless you change it, (which i know you wont!) Thank you..&lt;br /&gt;smells so wonderful if you add a few drops and rub your hands together and add to wet or dry hair..</li>
            <li> Smells great but leaves brown residue on my oil burner</li>
            <li> I really like this oil! It smells so good! I only bought it to make sugar scrubs but it works really great for that purpose.</li>
            <li> Is very good this product thanks.</li>
            <li> Ordered 2 bottles and though the scent is wonderful when first opened it does not last once applied. I also ordered a rose essential oil from another supplier and the scent is excellent AND it lasts very well. Both oils were used in homemade laundry detergent.</li>
            <li> Got this for a Pineterst project and it works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what else to say but I had eleven more words to use..</li>
            <li> This oil smells great, and is a great value for the price. I love using it in my Plant Therapy oil diffuser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells great - not so overpowering, but fragrant. A little bit goes a long ways. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more from this company.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipment!!! Works great combine with other products !!!! I would defininely recommend.to friends and family to use for any at home remedies !! Is great in making at home lotions, hair treatments, or facial treaments!!! Works great with coconut oil!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot to say about the oil since I didn&#x27;t really do anything with it. I just leave it on my desk to smell every now and then because it has a wonderful, clean, refreshing scent. The scent has lasted for quite a while now so no complaints here.</li>
            <li> I love pink grape fruit and when I found this oil...I love it...I put it in my shampoo and conditioner and even wear it as perfume!</li>
            <li> Cant get enough of this oil! Love it. Smells so pure</li>
            <li> These oils work wonders in my soaps and balms. Very concentrated, you do not need a heavy hand. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I make my own lotions, and pink grapefruit is my all-time favorite essential oil for summer.  This company went out of their way to make sure I was pleased with the product.  I really appreciated their personal touch.  I will definitely be using them in the future.  Oh, and the scent?  A wonderful, light, citrus scent that holds up well in my lotions!</li>
            <li> Is it just me, or does this oil smell just like oranges??  I&#x27;ve read many of the reviews on this product, and I haven&#x27;t seen anyone mention that it smells more like oranges than grapefruit. This was my first experience with grapefruit essential oil, so maybe it&#x27;s my lack of experience with it, but I also own orange essential oil from the same company, and I tell you, they both smell EXACTLY the same!...They could be used interchangably as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  I gave it 3 stars simply because first of all it smells lovely (even if it smells like oranges) and second because I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s not suppose to smell like this.</li>
            <li> Love this!  If grapefruits tasted as good as this smells I would have one every day!  It is a very nice, light citrus oil and while I don&#x27;t know a lot about the therapeutic properties of these oils, I know this one makes me happy!</li>
            <li> Added about 20 drops to 2 cups of baking soda and mixed well.  Sprinkled on living room rug - let it set for several hours - and then vacuumed - the whole house smelled wonderful!  And the rug was clean too.</li>
            <li> I have used this oil in making deodorant &amp; shampoo.  It has worked great.  I did replace the lid with a dropper I had on hand &amp; am glad I have that, but I hadn&#x27;t tried the lid it came with before.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! love the smell and wow it has so many uses! I have added it to many household things.</li>
            <li> I made several containers of bath salt.  My co-workers and friends loved the scent so much. really concentrated, very good price.</li>
            <li> I am just starting with making my own natural lotions and cleaning products and this was my first purchase of essential oils. I love the smell of grapefruit, and this essential oil perfectly captures that refreshing citrus scent of a freshly cut grapefruit. So far, I have used it mixed into coconut oil as a great body moisturizer. I like thensmell of coconut, but it can get a bit cloying for me, so the added grapefruit is a good combination.</li>
            <li> I had read in Maratha Stewart&#x27;s new book about putting Grapefruit essential oil on your forehead, temples and by nose in the morning to give you a perky feeling of wake-up and refreshment so I bought Plant Therapy Essential Oil from Amazon.  It arrived quickly; and I am totally happy with the product.  It has a wonderful fresh smell that I just love -- the smell of real grapefruit.  It is one of the best essential oils that I have had, and plan to buy more from this company.</li>
