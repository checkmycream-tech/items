            <li>Very happy I found this great product, definitely worth trying if you are looking for a great nightly moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t upset your skin or break the bank.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is good stuff, try it and you will like it.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product into the summer and hope for good results then.  </li>
            <li>My wife loved this product.</li>
            <li>so this is good for people who have acne as well.</li>
            <li>I got a sample at a luxury hotel and loved it.</li>
            <li>My biggest issue with moisturizers is that by the end of the day, my eyes burn from the cream, this is especially true with ones with spf in them.&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good moisturizer with sunscreen</li>
            <li>Recommended by our dermatologist for my daughter who has eczema, this is a good all over moisturizer for face and neck.</li>
            <li>good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,vgood, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,</li>
            <li>It came quickly and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and it works great for anti-wrinkling as well as using for a sun block.  </li>
            <li>This product is great, My doctor sells this product and more skincare  at her office</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the product!</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>On top of that it has a 25 spf which I love because I have fair skin!</li>
            <li>Came recommended from the dermatologist and I love it!</li>
            <li>is amazing been using it for years.</li>
            <li>nice.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this lotion and I am thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the kind of sunscreen</li>
            <li>Wonderful unscented, non-greasy moisturizer at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>and you get a nice dewy feel to your face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never heard of it before finding it in Amazon, and the packaging gives kind of an &amp;#34;off-brand&amp;#34; message that made me hesitate; but I can see why dermatologists recommend it.</li>
            <li>So thrilled that I found DML with SPF 25</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and this is perfect for it.  </li>
            <li>It has never clogged my poors or caused any kind of skin irritation and is very cheap</li>
            <li>I have tried just about all of the moisturizers with SPF and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>This is the best stuff for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years and find it to be a very good product and an affordable alternative to all the high price &#x27;designer&#x27; moisturizers out there.</li>
            <li>Unscented (barely smell anything, awesome x2)&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply and smoothed into my skin nicely.</li>
            <li>Good product for a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate my very fair sensitive skin and has SPF as a bonus.</li>
            <li>No fancy label or container, but the product is top notch.  </li>
            <li>This product is better than 100% of products that can often be twice their price or more.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this product, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I bet you&#x27;ll love it, too.</li>
            <li>Although we never went under the water, we were under the shadeless sun most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my skin does have more moisture without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for more a year and are completely satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy for sure.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Best of all, there is no white residue.  </li>
            <li>: I forgot to mention that it&#x27;s fragrance free!</li>
            <li>so I figured why not try this stuff for my face when I was ordering more Forte on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>and I took a change on this stuff and love it.  </li>
            <li>And I love how it doesn&#x27;t make my face look oily.</li>
            <li>I used to spend much more money on the kinerase moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have to say I like it a lot better</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it and the will buy it again from this company.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok I&#x27;ve used better</li>
            <li>I love this product and have recommended it to friends.</li>
            <li>and it has not caused me to have more break outs.</li>
            <li>I love me some Amazon shopping.</li>
            <li>Purchased this on the basis of the many 5-star reviews.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 7 years and love it.  </li>
            <li>This one is great; it&#x27;s very moisturizing and is non-greasy and non-sticky.</li>
            <li>Excellent product I&#x27;ve used before as a facial sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I love DML.  </li>
            <li>They sold it there for a lot more money.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased.</li>
            <li>It has superior sun protection, no fragrance, and quickly-absorbed but powerful moisture.  </li>
            <li>This is the best facial moisturizer I have ever found...plus it is SPF 25 and works to stop both A and B rays of sunshine.  </li>
            <li>It was recommended by my dermatologist, so I am more confidant that it wont make me breakout</li>
            <li>and I have tried so many</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many, many years...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My wife has been using this product for many years at the advice of her Dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t like it as much as my beloved Biore; however, it is pretty darn close.</li>
            <li>Have paid 4 times as much for creams that aren&#x27;t any better or as good as DML.</li>
            <li>All products from this company were recommended by my doctor, and they&#x27;re great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Gentle, non-greasy, it provides good coverage.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I purchased this product because many earlier reviews said it was great for oily skin.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply</li>
            <li>It truly goes on in a non-greasy manner and absorbs into your skin very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find it in retail stores anymore, but was able to \\&quot;special</li>
            <li>for the price - it is fine.  </li>
            <li>&amp; she even said can help with fine lines.</li>
            <li>I used the sample she gave me and quickly ordered more from Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is a light moisturizer which does moisturize.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know that it is worth spending more money for it.</li>
            <li>I need gluten free skin products.</li>
            <li>I now never even bother to take a free sample as I know</li>
            <li>it is light, unscented, and doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water.  </li>
            <li>It provides a wonderful smoothing and softening base under makeup; it refreshes my skin and gives it a youthful, dewy appearance; and the SPF appears to be measuring up to its claim of 25, although I am super-cautious in the bright sunshine and often wear brimmed hats, thus I can&#x27;t be sure how effective the DML&#x27;s sun protection abilities are.</li>
            <li>This product is great for all skin types even people who suffer from acne especially cystic acne.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I do like it, however, and of course, the dermatologists do frequently recommend it and with good reason, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>/a significant mark-up.</li>
            <li>Glad Amazon is reasonable!</li>
            <li>This product was originally recommended by a dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>It is wonderful for using under make-up or just by itself for those days I am too lazy to bother with make-up.  </li>
            <li>I first heard about it many years ago from my mom, whose doctor recommended it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent product that keeps my face moist with using just a small amount.  </li>
            <li>This is the best facial moisturizer with SPF for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Best daily moisturizer with sunscreen I found so far.  </li>
            <li>This lotion didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or do any damage, but I thought it was nothing special.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a good, reasonably priced product.</li>
            <li>My best friend is always on my case about how perfect my skin looks, and I know this stuff is the reason, because it looked like crap before haha.  </li>
            <li>Just wish it came in a higher SPF, but for winter it&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>I have no sunburn after that day, but my friend who sweats a lot got some mild redness on the nose</li>
            <li>(if I&#x27;m lucky).</li>
            <li>This arrived quickly and was packed well.</li>
            <li>Better then any drug or high end retail brand.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great!!!I have normal fair skin which can be sensitive to products and break out.</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer for dry skin</li>
            <li>This facial moisterizer was recommended by my dermatologist and I love it!  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m protected from the sun and then at bedtime I use good old sensitive skin Lubriderm (very reasonably priced and readily available).  </li>
            <li>It does a great job removing the dead skin from face and neck.</li>
            <li>I love this product ,it&#x27;s amazing,I don&#x27;t need anymore to use fond de teint to cover the redness on my face because it&#x27;s gone completely ...</li>
            <li>It makes your skin look youthful and fresh and is recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I have finally found something that leaves my face so soft and its paba free yaaaaay!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to continue to search for a moisturizer and sunblock that&#x27;s right for me.</li>
            <li>it will not be right for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I know those are high hopes since it does contain sunscreen, but it isn&#x27;t as light as DML (non SPF).</li>
            <li>The price was right and shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>First its not greasy and seeps right into my skin.</li>
            <li>A great facial moisturizer, packed in a simple box.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t wear anything with strong perfumes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle to my skin and does&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Have used it for about a year and it is very good for aging skin especially if you are sensitive to various products on the market.  </li>
            <li>making the purchase look as though you purchase  more than you actually have, DML is what you see.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time purchased at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I actually like my oily skin because I don&#x27;t have many developing wrinkles at all.  </li>
            <li>It was my dermatologist who first suggested I try this.</li>
            <li>However, the product irritated my skin on the first usage.</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s totally unscented, which I love.</li>
            <li>I first got samples at my dermatologist&#x27;s office...</li>
            <li>(again, can&#x27;t vouch for how successful the small quantity I use each morning is for preventing sun damage).</li>
            <li>LOVE my DML SPF 25 facial lotion.  </li>
            <li>I am blond, fair skinned with green eyes...</li>
            <li>I am a real beauty products junkie, and even though I love the high-end cosmetics, I find that I keep coming back to this.</li>
            <li>I have used DML now  for a few years and always have been very pleased with the purchase and the way your skin glows and feels.  </li>
            <li>I love thicker creams than thinner ones because I have dry skin, and this fits my requirements.  </li>
            <li>Love it...takes care of my winter dry skin.</li>
            <li>It was so chapped that I began using pure organic coconut oil to cleanse and moisturize.</li>
            <li>I also love that it has a higher SPF than some other creams.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product based on positive reviews from other customers, and have been extraordinarily pleased.</li>
            <li>ITS SO GENTLE AND</li>
            <li>For natural glowing skin, the product is worth the money you spend.  </li>
            <li>I have lupus and have to be really cautious in the sun.  </li>
            <li>It feels like it really nourishes my face when I put it on.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t mind reapplying during the day.  </li>
            <li>very awesome)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It has really helped.</li>
            <li>Solbar AVO SPF 32, by the same company and available from amazon.</li>
            <li>It is quite reasonable to purchase</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t really work well</li>
            <li>It is reasonable and</li>
            <li>a real winner.</li>
            <li>And, it is so reasonable.</li>
            <li>It does not take much of the DML to do the trick, either as it is a thicker consistency.</li>
            <li>Which is unusual for me.</li>
            <li>When I moved to Arizona where I really need the sun protection, I started ordering it online as I didn&#x27;t know where to buy it.  </li>
            <li>It really keeps my skin moist, but not greasy.  </li>
            <li>as it is very moisturizing...</li>
            <li>This one moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>This product is a bit too much for summertime, if you have an oily/shiny t-zone.</li>
            <li>Make sure your face has some water on it first and then apply a little to each side of your face.</li>
            <li>this cream is easy to apply and is absorbed fast into the skin, great base for make-up.</li>
            <li>I used to special order regular DML from the pharmacy.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product as long as it is available....</li>
            <li>First time user in my 30&#x27;s, so I was positively surprised.</li>
            <li>I almost 36 years old and consistently get mistaken for someone 23-24.  </li>
            <li>I like it well enough to try to find and was only able to find on line.</li>
            <li>DML is a fantastic, creamy, soft daily Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>No skin breakouts from this one, plus the SPF seems to work for most of the day; I only apply another SPF product if I&#x27;m constantly in the sun/light:</li>
            <li>I purchased DML Daily Facial Moisturizer with SPF 25 after trying Cetaphil moisturizer with SPF 50 on the recommendation of my dermatologist (I have lots of allergies and skin sensitivities to many products).  </li>
            <li>DML Daily Facial Moisturizer, SPF 25 - 1.5 oz is an alright product, still hooked on Skin Ceuticals, Olay ProX, ROC, and Boots No 7 products, but glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li>Decent price; delivered in about 7-10 days to my mailbox</li>
            <li>i have bounced around among many different facial moisturizers, but this is now my go to product.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks older</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend for anyone.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>For those who have had skin cancer on face this comes highly recommended by Mom&#x27;s Dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer is OK, but I find it a little greasy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It can also go on under makeup and the sunscreen is a complete bonus!!</li>
            <li>Ordering the product from Amazon was quick and easy, especially after having to order from the prescription counter and then go back a couple of days later to pick up the product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 4 years now due to the recommendation by a dermatologist for my dry, extremely fair, sensitive, rosacea-prone skin.  </li>
            <li>It does not have the normal sunscreen smell which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>I really liked the thick creamy texture.</li>
            <li>Smooth, not sticky like other products.</li>
            <li>to that I used Chanel night cream and loved it but its really expensive ($100 a jar).I also used the Elizabeth Arden products in the past and liked them too.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway,  I had used another Person and Covey product (DML Forte-recommended by my derm doctor for my ecezma prone hands)</li>
            <li>and I live in Florida.  </li>
            <li>It works very well for me 99% of the time, although in hot, humid weather (not a frequent occurrence where I live)</li>
            <li>My skin is super sensitive to facial products, including those made for \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>very soft product</li>
            <li>I highly recommend DML to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have been using DML for 25 years.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and tried a number of moisturizers with sunscreen that just didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>This product has protected my skin and kept me looking young for 20 years!</li>
            <li>It never really absorbed into my skin and if I perspired a bit, the white color came to the surface even more.  </li>
            <li>Not as described by other user maybe works for them but nothing special happened to me.  </li>
            <li>Nice quality, thick but not oily!</li>
            <li>Certainly seems moisturizing enough.  </li>
            <li>It is obvious that it does have the sunscreen, though, as it does have that certain scent of sunscreen, in case that smell bothers you know that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Advice: If you sweat a lot or plan to be in &amp; out of water frequently, I suggest you reapply accordingly.  </li>
            <li>This was recommended by a dermatologist over 15 years ago because of my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft, supple and protected from sun damage.</li>
            <li>Another benefit for those of us sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and combination at that.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy and offers SPF 25 sun protection.</li>
            <li>; the 1.5 oz tube lasts me about 6 months, and people are always saying I look much younger than I really am...</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this moisturizer for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>DML makes my skin so soft and helps with the redness.  </li>
            <li>Moisturizer plus sunblock that is designed for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s so calming for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have been having drier skin, overall after using this for a year, so I&#x27;m not sure if the long term benefits are good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair and my skin is both dry and sensitive and I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a moisturizer with sunscreen that didn&#x27;t irritate my face, provided enough moisture so that I don&#x27;t dry out, and could be worn under make-up without causing problems.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, especially if you have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Overall, about the same as most other lotions of this type.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty dry skin</li>
            <li>I like the suscreen  aspect but can&#x27;t tell whether there will be any other particular benefits after a little more time.  </li>
            <li>My skin tends to be a little sensitive and this one is so mild it doesn&#x27;t bother it.</li>
            <li>DML Facial Moisturizer, was highly recommended by my dermatologist, combined with his retina product at night.  </li>
            <li>I only hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it any time soon because I really don&#x27;t want to find another one and chances are, it will be much more expensive.</li>
            <li>Given all the great reviews I was disappointed in this cream.</li>
            <li>and it keeps my skin feeling hydrated and soft all day long.</li>
            <li>I am 22 years old and have extremly dry acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is both dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li>and I likde it, not bad to use but is expensive for as much as I need to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super thick and moisturizing, but not greasy or oily.</li>
            <li>I am 59 years old and don&#x27;t have a single wrinkle on my face even though I have rosacea and allergies</li>
            <li>I usually put it as soon as I get out of the shower and then go back later to put my makeup that way it has already absorbed into the skin.</li>

            <li> Very happy I found this great product, definitely worth trying if you are looking for a great nightly moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t upset your skin or break the bank.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is good stuff, try it and you will like it.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product into the summer and hope for good results then.  </li>
            <li> My wife loved this product.</li>
            <li> so this is good for people who have acne as well.</li>
            <li> I got a sample at a luxury hotel and loved it.</li>
            <li> My biggest issue with moisturizers is that by the end of the day, my eyes burn from the cream, this is especially true with ones with spf in them.&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good moisturizer with sunscreen</li>
            <li> Recommended by our dermatologist for my daughter who has eczema, this is a good all over moisturizer for face and neck.</li>
            <li> good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,vgood, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,</li>
            <li> It came quickly and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and it works great for anti-wrinkling as well as using for a sun block.  </li>
            <li> This product is great, My doctor sells this product and more skincare  at her office</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the product!</li>
            <li> and I love it!  </li>
            <li> On top of that it has a 25 spf which I love because I have fair skin!</li>
            <li> Came recommended from the dermatologist and I love it!</li>
            <li> is amazing been using it for years.</li>
            <li> nice.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this lotion and I am thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the kind of sunscreen</li>
            <li> Wonderful unscented, non-greasy moisturizer at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> and you get a nice dewy feel to your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never heard of it before finding it in Amazon, and the packaging gives kind of an &amp;#34;off-brand&amp;#34; message that made me hesitate; but I can see why dermatologists recommend it.</li>
            <li> So thrilled that I found DML with SPF 25</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and this is perfect for it.  </li>
            <li> It has never clogged my poors or caused any kind of skin irritation and is very cheap</li>
            <li> I have tried just about all of the moisturizers with SPF and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> This is the best stuff for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years and find it to be a very good product and an affordable alternative to all the high price &#x27;designer&#x27; moisturizers out there.</li>
            <li> Unscented (barely smell anything, awesome x2)&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply and smoothed into my skin nicely.</li>
            <li> Good product for a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my very fair sensitive skin and has SPF as a bonus.</li>
            <li> No fancy label or container, but the product is top notch.  </li>
            <li> This product is better than 100% of products that can often be twice their price or more.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I bet you&#x27;ll love it, too.</li>
            <li> Although we never went under the water, we were under the shadeless sun most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my skin does have more moisture without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for more a year and are completely satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy for sure.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Best of all, there is no white residue.  </li>
            <li> : I forgot to mention that it&#x27;s fragrance free!</li>
            <li> so I figured why not try this stuff for my face when I was ordering more Forte on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> and I took a change on this stuff and love it.  </li>
            <li> And I love how it doesn&#x27;t make my face look oily.</li>
            <li> I used to spend much more money on the kinerase moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have to say I like it a lot better</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it and the will buy it again from this company.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok I&#x27;ve used better</li>
            <li> I love this product and have recommended it to friends.</li>
            <li> and it has not caused me to have more break outs.</li>
            <li> I love me some Amazon shopping.</li>
            <li> Purchased this on the basis of the many 5-star reviews.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 7 years and love it.  </li>
            <li> This one is great; it&#x27;s very moisturizing and is non-greasy and non-sticky.</li>
            <li> Excellent product I&#x27;ve used before as a facial sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I love DML.  </li>
            <li> They sold it there for a lot more money.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased.</li>
            <li> It has superior sun protection, no fragrance, and quickly-absorbed but powerful moisture.  </li>
            <li> This is the best facial moisturizer I have ever found...plus it is SPF 25 and works to stop both A and B rays of sunshine.  </li>
            <li> It was recommended by my dermatologist, so I am more confidant that it wont make me breakout</li>
            <li> and I have tried so many</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many, many years...</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this product for many years at the advice of her Dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t like it as much as my beloved Biore; however, it is pretty darn close.</li>
            <li> Have paid 4 times as much for creams that aren&#x27;t any better or as good as DML.</li>
            <li> All products from this company were recommended by my doctor, and they&#x27;re great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Gentle, non-greasy, it provides good coverage.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I purchased this product because many earlier reviews said it was great for oily skin.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply</li>
            <li> It truly goes on in a non-greasy manner and absorbs into your skin very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find it in retail stores anymore, but was able to \\&quot;special</li>
            <li> for the price - it is fine.  </li>
            <li> &amp; she even said can help with fine lines.</li>
            <li> I used the sample she gave me and quickly ordered more from Amazon.</li>
            <li> It is a light moisturizer which does moisturize.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know that it is worth spending more money for it.</li>
            <li> I need gluten free skin products.</li>
            <li> I now never even bother to take a free sample as I know</li>
            <li> it is light, unscented, and doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water.  </li>
            <li> It provides a wonderful smoothing and softening base under makeup; it refreshes my skin and gives it a youthful, dewy appearance; and the SPF appears to be measuring up to its claim of 25, although I am super-cautious in the bright sunshine and often wear brimmed hats, thus I can&#x27;t be sure how effective the DML&#x27;s sun protection abilities are.</li>
            <li> This product is great for all skin types even people who suffer from acne especially cystic acne.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I do like it, however, and of course, the dermatologists do frequently recommend it and with good reason, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> /a significant mark-up.</li>
            <li> Glad Amazon is reasonable!</li>
            <li> This product was originally recommended by a dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> It is wonderful for using under make-up or just by itself for those days I am too lazy to bother with make-up.  </li>
            <li> I first heard about it many years ago from my mom, whose doctor recommended it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product that keeps my face moist with using just a small amount.  </li>
            <li> This is the best facial moisturizer with SPF for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Best daily moisturizer with sunscreen I found so far.  </li>
            <li> This lotion didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or do any damage, but I thought it was nothing special.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a good, reasonably priced product.</li>
            <li> My best friend is always on my case about how perfect my skin looks, and I know this stuff is the reason, because it looked like crap before haha.  </li>
            <li> Just wish it came in a higher SPF, but for winter it&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> I have no sunburn after that day, but my friend who sweats a lot got some mild redness on the nose</li>
            <li> (if I&#x27;m lucky).</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and was packed well.</li>
            <li> Better then any drug or high end retail brand.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!!!I have normal fair skin which can be sensitive to products and break out.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer for dry skin</li>
            <li> This facial moisterizer was recommended by my dermatologist and I love it!  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m protected from the sun and then at bedtime I use good old sensitive skin Lubriderm (very reasonably priced and readily available).  </li>
            <li> It does a great job removing the dead skin from face and neck.</li>
            <li> I love this product ,it&#x27;s amazing,I don&#x27;t need anymore to use fond de teint to cover the redness on my face because it&#x27;s gone completely ...</li>
            <li> It makes your skin look youthful and fresh and is recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I have finally found something that leaves my face so soft and its paba free yaaaaay!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to continue to search for a moisturizer and sunblock that&#x27;s right for me.</li>
            <li> it will not be right for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I know those are high hopes since it does contain sunscreen, but it isn&#x27;t as light as DML (non SPF).</li>
            <li> The price was right and shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> First its not greasy and seeps right into my skin.</li>
            <li> A great facial moisturizer, packed in a simple box.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t wear anything with strong perfumes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle to my skin and does&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Have used it for about a year and it is very good for aging skin especially if you are sensitive to various products on the market.  </li>
            <li> making the purchase look as though you purchase  more than you actually have, DML is what you see.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time purchased at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I actually like my oily skin because I don&#x27;t have many developing wrinkles at all.  </li>
            <li> It was my dermatologist who first suggested I try this.</li>
            <li> However, the product irritated my skin on the first usage.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s totally unscented, which I love.</li>
            <li> I first got samples at my dermatologist&#x27;s office...</li>
            <li> (again, can&#x27;t vouch for how successful the small quantity I use each morning is for preventing sun damage).</li>
            <li> LOVE my DML SPF 25 facial lotion.  </li>
            <li> I am blond, fair skinned with green eyes...</li>
            <li> I am a real beauty products junkie, and even though I love the high-end cosmetics, I find that I keep coming back to this.</li>
            <li> I have used DML now  for a few years and always have been very pleased with the purchase and the way your skin glows and feels.  </li>
            <li> I love thicker creams than thinner ones because I have dry skin, and this fits my requirements.  </li>
            <li> Love it...takes care of my winter dry skin.</li>
            <li> It was so chapped that I began using pure organic coconut oil to cleanse and moisturize.</li>
            <li> I also love that it has a higher SPF than some other creams.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on positive reviews from other customers, and have been extraordinarily pleased.</li>
            <li> ITS SO GENTLE AND</li>
            <li> For natural glowing skin, the product is worth the money you spend.  </li>
            <li> I have lupus and have to be really cautious in the sun.  </li>
            <li> It feels like it really nourishes my face when I put it on.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t mind reapplying during the day.  </li>
            <li> very awesome)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It has really helped.</li>
            <li> Solbar AVO SPF 32, by the same company and available from amazon.</li>
            <li> It is quite reasonable to purchase</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t really work well</li>
            <li> It is reasonable and</li>
            <li> a real winner.</li>
            <li> And, it is so reasonable.</li>
            <li> It does not take much of the DML to do the trick, either as it is a thicker consistency.</li>
            <li> Which is unusual for me.</li>
            <li> When I moved to Arizona where I really need the sun protection, I started ordering it online as I didn&#x27;t know where to buy it.  </li>
            <li> It really keeps my skin moist, but not greasy.  </li>
            <li> as it is very moisturizing...</li>
            <li> This one moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li> This product is a bit too much for summertime, if you have an oily/shiny t-zone.</li>
            <li> Make sure your face has some water on it first and then apply a little to each side of your face.</li>
            <li> this cream is easy to apply and is absorbed fast into the skin, great base for make-up.</li>
            <li> I used to special order regular DML from the pharmacy.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product as long as it is available....</li>
            <li> First time user in my 30&#x27;s, so I was positively surprised.</li>
            <li> I almost 36 years old and consistently get mistaken for someone 23-24.  </li>
            <li> I like it well enough to try to find and was only able to find on line.</li>
            <li> DML is a fantastic, creamy, soft daily Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> No skin breakouts from this one, plus the SPF seems to work for most of the day; I only apply another SPF product if I&#x27;m constantly in the sun/light:</li>
            <li> I purchased DML Daily Facial Moisturizer with SPF 25 after trying Cetaphil moisturizer with SPF 50 on the recommendation of my dermatologist (I have lots of allergies and skin sensitivities to many products).  </li>
            <li> DML Daily Facial Moisturizer, SPF 25 - 1.5 oz is an alright product, still hooked on Skin Ceuticals, Olay ProX, ROC, and Boots No 7 products, but glad I tried it.  </li>
            <li> Decent price; delivered in about 7-10 days to my mailbox</li>
            <li> i have bounced around among many different facial moisturizers, but this is now my go to product.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks older</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend for anyone.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> For those who have had skin cancer on face this comes highly recommended by Mom&#x27;s Dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer is OK, but I find it a little greasy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It can also go on under makeup and the sunscreen is a complete bonus!!</li>
            <li> Ordering the product from Amazon was quick and easy, especially after having to order from the prescription counter and then go back a couple of days later to pick up the product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 4 years now due to the recommendation by a dermatologist for my dry, extremely fair, sensitive, rosacea-prone skin.  </li>
            <li> It does not have the normal sunscreen smell which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I really liked the thick creamy texture.</li>
            <li> Smooth, not sticky like other products.</li>
            <li> to that I used Chanel night cream and loved it but its really expensive ($100 a jar).I also used the Elizabeth Arden products in the past and liked them too.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway,  I had used another Person and Covey product (DML Forte-recommended by my derm doctor for my ecezma prone hands)</li>
            <li> and I live in Florida.  </li>
            <li> It works very well for me 99% of the time, although in hot, humid weather (not a frequent occurrence where I live)</li>
            <li> My skin is super sensitive to facial products, including those made for \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> very soft product</li>
            <li> I highly recommend DML to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have been using DML for 25 years.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and tried a number of moisturizers with sunscreen that just didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> This product has protected my skin and kept me looking young for 20 years!</li>
            <li> It never really absorbed into my skin and if I perspired a bit, the white color came to the surface even more.  </li>
            <li> Not as described by other user maybe works for them but nothing special happened to me.  </li>
            <li> Nice quality, thick but not oily!</li>
            <li> Certainly seems moisturizing enough.  </li>
            <li> It is obvious that it does have the sunscreen, though, as it does have that certain scent of sunscreen, in case that smell bothers you know that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Advice: If you sweat a lot or plan to be in &amp; out of water frequently, I suggest you reapply accordingly.  </li>
            <li> This was recommended by a dermatologist over 15 years ago because of my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin soft, supple and protected from sun damage.</li>
            <li> Another benefit for those of us sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and combination at that.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy and offers SPF 25 sun protection.</li>
            <li> ; the 1.5 oz tube lasts me about 6 months, and people are always saying I look much younger than I really am...</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this moisturizer for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> DML makes my skin so soft and helps with the redness.  </li>
            <li> Moisturizer plus sunblock that is designed for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s so calming for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been having drier skin, overall after using this for a year, so I&#x27;m not sure if the long term benefits are good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair and my skin is both dry and sensitive and I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a moisturizer with sunscreen that didn&#x27;t irritate my face, provided enough moisture so that I don&#x27;t dry out, and could be worn under make-up without causing problems.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, especially if you have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Overall, about the same as most other lotions of this type.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty dry skin</li>
            <li> I like the suscreen  aspect but can&#x27;t tell whether there will be any other particular benefits after a little more time.  </li>
            <li> My skin tends to be a little sensitive and this one is so mild it doesn&#x27;t bother it.</li>
            <li> DML Facial Moisturizer, was highly recommended by my dermatologist, combined with his retina product at night.  </li>
            <li> I only hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it any time soon because I really don&#x27;t want to find another one and chances are, it will be much more expensive.</li>
            <li> Given all the great reviews I was disappointed in this cream.</li>
            <li> and it keeps my skin feeling hydrated and soft all day long.</li>
            <li> I am 22 years old and have extremly dry acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is both dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li> and I likde it, not bad to use but is expensive for as much as I need to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super thick and moisturizing, but not greasy or oily.</li>
            <li> I am 59 years old and don&#x27;t have a single wrinkle on my face even though I have rosacea and allergies</li>
            <li> I usually put it as soon as I get out of the shower and then go back later to put my makeup that way it has already absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel the same, maybe you are putting too much because a little goes a long way!!</li>
            <li> Recommended by a friend, whose face has hardly a wrinkle, I only wish I had known about it much earlier (as she did, thanks to a dermatologist).</li>
            <li> Gives me the protection from the sun that I need all year round and provides a normal moisture to my skin wihtout looking oily.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has been using prescription acne medications for several years which leave her skin dry and peeling.  </li>
            <li> and I like it because it does the job for far less money than the Lancome products I was using</li>
            <li> I did like it, but it made me break out, so I passed it on to a friend with less sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Is thick and within the hour my face is pure grease.  </li>
            <li> It mositurizes my skin all day long but isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t bother my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> It lasts me a long time</li>
            <li> I have used this moisturizer for years and will never stop as long as it is on the market.</li>
            <li> My face so soft and Dewy and has a firm feel.</li>
            <li> Hi - I am a 36 year old black woman with extremely oily skin.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t wait how it performs in the winter when my face gets dry.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and this product was recommended by my dermatologist years ago.</li>
            <li> After trying a few anti-aging moisturizers with spf, I started to notice that my skin was not looking younger and healthier, but quite the opposite.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After using it, I allow it to soak in for a few minutes before putting on my make-up (Bare Minerals).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and dml was recomended to me by a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Personally, I was hoping it wouldn&#x27;t be quite as heavy.</li>
            <li> My nose would always peel and feel rough during the winter months</li>
            <li> It absorbs into skin without an oily feel, does not require heavy application, and protects me from getting burned in a southern, sunny state.</li>
            <li> I need sunscreen since I have had a few skin cancers, this was recommended by my derm several years ago.</li>
            <li> It was heavy and left my greasy.</li>
            <li> NuSkin to dead sea to japanese products to Exuviance.</li>
            <li> I found the Cetaphil to be just like using plain ol&#x27; sunscreen: it went on greasy and made me look like I had clown white makeup on.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> make my eyes burn like other moisturizers w/ SPF.  </li>
            <li> But I decided to try other brands so save some money.</li>
            <li> Diamond in the rough!</li>
            <li> You only need to use a small amount.</li>
            <li> I have read other reviews about this moisturizer and they wrote it was greasy?</li>
            <li> It does not make your face white like usual with any cream with sunscreen.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews for DML, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it is due to this product or just aging.</li>
            <li> I recomend DML FORTE with Pantenol for thise with very dry sky and tight budgets likeme</li>
            <li> Also, a small dollop goes a long way, so ladies, don&#x27;t let the small tube fool you - the contents might last longer than you&#x27;d expect</li>
            <li> Guess you can say its a love hate relationship.  </li>
            <li> I was let down by the $50 Quercetin and Oak cream recommended by a Sephora clerk-</li>
            <li> Philosophy&#x27;s Hope in a Jar was a let down too.&lt;br /&gt;Prior</li>
            <li> Also, it made my skin feel odd, leathery instead of dewy.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin and have tried all kinds of oil serums, moisturizers and spf and was never able to find a combination that worked all day to keep my skin from being dried out and thirsty.</li>
            <li> During the winter her eczema gets worse and she was commenting on how her current moisturizer was not good enough.</li>
            <li> DONE WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> It is not sticky or heavy and absorbs without irritation.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday after my shower.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it does not leave my face feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> needed an affordable day cream with SPF and this will do the trick, but it is a bit heavy</li>
            <li> I use it as my everyday moisturizer and 25 spf sunblock.</li>
            <li> When dealing with acne and the harsh chemicals you use trying to deal with acne</li>
            <li> If I use it very sparingly it&#x27;s not too bad, and I think the oil does soak in after it&#x27;s been on your face for a while.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE TRIED NUMEROUS EXPENSIVE PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can not find DML at local stores.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it is expensive too for just a tiny tube&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li> Still get pimples, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s this moisturizer or my diet.</li>
            <li> but now in my late 40s I can use it year around.</li>
            <li> She also has acne and even though this moisturizer is thick, it does not cause her to have any breakouts</li>
            <li> It is thick, creamy and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> Other than the price... which is lower!!!!</li>
            <li> During the cold winter months my skin has not had one dry day and aside from my acne</li>
            <li> However, I have adult acne which I absolutely hate</li>
            <li> I have used this moisturizer for at least 10 years, and for 8 of them I kept trying other products and was always disappointed.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s not great for oily skin in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> It works beautifully, no burning sensation.  </li>
            <li> YOU CANNOT GO WRONG</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it burned my eyes.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> You want be sorry for trying it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with dry or damaged skin, but these products were making my skin look terrible and they all smelled like chemicals.  </li>
            <li> and I shine like crazy all the time.  </li>
            <li> I am unhappy with the product.</li>
            <li> and I hate to use anything else.</li>
            <li> I apply it before my base and you don&#x27;t use as much base also.</li>
            <li> The SPF smell is horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love thicker creams than thinner ones because I have dry skin, and this fits my requirements.  I also love that it has a higher SPF than some other creams.</li>
            <li> I received a sample at my Doctors office. I like it well enough to try to find and was only able to find on line. I use it on my face only.&lt;br /&gt;Feels nice. I use it every morning.</li>
            <li> I was looking for Estion Facial Moisturizer and this came up as its replacement. Cannot see one difference! Other than the price... which is lower!!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make you break out, and protects from sun.  Goes nicely under makeup!  Not pricey either.  Def a must have for the face.</li>
            <li> I HAVE TRIED NUMEROUS EXPENSIVE PRODUCTS AND THIS MAKES YOUR SKIN LIKE SILK, WITH ROSACEA ITS SO GENTLE AND ALSO HAS SUNSCREEN AS I HAVE MELANOMA YOU CANNOT GO WRONG DONE WASTE YOUR MONEY ON DEPT STORE JUNK WOULD NEVER HAVE KNOW HAD MY DERMATOLOGIST NOT GIVEN OUT A SAMPLE</li>
            <li> I have tried everything from Neutrogena to La Mer. And this is the best.  My dermatologist recommended it and I will  never switch again.</li>
            <li> DML Facial Moisturizer, was highly recommended by my dermatologist, combined with his retina product at night.  DML is a fantastic, creamy, soft daily Moisturizer.  For natural glowing skin, the product is worth the money you spend.  DML is not purchased in a fancy bottle, with a big box around it making the purchase look as though you purchase  more than you actually have, DML is what you see.  A great facial moisturizer, packed in a simple box.  I have used DML now  for a few years and always have been very pleased with the purchase and the way your skin glows and feels.  Each time I order, I purchase 5 or 6 bottles at a time, so I will not run out.  Unfortunately, I can not find DML at local stores.</li>
            <li> I have used it for years. This is the first time purchased at Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product is under the radar and was recommended by a Dermatologist.  It is not sticky or heavy and absorbs without irritation. No fancy label or container, but the product is top notch.  Gives me the protection from the sun that I need all year round and provides a normal moisture to my skin wihtout looking oily.  It can be worn under make-up too. I absolutely love the product! Finally, a moisturizer that is protects with perfection!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for years, and it&#x27;s the best! It&#x27;s super thick and moisturizing, but not greasy or oily. So happy I found it on Amazon. The price was right and shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> At the recommendation of my dermatologist, I have been using this product for over twenty years and I love it!  I use it every day alone or under my make-up and it keeps my skin feeling hydrated and soft all day long.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this lotion and I am thrilled with it. I have dry skin and have tried all kinds of oil serums, moisturizers and spf and was never able to find a combination that worked all day to keep my skin from being dried out and thirsty. I can apply it once in the mnorning and still feel moisturized all day. This product is better than 100% of products that can often be twice their price or more. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have lupus and have to be really cautious in the sun.  My dermatologist recommended this product, and I love it.  It&#x27;s not sticky or pasty.  It feels like it really nourishes my face when I put it on.  It&#x27;s the kind of sunscreen I really don&#x27;t mind reapplying during the day.  I have very sensitive skin, and this is perfect for it.  Try it.  I bet you&#x27;ll love it, too.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Hi - I am a 36 year old black woman with extremely oily skin.  I actually like my oily skin because I don&#x27;t have many developing wrinkles at all.  However, I have adult acne which I absolutely hate and I shine like crazy all the time.  Guess you can say its a love hate relationship.  Anyway, I purchased this product because many earlier reviews said it was great for oily skin.  It did not cause my skin to shine, but it did clog my poors and cause a breakout.  So it&#x27;s not great for oily skin in my opinion.  Also, it made my skin feel odd, leathery instead of dewy.  I did not like it at all.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different so try it if you have money to slurge.  If not, then keep searching. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I took this sunscreen for a test under the sun(~90F) hiking and canoeing during the hours of 11am to 4pm and the results were superb. Although we never went under the water, we were under the shadeless sun most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Results:&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;- Non-greasy&lt;br /&gt;- Absorbs very quickly (Absolutely no white cast effect on skin, very awesome)&lt;br /&gt;- Unscented (barely smell anything, awesome x2)&lt;br /&gt;- I have no sunburn after that day, but my friend who sweats a lot got some mild redness on the nose area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice: If you sweat a lot or plan to be in &amp; out of water frequently, I suggest you reapply accordingly.  This is good stuff, try it and you will like it.</li>
            <li> Product delivered as described.     Personally, I was hoping it wouldn&#x27;t be quite as heavy. I know those are high hopes since it does contain sunscreen, but it isn&#x27;t as light as DML (non SPF). It will take me a while to get used to wearing the SPF version every day since I&#x27;m currently used to wearing the non SPF version.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is OK, but I find it a little greasy.  If I use it very sparingly it&#x27;s not too bad, and I think the oil does soak in after it&#x27;s been on your face for a while.  Overall, about the same as most other lotions of this type.  Will probably try something different next time.</li>
            <li> Nice quality, thick but not oily!</li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommended I try this moisturizer to help my skin during the winter.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 months now and my skin does have more moisture without feeling greasy.  My nose would always peel and feel rough during the winter months but this year I haven&#x27;t had any of those issues.  I will continue to use this product into the summer and hope for good results then.  I just wish the tube was larger.</li>
            <li> First time user in my 30&#x27;s, so I was positively surprised. this cream is easy to apply and is absorbed fast into the skin, great base for make-up. I would deff. recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Great Product.  I have pretty dry skin and my dermatologist recommended it.  It has really helped.</li>
            <li> Wonderful unscented, non-greasy moisturizer at a reasonable price. No skin breakouts from this one, plus the SPF seems to work for most of the day; I only apply another SPF product if I&#x27;m constantly in the sun/light: Solbar AVO SPF 32, by the same company and available from amazon. All products from this company were recommended by my doctor, and they&#x27;re great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is super sensitive to facial products, including those made for \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot;. It was my dermatologist who first suggested I try this. I have been using this ever since (10 years now). I like that it also has sunscreen in it. I do not know what I will do if they ever choose to stop making this product</li>
            <li> I have used this product for more a year and are completely satisfied with the results.  It was recommended to me by a relative whose dermatologist recommended its use.  It is quite reasonable to purchase and I will continue to use it.  It is non-greasy, but does hydrate your skin.  I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a good, reasonably priced product.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me to use this for my acne condition, it works wonders. Non greasy, won&#x27;t clog pores, and has sunscreen. A little goes a long way! This product has improved my skin dramtically.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial moisturizer with SPF for sensitive skin. I am 59 years old and don&#x27;t have a single wrinkle on my face even though I have rosacea and allergies and I live in Florida.  I have tried just about all of the moisturizers with SPF and this is by far the best.  It&#x27;s very gentle to my skin and does&#x27;t make my eyes burn like other moisturizers w/ SPF.  I also use the regular DML moisturizer at night and their cleanser, Aquanil.  All are great!</li>
            <li> My wife loved this product. Whatever makes her happy makes me happy.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer was a bit too oily for me, but I bought it around summer.  I need the SPF.  This felt creamy and it didn&#x27;t make me break out which I like.  I still use it sparingly now but I can&#x27;t wait how it performs in the winter when my face gets dry.</li>
            <li> This lotion didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or do any damage, but I thought it was nothing special. It created a greasy film on my face that I had to blot off and cover with powder every morning.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a dermatologist over 15 years ago because of my sensitive skin. It keeps my skin soft, supple and protected from sun damage. One tube lasts me just over a year. I can&#x27;t find it in retail stores anymore, but was able to \\&quot;special order\\&quot; it w/a significant mark-up. Glad Amazon is reasonable! GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT VALUE!</li>
            <li> I stopped by amazon to pick up my 2nd tube and thought I&#x27;d write a review as well. I am 22 years old and have extremly dry acne prone skin. It has been a struggle trying to find a moisturizer that is...moisturizing enough! My search is OVER! I love this stuff. It mositurizes my skin all day long but isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t bother my acne prone skin. On top of that it has a 25 spf which I love because I have fair skin! It is the perfect moistuizer. I will continue to buy for sure.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t make my face break out. I love it and I always get compliments on my skin when I&#x27;m using it every day. Highly recommended, especially if you have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I brought this for my daughter who has eczema. During the winter her eczema gets worse and she was commenting on how her current moisturizer was not good enough. After trying this she has not had any eczema on her face and has been using this throughout the year and loves it. She also has acne and even though this moisturizer is thick, it does not cause her to have any breakouts so this is good for people who have acne as well.</li>
            <li> I love this product ,it&#x27;s amazing,I don&#x27;t need anymore to use fond de teint to cover the redness on my face because it&#x27;s gone completely ... I&#x27;m gonna use it forever !!!!</li>
            <li> Love it...takes care of my winter dry skin.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this product after reading the reviews. I currently us DML Lotion on my face and decided to try this on.  I am unhappy with the product. Is thick and within the hour my face is pure grease.  I will stay with the regular DML Lotion.</li>
            <li> I purchased DML Daily Facial Moisturizer with SPF 25 after trying Cetaphil moisturizer with SPF 50 on the recommendation of my dermatologist (I have lots of allergies and skin sensitivities to many products).  I found the Cetaphil to be just like using plain ol&#x27; sunscreen: it went on greasy and made me look like I had clown white makeup on.  It never really absorbed into my skin and if I perspired a bit, the white color came to the surface even more.  I scoured the internet looking for a moisturizer with sun protection and I read all of the reviews for this product here on Amazon.  I gave it a shot and I am just so impressed with this product!  It truly goes on in a non-greasy manner and absorbs into your skin very quickly.  Best of all, there is no white residue.  I can&#x27;t believe it! The product surpassed my hopes. I plan to order another tube to keep on hand so that I don&#x27;t run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recall one reviewer noting that this product is pricey.  I can tell you that the Cetaphil I used was about the same price and was, in my opinion, inferior.  This product comes in a 1.5 oz tube but it actually goes further (lasts longer) than you might think.  Also, to save money, I suggest doing what I do, which is to use the DML with SPF 25 in the morning so I&#x27;m protected from the sun and then at bedtime I use good old sensitive skin Lubriderm (very reasonably priced and readily available).  No need for sun protection at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edited to add: I forgot to mention that it&#x27;s fragrance free! Some products say they are, then still have an odor. This one doesn&#x27;t. Another benefit for those of us sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li> This product was originally recommended by a dermatologist.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and find it to be a very good product and an affordable alternative to all the high price &#x27;designer&#x27; moisturizers out there.</li>
            <li> DML Daily Facial Moisturizer, SPF 25 - 1.5 oz is an alright product, still hooked on Skin Ceuticals, Olay ProX, ROC, and Boots No 7 products, but glad I tried it.  It is a light moisturizer which does moisturize.</li>
            <li> I am 50 and have been searching for a facial cream that WORKS and doesn&#x27;t break the bank. I was let down by the $50 Quercetin and Oak cream recommended by a Sephora clerk- it didn&#x27;t really work well, I felt like it didn&#x27;t absorb and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again at any price point. Philosophy&#x27;s Hope in a Jar was a let down too.&lt;br /&gt;Prior to that I used Chanel night cream and loved it but its really expensive ($100 a jar).I also used the Elizabeth Arden products in the past and liked them too.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway,  I had used another Person and Covey product (DML Forte-recommended by my derm doctor for my ecezma prone hands) and it worked beautifully so I figured why not try this stuff for my face when I was ordering more Forte on Amazon. Wow! This stuff is great!!!I have normal fair skin which can be sensitive to products and break out. No worries here. This stuff goes on and your skin FEELS moisturized and you get a nice dewy feel to your face. I am done with the pricey department store night creams and using this every night. Very happy I found this great product, definitely worth trying if you are looking for a great nightly moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t upset your skin or break the bank.&lt;br /&gt;It can also go on under makeup and the sunscreen is a complete bonus!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  This went with Aquanil and I took a change on this stuff and love it.  It is reasonable and it works.&lt;br /&gt;I will order agrain</li>
            <li> this moisturizer was issued to me by mt derm and i have been using it ever since. very soft product</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using prescription acne medications for several years which leave her skin dry and peeling.  At her last dermatology appointment, her doctor recommended DML, but said the cost may be prohibitive since especially she is a college student.  My daughter uses her prescribed cream at night on her face, but has supplemented this regimen with daily use of the DML moisturizer.  She loves it and her skin looks clearer and healthier than it has in years.  I will continue to order this product for her and will order this for Christmas presents for my female friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using DML for three weeks now and it&#x27;s a great product. I have oily, prone-to-breakout skin and I&#x27;m very happy to have found this. It absorbs into skin without an oily feel, does not require heavy application, and protects me from getting burned in a southern, sunny state. I highly recommend DML to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermotologist. Have paid 4 times as much for creams that aren&#x27;t any better or as good as DML. This is the only day moisturizer I&#x27;ll ever buy.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a great sunblock/moisturizer because I started using a glycolic acid cream and needed something that would moisturize my face as well as serve as a sunblock. I read the reviews and this product seemed to be what I was looking for. I really liked the thick creamy texture. It was easy to apply and smoothed into my skin nicely. Unfortunately it burned my eyes. Even when I stopped applying it to my forehead and the area immediately around my eyes it continued to sting. I&#x27;m going to continue to search for a moisturizer and sunblock that&#x27;s right for me. I wish I had found it in this product.</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;m a mail carrier and I dont seem to be getting sun burn like I did last year this time. And I love how it doesn&#x27;t make my face look oily. It was recxommended to me by my dermatologist after a vitalize chemical peel.</li>
            <li> Came recommended from the dermatologist and I love it! Use it everyday after my shower. Would highly recommend for anyone.</li>
            <li> The comments on the plastic say it is hypoallergenic. However, the product irritated my skin on the first usage. I never used it again.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist gave me some samples of this product and then I ordered a tube.  I noticed that the ingredients in it are the same as a cheaper product found in all the stores.  I like consistency of this product but I don&#x27;t know that it is worth spending more money for it.</li>
            <li> I got a sample at a luxury hotel and loved it. It does a great job removing the dead skin from face and neck.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and this product was recommended by my dermatologist years ago. It works very well for me 99% of the time, although in hot, humid weather (not a frequent occurrence where I live) I sometimes go for a lighter moisturizer. Also it&#x27;s totally unscented, which I love.</li>
            <li> I like the suscreen  aspect but can&#x27;t tell whether there will be any other particular benefits after a little more time.  Certainly seems moisturizing enough.  Going to try a couple of tubes before deciding.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and combination at that. I used to spend much more money on the kinerase moisturizer. But I decided to try other brands so save some money. After several attempts on different brands. I found this gem! Diamond in the rough! It lasts me a long time and I have no reaction to it. I only hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it any time soon because I really don&#x27;t want to find another one and chances are, it will be much more expensive. At this price you should definitely try this.</li>
            <li> you can put make up on after you put on this lotion on.  it will cause he make up (eyeliner or shadow) smear&lt;br /&gt;it is expensive too for just a tiny tube&lt;br /&gt;will not buy again</li>
            <li> My skin is both dry and sensitive. It was so chapped that I began using pure organic coconut oil to cleanse and moisturize. This helped, but clogged my pores and I started having breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer was recommended to me by my dermatologist. I used the sample she gave me and quickly ordered more from Amazon. The sunscreen is also a big plus. I am blond, fair skinned with green eyes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, check out the Aquanil Cleanser by the same company. I am using them together now and could not be happier.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff for my sensitive skin. I need sunscreen since I have had a few skin cancers, this was recommended by my derm several years ago. Great product.</li>
            <li> Not greasy. Does not cause itching or problems.  I need gluten free skin products. This is a great product. Use it on my face daily.</li>
            <li> An excellent moisturizer.  It was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of moisturizers before I discovered this one. My skin tends to be a little sensitive and this one is so mild it doesn&#x27;t bother it. My daughter and I have been using it for years.  It isn&#x27;t greasy and offers SPF 25 sun protection. Good product for a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me by a friend and I like it because it does the job for far less money than the Lancome products I was using</li>
            <li> My skin Dr. told me to buy this product. I was buying something from my spa where I get my facial, about twice a year (if I&#x27;m lucky). So she told me to buy this product instead and use it day and night. I have to say I like it a lot better then the spa stuff. First its not greasy and seeps right into my skin. I have roscea and it works wonders. Absolutely love it and the will buy it again from this company.</li>
            <li> This facial moisterizer was recommended by my dermatologist and I love it!  Have used it for about a year and it is very good for aging skin especially if you are sensitive to various products on the market.  Decent price; delivered in about 7-10 days to my mailbox; the 1.5 oz tube lasts me about 6 months, and people are always saying I look much younger than I really am...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok I&#x27;ve used better</li>
            <li> This is one of the best dermatologist recommended moisturizers - works great &amp; will NOT cause breakouts!</li>
            <li> My biggest issue with moisturizers is that by the end of the day, my eyes burn from the cream, this is especially true with ones with spf in them.&lt;br /&gt;Since my go to was discontinued (Biore doesn&#x27;t make moisturizers anymore), I&#x27;ve been searching and subsequently throwing away a lot of &#x27;organic, hypoallergenic etc...&#x27;  ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend used the DML hand cream for years so I decided to try the brand for my facial moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I don&#x27;t like it as much as my beloved Biore; however, it is pretty darn close.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t so expensive. Drop the price by  couple of dollars and it will be a five!</li>
            <li> Recommended by a friend, whose face has hardly a wrinkle, I only wish I had known about it much earlier (as she did, thanks to a dermatologist).</li>
            <li> Best daily moisturizer with sunscreen I found so far.  Will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have used this moisturizer for at least 10 years, and for 8 of them I kept trying other products and was always disappointed.  I now never even bother to take a free sample as I know it will not be right for my skin.  My only caution is to wash your hands after applying as it can sting your eyes.  I love this product and have recommended it to friends.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and dml was recomended to me by a dermatologist. So far so good. I have been using it for a week</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has been the best product i have ever used. I use it everyday and it does not leave my face feeling greasy. I have acne prone skin and it has not caused me to have more break outs. During the cold winter months my skin has not had one dry day and aside from my acne my skin has never looked healthier. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know. Still get pimples, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s this moisturizer or my diet. Probably my diet, but anyways, i feel it too oily when I put it on. It adds on to my already oily skin.</li>
            <li> I asked Dermatologist to recommend a moisturizer for drier winter skin, and this was her suggestion.  This product is great - moisturizes without being greasy or sticky - and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  I also like the fact that it contains sunscreen.  Just wish it came in a pump.</li>
            <li> i have bounced around among many different facial moisturizers, but this is now my go to product.  it is light, unscented, and doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water.  a tube lasts me six months.  a real winner.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this moisturizer for my sensitive skin.  It is thick, creamy and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> I use Retin-A for breakouts and this moisturizer helps to combat the dryness/flakiness that happens when using Retin-A. I am a real beauty products junkie, and even though I love the high-end cosmetics, I find that I keep coming back to this. And, it is so reasonable. Plus, it has sunscreen for the day. It is obvious that it does have the sunscreen, though, as it does have that certain scent of sunscreen, in case that smell bothers you know that. It does not take much of the DML to do the trick, either as it is a thicker consistency. I do like it, however, and of course, the dermatologists do frequently recommend it and with good reason, in my opinion. This arrived quickly and was packed well. I love me some Amazon shopping.</li>
            <li> Not as described by other user maybe works for them but nothing special happened to me.  I don&#x27;t like the smell and nothing is great about this product.</li>
            <li> Purchased this on the basis of the many 5-star reviews. I did like it, but it made me break out, so I passed it on to a friend with less sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Not too greasy. I use it everyday. Does not make me break-out... Which is unusual for me.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended DML as a great sunscreen moisture that didn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.  I have been using it for 7 years and love it.  When I moved to Arizona where I really need the sun protection, I started ordering it online as I didn&#x27;t know where to buy it.  It really keeps my skin moist, but not greasy.  It does not have the normal sunscreen smell which I don&#x27;t like. Great product.  Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product has protected my skin and kept me looking young for 20 years! Smooth, not sticky like other products.</li>
            <li> I was on a quest for a facial moisturizer that didn&#x27;t sting and this one doesn&#x27;t. I was also looking for one that didn&#x27;t have any anti-aging ingredients. This one is great; it&#x27;s very moisturizing and is non-greasy and non-sticky. Just wish it came in a higher SPF, but for winter it&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> Given all the great reviews I was disappointed in this cream. It was heavy and left my greasy. The SPF smell is horrible. Cause me to break out and made my roseaca flare up. I could probably use this as a cream for my hands when going to the beach but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> for the price - it is fine.  needed an affordable day cream with SPF and this will do the trick, but it is a bit heavy</li>
            <li> Excellent product I&#x27;ve used before as a facial sunscreen. Very pleased with results! Dermatologist recommended. Shipped and received on time.</li>
            <li> He claims it to be best face cream he&#x27;s used AND SPF!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smoothn skin protected from sun! Recommend it.Try it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 4 years now due to the recommendation by a dermatologist for my dry, extremely fair, sensitive, rosacea-prone skin.  DML makes my skin so soft and helps with the redness.  It is wonderful for using under make-up or just by itself for those days I am too lazy to bother with make-up.  My best friend is always on my case about how perfect my skin looks, and I know this stuff is the reason, because it looked like crap before haha.  Also, it may be genetics, this cream, or a combination of both, but I almost 36 years old and consistently get mistaken for someone 23-24.  Not a wrinkle, crease, or crack in sight (and I am on the thinner side, so I don&#x27;t have the fat to protect against aging).</li>
            <li> For those who have had skin cancer on face this comes highly recommended by Mom&#x27;s Dermatologist.  She swears this is best moisturizer post surgical excision of skin cancer.</li>
            <li> I love DML.  I first got samples at my dermatologist&#x27;s office... They sold it there for a lot more money.  It came quickly and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have used the cream all the way to the end. It caused my skin to break out. I will not buy this item again.</li>
            <li> I have used this moisturizer for years and will never stop as long as it is on the market. I love it. I have very sensitive skin and have to be very careful about what I put on my face. This actually soothes my skin, takes the red out and has sunblock...can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> Great two in one.  Moisturizer plus sunblock that is designed for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and it works great for anti-wrinkling as well as using for a sun block.  Ordering the product from Amazon was quick and easy, especially after having to order from the prescription counter and then go back a couple of days later to pick up the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used DML moisturizer for years and I hate to use anything else. I first heard about it many years ago from my mom, whose doctor recommended it. My mom recently passed away at the age of 92, and she had the skin of a woman thirty years younger. I&#x27;ll swear it was this DML moisturizer. She used to give me a tube every year in my  Christmas stocking. Now I have to buy it myself and I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores. But here it is at Amazon! I&#x27;m so pleased. It has superior sun protection, no fragrance, and quickly-absorbed but powerful moisture.  You only need to use a small amount.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good moisturizer with sunscreen and it&#x27;s inexpensive</li>
            <li> This is the best facial moisturizer I have ever found...plus it is SPF 25 and works to stop both A and B rays of sunshine.  It makes your skin look youthful and fresh and is recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer for dry skin</li>
            <li> I use this when my skin needs extra moisturizing like after I do a peel &amp; I especially slather it on in the summertime.  It was recommended by my dermatologist, so I am more confidant that it wont make me breakout &amp; she even said can help with fine lines.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on positive reviews from other customers, and have been extraordinarily pleased. I&#x27;d never heard of it before finding it in Amazon, and the packaging gives kind of an &amp;#34;off-brand&amp;#34; message that made me hesitate; but I can see why dermatologists recommend it. It provides a wonderful smoothing and softening base under makeup; it refreshes my skin and gives it a youthful, dewy appearance; and the SPF appears to be measuring up to its claim of 25, although I am super-cautious in the bright sunshine and often wear brimmed hats, thus I can&#x27;t be sure how effective the DML&#x27;s sun protection abilities are. Also, a small dollop goes a long way, so ladies, don&#x27;t let the small tube fool you - the contents might last longer than you&#x27;d expect (again, can&#x27;t vouch for how successful the small quantity I use each morning is for preventing sun damage). About to reorder now!!</li>
            <li> I have read other reviews about this moisturizer and they wrote it was greasy? I didn&#x27;t feel the same, maybe you are putting too much because a little goes a long way!! Make sure your face has some water on it first and then apply a little to each side of your face. It does not make your face white like usual with any cream with sunscreen. This one is the best I have ever tried and I have tried so many I love this product. I usually put it as soon as I get out of the shower and then go back later to put my makeup that way it has already absorbed into the skin. I have finally found something that leaves my face so soft and its paba free yaaaaay!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting to the age where it&#x27;s necessary to wear a daily moisturizer with spf--fine lines are starting to appear and I can only imagine it&#x27;s going to be an uphill battle from here.  After trying a few anti-aging moisturizers with spf, I started to notice that my skin was not looking younger and healthier, but quite the opposite.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem with dry or damaged skin, but these products were making my skin look terrible and they all smelled like chemicals.  After reading other reviews for DML, I decided to give it a try.  Within days of using this product my skin started to look younger and plumper than ever and I don&#x27;t have to put up with a chemical smell.  I am a life convert and will continue to use this product FOREVER.</li>
            <li> Recommended by our dermatologist for my daughter who has eczema, this is a good all over moisturizer for face and neck. Gentle, non-greasy, it provides good coverage.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t wear anything with strong perfumes. This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> LOVE my DML SPF 25 facial lotion.  I have very sensitive skin and have been using DML for 25 years.  I used to special order regular DML from the pharmacy.  So thrilled that I found DML with SPF 25, it&#x27;s so calming for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this from a Dermatologist 10 years ago and have been buying it ever since. I use it as my everyday moisturizer and 25 spf sunblock. It has never clogged my poors or caused any kind of skin irritation and is very cheap</li>
            <li> This product is great for all skin types even people who suffer from acne especially cystic acne. When dealing with acne and the harsh chemicals you use trying to deal with acne this lotion helps your skin repair.&lt;br /&gt;I use the orange on ewith spf in the morning (also dounles as a primer ladoes) and the white one at night.&lt;br /&gt;It is amazing been using it for years. Better then any drug or high end retail brand.I oerfer it over Dermalogica too</li>
            <li> I bought this after using the sample given to my by my dermatologist. I&#x27;m very fair and my skin is both dry and sensitive and I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a moisturizer with sunscreen that didn&#x27;t irritate my face, provided enough moisture so that I don&#x27;t dry out, and could be worn under make-up without causing problems. I used the entire sample tube with no problems and am part way through the larger tube that I bought on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it, I allow it to soak in for a few minutes before putting on my make-up (Bare Minerals).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works perfectly for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many, many years...It is perfect for an under makeup moisturizer. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my very fair sensitive skin and has SPF as a bonus. When I was younger I only used it in winter..as it is very moisturizing... but now in my late 40s I can use it year around. I will continue to use this product as long as it is available....</li>
            <li> I have been using moisturizer from all stretches of the earth. NuSkin to dead sea to japanese products to Exuviance. This one moisturizes very well. The thing about less-expensive moisturizers are that they do the same job, but they are thicker. I have been having drier skin, overall after using this for a year, so I&#x27;m not sure if the long term benefits are good. My skin looks older but I don&#x27;t think it is due to this product or just aging. This product is a bit too much for summertime, if you have an oily/shiny t-zone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product that keeps my face moist with using just a small amount.  It lasts about two months.</li>
            <li> The SPF aspect is critical to me.  I have very sensitive skin and tried a number of moisturizers with sunscreen that just didn&#x27;t work.  At a makeup saleswoman&#x27;s recommendation, I tried a $40 moisturizer that was supposed to work, but made my face feel like it was burning.  Then my dermatologist suggested this.  It works beautifully, no burning sensation.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years along with Retin-A and it&#x27;s the only moisturizer that works for the dryness from Retin-A</li>
            <li> I like the way it feels under my makeup. I apply it before my base and you don&#x27;t use as much base also.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this product for many years at the advice of her Dermatologist.  At age 97, she daily applies this facial product.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer!! The price is the best that I have found anywhere! I have used this product for 8 years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good...I would like to have a short review, but there is a minimum word submission...good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,vgood, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,good, good,</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recomended this for me to use and I likde it, not bad to use but is expensive for as much as I need to use. I recomend DML FORTE with Pantenol for thise with very dry sky and tight budgets likeme</li>
            <li> This product is great, My doctor sells this product and more skincare  at her office so I gave it a try.I&#x27;m 56  My face so soft and Dewy and has a firm feel. You want be sorry for trying it.</li>
