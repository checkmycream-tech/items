            <li>I am in need of a great blush brush...</li>

            <li>Loving these Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li>What else is there to say :)  Top quality!</li>
            <li>Honestly, this is better than my MAC blush brush.  </li>
            <li>the best I have found has been a Sonia Kashuk brush but can&#x27;t really find a better one... and even that one is just ok.</li>
            <li>This brush works great for applying the right amount of blush without overdoing it.</li>
            <li>At first I got this brush thinking this would be great for applying blush.</li>
            <li>I noticed that the blush application is very light</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter how many times it&#x27;s been washed, or how I wash it, it sheds with each application.</li>
            <li>in love with this brush</li>
            <li>Love love love Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li>thank you Amazon and sigma:):)</li>
            <li>So glad the makeup artist I like on YouTube recommended these Sigma brushes.  </li>
            <li>I love the is sigma brush.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This is just OK.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK as is the eye shadow.  </li>
            <li>This brush is just okay</li>
            <li>sure why</li>
            <li>I use this brush for my powder and it just give me a nice even light coverage of powder onto my face.</li>
            <li>This brush is just ok.</li>
            <li>I really love this brush.  </li>
            <li>Better brushes do make as difference...</li>
            <li>It is a okay brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m in love for the products of Sigma.</li>
            <li>It is much softer and gives a very nicely diffused blush application.  </li>
            <li>Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t shed all over my face like so many other brushes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Overall good value!</li>
            <li>I have heard so many great things about Sigma brushes and finally hopped on the train!</li>
            <li>I used this for blush and it&#x27;s fine, but I&#x27;m not blown away.  </li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>If it were under $10, I&#x27;d be fine with it.</li>
            <li>brushes make a huge difference on the application of makeup and this is a line that i will be sticking with.</li>
            <li>LOVE this brush, applies just the right amount of blush for a even application.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i totally recommend this brush to anyone who wants a cheap and great brush. :)</li>
            <li>so you can have full control on</li>
            <li>I like the real techniques powder brush more</li>
            <li>It evenly applies the product, is so nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I use a full coverage foundation.</li>
            <li>They have nice soft bristles, apply nicely and generally work well.</li>
            <li>Picks up a lot of product with little effort, it&#x27;s very soft, and it&#x27;s the perfect size for applying blush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found a much better one--the Illamasqua rounded blush brush (not the angled one, which is very narrow and best for contouring only.)  </li>
            <li>Love the way it applies my blush and how soft this brush is.</li>
            <li>Overall I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good for blush unless you want very minimum blush.</li>
            <li>I keep buying Sigma, brushes are so soft, don&#x27;t shed and the quality is better than MAC.</li>
            <li>recomendos all the girls that buy the products of Sigma, are very good and last a long time.</li>
            <li>The right size.</li>
            <li>It is very soft and applies blush easily and with precision where I want it.</li>
            <li>Gives me exactly the right amount of powder I need.</li>
            <li>It makes blending my bronzer and blush so easy to give me a natural look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a smaller, less dense version of my large Sigma powder brush, which is perfect for what I needed.</li>
            <li>you very much</li>
            <li>Specially because Sigma is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is very soft, but I wonder if this would&#x27;ve been better as an overall face brush for light application of translucent powders.</li>
            <li>Enjoying this brush immensely!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back for more Sigma face brushes.</li>
            <li>exactly the&lt;br /&gt;perfect</li>
            <li>I will be buys more of them, especially from Amazon.</li>
            <li>swipe the brush on my cheek bones with small strokes and it gives a beautiful natural</li>
            <li>I have recently bought many Sigma eye and face brushes and love every single one.</li>
            <li>I was hoping the bristles be soft like the F80, but fluffier (as that is super dense).  </li>
            <li>It is super soft, but still picks up products.</li>
            <li>finish.&lt;br /&gt;the bristles are super soft too.&lt;br /&gt;No complaints.</li>
            <li>Transfers all the product to your face so you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li>I have no idea if this is normal for a blush brush as this is my first one.</li>
            <li>I alternate between blush and setting powder, and have even used it for an all-over dusting of bronzer for a light glow (cleaning between products of course).</li>
            <li>This brush just doesn&#x27;t really do it for me</li>
            <li>I absolutely did not like it for my blush.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to worry about applying too much powder.</li>
            <li>and it really does do its job</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>I expected more.</li>
            <li>I own a few sigma brushes and I must say this is a</li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft and don&#x27;t shed at all!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and just the right size.  </li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t used my other favorite blush brushes (Smashbox and Real Techniques) at all since I bought this brush.</li>
            <li>I love all the brushes from Sigma and would not trade for any other brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For powder I still prefer the Sona Kashuk white handled  (really cheap, soft, but doesn&#x27;t take much abuse) or the Cover FX powder brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in lov with my new sigma brush!</li>
            <li>Sigma brushes are very practical, lightweight, soft, and with a disgner very beautiful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So high end</li>
            <li>Bristles were not as soft as a real sigma.</li>
            <li>I am in love with the Sigma F80 round kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>It should be more firm.</li>
            <li>these are worth the extra $ over drug store brands.</li>
            <li>This is a very soft brush.</li>
            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>So soft!  </li>
            <li>Soft on the face, no fall out of bristles!</li>
            <li>old daughter for xmas stocking.</li>
            <li>Doesnt shed and is so soft.</li>
            <li>I replaced my really old blush brush with this.</li>
            <li>- so soft and doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>Soft blush brush.  </li>
            <li>Big and soft!!</li>
            <li>It looks like a simple fix with super glue, or you can just hold it carefully when applying blush/powder which is what I do now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve washed it several times since purchasing it and it still looks like new.  </li>
            <li>Brushes were not a disappointment I use them everyday .&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>It is soft but I would recommend a different blush brush that would apply blush to a smaller area.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not harsh, but i&#x27;s not very soft.</li>
            <li>It is beter quality than expensive lines like NARS and MAC but has great if not better quality.</li>
            <li>Only thing is that it is a little large for blush.</li>

            <li> It makes blending my bronzer and blush so easy to give me a natural look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a smaller, less dense version of my large Sigma powder brush, which is perfect for what I needed.</li>
            <li> you very much</li>
            <li> Specially because Sigma is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is very soft, but I wonder if this would&#x27;ve been better as an overall face brush for light application of translucent powders.</li>
            <li> Enjoying this brush immensely!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be back for more Sigma face brushes.</li>
            <li> exactly the&lt;br /&gt;perfect</li>
            <li> I will be buys more of them, especially from Amazon.</li>
            <li> swipe the brush on my cheek bones with small strokes and it gives a beautiful natural</li>
            <li> I have recently bought many Sigma eye and face brushes and love every single one.</li>
            <li> I was hoping the bristles be soft like the F80, but fluffier (as that is super dense).  </li>
            <li> It is super soft, but still picks up products.</li>
            <li> finish.&lt;br /&gt;the bristles are super soft too.&lt;br /&gt;No complaints.</li>
            <li> Transfers all the product to your face so you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if this is normal for a blush brush as this is my first one.</li>
            <li> I alternate between blush and setting powder, and have even used it for an all-over dusting of bronzer for a light glow (cleaning between products of course).</li>
            <li> This brush just doesn&#x27;t really do it for me</li>
            <li> I absolutely did not like it for my blush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about applying too much powder.</li>
            <li> and it really does do its job</li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> I expected more.</li>
            <li> I own a few sigma brushes and I must say this is a</li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft and don&#x27;t shed at all!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and just the right size.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t used my other favorite blush brushes (Smashbox and Real Techniques) at all since I bought this brush.</li>
            <li> I love all the brushes from Sigma and would not trade for any other brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For powder I still prefer the Sona Kashuk white handled  (really cheap, soft, but doesn&#x27;t take much abuse) or the Cover FX powder brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in lov with my new sigma brush!</li>
            <li> Sigma brushes are very practical, lightweight, soft, and with a disgner very beautiful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So high end</li>
            <li> Bristles were not as soft as a real sigma.</li>
            <li> I am in love with the Sigma F80 round kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> It should be more firm.</li>
            <li> these are worth the extra $ over drug store brands.</li>
            <li> This is a very soft brush.</li>
            <li> Very soft.</li>
            <li> So soft!  </li>
            <li> Soft on the face, no fall out of bristles!</li>
            <li> old daughter for xmas stocking.</li>
            <li> Doesnt shed and is so soft.</li>
            <li> I replaced my really old blush brush with this.</li>
            <li> - so soft and doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> Soft blush brush.  </li>
            <li> Big and soft!!</li>
            <li> It looks like a simple fix with super glue, or you can just hold it carefully when applying blush/powder which is what I do now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed it several times since purchasing it and it still looks like new.  </li>
            <li> Brushes were not a disappointment I use them everyday .&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> It is soft but I would recommend a different blush brush that would apply blush to a smaller area.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not harsh, but i&#x27;s not very soft.</li>
            <li> It is beter quality than expensive lines like NARS and MAC but has great if not better quality.</li>
            <li> Only thing is that it is a little large for blush.</li>
            <li> Brush is soft, the hairs don&#x27;t come off like some of the other one&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I have no major complaints, but that it is already showing some wear and tear after a month.</li>
            <li> They will last you a really long time!</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft and fluffy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over flowing with makeup brushes that are cheap to expensive.</li>
            <li> but came the brush part came loose from the wand.</li>
            <li> I get for less at CVS, except it&#x27;s larger.</li>
            <li> but the black handle of this brush is starting to separate from the metal piece?</li>
            <li> At least it&#x27;s not huge like the Real Techniques one.  </li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth every penny</li>
            <li> These brushes are expensive but are completely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced much shedding as other commenters noted.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I recieved a faulty brush, but the brush I recieved constantly sheds on me.</li>
            <li> Not sure why as I have only used this for a couple of months on myself?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have an issue with the bristles falling out like other brushes.</li>
            <li> Shocked because all my other Sigma brushes are strong and sturdy?</li>
            <li> I have had other brushes from other brands like ecotools that have never shed on me, even after 6 years!</li>
            <li> For the price, this brush is not worth it.</li>
            <li> I also paid less than half the price for this one.  </li>
            <li> sheds a little in the beginning</li>
            <li> it picks up a little blush at a time</li>
            <li> It picks up so little product.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t leave little bristles all over your face!  </li>
            <li> But I find that it is too small to use as a powder blush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not better than brushes sets</li>
            <li> I often end up using the F80 to  apply blush, as I like it in a small area.  </li>
            <li> , I usually pass this brush up when applying my makeup.</li>
            <li> and I have to reapply at least 3 times for the color to show on my face.</li>
            <li> I would reccomend this brush to anyone who is really serious about makeup.</li>
            <li> Thought it was a fake brush but seller say it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> It works like an expensive brush would work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used from expensive brand names.</li>
            <li> I am very very highly disappointed.</li>

            <li> I am not sure if I recieved a faulty brush, but the brush I recieved constantly sheds on me. It doesn&#x27;t matter how many times it&#x27;s been washed, or how I wash it, it sheds with each application. I have had other brushes from other brands like ecotools that have never shed on me, even after 6 years! For the price, this brush is not worth it.</li>
            <li> Great blush brush, very happy with purchase!</li>
            <li> Great powder brush :)</li>
            <li> It is very soft and applies blush easily and with precision where I want it. Transfers all the product to your face so you don&#x27;t need to use much. Great quality!</li>
            <li> Received on time and as described on site. Purchased for my 19yr. old daughter for xmas stocking. Purchased (5) Sigma Makeup Brushes all which came on time as as described on site. She will be opening all on Christmas Eve 2014.</li>
            <li> in love with this brush</li>
            <li> Love love love Sigma brushes. What else is there to say :)  Top quality!</li>
            <li> Brushes were not a disappointment I use them everyday .&lt;br /&gt;You may want to consider how you mail them... United States&lt;br /&gt;Post Office just stuffed the box in the mailbox and I could not&lt;br /&gt;get it out, but the brushes were great.</li>
            <li> This is a very soft brush. I purchased it to specifically apply blush. I noticed that the blush application is very light and I have to reapply at least 3 times for the color to show on my face. I have no idea if this is normal for a blush brush as this is my first one. I like the fact that it is very soft, but I wonder if this would&#x27;ve been better as an overall face brush for light application of translucent powders.</li>
            <li> Picks up a lot of product with little effort, it&#x27;s very soft, and it&#x27;s the perfect size for applying blush.  I&#x27;ve washed it several times since purchasing it and it still looks like new.  No bristle fall out to speak of.  I absolutely love this brush!</li>
            <li> Love this!  This blush brush picks up color nicely and is the perfect shape to deposit it onto my cheeks.  I&#x27;ve found myself reaching for this every day and I haven&#x27;t used my other favorite blush brushes (Smashbox and Real Techniques) at all since I bought this brush.</li>
            <li> This is great quality, like all of the Sigma brushes. But I find that it is too small to use as a powder blush. I prefer to use this for bronzer and contouring.</li>
            <li> Enjoying this brush immensely!!! sheds a little in the beginning but all you have to do is wash it...puts on color beautifully!! thank you Amazon and sigma:):)</li>
            <li> Thought it was a fake brush but seller say it&#x27;s not. After only two washes, it&#x27;s starting to shed. Just doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s great quality. Oh well, gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I used this for blush and it&#x27;s fine, but I&#x27;m not blown away.  At least it&#x27;s not huge like the Real Techniques one.  I&#x27;ve found a much better one--the Illamasqua rounded blush brush (not the angled one, which is very narrow and best for contouring only.)  For powder I still prefer the Sona Kashuk white handled  (really cheap, soft, but doesn&#x27;t take much abuse) or the Cover FX powder brush.</li>
            <li> So glad the makeup artist I like on YouTube recommended these Sigma brushes.  I think they are a great price and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with each one I&#x27;ve bought.  They have nice soft bristles, apply nicely and generally work well.</li>
            <li> I love the is sigma brush. It works like an expensive brush would work. The price is great.</li>
            <li> I am really loving the quality of Sigma brushes.  This one is perfect for applying brush or powder. I use it for applying bronzer too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush based on a recommendation, and I absolutely love it! It&#x27;s a smaller, less dense version of my large Sigma powder brush, which is perfect for what I needed. I alternate between blush and setting powder, and have even used it for an all-over dusting of bronzer for a light glow (cleaning between products of course). Definitely part of my must-have set.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this is better than my MAC blush brush.  It is much softer and gives a very nicely diffused blush application.  I also paid less than half the price for this one.  I&#x27;ll be back for more Sigma face brushes.</li>
            <li> Great brush!! Big and soft!!</li>
            <li> This is my fave brush. It is beter quality than expensive lines like NARS and MAC but has great if not better quality. Doesnt shed and is so soft.</li>
            <li> Brush is soft, the hairs don&#x27;t come off like some of the other one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used from expensive brand names. Overall good value!</li>
            <li> I replaced my really old blush brush with this. Was an amazing choice. So soft&lt;br /&gt;and it picks up a little blush at a time so you can have full control on exactly the&lt;br /&gt;perfect amount of blush you want. The right size. Love it.</li>
            <li> JUST BUY ANY SIGMA BRUSH, YOU WONT REGRET IT. THEY ALL WORK GUD. I AM A HAPPY CUSTOMER AND I WILL BUY THESE AGAIN!!!!</li>
            <li> I am in love with the Sigma F80 round kabuki brush. It&#x27;s perfect. This is just OK. It&#x27;s not better than brushes sets I get for less at CVS, except it&#x27;s larger. It works fine. I have no major complaints, but that it is already showing some wear and tear after a month. It&#x27;s not harsh, but i&#x27;s not very soft. I was hoping the bristles be soft like the F80, but fluffier (as that is super dense).  It&#x27;s OK as is the eye shadow.  I often end up using the F80 to  apply blush, as I like it in a small area.  If it were under $10, I&#x27;d be fine with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over flowing with makeup brushes that are cheap to expensive. This brush is just okay, I usually pass this brush up when applying my makeup. I like the real techniques powder brush more and I use my Bella terra brush for my bronzer. This brush just doesn&#x27;t really do it for me</li>
            <li> I own a few sigma brushes and I must say this is a Must have brush.  Love the way it applies my blush and how soft this brush is.</li>
            <li> So soft!  and it doesn&#x27;t leave little bristles all over your face!  I will buy more! Expensive, but worth every penny</li>
            <li> I use this daily. It is super soft, but still picks up products. Cleans beautifully and no shedding.</li>
            <li> Great powder brush. Very soft. Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t shed all over my face like so many other brushes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> received on time and the brushes are great!</li>
            <li> I have heard so many great things about Sigma brushes and finally hopped on the train! I have recently bought many Sigma eye and face brushes and love every single one. Especially this one. It evenly applies the product, is so nice and soft. These are very well made at a great price! I will be buys more of them, especially from Amazon. Great service!&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why but the black handle of this brush is starting to separate from the metal piece? Not sure why as I have only used this for a couple of months on myself? Will be getting in touch with the seller and maybe even Sigma. Shocked because all my other Sigma brushes are strong and sturdy? Still a great brush but watch for a separating handle?</li>
            <li> It is a nice brush and good quality. I don&#x27;t have an issue with the bristles falling out like other brushes. Only thing is that it is a little large for blush. Besides that it is great!</li>
            <li> At first I got this brush thinking this would be great for applying blush. I absolutely did not like it for my blush. It picks up so little product. It didn&#x27;t even blend to well. When I was applying my blush to my cheeks. Overall I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good for blush unless you want very minimum blush. But I do have to say that it&#x27;s very good for applying powder. I use a full coverage foundation. I do think this is perfect for applying powder to your T-Zones. Like I said it does pick up minimum product. But it is good for concealing your foundation with powder without leaving it cakey. I use this brush for my powder and it just give me a nice even light coverage of powder onto my face. I don&#x27;t have to worry about applying too much powder. Gives me exactly the right amount of powder I need. But I don&#x27;t recommend this brush. if you are looking for a maximum coverage for a powder.</li>
            <li> i just got my powder blush brus the sigma F10 and its a great product i love it its sof and it really does do its job i recomend it</li>
            <li> Great brush. Fast delivery</li>
            <li> This brush works great for applying the right amount of blush without overdoing it. brushes make a huge difference on the application of makeup and this is a line that i will be sticking with. goodbye mac brushes.</li>
            <li> LOVE this brush, applies just the right amount of blush for a even application.&lt;br /&gt;I swipe the brush on my cheek bones with small strokes and it gives a beautiful natural finish.&lt;br /&gt;the bristles are super soft too.&lt;br /&gt;No complaints.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t apply to the area you want. It kinda just spreads all over. This brush is just ok.</li>
            <li> Once you put it on your cheek is spreads all over. It should be more firm. It is soft but I would recommend a different blush brush that would apply blush to a smaller area.</li>
            <li> I really love this brush.  It&#x27;s soft and just the right size.  I will continue ordering Sigma brushes because this one is so great.</li>
            <li> I just received the Sigma F10 Powder/Blush brush. It has the softest feel to it! I use this brush to apply my blush and sometimes bronzer. It applies my blush beautifully. It makes blending my bronzer and blush so easy to give me a natural look. Great quality for the price! I love it!</li>
            <li> I love sigma brushes! So high end but for a considerably low price! must have! Great blush brush for your every day kit!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic deal&lt;br /&gt;Deliver the shipment on time&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to cooperate with you again&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much</li>
            <li> This brush is beautiful!  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it - so soft and doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> It does not blend well the blush. I have to blend a good minute in order for the blush to be even.</li>
            <li> This brush is not a Sigma brush at all. Very cheaply made. Bristles were not as soft as a real sigma. I am very very highly disappointed. It even had patent pending on the back. I would NEVER buy this brush. 1 star is generous! DO NOT PURCHASE</li>
            <li> Distributes powder evenly. I have not experienced much shedding as other commenters noted. Better brushes do make as difference...these are worth the extra $ over drug store brands.</li>
            <li> I expected more. Specially because Sigma is highly recommended. The blush doesn´t &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; well to the brush.It is a okay brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in lov with my new sigma brush! i totally recommend this brush to anyone who wants a cheap and great brush. :)</li>
            <li> I love the versatility of this brush! You can put bronzer, blush, and highlight all with this brush! Soft on the face, no fall out of bristles!</li>
            <li> This brush is absolutely amazing!! Perfect for applying blush and highlighter. The bristles are so soft and don&#x27;t shed at all!!! Also  the weight of the brush make a perfect weight for applying makeup. I would reccomend this brush to anyone who is really serious about makeup. These brushes are expensive but are completely worth the investment. They will last you a really long time!</li>
            <li> I keep buying Sigma, brushes are so soft, don&#x27;t shed and the quality is better than MAC. Need a Sigma store in Phoenix...</li>
            <li> I am in need of a great blush brush... the best I have found has been a Sonia Kashuk brush but can&#x27;t really find a better one... and even that one is just ok. But it blends blush well... still on the hunt though.</li>
            <li> Soft blush brush.  It picks up lots of powder and applies beautifully.  Loving these Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush, excellent price</li>
            <li> Good brush but came the brush part came loose from the wand. It looks like a simple fix with super glue, or you can just hold it carefully when applying blush/powder which is what I do now. I like the way Sigma brushes feel so I&#x27;m not that upset by it.</li>
            <li> The sigma brushes are wonderful, the finishes of the shadows and application of blush and powder is fantastic. The brushes are very soft and fluffy. I love all the brushes from Sigma and would not trade for any other brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoever brushes good, the best is even Sigma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sigma brushes are very practical, lightweight, soft, and with a disgner very beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recomendos all the girls that buy the products of Sigma, are very good and last a long time. What is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in love for the products of Sigma.</li>
