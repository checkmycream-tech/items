            <li>I was able to apply it to my face with ease using a fan brush (of course you can use your fingers, but I am broke and trying to pretend I am at the spa, lol!).</li>

            <li>And the best part, it&#x27;s dirt cheap!</li>
            <li>then rinse with warm water and voila!</li>
            <li>I use this once a month for perfect skin, I love this face mask.</li>

            <li>The texture of my skin after using this mask is remarkable.</li>
            <li>Loving the stuff!</li>
            <li>I was waiting for a while to write this review, to make sure I could leave the best advice/ experience/ feedback for others who are looking for something to help with their acne.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of cleaning out my pores, and the price is great.</li>
            <li>This mask one of my favorite ,..in my routuine.helps whatever it said on the package ,very happy purchased</li>
            <li>People if u have sensitive skin don&#x27;t try!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>love it love it!!!</li>
            <li>Love love it!!!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell that pleasant.</li>
            <li>beauty-wise.&lt;br /&gt;It makes your face pulsate and tingle in a quite pleasant way which I like to imagine</li>
            <li>I mix it with apple cider vinegar--it doesn&#x27;t smell or look pleasant, but works.  </li>
            <li>im so excited guys!!!</li>
            <li>Worked great mixing it with apple cider , very satisfied with results</li>
            <li>would like to thank Amazon for a wide range of awesome products with excellent online service and excellent customer service.</li>
            <li>I recommend this wonderful product for true results!</li>
            <li>My face felt so clean!!!  </li>
            <li>and when you wash it off you won&#x27;t believe how clean your skin looks and feels!!!</li>
            <li>Great for many usage too!</li>
            <li>It works best with apple cider vinegar, but using with water it works fine to just the results might not be as good.</li>
            <li>I made sure to wipe everything away very good when washing it off.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it in places that i don&#x27;t have to, it&#x27;s very strong!</li>
            <li>Honestly this is probably top 3 best beauty products I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I wonder if there something to the thickness level that is causing bright redness for some people?</li>
            <li>This is great clay and many of the attractive masks I see in the store have cheaper ingredients.</li>
            <li>&#x27;S THE BEST PART:  If you have lines and wrinkles already, within a couple of weeks of using the two products you will see a HUGE difference.  </li>
            <li>This one is the most effective and of best value in my opinion.</li>
            <li>My face has never EVER looked so bright.</li>
            <li>This is honestly the best product I have ever tried and trust me, I have tried many.</li>
            <li>The tingling feeling is amazing and I am so happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>this once a week and follow with a good, non-chemical moisturizer and your skin will feel like a baby&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon of each is really good for applying it to your face.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this because I heard it was good, but I had no idea</li>
            <li>The product arrived in time, it was in good conditions.</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>I loved it..</li>
            <li>The producer may buy some good reviews from co,.</li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>good luck</li>
            <li>you want to make a good clay mask, get about 1/16th of a cup (and I recommend a glass mixing bowl) and then get your apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly though i did not feel any pulsation</li>
            <li>but this product is so good</li>
            <li>good with apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>Good Luck to all</li>
            <li>GOOD PRODUCT..</li>
            <li>I recommend using this as just an all around good face mask.</li>
            <li>but i still want my skin looking good,</li>
            <li>The cashier even looked at the product before the scan and said i heard this stuff is good...</li>
            <li>All the tightening and clay cleasing felt good</li>
            <li>here&#x27;s the good part.</li>
            <li>As a clay face masked it worked good</li>
            <li>and I LOVED THE FEELING.</li>
            <li>This is a good product</li>
            <li>Good buy for the price.</li>
            <li>Honey is good for healing, just like the clay.</li>
            <li>Honey is good for healing, just like the clay.</li>
            <li>Not a miracle, but good for cleaning out pores and drying out blemishes.</li>
            <li>have been applying the mask,  once in three days and after three applications , I do see a good difference.</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>and i was good to go.</li>
            <li>i think this clay helps with that which is good for me</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also says that the clay is good for acne</li>
            <li>I really loved my experience with the clay.</li>
            <li>and when I took it off my face felt soo good</li>
            <li>On day 2 after using the clay, my face started to peel and I wish that&#x27;s a good sign.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin looks soooo good-</li>
            <li>I also tried it without applying any serum or cream afterwards and the results were just as good.</li>
            <li>I also tried it without applying any serum or cream afterwards and the results were just as good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(looking for a good product to tighten the pores afterward</li>
            <li>so I have consistently good skin.</li>
            <li>I loved this on my face and even had my sister use it...</li>
            <li>My measuring skills have never been good.</li>
            <li>That being said, even though I did screw it up I really loved how rosy my face was and how good it felt.</li>
            <li>Afterwards a good face cream is essential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use it on my face as a mask and makes it feel really good.</li>
            <li>However, the product is good</li>
            <li>that day - it all looked good.</li>
            <li>It tingles and afterward your feet feel so good.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend and I use it together, I think this product is good for all skin types.</li>
            <li>It is just a good skin exfoliator, blackhead still there.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t know if it is good for your plumbing.</li>
            <li>Good product for the price &amp;</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s good stuff</li>
            <li>good value.</li>
            <li>Although, the apple cider vinegar doesn&#x27;t smell to good the smell will eventually go away.</li>
            <li>ITS IS NUMBER ONE IN SKIN ANTI AGING FOR GOOD REASIN.</li>
            <li>A light dose is best, I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job of cleaning pores, smoothing skin and the apple cider vinegar is good for my oily T zone.</li>
            <li>Follow with a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>That or use in combination with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>just because it has lots of badtass good ratings already, why should i drop it</li>
            <li>the tingling sensation feel good, relaxing to me.</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;ve had my fair share of school projects</li>
            <li>Nice stuff, works great for blackheads but doesn&#x27;t do away with them 100%, I&#x27;d say maybe 70% of blackheads gone</li>
            <li>After using the clay, I moisturize with rosehip, jojoba  or good quality olive oil.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely loved this product.</li>
            <li>but it seems like a good product.</li>
            <li>The tub says its good for 4 masks</li>
            <li>Its good for acne and bug bites sooo</li>
            <li>I wanted to use this for a couple weeks before I gave a good review on it.</li>
            <li>and it literally feels like your face is being tightened into a corset ( this is a good thing).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for reducing redness and swelling.</li>
            <li>This improved my skin and good for days where you feel like you need a spa day.</li>
            <li>YOU FOLLOW UP WITH A GOOD MOISTURIZER</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I even bought the good apple vinegar for it, and it didn&#x27;t make any difference.</li>
            <li>I use a good vinegar with \\&quot;the mother\\&quot; and  bought the  Rosallini Packed 4</li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>Feels good.</li>
            <li>Looks Good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good cleanser.</li>
            <li>My face felt like it was pulsing, in a good way.  </li>
            <li>I mix this with apple cider vinegar like the instructions say and it makes my skin feel good.</li>
            <li>It feels good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The good news:</li>
            <li>and I still use it now to maintain optimum skin clarity.  </li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel good after using it</li>
            <li>With water it was still fairly clumpy and I haven&#x27;t yet tried it with apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li>But, it is a good mask</li>
            <li>years of searching for a good product  </li>
            <li>I used a good quality moisturizer after.  </li>
            <li>its good for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Good step to add in your skincare routine.</li>
            <li>No fuss multipurpos good face mask.</li>
            <li>I feel good knowing that there aren&#x27;t a ton of ingredients in this, and mixing with ACV</li>
            <li>which is what makes the product so good</li>
            <li>I loved it and it was delivered in a timely fashion</li>
            <li>A good moisturizer is needed afterwards.</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, I have really good skin.</li>
            <li>Thus getting a good cleaning has always been a problem.  </li>
            <li>Good luck to you all and</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>Good luck to you all and</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>its not some miracle but its a good mask.</li>
            <li>Results not as good as others reported.  </li>
            <li>so i feel good in recommneding this to others.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere for a good face mask and nothing</li>
            <li>So I will try on my hair and see if it works just as good as it works on the face.</li>
            <li>Purchased this based on the good reviews here about how it helps with acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;10) Just take a paper towel and give a sink a good wipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though I&#x27;m absolutely delighted with the lifting, energizing, and skin rejuvenating effects of the mask, I must say that I didn&#x27;t see any sign of it dissolving or DRAWING gunk out of pores</li>
            <li>My skin looks so good</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect miracles with this, but I think it does some good for my skin.</li>
            <li>Excellent product , make your face smooth</li>
            <li>BTW, the directions say to use 1/4 - 1/2 inch on your face, making 1 pound good for 15 treatments.</li>
            <li>Just put on an even coverage, 1 pound will probably do a good 40 treatments.</li>
            <li>Good stuff works well</li>
            <li>It is really a good product to use.</li>
            <li>Acquire a fan with a good amount of power.</li>
            <li>As recommended, use a good moisturizer after the pore cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But Bragg&#x27;s Vinegar is also good for your skin, so it&#x27;s a go</li>
            <li>A good time to mention</li>
            <li>This works good</li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good for your skin.</li>
            <li>it should just make your skin glow and look good.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>and i absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>But in a GOOD way.</li>
            <li>She didn&#x27;t complain, so I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>this is a good product for cleansing, masks, and baths.</li>
            <li>She loved it because it drew out impurities and seemed to exfoliate.  </li>
            <li>GOOD.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin, did not cause any redness or irritation.</li>
            <li>I loved this produced</li>
            <li>Makes a good mask when used with water.  </li>
            <li>After one use everyone was raving about how good my skin looked.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say use this at night before you go to bed because it won&#x27;t do any good-</li>
            <li>so a scar treatment or good exfoliator is a good idea also if you have issues with that.t</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say use this at night before you go to bed because it won&#x27;t do any good-</li>
            <li>so a scar treatment or good exfoliator is a good idea also if you have issues with that.</li>
            <li>It is a good product and is sold at a good price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That being said I still find use for a good clay mask.</li>
            <li>Really loved it.</li>
            <li>and also good for men.  </li>
            <li>your face looks gorgeous</li>

            <li>It does make your face pulsate a bit, but it feels good.</li>
            <li>This is a good price for this stuff.</li>
            <li>This product really is good.</li>
            <li>Both things are good for cleansing.</li>
            <li>This cleansing mask works so good</li>
            <li>I loved how it felt.</li>
            <li>My skin does not feel good while it&#x27;s on or after.  </li>
            <li>Apply moisturizer liberally after a good cleaning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m practicing on making the perfect smooth concoction.</li>
            <li>you shave really good</li>
            <li>50 -carmel complexion and have taken really good care of my skin,</li>
            <li>and I guess good genes are a factor too.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it, but I think it is good</li>
            <li>This is good stuff.</li>

            <li>I see a lot of good reviews on here</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>Also good for sinus infections.</li>
            <li>Since Apple Cider Vinegar is acid (pH around 4), it balances out and is good for the skin.</li>
            <li>This is the most incredible stuff.  </li>
            <li>This was surprising to me at 24</li>
            <li>and it felt good as it was drying.  </li>
            <li>aren&#x27;t good for you if you do your research.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product, works great to cleanse skin!  </li>
            <li>Really good for oily, acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>so good.</li>
            <li>good face mask.</li>
            <li>Its a good product, would buy again.</li>
            <li>It felt wierd and good</li>
            <li>I loved using it and would suggest it to anyone who hasnt ever done face masks before.</li>
            <li>I use this once a week because I feel like it does a good job</li>
            <li>I bought it over a year ago and tried it for myself and loved it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to rinse this off in the shower I recommend putting some paper towels over the drain to collect the mud because this can&#x27;t be good for the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried it and loved it.</li>
            <li>a so called \\&quot;good day\\&quot; my skin would be sore and ravaged with acne.</li>
            <li>It seems to be a good product.  </li>
            <li>Good facepack for all skin types</li>
            <li>Which is good in my opinion because of the amount of clay that is suggested you put on.</li>
            <li>I tried because of good reviews &amp; price.</li>
            <li>but I get a good result with water as well.</li>
            <li>I used apple cider vinegar to mix with it, I used that on my face pryer because I heard its good for your skin.</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin so smooth and feels great!</li>
            <li>Its a good Product .</li>
            <li>Loved that it came with a sealed label.  </li>
            <li>Makes quite a bit...a good bargain&lt;</li>
            <li>It feels so good to have no pimples on my face.</li>
            <li>It feels so good to have no pimples on my face.</li>
            <li>Leaves face with good complexion.</li>
            <li>i am baffled by the number of good reviews this product has.</li>
            <li>/&gt;would not recommend, it&#x27;s way too drying, and not in a good way.</li>
            <li>I use it every night and mix it with apple cider vinegar, which I find is the best way to get a smooth mix, and leave it for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>You know those Axe commercials where chicks won&#x27;t leave that one guy alone cuz he smells just so darn good?</li>
            <li>This product has changed my skin forever.&lt;br /&gt;You will need a good moisturizer, as this will suck all of the crud out of your pores but you can expect to sacrifice some moisture in the process.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and that is good advice.</li>
            <li>However, apple cider vinegar doesn&#x27;t smell that good -_-</li>
            <li>Definitely a good idea to mix it up using ACV, then add a bit of water for it not to be lumpy.</li>
            <li>The mask is really good.</li>
            <li>That was a good combo.</li>
            <li>I do use a good moisturizer after use of the mask to help my skin from drying out.</li>
            <li>but I guess its still good.</li>
            <li>Thank  you  very much,  i loved</li>
            <li>Seemed like a good idea.</li>
            <li>its really good.......</li>
            <li>After you use this, you will need a good moisturizer, it cleans out your pours and dries your face a bit.</li>
            <li>Good, but not a miracle product.</li>
            <li>Do not buy if you know what&#x27;s good for you.</li>
            <li>Every time I have loved it.  </li>
            <li>Also word to the wise,..</li>
            <li>, I think this stuff works fairly well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really good stuff</li>
            <li>but my skin felt good.</li>
            <li>HOW GOOD THIS IS....</li>
            <li>and I could literally feel my skin getting a good cleaning while it was drying.</li>
            <li>so I bought this after seeing a gazillion good reviews.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>I bought this based on the good reviews.</li>
            <li>it cleans good when one needs it</li>
            <li>its so good for you.</li>
            <li>i bought this because i was looking for a good mask to unclog my pores.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It made my face clearer, but I guess it was a temporal bleach effect (which doesn&#x27;t feel good at all for your skin)&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel like a mask of good quality</li>
            <li>my wife ordered this and loved it...</li>
            <li>You can try it, I wanted to because of all the good reviews but trust me here</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good substantial size.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does a good job cleaning up your face.</li>
            <li>It is a good product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear makeup so having my pores look good is a necessity.</li>
            <li>but now my skin has never looked this good and will not go without again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fairly inexpensive, and somewhat &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; way to deal with problem skin.</li>
            <li>Skin looks and feels good.</li>
            <li>The reviews were really good, so I thought, why not?&lt;br</li>
            <li>My child has received compliments about how good their skin looks.  </li>
            <li>and my face feel and looks good</li>
            <li>good product.</li>
            <li>and I loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>which wasn&#x27;t really good because you&#x27;re stretching out the skin.</li>
            <li>it takes the redness out of skin if you are fair complected.  </li>
            <li>It works good.</li>
            <li>I think 20 minutes is a good maximum.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Follow those steps, and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>I had good hopes with this product.</li>
            <li>Use it with a good quality apple cider and you can feel its power.</li>
            <li>Here is a review to balance out the overly inflated good reviews here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fair to say that this stuff does do what it says it clears yur pores...</li>
            <li>I mix mines with water and just mix really good.</li>
            <li>Works really good</li>
            <li>This is so good because, when you put water in it, you can feel it drying your skin</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>The vinegar is also good for those with acne.</li>
            <li>My face feels so good after I use this.</li>

            <li>she said i worked really good.  </li>

            <li>It is so good.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mind mixing the clay and vinegar, and I loved the tingling feeling from the mask as well as</li>

            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>My acne-prone skin hasn&#x27;t felt this good since before puberty.</li>
            <li>That lasted for a good two hours.</li>
            <li>I got some good skincare products from amazon, and this indian healing clay</li>
            <li>it works good on me~ although it cost time to stir, I still apply it three times a week~</li>
            <li>One of the best pore cleansing mask, it is very powerful and you can feel your face pulsate and your skin tighten.</li>
            <li>and I have never been dissappointed with a positive rating UNTIL NOW!!!!!  </li>

            <li>and I&#x27;m more than happy to share that this product delivers on promise.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t believe how good my skin looks after using this amazing product.  </li>
            <li>clay began to release from my skin and it was very refreshing</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m so happy :) .</li>
            <li>Great that it worked for most people.</li>
            <li>It feels very refreshing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also rated 0 by the Environmental Working Group (zero is the best score they give, and beauty products rarely earn it.)  </li>
            <li>and I have been trying to find more natural-based products to use that had great reviews.</li>
            <li>So many uses, great product</li>
            <li>but i would recommend it mostly for people with oily to combination skin because it has a great drying effect.</li>
            <li>Great product and has so many uses I am just learning about all the benefits of clay but would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very refreshing and tightening&lt;</li>

            <li>Most of all I&#x27;m happy with how I look and feel.</li>
            <li>Great quality - will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li>Brought all my clogged pores out and made my skin look nice and bright and not oily.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I saw all the great reviews, but I have to add one more thing about this product.  </li>
            <li>I do notice I have a bright, nice glow after using.</li>
            <li>I love this product, its great on my skin.</li>
            <li>But it is better as I feel a sense of joy</li>
            <li>Others have extolled it virtues so I won&#x27;t go into detail here, but it is a universally great choice for many skin types.  </li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I use this once a week and get great looking healthy skin!RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li>; I&#x27;m confident and happy to add this to my routine.</li>
            <li>found that it&#x27;s best to whip fresh batches a day before using</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pulsating lay great :)</li>
            <li>It keeps your skin looking fresh and flawless.</li>
            <li>love this stuff, and great deal...</li>
            <li>A friend recommended this, and I&#x27;ve been very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the results it&#x27;s provided me.</li>
            <li>love this great stuff for ur face</li>
            <li>I saw that it had a lot of great reviews and thought most of them were probably BS</li>
            <li>With so many great reviews on this product, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak for most because i don&#x27;t have a acne problem, I just want to maintain great skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this mask mostly cuz of the great reviews &amp;when it came I couldnt wait to try it.</li>
            <li>but I am very pleased</li>
            <li>This is an okay one not the great one.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Very Satisfied.</li>
            <li>I thought for sure the reviews on this product had to be skewed, but honestly, it&#x27;s as great as it&#x27;s made out to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes my skin very smooth and supple!</li>
            <li>I use this once a week and it keeps my skin very healthy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very refreshing</li>
            <li>Though the smell with the apple cider can be overwhelming it feels great on my face.</li>
            <li>After that, my skin does feel great, and maybe looks slightly better</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m just using it to tighten and tone, I follow up with a good slather of rose hip oil (all of these can be purchased here on Amazon).</li>
            <li>i wouldn&#x27;t swear by it or anything, but it&#x27;s a nice face mask, feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li>good product, so very happy , thanks , and good deliver , OMG ....</li>
            <li>good product, so very happy , thanks , and good deliver</li>
            <li>However, it does feel nice, and is good for a spa day with the girls (or guys, as the case may be) every now and then.  </li>
            <li>I try once, its nice with good results</li>
            <li>i mix my pearl powder in it and it feels nice good product</li>
            <li>I was very excited to use this product because of all the great reviews.</li>
            <li>love love this mask!!</li>
            <li>great for removing dirt , leaves face feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>Very good product to clean out the pores.  </li>
            <li>the mixture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The contracting feel of the clay drying is surprising at first, but is actually very pleasant.</li>
            <li>After using this...I can honestly say that I have never been more happy with a product.</li>
            <li>, my boy friend and I got a great laugh and pictures (LOL) to show off before and after.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a miracle product but it does great for tightening things and acne scarring, and the best part is it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>Glad there is actually a good product at a good price.</li>
            <li>This is just too good for its price and very easy to use too.</li>
            <li>Just follow the direction and u will be super happy with the result :P</li>

            <li>That made a pretty perfect amount to use on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>To me, it&#x27;s not some magical awesome mask that&#x27;s gonna solve all your skin issues - it&#x27;s just a mask to clean your skin.</li>
            <li>Good luck!t into your face to loosen the mask, it comes off easily!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described - great quality - perfect for the job and really easy to use&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can easily see the great improvement on her skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, it does have a strong odor</li>
            <li>Your skin will absorb anything you use very quickly, so I recommend a great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Be warned though: It&#x27;s recommended that you use apple cider vinegar to mix with the powder so if you have an aversion to strong smells, this might not be great for you...</li>
            <li>With the unfiltered organic apple cider vinegar it&#x27;s not the most pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>I follow this mask up with coconut oil all over and it is a great way to easily pamper myself.</li>
            <li>all those together and apply to your face and wash it off after 20-25 minutes or keep it on until you feel comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;You can adjust the quantities as you wish coz ratios that work perfectly for one skin might not be same for others.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy beautiful glowing skin.</li>

            <li>Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>it makes your skin more bright and humid~</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re done with the mask, dab your face with warm water before removing it from your skin (this will make it easier for you to take it</li>
            <li>Add water or organic apple cider and it gives you a nice cleansing mask.</li>
            <li>I applied rose oil on my face when I was done.</li>
            <li>but my hair is loving all this time with the conditioner in.  </li>
            <li>I think it depends of each one, for me it wasn&#x27;t effective at all.</li>
            <li>It just kind of sets me in stone.</li>
            <li>I recommend taking a rag and soaking it with warm water and dabbing it generously on the clay so that it softens somewhat.</li>
            <li>im loving the four day use results and can&#x27;t wait to see how effective it&#x27;ll be after 1 month of use..</li>
            <li>but the pimples just smiled and kept swelling.</li>
            <li>It dragged my face and I kind of looked like a gangster Robert Deniro  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice rubbing your face with dirt.</li>
            <li>+ mixer handy to make the mask in.</li>
            <li>Love the tingling/tightening...makes me feel like it&#x27;s doing something good</li>
            <li>I would say it lasted about 2-3 hours, honestly.  </li>
            <li>I would say it lasted about 2-3 hours, honestly.  </li>
            <li>I took a towel and ran warm water on it and just placed this on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mixing it ourselves has been nice because I like it a bit thicker than my daughter.</li>
            <li>I think it makes your face feel nice.</li>
            <li>it won&#x27;t smell nice.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter taught me how to make my own face powder with this.  </li>
            <li>My wife bought it and she really liked.</li>
            <li>It kind of stings my skin,</li>
            <li>I do think that the apple cider vinegar(I use the unfiltered kind with the \\&quot;mother\\&quot; in it)vastly increases the healing power.</li>
            <li>It felt good, refreshing.</li>
            <li>But I have used this twice now (and you don&#x27;t need more than one spoonful) and it makes my skin feel so good afterwards.  </li>
            <li>After about 20 minutes, I removed the mask with warm water.  </li>
            <li>Take a bowl and fill it with warm water.</li>
            <li>thank you  very much,order it ,got it very happy</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it had good reviews</li>
            <li>so you need to take a warm shower to get it off or press a warm washcloth on your face to loosen the clay and then wipe it</li>
            <li>and then I wash it with warm water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;1tsp Indian healing clay + 1/4 tsp Vinegar + 1/2 tsp rose</li>
            <li>+ 1/2 rose water - Pore cleaning&lt;br /&gt;1/2 tsp Indian healing clay + 1/2 tsp lemon juice -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have something that doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of ingredients that don&#x27;t seem to help anyway.</li>
            <li>Honestly it lasts longer that way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So I got a wash cloth with warm water.</li>
            <li>I was the weirdo in line at CVS stroking their own face.</li>
            <li>I was the weirdo in line at CVS stroking their own face.</li>
            <li>I apply the clay mixture to my face and neck, i also add two slices of cucumber over my eyes and just relax for 20 minutes then rinse with warm water.</li>
            <li>Boyfriend described the brightness of our skin afterwards as &amp;#34;from night to day.&amp;#34; He really liked the tingly/tight feeling too.</li>
            <li>I liked this product a lot.</li>
            <li>Apply moisturizer (any kind) I am using coconut oil for my oily skin.</li>
            <li>but it sure feels good.</li>
            <li>I had no redness or any kind of reaction</li>
            <li>I used it at my own risk and so should you.</li>
            <li>After rinsing this off my face with warm water, I washed with my L&#x27;Oreal RevitaLift Radiant Smoothing cleanser and then applied my AcneFree 3-in-1 Night Repair Foam and my Neutrogena Firming Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen so many good ratings about this item, so I made the order.  </li>
            <li>Everyone should own this stuff.</li>
            <li>I tried mixing my clay powder with just some warm water in a bowl with a spoon.</li>
            <li>I just use 1 time a week for 10 minutes and it works nicely...</li>
            <li>we both really liked it.</li>
            <li>we both really liked how it made our skin look...</li>
            <li>Use warm water to remove-</li>
            <li>i honestly think this product needs to be a staple in every girls \\&quot;bag of stuff\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why others liked it.</li>
            <li>After thoroughly removing this from my face with warm cloth then a toner all my products absorb quite nicely.</li>
            <li>I put a nice layer on.</li>
            <li>The absolute best clay mask I have ever tried!</li>
            <li>It feel good after use it in my first time make my skin beautiful and shine</li>
            <li>Rub in well and let it set for five minutes then remove with a warm, damp face cloth.</li>
            <li>This product and water is plenty on its own.  </li>
            <li>The excess keeps nicely in the fridge.</li>
            <li>Excellent, overnight resolution of any smaller inflammations and great for blackheads too.  </li>
            <li>Warm water on a towel to take the mask off helps a lot too.</li>
            <li>I also use a thicker mask and again, I felt a noticeable tingle and tightening, but not the kind of tightening you get from drug store masks, where it tightens because it&#x27;s drying you out.  </li>
            <li>and I can honestly say I have seen an improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I washed it off with a warm towel</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>/&gt;The absolute best way to mix this is by adding apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for great products I never see in stores!!</li>
            <li>; It honestly did nothing at all for/against my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>no harm done.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it will work wonders for others, but it honestly did nothing for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having said that, I use the clay as a weekly treatment and even though the directions instruct mixing with water or apple cider vinegar, I prefer to use Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li>I love it - works really good</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It makes my face look nice every time i use it</li>
            <li>Love this mask make my face feel really good</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice but not gonna lie</li>
            <li>So make sure every time you use it, you replace the good to build your skin up.  </li>
            <li>I found that the absolute best results were to use the clay before you shower at night, then after you get out of the shower, when your skin is warm, use the cream.  </li>
            <li>It gets absorbed so much better and the results are the best.  </li>
            <li>I made my own foundation powder with it, and now my daughter it using the clay itself for a clay mask to treat acne, and she loves it.</li>
            <li>Let the mixture sit as a mask on my face for about 15 minutes and then washed the mixture off with warm water and a washcloth.</li>
            <li>but I liked it</li>
            <li>I have tried it with water and with warm milk with equally nice results.</li>
            <li>Really nice face mask, although I thought it was a mixture already made up, it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>This brand is the more popular one, good cost for the amount and effective.</li>
            <li>To prevent clogging my drains, I take a bowl of warm water and dip a towel into it for removal.  </li>
            <li>I would gladly buy this again, or gift it to a friend or loved one.</li>
            <li>part of why it is effective is because of its aluminum</li>
            <li>to each their own.</li>
            <li>Had I known this product was so effective on sunburn</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s really finicky about her make-up and is always searching for the best setting powder.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s kind of tingling and feels like its working.</li>
            <li>Warm water and a wash cloth will do the trick.</li>
            <li>I saw this on youtube heard so many good things about it.</li>
            <li>I leave on for about 20-25 minutes and rinse off with warm water.</li>
            <li>I tried it 3 times and after removing the mask each time I would use a cotton pad to swipe on some Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of a process</li>
            <li>I dilute mine with a bit of warm water, I found it to burn my face.  </li>
            <li>I keep plastic forks handy to minimize lumps.</li>
            <li>I use a washcloth soaked in warm water to start loosening it</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving the results I get.</li>
            <li>so this is a nice change of pace.</li>
            <li>I grew up using the Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque and loved it until I discovered this magical stuff.  </li>
            <li>I am sure some of the stuff it remove from the skin are good things.</li>
            <li>When I read the reviews for this products, I was honestly convinced by the fellow who wrote his review as an honest advertisement.</li>
            <li>I told her to take a tablespoon of the Aztec Clay and mix it with water, juice or whatever she liked and drink it before it congealed.  </li>
            <li>Then wash it off with warm water.</li>
            <li>I started off with warm water as instructed</li>
            <li>After hearing so many good things about this mask, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Still no improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Giving it 3 stars because it still feels nice</li>
            <li>Which is kind of what it&#x27;s supposed to do at the beginning.</li>
            <li>Kind of a pain to do and requires some work,</li>
            <li>Wife liked it.</li>
            <li>When I started to use this mask once a week on the weekends I saw that they didn&#x27;t come out on their own, so I had to use a tool to extract it</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great prices!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much of the clay for your face so definitely an awesome value.</li>
            <li>already so I liked the idea that I could mix it with this mask.</li>
            <li>I have to say it&#x27;s taken me a few uses to perfect the amount of vinegar to clay ratio, so you would have to try what&#x27;s best for you.</li>
            <li>This is not a mask you use to relax, this is the kind of mask that means business.</li>
            <li>I dab my face with a warm washcloth, filling a basin with water, and try to get the majority of it off there</li>
            <li>It really is the best way to mix it...</li>
            <li>your smoother, tighter, pore-less skin!a zip-lock type bag and THANKS to that awesome tip</li>
            <li>It really is the best way to mix it...</li>
            <li>I liked it .</li>
            <li>Packaged good will order more</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t get a nice layer on.</li>
            <li>I use this with warm water to remove.</li>
            <li>You can make your own recipes, do what you want.</li>
            <li>I also use rose water afterwards</li>
            <li>Washing it off is kind of a pain though.</li>
            <li>use a face towel with warm water.</li>
            <li>I mostly use Paula&#x27;s Choice products and try to practice good skin care rules (like Np smoking,</li>
            <li>I waited 25 minutes and rinsed it off with warm water.</li>
            <li>I honestly didnt think it would be so effective since I have used every treatment under the sun</li>
            <li>But more water was actually good.</li>
            <li>good product love it.</li>
            <li>It is especially useful for people who struggle with acne.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t find it anything spectacular.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;LAVENDER - Soothing and softening, lavender is not just good for your skin, but a couple of drops will also mask the overwhelming scents of apple cider vinegar, tea tree and/or neem</li>
            <li>I use this to make my own glamglow mask dupe.</li>
            <li>I like that because I can create my own consistency.</li>
            <li>I stumbled upon this product while looking for petal rose witch hazel and cannot believe I haven&#x27;t heard about it before.</li>
            <li>, honestly I don&#x27;t see no difference in my skin</li>
            <li>When I saw this product and its great reviews, I figured, &amp;#34;why not try it?&amp;#34; After only one use, I&#x27;m really impressed.</li>
            <li>Or better yet, invest in a good micro-dermabrasion brush</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s nice as well.</li>
            <li>Loved it more with the vinegar.  </li>
            <li>But honestly I think it works well on any skin type.</li>
            <li>i just use warm water and a face cloth...</li>
            <li>The biggest draw for me though is honestly just the value.</li>
            <li>thayer&#x27;s witch hazel rose</li>
            <li>have nice skin (from what I’m told) but</li>
            <li>I can tell this product will be good to make my face look :)</li>
            <li>Also recommend getting a lotion that has nice herbs in it</li>
            <li>Kind of iffy if you ask me.</li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>It was wonderful, just tablespoon was all you needed for your whole face.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget to use nice skin lotion and serum after this.</li>
            <li>If you want to be more precise and match the ideal pH of the skin, you could always use pH strips to test your mixture.</li>
            <li>I hop in the shower and let the warm water take the mask off for me.</li>
            <li>nice product</li>
            <li>Use this to make my own tooth powder.</li>
            <li>so I am going to devise my own treatments.</li>
            <li>but I think all kinds of clay mask can have this kind of effect.</li>
            <li>I think this clay powder makes a nice face mask couple times a week when you want to pamper yourself.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice mask,</li>
            <li>ACV is SO good for your skin and it just helps heal it so much better than water.</li>
            <li>I was kind of scared to try vinegar again</li>
            <li>In the mornings, I rinse with warm water, then use witch hazel as a toner.</li>
            <li>so I was kind of concerned about getting this as a starter</li>
            <li>I would tried to savor it because i don&#x27;t have much money to buy another one but who knows :D</li>
            <li>and it foamed and made a nice foamy paste to paint on with a brush.</li>
            <li>It might come in handy then.</li>
            <li>But because I find that using ginger on my face as asks is just as effective .</li>
            <li>To avoid some of this irritation, when you go to take the mask off, try using a warm washcloth and pressing it to your face to soften the clay.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;this is my honest experience with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>kind of a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I honestly am so grateful I found this when I did…</li>
            <li>would give it 5 stars, but i&#x27;d like to wait and see if it continues to work effectively.</li>
            <li>i have sugested to all my firemds to own n</li>
            <li>It kind of clumps to the face.  </li>
            <li>The mask did itch while it was on and was a bit of a challenge to get on without a brush of some kind.</li>
            <li>I use it to make my own toothpaste, face powder and as a face mask.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done a bunch of research on good &#x27;ol google which helped me to understand it better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done a bunch of research on good &#x27;ol google which helped me to understand it better.</li>
            <li>It seems to work quite well, and i&#x27;m entertained with my own antics.</li>
            <li>I do recommend as others that you wipe off the clay with warm water instead of wash off in sink.  </li>
            <li>I did feel a nice pulsing and didnt mind the redness since it went away after i applied lotion.</li>
            <li>Washed it off with warm water</li>
            <li>I have tried every prescription, and over the counter product there is, and I can honestly say that nothing has truly ever worked for me.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>Has a nice tingly feeling.</li>
            <li>after rinsing with warm washcloths or jumping in the shower your skin should be all prepped to do some extractions.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;3)1 teaspoon of apple cider (acv)&lt;br /&gt;4)3 teaspoons of warm water</li>
            <li>(so make sure you have a good moisturizer once you wash it off).</li>
            <li>I have know idea how it could have gotten so many good reviews.</li>
            <li>Just use warm water and maybe a wash cloth.</li>
            <li>&amp; also my face doesn&#x27;t warm up or pulsate from it like everyone else</li>
            <li>I am told I have nice skin already</li>
            <li>Rinse with warm water and remove with washcloth.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s kind of a hustle having to prepare it</li>
            <li>the result is Good and Amazing:)</li>
            <li>With warm water and paper towels it did come off in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use the clarisonic brush and warm water since it works well.</li>
            <li>You can honestly feel your face pulsing as it hardens.</li>
            <li>Nice clay mask for bi weekly treatment.</li>
            <li>I am a beautician and I have seen and used plenty of products on all skin types, including my own.</li>
            <li>Mix feelings; nice texture</li>
            <li>...make sure you use plenty of good moisturizer after you remove the mask.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I haven&#x27;t thought of just mixing my own clay masks at home before.</li>
            <li>I liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>My skin looks really, really nice.</li>
            <li>A good manual for the specifics of using this clay would have been more beneficial, as in measurements for a face mask and some tips for blending the clay with water.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m honestly amazed.  </li>
            <li>Also use this moisturizer, Its Popular in my country of Peru, Called &amp;#34;Portugal Concha De Nacar&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Breakout, pore size, and redness have been losing their fight on my face and I am so thrilled.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had this kind of reaction to any mud masks before.    </li>
            <li>have found the mask to be extremely effective in cleaning my pores.</li>
            <li>I am loving it.</li>
            <li>and I just haven&#x27;t had the good results that so many people have had.  </li>
            <li>Made my skin feel nice.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for something that would be effective in that area.  </li>
            <li>Loving this clay mask.  </li>
            <li>Kind of nice and relaxing.</li>

            <li>I love love love this mask!!</li>
            <li>Its cheap and very effective clarifying mask.</li>
            <li>but it does a great job and your face feels so nice and clean after.</li>
            <li>The mask is great, but the logistics of mixing and clean up is kind of a pain in the arse.&lt;br /&gt;Meh.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m honestly really happy and excited about this masque.</li>
            <li>It is very affordable and very effective!</li>
            <li>My original choice will remain my go-to product as I am happy with it,</li>
            <li>the first couple times I used it I think it did make my skin break out more, but I think it was just the &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34; because now my skin is the best it&#x27;s ever been!</li>

            <li>But it give a great clean feeling.</li>

            <li>Great product, it leaves your skin feeling soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li>It is easy to rinse off and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>As an esthetician with more than 20 years experience, I can tell you that this is an exceptional mask.  </li>
            <li>Nothing Exceptional or magical  ..</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, however it is very strong.</li>
            <li>Taking it off with warm water was very easy...</li>
            <li>I found that while pimples weren&#x27;t exactly popping out of my face, the mask did do a very good job of purifying my skin OVER TIME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this and the price is excellent.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this wonderful product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I had high expectations for this product after seeing the excellent reviews.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m honestly quite impressed at this product drawing out all the impurities and it most certainly feels like it does that.</li>
            <li>Works great and arrived right on time!</li>
            <li>I used this product 5 out of 7 days my first week and it brought out an incredible amount of gunk.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased and would recommend it :).</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m so incredibly relieved I was willing to give this mask a shot.  </li>
            <li>cheap and effective!  </li>
            <li>Excellent product, super fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li>and my pores were clean!!</li>
            <li>I always feel flawless after using this mask, it will leave your skin looking brand new.</li>
            <li>After about 10 minutes, rinsed with warm water and 99% of all impurities were gone, my face felt smooth and bright.</li>
            <li>Great stuff... leaves my incomparably skin smooth for days, and helps prevent breakouts!</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and I have an amazing glow :D</li>
            <li>Also, while this clay is awesome, you still need to figure out the root cause of your acne and get on a healthy skin care and diet routine to really combat any skin issues.</li>
            <li>skin isn&#x27;t perfect, but it is a whole lot better.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on easily, it doesn&#x27;t feel good</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply and felt good after putting on.  </li>
            <li>My skin looked so smooth, revitalized, fresh and happy!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think peeling it off is a good or healthy idea as I would think it more damaging that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess I was expecting more based on so many good reviews...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good but for me the apple cider vinegar was too strong had to use aloe Vera juice</li>
            <li>You can easily remove a good chunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also works great for the quick redness/acne overnight spot treatment when you see one popping up.</li>
            <li>It works super great.  </li>
            <li>Probably the thing I&#x27;m most impressed with, though, is that it does not seem to be drying out my very prone-to-dryness skin.</li>
            <li>I have a brown tanned face, I tan very easily</li>
            <li>my face dries out very easily</li>
            <li>While using the apple cider vinegar it was very easy to mix.</li>
            <li>Very easy to mix.  </li>
            <li>To me the mask washed off very easily..</li>
            <li>It comes off very easily then.</li>
            <li>This is a very strong powder not a cream.</li>
            <li>Very strong.</li>
            <li>Very easy to burn your face.</li>
            <li>The clay mixes very easily with the vinegar</li>
            <li>Very strong pulling sensation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used anything like it, it&#x27;s very strong.</li>
            <li>and it was very easy to apply and to wipe off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Application was very easy to both my face and my hair.</li>
            <li>so I hyper pigment very easily.  </li>
            <li>Its very easy to use.and</li>
            <li>But the more iv used it the better results I see!</li>
            <li>It has many, many uses for it: including body wraps!</li>
            <li>Yesterday was the first time using this and loved it!</li>
            <li>Pretty good mask!</li>
            <li>Just in the very first application, it&#x27;s wiped out a ton (but not all) of my blackheads, tightened my pores, and given my skin a great tone.</li>
            <li>i have used it three times and each time my skin has gotten better and better!</li>
            <li>Use your favorite, most nourishing skin cream afterwards, and your skin will soak it up!</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li>Pretty good!</li>
            <li>i think this is my first good review in 5 years!</li>
            <li>I know that a mask is not going to do miracles like they all advertise but for a good, pampering self-induced spa night, this is a fine choice.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so smooth and feels so clean!!!</li>
            <li>And super cheap uet extremely effective !!</li>
            <li>Geez was I one happy camper after I used this for the first time!  </li>
            <li>Geez was I one happy camper after I used this for the first time!  </li>
            <li>Great item, exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>LOL  jokes on her because after a month of using this once a week my face is so clean and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>So happy love it on my face and hair feels so clean after using the.</li>
            <li>For sure it was just going to take a regimen to clean out those pores (yes clay does swell greatly in water, and when it dries, it can pull in moisture, oils, organics from its surroundings.</li>
            <li>But it is very good for your skin, so I breathed through my mouth the whole time.  </li>
            <li>very good product just as described, thanks</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re very fair skinned be ready for that, but no need for alarm.</li>
            <li>the powder is fine and can fly all over), for an excellent drawing facial mask, I have applied to my body in the shower as a &#x27;mud bath&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This natural calcium bentonite clay is especially great for oily skin.</li>
            <li>So far the best benefit this clay has given</li>
            <li>It is by far the best clay mask I have ever used.</li>
            <li>:) Even my hubs used it with me and liked it.</li>
            <li>if the results prove to be more than a non harmful mask-- just not as effective as they claim.</li>
            <li>it seems to calm the inflammation, diminishes the look of the pores, and feels great.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a great product and worth giving it a shot.</li>
            <li>Amazing product, there is so many diy mask you can make with this miracle product</li>
            <li>Suitable for problematic skin and also maintaining a beauty regimen.</li>
            <li>So a believe and a non believe is sold on this amazing pore shrinking, CHEAP product!CHEAP product!</li>
            <li>I researched a lot of products and saw this and thought, it&#x27;s cheap and has a lot of good reviews, why not try it?</li>
            <li>this by far is the best treatment for it.</li>
            <li>I suggest using it twice a week for near flawless skin!</li>
            <li>i splashed warm water and with my fingers adn adding more water it washed off..</li>
            <li>This makes your face feel nice and smooth!</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>After rinsing it off most of the products I apply kind of burn.</li>
            <li>Fun to do and works great.</li>
            <li>And this by far is the best face mask!</li>
            <li>But its fun to use lol.</li>
            <li>For the price- this is the best thing I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>a guaranteed customer from now own, infact I might go ahead and stock up:)</li>
            <li>Wow - this stuff is great!  </li>
            <li>okay liked this product but didn&#x27;t know I had to mix it myself.</li>
            <li>Amazing Product :) Helped My Skin After One Use.</li>
            <li>Wow, so impressed.</li>
            <li>I immediately realized I would need a lot more water to loosen up the clay, so I did end up hanging my head over the tub rinsing with warm water and my hands.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look like a fairy waved her wand and made all my blemishes go away, but my face is smooth, and the bumpy clogged pores I had everywhere have shrunk a good deal.</li>
            <li>By far the best acne product I have tried.</li>
            <li>it shrinks my pores and gives my skin a nice healthy glow.</li>
            <li>because it is the best all natural anti-aging cream I have found, it&#x27;s oil based, so it gives your skin what it needs and doesn&#x27;t encourage over production of oil.  </li>
            <li>When your skin is warm from the shower, it absorbs the anti-aging cream even better.  </li>
            <li>I have tried hundreds of masque&#x27;s for my skin and this is by far the best one I have ever used!</li>
            <li>This is awesome i have clear skin now</li>
            <li>Give your face atleast 5 days before using this again, it works more effectively.</li>
            <li>so your face doesn&#x27;t feel dry.&lt;br /&gt;This is a really great product and definitely worth the try.</li>
            <li>A good daily cleanser (acne.org has a great one), a good exfoliator in between mud applications (anything with a variety of skin acids like glycolic, lactic, citric, malic, etc - pH of 4.5-5), mud once or twice a week, and oil/moisturizer every day is working wonders for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love aveeno night cream, the soy is amazing for it.</li>
            <li>WOW I am so impressed.</li>
            <li>I feel refreshed and cleansed on an indescrible level, but best of all its 100% natural.</li>
            <li>So far this stuff is great!</li>
            <li>I had a nice healthy glow after using it that I didn&#x27;t get from the clay mask.  </li>
            <li>I liked this clay, it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>If you purchase, try it with apple cider vinegar, in my experience it seems to be more effective with ACV (with Mother) than with water.</li>
            <li>I have tried most of the popular acne kits/products.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe the price for one pound, I&#x27;d honestly pay more for this stuff.</li>
            <li>It takes away all of the excess oil and dries out all the acne, leaving my skin wonderful feeling and clear.  </li>
            <li>i wish my face was bright and smooth</li>
            <li>as far as masks go, the best one i have ever used.</li>
            <li>By far thee best mask I have ever used.</li>
            <li>know since it&#x27;s cheap &amp; there are a lot of good reviews</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my skin feel wonderful and helps clear out my pores.  </li>
            <li>It COMPLETELY removed all the stubborn blackheads from the creases of my nose, and that is a wonderful feeling.</li>
            <li>Natural is allways the best way, you can literally feel this mask sucking the dirt out of your pores</li>
            <li>just try it once yet, it feels smooth after i wash it away from my face, hope it as good as it writes</li>
            <li>This is by far the best mask I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely much more effective with Apple Cider Vinegar</li>
            <li>I would recommend using it with the Apple Cider Vinegar (I find it more effective).</li>
            <li>I am introducing it to more people and they are loving it as well.</li>
            <li>It works great and is powerful.</li>
            <li>By far the best mask I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I mix it with apple cider vinegar and it makes my face feel so rejuvenated, this is by far the best face mask I have ever used</li>
            <li>in all this is a great purchase and totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>Is it more effective if I use Apple cider vinegar instead?</li>
            <li>This is by far the best clay mask I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin its taken me years to perfect my cleaning regimen</li>
            <li>It works great, clears my pores and my face feels fresh.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS AMAZING</li>
            <li>Like smooth whipped cream, not lumpy like the first time :D</li>
            <li>It also helped my curls to look great right after.</li>
            <li>right after there skin looked great and the day after was glowing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the miricle solution, but is a very fine clay.</li>
            <li>it could easily create a clog!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a powder, is very fine and can get everywhere</li>
            <li>Sometimes I will use microdermabrasion afterwards (very fine grit) and a Tepezcohuite cream from ASDM Beverly Hills to moisturize.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy peasy!</li>
            <li>but this is a very finely ground powder.  </li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s a very fine powder</li>
            <li>Thank you for the very quick shipping and competitive rate!</li>
            <li>This is a jar of clay dust, very fine.</li>
            <li>Making homemade masks is so easy!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>as others have mentioned its definitely strong but it does the job!</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>I love love love it!  </li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>It cleansed our pores wonderfully, removed blackheads, and I could not stop touching my skin, it was so soft!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would strongly recommend as a mask for anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li>good things take time, and this is worth the wait!</li>
            <li>And make sure to have a very good moisturizer after because it really dries up your skin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even get anything out of it with the tool; so I am assuming my nose is &#x27;squeaky clean&#x27; !! :)</li>
            <li>Kind of excited!</li>
            <li>AND for ANY new buyers that want more information of my experience, I would be MORE than happy to help!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been perfect ever since applying this always right after a nice pore opening hot shower.</li>
            <li>Such a great value for a great product</li>
            <li>Its a great detoxing, tightening great facial mask.</li>
            <li>I have used many products but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Great value- just add water and apple cider vinegar for a great facial mask</li>
            <li>Face feels so clean so good.</li>
            <li>I would pay 10 times more for this great product, but thankfully it is super cheap!</li>
            <li>Far be it from me to not try the latest and greatest skin-oriented snake oil</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing (and yucky at the same time), but its the best way to get your pores flushed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing (and yucky at the same time), but its the best way to get your pores flushed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After two uses of this clay, my pores have shrunk significantly and my pimple rose to the top and came out!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure more results will come :) but make sure to moisturizer after you use it!</li>

            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it on my face as yet, but I will pretty soon since I&#x27;ve heard nothing but great things.&lt;br</li>

            <li>This product does exactly what it says and is a great buy.</li>
            <li>A pulsing face I have experienced for the first time by preparing 1 teaspoon clay with 2 teaspoon organic apple cider.</li>

            <li>It just seemed too good to be true.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy and gives great results.</li>
            <li>Super embarrassing!!</li>

            <li>this mask (with Apple Cider Vinegar-- i forgot to mention.. very important.</li>
            <li>My skin looks very smooth though..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m grateful for the very detailed reviews with instructions here, they are spot-on.  </li>

            <li>Very good natural mask!</li>
            <li>My pores have gotten smaller and my skin looks bright and has a beautiful glow which I get compliments about now.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t work amazingly, but cleans your face pretty good</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t try to scrub it off, just wash it off nice and easy.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t try to scrub it off, just wash it off nice and easy.</li>
            <li>I used a warm water wash cloth to rinse off the mask, and it came off easily.</li>
            <li>cleans pores super good</li>
            <li>really great, i agree with all the positive feedback.</li>
            <li>great product, I purchased it because of overwhelmingly positive reviews.</li>
            <li>After years of looking for a good mask I cant believe how cheap and easy this is.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend using apple cider vinegar to create the mixture instead of water, as it is more effective.</li>
            <li>My face felt very smooth and my pores look better already.</li>
            <li>The clay goes on very smoothly and is refreshing on the face.</li>
            <li>Good mask, the first time see the result!</li>
            <li>She has very fair, sensitive skin, as do I.  </li>
            <li>I have very fair, sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It was very good for my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I have used better masks but this mask does a great job with reducing large pores.</li>
            <li>It actually mixed very nicely into a creamy texture, and felt pleasant when I put it on my skin.  </li>
            <li>The container was huge!</li>
            <li>I could already feel a huge difference!</li>
            <li>and i already see a huge difference !</li>
            <li>it made my pores huge!</li>
            <li>and they are still huge!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would recommend using ACV to mix instead of water - it mixes MUCH better and ACV also has acne fighting properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really draws out the oils and dirt from your pores :) great mask for acne prone skin ..</li>
            <li>Recommend it ! :)</li>
            <li>and that is way more</li>
            <li>I also started putting it on the top of my hands and fingers.</li>
            <li>but this is something that I can relate to people the most.</li>
            <li>There are so many products that don&#x27;t help for people with combination skin</li>
            <li>:)e done-</li>
            <li>but this is something that I can relate to people the most.</li>
            <li>There are so many products that don&#x27;t help for people with combination skin</li>
            <li>I have to say i am so glad i did.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d love to see how that works.</li>
            <li>and you will love the improvement of your skin</li>
            <li>Make sure to use a plastic spoon and bowl to mix, not metal.</li>
            <li>Still love it.</li>
            <li>Nothing worked better for my skin, really!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m hoping that this will really be as magical as many of the reviews claim.  </li>
            <li>I have not used many face products and have abused my face by not giving it the care it needed.</li>
            <li>and I did not expect it to do wonders either, but it did do something that made me fall in love with this product.</li>
            <li>Will update my review if it does anything to the &amp;#34;experience and wisdom&amp;#34; signs on my forehead :)</li>
            <li>For me, it didn&#x27;t exfoliate my skin any better than just scrubbing my face with a washcloth.</li>
            <li>i bought it to my mom and she really love it</li>
            <li>about 12 minutes in I did feel the \\&quot;pulsating\\&quot; sensation others have mentioned, mostly around my nose and temples.  </li>
            <li>and I sure don&#x27;t want to rip it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>Make sure you wash your face before using.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad i did.  </li>
            <li>So glad I stayed up that one night and made this purchase.</li>
            <li>My mother was very happy with it because it was actually recommended by her dermatologist.</li>
            <li>This stuff is ok.</li>
            <li>A Baking soda mask worked better for my skin.</li>
            <li>Great product highly recommend it !</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but I have been able to diminish the scares that I have acquired over the years.</li>
            <li>I make sure that when I mix it with Bragg&#x27;s Organic Apple Cider that the texture is silky and whipped.</li>
            <li>so I am sure you could also use strips on your chin and forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so pleased</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I like it better than most face masks.</li>
            <li>I think it does better.</li>
            <li>I purchased the big jar and i am happy to say i will not regret it!</li>
            <li>it makes you skin so nice and smooth</li>
            <li>For me, mixing with water worked better than mixing with apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li>Also, be sure to mix well.</li>
            <li>The pimples look way better after the mask treatment.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve used much better masks that I didn&#x27;t have to spend any time mixing up</li>
            <li>I tried so many things, but nothing was helping.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Love it give it a try for the price</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about 2 months or more...</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve tried more products than I could ever count.</li>
            <li>Really, I am SO pleased.</li>
            <li>Really, I am SO pleased.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Although I didn&#x27;t purchase from Amazon, I recently purchased this at The Vitamin Shoppe, and I must say, after 2 uses, I am impressed with the &#x27;after&#x27; results.  </li>
            <li>Who wouldn&#x27;t love that??</li>
            <li>I was just better off not using it.</li>
            <li>I was just better off not using it.</li>
            <li>and I gave it so many chances</li>
            <li>Love love love this product.</li>
            <li>PUTTING IT ON: make sure to thoroughly cleanse your face.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s not coming off, that just means you need more</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s not coming off, that just means you need more</li>
            <li>I have tried so many things(OTC and prescription)</li>
            <li>I have to say that I&#x27;ve used many masks and cleaners for my face.</li>
            <li>Ok product  the mixture is lumpy when mixing with water</li>
            <li>Good &amp; economical mask.</li>
            <li>Okay,</li>
            <li>I love this clay.  </li>
            <li>You can use it many times before you even start to make a dent in the powder.</li>
            <li>Make sure to crack most of it off over a trashcan because it can clog your pipes and drains since it is clay.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>(frankly I don&#x27;t see the point of using it with water since you don&#x27;t get the satisfying pulsing effect).</li>
            <li>This product seems like it&#x27;s more for skin improvement than acne.</li>
            <li>then this will not be the magic end</li>
            <li>This is the best facial mask I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of beauty items.</li>
            <li>cleaner skin than when I go to my lovely West Hollywood spa.</li>
            <li>After taking birth control, my acne got better and stayed like that for a year.</li>
            <li>I tried so many things.</li>
            <li>But I can say for sure this helped me out.</li>
            <li>Now my acne is so much better form using it twice a week.</li>
            <li>my skin has never felt so smooth!</li>
            <li>so if you think you can handle the vinigar then you may have even better results than this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been hearing rave reviews about this product and that fact that it&#x27;s multipurpose makes it even better.  </li>
            <li>Use Apple Cider vinegar if your skin can tolerate it for better results.</li>
            <li>Great Product, fast delivery</li>
            <li>I use the Garnier Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel-Cream.</li>
            <li>I use the Garnier Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel-Cream.</li>
            <li>I love this for DYI face masks.  </li>
            <li>So this is one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li>Its just OK in my opinion.</li>
            <li>My skin does look better but it did not reduce the pores as well as I would have like.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this clay.</li>
            <li>so I was more motivated to buy</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Bentonite Indian Healing Clay.</li>
            <li>must say this is fabulous!</li>
            <li>Save 70$ or more n</li>
            <li>bought 2 more for gifts.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I am sure it probably said that in the product description, but I missed it.  </li>
            <li>I am ok with that though.  </li>
            <li>It is more like cottage cheese.  </li>
            <li>It is just ok.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>but I used it many times within a month</li>
            <li>and it never got better.</li>
            <li>So Apple cider vinegar or lemon juice is best , since both are equally acidic.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff....</li>
            <li>Love this clay will continue to use.</li>
            <li>Then I put a plastic cap on for about 20 minutes, THOROUGHLY rinsed it all out and then conditioned hair and scalp with TRESemme Naturals Nourishing Moisturizing Conditioner (my favorite).</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It cleaned my pores and my skin hasn&#x27;t looked better.</li>
            <li>I love the pulsating, tight,tingling feeling</li>
            <li>Love this for skin and hair</li>
            <li>im sure its doing the cleaning...</li>
            <li>my whole life??&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin look and feel great.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
            <li>so that’s what I used to paint the mixture on more evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so that’s what I used to paint the mixture on more evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used it for a week, every day (a lot of people said you should use it every day for a while and then magic happens.  </li>
            <li>and I love this.  </li>
            <li>Okay.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s OK, you know its working.</li>
            <li>more mud for your cleansing pleasure.</li>
            <li>I cried because I thought it would never get better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this clay.</li>
            <li>sure you mix with apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li>I still have a lot more product to go</li>
            <li>skin likes to stay more acidic</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching it.</li>
            <li>Used on all my family members and my dad fell in love. .</li>
            <li>I absolutely love giving myself this mask because it squeezes and pops pimples (if any) for me.</li>
            <li>I sure looked like an iguana.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and I will be buying more of it soon.</li>
            <li>Now, I got what I paid for and I am about to pay more since I&#x27;m meeting a skin specialist tomorrow.</li>
            <li>Bentonite Clay is perfectly safe for your drains, even if you have a septic system.</li>
            <li>and found that it is even safe for septic systems.</li>
            <li>I make sure to moisturize immediately after, then wait an hour to do</li>
            <li>and my oh my it was the BEST facial ever</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had many.</li>
            <li>allows more flushing of the drain.&lt;br /&gt;Tip</li>
            <li>I love having time to make masks.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products over the years and nothing has worked.</li>
            <li>but I know I&#x27;ll be using it twice a week because I love the way it feels.&lt;br /&gt;Update: August 8th&lt;</li>
            <li>So glad I listened to the reviews on this.  </li>
            <li>so glad now that I did.  </li>
            <li>I love how it tingles</li>
            <li>I leave it about 20 mins, as I can&#x27;t take more than that.</li>
            <li>Adjust with more clay or water as needed until you get your desired consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>The method someone suggested of mixing it in a ziplock baggy worked ok.</li>
            <li>My husband is very impressed because he had a very deep acne spot that has been hanging around for about 2 weeks going on 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>Hope to see more with repeated use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a month or more.</li>
            <li>Better than glam glow</li>
            <li>and I think this is best for internal use.</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>There are tons of uses for this product, and I plan on trying them all. :)</li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always suffered from Acne and understand it takes more than once or twice to use a product to know if it will work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to save money and go more organic or &amp;#34;from the earth&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how to remove it without getting in in the drain</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll look through more posts and see what others are doing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll look through more posts and see what others are doing.</li>
            <li>Even my favorite can&#x27;t-live-without-it products have a bell curve of opinions going on (as do the Amazon top 100 beauty sellers).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful at home clay mask, at such an affordable price.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to others :)</li>

            <li>I still get breakouts (but it&#x27;s about 2 or 3 zits instead of 20), but they are much more manageable with this in combination with proactiv.  </li>

            <li>I recommend using this once a week, twice a week at most.  </li>
            <li>If you have oily skin, it can cause your skin to produce more oil (because you are drying out your skin when you use it).</li>
            <li>Since I break out in the summer a bit, I use it twice a week, and it has helped more than anything else to keep my breakouts to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>After 1 application, I can actually see beautiful muscular features!  </li>
            <li>I put 1 tablespoon of the clay in a ziploc bag and add one tablespoon plus a smidge more of ACV (apple cider vinegar) and mix/</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s been more than 24 hours</li>
            <li>The rest of my face is more elastic.</li>
            <li>I work in construction, and am out in the florid sun most of the day</li>
            <li>i could feel my skin was so much more smoother.</li>
            <li>I love the feel it gives when it&#x27;s in the process of drying</li>
            <li>But now I am prettier than most of em.</li>
            <li>better then Proactiv Mask.</li>
            <li>This mask is ok.</li>
            <li>Nothing magical.</li>
            <li>but I feel it is making a difference for the better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it does what it says it does, but I sure do love it.</li>

            <li>The healing clay has worked well :) I&#x27;ve taken to using it once a week</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>so you may notice more breakouts to help speed this process, use it 2 days on and 1 day off until the purge is over.</li>

            <li>Best put, preventing breakouts is the ultimate goal.</li>
            <li>its a lot more of a hassle</li>
            <li>I have dyshidrotic eczema all over my hands but using this with apple cider vinegar rebalances the ph level of my skin giving it healthy vibrancy and speeds healing.</li>
            <li>I heard from many people that this can help with both.</li>
            <li>but I wish it did blackheads better.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s a wonderful staple to my overall beauty regiment.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>i recommend making sure that you use more than what the directions tell you.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many high-end products to minimize my pore like Murad, philosophy etc, but none have worked wonders like this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I was not in a hurry to go anywhere because it took 30 to 40 mins.</li>
            <li>Enter the magic clay.</li>
            <li>I came up with a formula and method I use myself, but I&#x27;m sure everyone does it differently.&lt;br</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE...</li>
            <li>but I did place product in elegant glass bottles.</li>

            <li>I read many reviews and bought this on the basis of skin clarifying, pore shrinkage, etc.  </li>

            <li>I saw  improvements in the appearance of my skin, but waited a while longer before posting a review to make sure I am satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>more acne</li>
            <li>more will I have to pick pimples (AWESOME)&lt;br /&gt;Scars are disappearing (AMAZING!)&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>people are just more vigilant about using it</li>
            <li>so it seems to work better...</li>
            <li>and I hope I haven&#x27;t screwed myself into having a zit filled picture with my students!</li>
            <li>I have also noticed my skin is much more smoother.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I love this mask.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this mask.</li>
            <li>Used as a avail mask it does leave your face very red immediately after but goes away, so best to use in the evening</li>
            <li>I like the results even better than the Proactiv mask, which was my go-to mask before this.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make it go away, but makes it look better for a day</li>
            <li>I bought this based on the reviews and I am pleased.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the next best thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this product--used it before years ago.  </li>
            <li>I have the largest pores anyone could have and many blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li>I join the rest of the hundreds out there that love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, and love it.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;pulsating\\&quot; effect more than my body can,</li>
            <li>No dealing with getting it out from under your nails or drying your cuticles. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>No dealing with getting it out from under your nails or drying your cuticles. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I like this stuff, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really that great.</li>
            <li>since I just think it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I love this stuff...</li>
            <li>and I love how I can feel it working...</li>
            <li>but I am pleasantly satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Love this mask.  </li>
            <li>I regret that I didn&#x27;t spend more for a better product.</li>
            <li>I accidentally ordered two jars.&lt;br /&gt;Toothpaste does a better job of cleaning pores.</li>
            <li>my face feels and looks better</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I am absolutely in love with this mask.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve mixed it with water and apple cider vinegar, I have to say the best mixture is with the vinegar.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>decided i&#x27;d try out a blackhead pore strip and this time the strip was filled with blackheads!</li>
            <li>Love this mask.</li>
            <li>I now have a prescription for acne that has gotten rid of most of it, but if I break out, this is still my go to product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen some mud masks try and sell for WAY more than this too</li>
            <li>Love it it reminds me of the glam glow mask but a lot cheaper</li>
            <li>i have three jars that&#x27;s how much I love it</li>
            <li>I love this clay.</li>
            <li>Ok I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Even better when you mix with some apple cider vinegar.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this cleans and tightens my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I want to love this.</li>
            <li>so I use the mask twice a week at most.</li>
            <li>If you have oily skin it will work okay for you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously magical, I love it.</li>
            <li>I am able to keep on for 15mins</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll cause more breakouts.</li>
            <li>I used Neutrogena Acne Lotion which is okay for a day or so-</li>
            <li>a cleanser works much better for before-bed routines.</li>
            <li>This is more of a morning or emergency treatment thing when you need immediate or drastic results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>This is more of a morning or emergency treatment thing when you need immediate or drastic results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great clay mask that works really well.</li>
            <li>The best way to describe the \\&quot;pulsating\\&quot; is like your pores are suffocated of oxygen and you can feel a \\&quot;heart beat\\&quot; pulse over your entire face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I LOVE this mask.</li>
            <li>yup, sure did.</li>
            <li>and I saw way more</li>
            <li>Watch this video where she talks about clay masks, I love her</li>
            <li>Best facial ever!!</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>so I am pleased with the amount.</li>
            <li>I am definitely glad I bought this and plan on using it once a week.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>but i heard many times about this mask, so i decided to buy it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t leave on for more than the time it says.</li>
            <li>ACV alone has many benefits for the skin.  </li>
            <li>, then you&#x27;ll need this more.</li>
            <li>I read that it was better to use apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>It is a fantastic mask!  </li>
            <li>I make sure that I use lots of water to rinse out the bowl and to rinse my face when finished.</li>
            <li>This has been one of the best facial healing cleansers ever made.</li>
            <li>Cleared up my skin and made it feel tighter:).</li>
            <li>This is a phenomenal product.</li>
            <li>my friend love it</li>
            <li>this stuff is greater</li>
            <li>But my face does feel really smooth after I take it off!</li>
            <li>The smell is okay.</li>
            <li>It does not smell like you are in a field of flowers or surrounded by mangoes like most beauty products do, but I am okay with that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love witch hazel.</li>
            <li>If that doesn’t work, I will gladly reorder this</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so SMOOTH!</li>
            <li>I also love all the benefits it has.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure by now we all know the lovely product that is coconut oil.</li>
            <li>Even longer if you take better care of them.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of varieties of different ingredients added to the sponges, so I am sure you can find one that works best for your skin.</li>

            <li>I love it..</li>
            <li>I love when it tightens  on your face.</li>
            <li>Magical.</li>
            <li>If you know what you&#x27;re doing, it&#x27;s ok, I guess.</li>
            <li>My skin feels great and you really do see a difference</li>
            <li>Be sure to put a paper towel over your sink so the clay doesn&#x27;t clog your sink.</li>
            <li>BEST FACIAL MASK EVER:</li>
            <li>Glad that i purchased.</li>
            <li>2 more times I saw the difference.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m basically acne free!</li>
            <li>love saving money on this.</li>
            <li>I love this mask.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for anything - cleaner skin, a refreshing feeling, clearing up of pores, etc.</li>
            <li>I use apple cider vinegar, the smell takes time to get used to but does make my skin feel better after.  </li>
            <li>it works better than any acne medicine i have ever used.</li>
            <li>This mask is more drying than any clay mask I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>Way better than any prescription I&#x27;ve ever been prescribed.</li>
            <li>Bentonite clay plus apple cider vinegar equals the best facial you have ever!!  </li>
            <li>i love this face mask.</li>
            <li>I tried it once and fell in love</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will also bring up dirt under skin that u didn&#x27;t know was there, thus creating more pimples in the beginning phase of use.</li>
            <li>Am looking forward to using more frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>but I also am pleased with the Amazonian clay mask, and will update this review of the results continue to impress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and they have all fallen in love with it as well.  </li>
            <li>My skin varies in degree of acne depending on my cycle, so when it is really problematic, this stuff is great to have on hand.</li>
            <li>skin look more healthy</li>
            <li>the more you use it the cleaner your pores will be</li>
            <li>In an attempt to save my sanity my boyfriend purchased this for me, and I gotta say that I love him so much more for it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it keeps my face from being so oily(which</li>
            <li>The texture of my skin appeared more even and my pores even looked</li>
            <li>I tried this because someone said it was better than glam</li>
            <li>I will order more just incase they run out, increase price or discontinue.</li>
            <li>Skin is looking OK..</li>
            <li>It feels like all the blood is rushed to the skin and is refreshed and healthy</li>
            <li>There are much better products out there.  </li>
            <li>Since I have an entire container of this product, I may try it again, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed nor</li>
            <li>I woke up the next morning and my skin looked great!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with my skin...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it more than once or twice a week.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It can be a bit drying, so make sure you moisture after.</li>
            <li>but I kept wanting to love it</li>
            <li>I really, really enjoyed this face mask.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more for presents to family and friends</li>
            <li>I love it, definetly tightens skin.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>I love how immediate the results are with this product.</li>
            <li>it was much more noticeable that my pores were smaller.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>now 3 weeks later it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>go youtube and search for this product, there are many videos shown how to do the mask.  </li>
            <li>You can even add a drop of tea tree oil (if it doesn&#x27;t irritate you) for more anti-bacterial effect.</li>
            <li>anyways im sure its nothing to worry about.</li>
            <li>then i apply my favorite cream or honey...</li>
            <li>but after using this item, i feel better.</li>
            <li>This stuff works some magic on your skin.</li>
            <li>And prevents more acne.</li>
            <li>so I rinse into a wash bucket, but I&#x27;ve read if you&#x27;re just doing it once a week it should be ok.</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t find it to be any better for producing &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>So glad I got it.</li>
            <li>I love the way it tightens and makes my face pulsate.</li>
            <li>too many friends to count have commented as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After most of it has come off my face</li>
            <li>skin looks radiant and healthy,</li>
            <li>what more could a girl ask for?</li>
            <li>Best facial mask I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>The next 1-2 days after using it is when I saw the best results</li>
            <li>and my skin is defiantly more evenly toned.</li>
            <li>and I never had more then like 5 zits at once.</li>
            <li>thats okay.  </li>
            <li>gives me more blackheads....</li>
            <li>but this is much better than nothing at all.</li>
            <li>She still prefers glam glow, but I prefer this because you get  SO MUCH MORE.</li>
            <li>Most of the reviews here address talk about the clay&#x27;s effectiveness for facials; I have never used it for that purpose but know it instead as a healing</li>
            <li>have since used this many times to help relieve pain associated with bumps and bruises and would recommend this stuff to anyone.</li>
            <li>So many mask don&#x27;t seem to do anything while drying, but this isn&#x27;t one of those.  </li>
            <li>I picked up mine at WFM but am glad to see it on here.</li>
            <li>It does froth, but it makes a nice smooth mask.</li>
            <li>Its so cheap, too!</li>
            <li>Its so cheap, too!</li>
            <li>and I have tried many skin products over the years...</li>
            <li>It works even better the longer you use it, so be patient.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I feel like I am breaking out more since using this product.  </li>
            <li>I am hoping that with more use over time this product will do what it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m glad it worked for them</li>
            <li>Be sure you mix the clay with apple cider vinegar instead of water to prevent clumping.  </li>
            <li>You will feel your skin responds to them better.</li>
            <li>There are SO many grammatical errors in the discription</li>
            <li>Worked much better.</li>
            <li>I love how this makes my face and hair feel.</li>
            <li>I always make sure I have time for my face to &amp;#34;calm down&amp;#34; before going out and follow with an all-natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>better to use closer to bedtime..</li>
            <li>just mix up 1 part clay powder, 1 part ACV, and add water as needed to reach the desired consistency (make sure to not use anything metal as it will react with the chemical properties of the clay</li>
            <li>Mixed with vinegar, it is the best face mask I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>mostly dries (</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning a girl&#x27;s night in spa night with my lady friends soon :)</li>
            <li>I love love LOVE this.</li>
            <li>, it does not mix that we&#x27;ll with water,  but mixes better with apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li>I have never used a deep cleanser that makes my skin feel this incredible!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m cheap!)</li>
            <li>I give four stars because I need to use more.</li>
            <li>This clay is literally magic in a jar.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love this mask.</li>
            <li>Then after most of it&#x27;s off I take my shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this mask.</li>
            <li>Love it for acne control.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>but its making me break out more then ever.</li>
            <li>Make up stays better.  </li>
            <li>I guess I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect</li>
            <li>ok :) It also mixes better than water does with the clay.</li>
            <li>The ACV makes it into a better mask in my opinion.</li>
            <li>and it becomes more bearable.</li>
            <li>So spend the $9, &amp; give it a try! :-)</li>
            <li>Love this clay.</li>
            <li>more time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>more time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I thought adding vinegar to the mix might make my skin drier and irritate it more.</li>
            <li>it says you can use it more a week if yoy have problrms.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve waited like a month to see improvement and each day I would wake with more break outs.</li>
            <li>I love how I feel after I remove it from my face</li>
            <li>Rinsing off was the most challenging</li>
            <li>I am sure there are more uses for it as well.</li>
            <li>I hope as I continue using it I will see better results.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>OK experience, but</li>
            <li>Remember that you are supposed to use this with ACV not water, ACV is great for your skin so the combination of these two really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE....</li>
            <li>I am so glad I purchased this product because it is heaven sent.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do water because I feel it provides me with more results if I do it with Apple Vinegar Cider.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clearer and more radiant for sure.</li>
            <li>Oh well, I have more than I need for a while.</li>
            <li>I LOVE MY JAR OF DIRT</li>
            <li>Do not be deceived by its price because the product is better than that.</li>
            <li>I even tried it on my boyfriend and his skin got better.</li>
            <li>and I figured it made more sense to buy something with the $7.00 that otherwise would have gone to non-free shipping.</li>
            <li>I feel my skin pulsate and all of the gunk that&#x27;s been deep within my pores comes to surface, (remove in any method you find best)</li>
            <li>Plus for the most part is helps to control acne breakouts.</li>
            <li>It has a tightening effect for sure.</li>
            <li>Love this product, arrived on time.</li>
            <li>I love this clay mask.</li>
            <li>I love love this clay.</li>
            <li>My mom loves it as well:)</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been many years since I have written a review here</li>
            <li>and I always get compliments when I go out after using it :)</li>
            <li>it works wonders on problem skin :)</li>
            <li>My skin was smoother &amp; looked more radiant.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>My acne is going away :)</li>
            <li>(I use a designated makeup fan brush) let semi-dry then add one more layer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite the bumpy start, I love this clay for my masks.</li>
            <li>If you didn&#x27;t have luck with this clay, I would suggest changing the liquid you used to mix it. :)</li>
            <li>Overall I am very impressed.</li>
            <li>Mixing with apple cider as suggested is like a science experiment, making it more &amp;#34;guy-friendly&amp;#34; to my husband.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this mask</li>
            <li>I love this mask.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than the many creams and cleaners my dermatologist gave me.  </li>
            <li>This is simply the best there is.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended this product, and I thought, well, sure.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up purchasing something from The Body Shop, which worked a bit better (for me).</li>
            <li>Be sure not to put it too close to your eyes.  </li>
            <li>bottom line i love this.</li>
            <li>and i do see a difference in using it 1 time.. :)</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Make sure you have apple cider vinegar as the instructions tell you to mix it with it.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with product</li>
            <li>Just make sure to have apple cider vinegar on hand to mix.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this mask.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>This product is outstanding.</li>
            <li>A ok</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s better to do this when you&#x27;re planning to stay in for the night.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this clay for myself as well as my parents whom both love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product, have used it for years &amp; will continue.  </li>
            <li>My skin has never been better and my wrinkles have magically decreased&lt;br</li>
            <li>And you can use rosewater that you can purchase on Amazon, and I&#x27;ve heard that it works even better with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love this alternative to shampoo. :-)</li>
            <li>so I safely popped them as well.</li>
            <li>so I could examine my skin better.</li>
            <li>so I could examine my skin better.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>Will recommend this for sure.</li>
            <li>Best facial product i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Much better for my house drain to rinse</li>
            <li>I had no problem mixing it but ended up needing more Apple Cider Vinegar than the recommended ratio of 1:1.</li>
            <li>I also was able to peel off some areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>ok Im not gonna lie to you guys/</li>
            <li>then safe bet to say that proactiv  does not work for you...</li>
            <li>I clumps up a lot with water, the vinegar works better with it.</li>
            <li>but there are MUCH better clay masks out there for purchase that are easier &amp; more convenient to apply and won&#x27;t strip all the moisture from your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>glad I got this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I use bentonite clay for so many things, from aiding in digestion, to pore cleansing masks, and bath soaks, tooth powder, etc.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;ve found that applying the mud with a paintbrush to my face and neck makes the thickness more uniform all over</li>
            <li>and I can already see a healthy difference in my skin (face).</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions that many people have posted, did my research</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to extract them with a tool.  </li>
            <li>my pores are too sexy.</li>
            <li>So many babies.</li>
            <li>me and my wife do mud mask Mondays and this makes our skin feel soo much better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve never used a product that did more for my skin than this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>figure out how more people don&#x27;t know about this stuff, and why something so HOLY GRAIL caliber is so darn</li>
            <li>, when I am in the mood for a more cooling type of mask, I add 1 or 2 drops of tea tree oil to my mixture.  </li>
            <li>Also, when I am in the mood for a more cooling type of mask, I add 1 or 2 drops of tea tree oil to my mixture.  </li>

            <li>Mix with vinegar, love the feeling and skin feels refreshed.</li>
            <li>If your acne is an issue, you would be much better off consulting your family doctor or dermatologist.</li>

            <li>I love this clay.</li>
            <li>and I apply a thicker layer to areas where I break out most or where my pores are the largest.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I cannot begin to express how satisfied I am with this product.</li>
            <li>I think most people use it about once a week</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a product that works better than this.</li>
            <li>and I often have to wait a week or more for the acne to go away.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love to drink a lot of water, but I am determined to make my skin look</li>
            <li>Well this is a no brainer - eat healthy most of the time.</li>

            <li>Like I said, the mask itself isn&#x27;t drying, but the oils have healing properties that work magic while you sleep.</li>
            <li>I do not even need to do so, but I have read many people do so.</li>
            <li>:)ask on until it dries...not the label that says 15-20 mins...usually takes me about 45 to an hour.</li>
            <li>I do not even need to do so, but I have read many people do so.</li>

            <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>However, I think it does make it a bit better.</li>
            <li>I will try to remember to leave the update after using it for more months in case someone is reading my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now I know for sure it does work</li>
            <li>Now I know for sure it does work</li>
            <li>Make sure you mix with apple cider vinegar, not water.  </li>
            <li>Love this face mask.  </li>
            <li>I have never had a cheap mask to do that, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>I prefer vinegar because I feel it works better this way.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to follow up with an oil to help replace the oils that are lost after using this product.</li>
            <li>Most people who get stung here in Panama suffer for days.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>IT SAID IT WOULD TRIED IT AND LOVE THE RESULTS</li>
            <li>Best facial ever.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>I use this about once a week and after using it my skin feels and looks so much better.</li>
            <li>but I will update when I use it more than once.</li>
            <li>The smell is not \\&quot;spa\\&quot; like as it&#x27;s more of a dirt smell, but not over the top or anything.</li>
            <li>I found this mask in an organic, all-natural grocery co-op and thought it was my magic.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use vinegar, I just used water, but I will try vinegar and see if it is better.</li>
            <li>Thank you!! :-)</li>
            <li>and I am SO pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>The mask is very penetrating and has helped me greatly with cystic acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so pleased that I kept it because it has been a life saver.</li>
            <li>It is a bit drying, so be sure to be generous with the moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li>and it makes that mask feel that much better.</li>
            <li>Mostly by helping my acne (which consist mostly of blackheads) to surface quicker and extracting them out easier.</li>
            <li>With that said, there&#x27;s then something about this clay mask that has surely made a difference even though I seem to be doing everything else that would help prevent my acne.</li>
            <li>I think this product works for the most part.</li>
            <li>Not an overnight miracle, but I feel confident my skin will improve over time with usage.</li>
            <li>; too :-)</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>my skin feels better and cleaner after using it.</li>
            <li>Ehh, this product is okay.</li>
            <li>I love the way it draws out all the impurities from your face.</li>
            <li>Love love love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Works much better.</li>
            <li>Love this product, works wonders.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally in love with this mask.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it..</li>
            <li>Great product and really fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I love this mask.</li>
            <li>Everyone in my family is now in love with this stuff and always want me to mix some up for them when they come over.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love how I feel after I wash it off</li>
            <li>/&gt;After removing the clay I noticed my skin was smooth, and the white/black heads around my nose were gone!</li>
            <li>I need to work on making it better, yet it&#x27;s more convenient to buy masks that are already premixed.</li>
            <li>Of course those may include more chemicals and ingredients, so</li>
            <li>Make sure you use it with vineager.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I mix it with either water, apple cider vinegar, or my favorite tea tree oil</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>Dr. Bronners castile soap has been better to remove pimples on my face.</li>
            <li>This product is the best facial I ever used!!!!!  </li>
            <li>, it is an awesome product and it will last you forever.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this clay.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite face mask.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Many acne products and face masks can cause Seb Derm flare ups.</li>
            <li>However, in the morning my skin feels and looks so much better.</li>
            <li>my complexion does look better after i use this.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a product that was non-toxic and would be more of an all-in-one face mask.  </li>
            <li>the better the results.  </li>
            <li>do have a couple tips though that make this product more</li>
            <li>I get better results when I do.&lt;br /&gt;4)  </li>
            <li>It really does do a great job of clearing up my face when I use it like I&#x27;m supposed to.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re mostly benign meaning they don&#x27;t form cystic zits</li>
            <li>The minute you take the mask off your skin already feels 10x better.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell for sure, but every time I use this product I seem to breakout more.</li>
            <li>I love face masks</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s thickness and also being able to mix it with ACV</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I would definately recommend this to anyone looking for that &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; face mask. :)</li>
            <li>I even got some compliments :)</li>
            <li>Best mixed with apple cider vinegar from the health store</li>
            <li>Even better...</li>
            <li>Please make sure you dont rinse off this make in your bathroom sink as it comes off on clumps</li>
            <li>When it talks about feeling your skin pulse believe it, mine sure did.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>The vinegar has to be a kind with the &amp;#34;mother&amp;#34; in it, like Bragg&#x27;s, and not the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>More rashes now</li>
            <li>I have even taken it to a couple of my friends and they are in love with it too.</li>
            <li>but it seems that an acne sufferer can be susceptible to the many internet lores</li>
            <li>but for a month or more?</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried soooo many.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I do make sure I tone my face afterward to remove any bacteria because I broke out in acne once because I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>have been using it for many years, and love it..</li>
            <li>(I feel my face is just too oily to not wash with some form of soap), then I use the Thayers as a toner - focusing more on my problem areas and pimples.  </li>
            <li>Works better with acv, I felt a pulsation</li>
            <li>I was able to go a couple weeks with no breakout.</li>
            <li>If you want to know more</li>
            <li>just Google the caveman method, although I didn&#x27;t go without putting water on my face because I want to be able to splash my face before I go to bed or after I wake up, like my boyfriend does</li>
            <li>Mostly in my t-zone area.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great cuality.</li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>So i made the purchase and I am so glad i did, Yes it does work....</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and you will see astonishing results.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>I plan to buy more from amazon when I finish this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but after awhile my face starts to get more oily and my face is already oily</li>
            <li>Maybe after a couple more times the peeling will stop.</li>
            <li>I get better results from a healthy diet and apricot scrub.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love love love.</li>
            <li>I love the pulsing and tugging it</li>
            <li>I baught this with intentions of getting rid of acne scars, which I don&#x27;t have many, and blackheads on the nose area.</li>
            <li>I should probably use it more</li>
            <li>Even if you&#x27;re not suffering from acne, this mask has many benefits</li>
            <li>I have tried so many non-prescription and prescription medications-</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It works way better when you use it with apple cider vinegar than water.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I use it about once a week and always make sure I use a (heavier) moisturizer afterward.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend mixing with the apple cider vinegar as it has a better consistency and easier to put on your face.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li>Make sure to use a plastic bowl and spoon to stir the mixture.</li>
            <li>I tried my best to stir the mixture as well as possible, but it would still be a bit clumpy when I applied it to my face.</li>
            <li>it feels great and really tightens your pores.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly on my hair with a mixture of acv.</li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>I know it works for most people</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but I use pronexin now which worked a lot better for me</li>

            <li>/&gt;It works pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I used this mask in conjunction with Braggs ACV and I loved the way my skin felt after I used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>and i can say it does do a good job after your first use, if you are using it for acne, you might get breakouts but after that (using 2 times a week)</li>
            <li>My boyfriend even noticed how good my skin looked after I tried this for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works pretty good.</li>

            <li>best of all a lil goes a long way.</li>
            <li>and it seems to be a pretty good value.  </li>
            <li>but when I do use it WHOA my face feels amazing so tight and perfect.</li>

            <li>I am so impressed to actually find a beauty product that you can see a noticeable improvement so quickly!</li>

            <li>It makes my face super soft and beautiful after rinses it off in warm water.</li>
            <li>Which is an extra bit of work to use the product but that&#x27;s ok because the results are very nice, my face honestly feels revitalized.</li>

            <li>Since using this mask those have diminished significantly!</li>
            <li>Really excited to use this again!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try!!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li>Great for the New England change of seasons and blah skin from changing temperatures.</li>
            <li>My skin is the consistently best that it has been in a very long time, probably since using hormonal birth control (which I discontinued years ago).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to say this is a GREAT positive update.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to say this is a GREAT positive update.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say It a huge difference but the best clay masque I&#x27;ve found and especially for the price</li>
            <li>Also, this is a HUGE tub for such a great price!  </li>
            <li>This is so great for detox, I&#x27;m always left feeling amazing.</li>
            <li>The mask can leave your skin feeling a tad bit dry depending on how often you use it - great for oily skin!</li>
            <li>to the surface so it can be removed more easily.</li>
            <li>This has worked better than any product I&#x27;ve used and for easy removal</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best removed in the shower because it forms a formidable substance once dry.  </li>
            <li>I mix it with a bit of warm water and it will turn super clumpy.</li>
            <li>and when I washed it off it seemed like the forming pimples had been brought more to the surface and were easily pop-able.</li>
            <li>I use this with Bragg ACV as a mask to dry up cystic and it WORKS GREAT!!!!</li>
            <li>When it starts to dry, you can feel your skin tightening, its awesome!!!</li>
            <li>And as I said, it absorbs very quickly which I love.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful for those with acne-prone skin, dry skin and conditions like eczema.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Two years with a tub of it and still going strong :)</li>
            <li>The product came quickly and packaging was nice.</li>
            <li>and I have yet to be able to make it 100% smooth like most clay masks, which is why I gave it a 4.</li>
            <li>Shall return with fair assessment: I do believe it is the answers to my prayers in maintaining good facial contours.</li>
            <li>:) Even with my sensitive skin, this works great.</li>
            <li>so i made sure the majority went to my nose since it was the most important area to attack.</li>
            <li>I use this with Apple Cider Vinegar to make a wonderful facial mask once weekly to keep my skin free of blackheads.</li>
            <li>THANKS to that awesome tip-it made the process much easier.</li>
            <li>Work great to clear pores and leave skin healthy.</li>
            <li>It is very drying after even for more, which is good for my oily skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product and the price is more than reasonable.</li>
            <li>it was too good to be true, though it&#x27;s not bad product.</li>
            <li>This is very strong clay and will clean all your pores.</li>
            <li>, my skin feels so great afterward and my pores are so clear!</li>
            <li>Then spread on your freshly cleansed face and watch the magic happen!  </li>
            <li>leaves my face red for the first 30 minutes or so after removing it, but I can honestly say this is the best mask I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>Good mask, dries right up and leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent product at an excellent price, but it is mud, so don&#x27;t wash it down your drain unless you want to be replacing your plumbing later</li>
            <li>Very good stuff, makes my face soft , clean, even color.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling clean!</li>
            <li>leaves my skin feel clean!</li>
            <li>My pores are so clean I can&#x27;t even see them anymore!</li>
            <li>But my face is so clean and refreshed!</li>
            <li>and my scalp feels extremely clean!</li>
            <li>My face feels so clean and silky after use!</li>
            <li>I am a bit redfaced after I wash it off, but after that subsides, I am SO SHINY clean!</li>
            <li>But am more fine with just water.&lt;br /&gt;8.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be fine</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think my face has ever in 62 years been so clean !</li>
            <li>I saw in comments that many of us are having problem in making fine paste out of it.</li>
            <li>do it better and beyond what other products will, but for the price, its excellent.</li>
            <li>i need to find something that will finish the job and get everything soft smooth and bright!</li>
            <li>I love love love this, I am 22 and have mild acne problems, I use this for about 45 minutes a couple times a week</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a refreshing gel and makes a wonderful paste with these other two products.  </li>
            <li>but I chose to mix it with pure lemon juice since is just as good.</li>
            <li>For best results, use raw unpastuerized apple cider vinegar (Bragg&#x27;s is a popular brand).</li>
            <li>Worked amazing on my pored, started seeing a difference after the first mask!</li>
            <li>I do still have a fair amount of acne - mainly whiteheads - but it is much, much better than before.  </li>
            <li>very good for deep pore cleansing.</li>
            <li>It was very good especially for those who have oily skin.</li>
            <li>This clay mask works very good for face deep cleanings.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely amazed at this stuff!This product is high quality and good values!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing and worth</li>
            <li>so I get huge cystic acne and nothing has been able to cure it.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Bentonite Clay, and this one is okay.</li>
            <li>My acne was moderate/severe and when I paired this mask with monthly facials, I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference (even without the facials, I&#x27;m sure this product would still do wonders).</li>

            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving 2 stars because it does not pulsate and because it needs better directions that are straightforward instead of using the space on the bottle for a bunch of nonsensical hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I have 51 years and have had no serious issues with my face but thought it would be good to add it this clay to my regimen.</li>
            <li>: I would strongly recommend apple cider vinegar for oily skin; unless you do not like the smell of vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;2-</li>
            <li>I used just water as vinegar is too strong for me.</li>
            <li>I strongly encourage you all to try it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>strongly recommend</li>
            <li>I tried it w/water since ACV would be a bit too strong for me.</li>

            <li>This is strong</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li>With apple cider, the smell is really strong.</li>
            <li>so I apply vitamin E of a strong moisturizer immediately after removing.</li>
            <li>Taking the product off is best done slowly and with warm water as when it dries it hrts if you tru scrubbing or peeling it off.</li>

            <li>Came so quickly, packaged good and safe.i got  Exactly what I ordered and use</li>
            <li>My skin felt great after the redness left, and very clean.</li>

            <li>It was very refreshing thanks to the tea tree oil scent.</li>
            <li>So, I watched a youtube video of a young African-American lady using this product in her hair, as well as her face and throat, and she looked AMAZING afterwards (including her hair)!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>This awesome clay is also relatively cheap (compared to all the other acne medicines I&#x27;ve tried.)</li>
            <li>I used it only once and used a mix of both water and vinegar worked beautifully.</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin feeling nice and smooth and super clean.</li>
            <li>otherwise, the quality and effectiveness is average at best.</li>
            <li>It was actually kind of funny.</li>
            <li>then you need, so If you mix it in a bag you can save it in a cool place and use it afterwards, even a week and more</li>
            <li>I mix it with apple cider vinegar as my face is not sensitive and incredibly oily.</li>
            <li>My skin felt dewy and soft and had this gorgeous warm golden glow like I used to have before puberty.</li>
            <li>Pretty effective.</li>
            <li>I use it for spot treament more than a full face mask.</li>
            <li>So far we are loving this stuff!</li>
            <li>but when I used the apple cider vinegar it fizzed and mixed beautifully.</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it, my face feeling much softer, brighter</li>
            <li>I do have some acne (my skin breaks out more in the summer), but it&#x27;s not a bad condition and the vinegar irritates my skin.  </li>
            <li>The results are immediate and GREAT: face is tighter, pores are emptied and clean, and my skin feels soft.</li>
            <li>It is hands down one of the best beauty products I&#x27;ve ever come across.</li>
            <li>(Someone else recommended putting a paper towel down in the basin of your sink while you rinse to catch the mask as it comes off, awesome idea!)&lt;br /&gt;*You</li>
            <li>Yes, my skin is soft after rinsing off, and yes, my pores are clean and smaller.&lt;br /&gt;It feels great on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this face mask, It has cleared my pores and my face looks smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best product I have ever used for acne.</li>
            <li>The down side to this product though is that I think it works best if you don&#x27;t wear makeup.</li>
            <li>It is hands down the best product I&#x27;ve EVER purchased for my face.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t smell very good and made my skin dry.</li>
            <li>I just used this clay for the first time and had very high expectations based on all of the great reviews.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a new clay mask and bought this one based on all of the good reviews.</li>
            <li>I mix this with water and works just fine</li>
            <li>use apple cider vinegar instead of water though because water has a higher ph level and will damage your skin more and cause more of the &amp;#34;redness&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smooth and spreads easily.</li>
            <li>The paste came out smooth and easy to apply and layer to a desired thickness.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap, and it&#x27;s easy.  </li>
            <li>though she says her face feels fine..</li>
            <li>The delivery was fine.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s totally fine ..</li>
            <li>The bonus is that after a couple of months, the fine lines on my face - eyes, forehead, lips are GONE.  </li>
            <li>Between the mask and the Bel Essence, all those fine lines on my face - GONE.  </li>
            <li>Mixing it was fine.</li>
            <li>I used the mask for the first time last night, and I&#x27;m still amazed at how great my face feels!</li>
            <li>which is fine</li>
            <li>/&gt;i used it with apple cider vinegar because it seems to work the best for acnee and black heads.</li>
            <li>Once a month would probably be fine.</li>
            <li>It seems to work on acne fine, but that might be all in my head.</li>
            <li>Seems fine</li>
            <li>I think it works fine on the face.</li>
            <li>It arrive very quickly and was packaged securely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m natural this is great for hair as well as a full body mask.</li>
            <li>so it worked just fine.</li>
            <li>clay mask is fine.  </li>
            <li>Read the fine print...and use as directed..</li>
            <li>I have medium-sensitive skin and it works fine for me.  </li>
            <li>It works great and shipping was pretty fast.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m fine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine and neutral tasting.</li>
            <li>I was amaze at the before and after pictures of myself and for the first time my skin is nice and  smooth.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>What i love the most is that it does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>Apple cider vinegar is also good for acne and dark spots, so it&#x27;s a good combination to try out if you have acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>With the apple cider vinegar, there it is effortless to get the clay and vinegar to mix into a smooth velvety paste that goes on easily.</li>
            <li>Came in just fine.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m fine with this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that I would use this more than once or twice a week since it seems pretty potent</li>
            <li>but I find that if I use a plastic fork to mix and a plastic spoon to spread it works fine.</li>
            <li>it felt fine</li>
            <li>You see results quickly!</li>
            <li>Always follow up with a cleanser after taking it off, and be sure to use a mild astringent after that.  </li>
            <li>super inexpensive way to make a miracle happen in your life!</li>
            <li>I had a MilD staph infection on my face and this got rid  of it with one mask application!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super cheap!</li>
            <li>It works quickly in about 5 minutes and makes your skin glow!</li>
            <li>Tried it with Apple Cider Vinegar and it was super drying!</li>
            <li>Basically blackheads show up quickly and prominently on my nose.  </li>
            <li>leaves your skin looking very healthy and extremely fresh too will be using this a lot more from now on.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it for people with large pores.</li>
            <li>I mix mine with a little apple cider vinegar, I believe this is the best way because it makes it easy to mix and the ASV did assist with the clearing of my skin.</li>
            <li>I noticed it is perfect for shrinking pores and just really drawing out impurities in the skin(even boils and stings), like other reviewers have mentioned(rather creatively(-:).  </li>
            <li>My whole family has been using for years and is an awesome facial mask at such a good price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 37 and very fair, combo skin with occasional mild breakouts.</li>
            <li>Thanks again Amazon for making healthy living easy and affordable!</li>
            <li>just wanted something to keep my face looking good and young!</li>
            <li>My skin felt so much cleaner and looked so much better after just one use!</li>
            <li>And really, I think this might still work better!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not expensive and definitely does a great job of clearing skin and gives a nice glow.</li>
            <li>It has really helped with my acne scars and that is the biggest reason I love this mask!</li>
            <li>Warm water and gently rubbing, sometimes with a washcloth, takes the mask off relatively easy</li>
            <li>Super comfortable and enjoyable DIY face mask.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, feels good on the face and leaves your skin soft and glow.</li>
            <li>Came quick and was glad to find this so cheap.</li>
            <li>so I luckily had one plastic spoon (you can&#x27;t use metal) and used a plastic bowl with a good sealing lid because I made too much.</li>
            <li>This is one Deep Pore Cleansing mask that lives up to ALL of the positive reviews and is impressive.</li>
            <li>It comes in powder form, which is good because you will be able to mix a fresh new batch of clay every time you want to use a mask.</li>
            <li>I use facials all the time and this is by far the best working one and made with all natural product!</li>
            <li>Just used this for the first time and so far so good!  </li>
            <li>if you feel your face dry after the clay, be sure to use a good cream to hydrate the skin and don&#x27;t use the clay more than 1 time a week if dryness occur.</li>
            <li>in all, I would not recommend this product; I honestly had VERY realistic expectations going into this product.</li>
            <li>This stuff is just pure amazing.</li>
            <li>It does help to minimize the appearance of large pores and gives a nice refined texture to my skin.  </li>
            <li>This feels good going on and feels good when it dries and makes my face tight.</li>
            <li>Love the tingle you get that says it is really working!!</li>
            <li>results from the very first use!</li>
            <li>I love this product so much!!</li>
            <li>I used the vinegar and it was ok the first three times, then it was too drying!</li>
            <li>But overall, very pleased!</li>
            <li>Tried it and felt the difference in how my face felt on a very first time!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff so much!!</li>
            <li>I love the product and I will most likely buy more as soon as I am done with this batch!</li>
            <li>I love this product really tightens my skin!!</li>
            <li>Water and a little lemon juice works best for me.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend using the Apple cider vinegar, the smell isn&#x27;t strong once mixed,you&#x27;ll see better results!</li>
            <li>very good product, works as expected</li>
            <li>(I keep a plastic bag or bowl under my face when I&#x27;m rinsing it off) and making a certain amount and storing it in a plastic bag to take out from later is a great idea!</li>
            <li>Very good for taking those top layers of dead cells off once a month or so.</li>
            <li>Best face mask under $60 hands down!</li>
            <li>The item was exactly as described, it arrived very quickly and was packaged very securely.</li>

            <li>Feels like it&#x27;s really cleaning out your pores, gives a nice tingling sensation on your face.</li>

            <li>While I don&#x27;t know about this being a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product, it&#x27;s too cheap to not try.</li>
            <li>It was also reassuring and fulfilling to think that this product isn&#x27;t filled with chemicals (which I believe damaged my skin as a youth).</li>

            <li>Probably biggest advantage is it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>I am an african-american female and this works great on my skin.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve had it pull my eyebrows out, even when being gentle while removing it with warm water.</li>
            <li>Also it doesn&#x27;t mix smoothly and is clumpy when I put it on my face.</li>
            <li>Reduces the pimple size and redness greatly by the next day.</li>
            <li>I get a lot of compliments of how good I look, people I run into always comment on my great skin and especially, how young I look.  </li>

            <li>it made my skin soft and was was really good on my pores.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Not the MAGIC that everyone exclaimed here, but good enough for me.</li>
            <li>but I have fair, sensitive skin.  </li>

            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far made a mud mask and loved results</li>
            <li>/&gt;About my skin and tips: I have extremely fair, sensitive, combination skin.</li>
            <li>I liked how it tightened up my skin while it was drying and was expecting great results, but have not seen them after a few times of use.</li>
            <li>but my skin felt soft and looked good.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you use a really good facial moisturizer..</li>
            <li>far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far, so good and would recommend.</li>
            <li>I bought this item after seeing so many good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this mask takes a big amount of time to prepare and apply.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good I&#x27;ve use this product for a week and it truly gets rid of pimples.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s a bit messy, I honestly could see great results/improvements in my skin after just 2-3 uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, this deep cleanse is enjoyable weekly.  </li>
            <li>Very great mask, last very long.clears</li>
            <li>problem is that I have extremely fair, and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Its ok, very drying, make sure to put a moisturizer or oil on after.  </li>
            <li>I love this and it cleared my acne up so good can&#x27;t get enough of this mask!</li>
            <li>This will last a while, great amount of product with a nice price point and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I read many reviews about this product and so many people touted this as an absolute miracle product.</li>
            <li>So far so good tho.</li>
            <li>Like most good things this will take a bit of time on your part to work properly.</li>
            <li>Need to be careful mixing it up, but once you get it right, it is perfect!  </li>
            <li>works soooo well on blemishes leaves pores very clean and skin feels very refreshed after using!!</li>
            <li>Also the way it feels when it starts to dry is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>I do however suggest this product because it is pretty damn good for the price, and who doesn&#x27;t love a good tight face mask</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a nice treatment indeed, it makes me feel very clean, I mixed it with vinegar and got even better results.</li>
            <li>Just plain out Awesome.</li>
            <li>It is really challenging to get it to the right consistency.</li>
            <li>Just make sure not to use it right before going somewhere.</li>
            <li>**make sure you&#x27;re using it with the recommended Apple Cider Vinegar to get the right effects.</li>
            <li>it is a very good product, but I have had other clay masks that make my face pulsate and tightens my pores.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing; all the positive reviews on here are definitely true.  </li>
            <li>I sure would welcome any tips other commenters have on how to avoid clumps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, we are happy with our purchase and are excited to try it again.</li>
            <li>With that being said, it cleans out pores beautifully and does not over dry my skin.</li>
            <li>This is the third time I&#x27;ve purchased this product, and still LOVE it!!</li>

            <li>My whole family uses it even the fella&#x27;s!!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very powerful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very intense &amp; I love how fresh &amp; healthy it makes my skin look.</li>

            <li>and I just exfoliate as normal and my face is very smooth and looks better.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my skin feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>To take it off I get a bucket of warm water and a clean wash cloth and gently wipe the mask off of my face with the damp wash cloth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been able to control my acne with a good basic cleanser (no harsh stuff) and a mild face scrub 3 times a week (skinceticals has a good one but its pricey) .</li>
            <li>My acne is steadily getting better and better</li>
            <li>The jar is super full and it makes my face so clean and smooth!</li>
            <li>I have pretty good skin to begin with, but using this mask makes my skin look so much more even and soft.</li>
            <li>I originally ordered this product because it put me over my $25 free shipping limit</li>
            <li>It will be RED and have a pretty good tingle, but a nice layer of moisturizer and a couple of hours</li>
            <li>works best when mixed with high quality vinager.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried several products....including the highly publicized &amp;#34;P&amp;#34;, but this has proven to work the best.</li>
            <li>After I washed it off, I applied Thayer&#x27;s rose witch hazel as a toner and Trader Joe&#x27;s antioxidant oil-free moisturizer and my skin felt amazingly soft and clean!</li>
            <li>Use raw honey for the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>With this price, and it give me smooth and clean skin, I would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li>but my skin feels clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel smooth and clean</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin smooth and squeaky clean</li>
            <li>I have never felt my face so clean and smooth without having to exfoliate and with a scrub or brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does everything it promises... smooth clean skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I experienced no drying, my skin is usually pretty sensitive</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>It just pulls all the impurities out of my face, leaving it smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>It made my face feel smooth and clean and that is what I wanted.</li>
            <li>When I use this mask my face feels so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>and once I washed it off, my skin felt incredibly smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this about once a week, it always makes my face feel really clean</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s up to you to change up the ingredients for your own particular needs.</li>
            <li>and that was pretty awesome, but I had a lot of closed comedones (acne that isn&#x27;t inflamed, but is just a bump under the skin.</li>
            <li>Mixing it was super easy- for a lack of apple cider vinegar in my dorm</li>
            <li>This product is super strong</li>
            <li>First, let me just say I have dreamed and prayed, literally dreamed of the day I can write a success story of my own in regards to acne.</li>
            <li>this takes way too much time and effort to mix to a good consistently.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a quick process and the heat of the water helps easily dissolve the mask, as well as the friction from the wash cloth.</li>
            <li>I would receive a container full of fine dust.</li>
            <li>Also, it is super easy to learn to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to mix and hardens quickly.</li>
            <li>I find that mixing the clay to ACV at a 1 to 1.5 ratio (I use about a teaspoon of clay to 1.5 teaspoons ACV) and applying a much thinner layer than the product label suggests still provides REMARKABLE results while stretching the product much farther.  </li>
            <li>A teaspoon of powder (not packed in) and a teaspoon of water was the perfect amount for a nice super thin layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time I did the mask, I didnt notice very much of a difference, except that my skin was bright bright red for an hour.</li>
            <li>Have fun..try new things.. you will love it!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that if you take the same washcloth you used to prep your face before the mask and run it under warm water, then press it into your face to loosen the mask, it comes off easily!</li>
            <li>My pores have not decreased but I&#x27;m still very happy; I love the tight pulling while the mask is on too.  </li>
            <li>This is amazing highly recommend and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li>Of course I still have the spots, as we all know those take a while to go away, but my makeup can hide those better, and the rosewater is very gentle, too.</li>
            <li>I love this very much.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin look fresh, clean and well taken care of!</li>
            <li>It may burn at first, but once it&#x27;s washed off your face is very smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>this is has calm my acne like nothing else before, i have super sensitive skin but its clearing up compare to how it was, i love this !!</li>
            <li>and it mixed beautifully and was just the right amount for the face.</li>
            <li>Be prepared with moist towels handy for clean-up, watch out for your plumbing, and have something to store leftovers because You&#x27;ll never make exactly the right amount.</li>
            <li>I am loving the results so far!!  </li>
            <li>I am loving the results so far!!  </li>
            <li>After I washed it off, my clean felt so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>It dissolved more easily that way and the whole process took about five minutes.</li>
            <li>It dissolved more easily that way and the whole process took about five minutes.</li>
            <li>and I have yet to find a good (and easy) solution, save from hosing myself off in the back yard</li>
            <li>This clay mask is really nice for my body, but it is way to strong to use on the sensitive skin on my face.</li>
            <li>Made my skin nice and soft and was easy to use.</li>
            <li>The redness goes away quickly and you are left with great skin.</li>
            <li>This product does not seem pulsate or pull as strongly as the mask I made from the NOW brand bentonite (sodium type), nor did it draw as much blood to the surface of my skin, which is what causes the redness and/or burning sensation, but it does seem to help heal better.</li>
            <li>But make sure to use moisturizer after because it does dry out your face (which is good for acne)</li>
            <li>, it isn&#x27;t a magic cure-all and certainly doesn&#x27;t repair me 100%, but a 40-50% improvement is fine for me).  </li>
            <li>Next time I used ACV and the results were amazing!</li>
            <li>After the first use I noticed a huge difference!</li>
            <li>so so worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I let the hot water run in my sink to make sure my sink doesn&#x27;t clog.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with it so far.  </li>
            <li>totally worth the hype!</li>
            <li>I originally bought this for the keratosis pilaris that I have on my arms and legs</li>
            <li>Love this product so much!</li>
            <li>I use this product for the first time and I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I tried this as soon as I got it because I was excited to see if it worked as well as the reviews said it did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure the hype is just because you mix it yourself and see it bubble up -- it&#x27;s a gimmick.</li>
            <li>first picture is when I first started breaking out, and then the process of how the clay was working its magic :)</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;pulsing&amp;#34; you experience while it&#x27;s on is quite fun!</li>
            <li>But oh my is it worth it!</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product! : )</li>
            <li>2 tsp Rose water - Normal days&lt;br /&gt;1tsp Indian healing clay</li>
            <li>I wanted to test the mask out to make sure it did not irritate my skin, so the first time I used it</li>
            <li>I have pretty okay skin</li>
            <li>After reading reviews and watching youtube videos on this i was so excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>When i took it off once again it didnt look like it had dont anything significant to my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this is snake oil.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definatley worth it!</li>
            <li>Pretty sure im a lifer</li>
            <li>Way worth the $11!</li>
            <li>Rinse and smile!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t the most attractive mask that I&#x27;ve used, but is that really that big of a deal?</li>
            <li>This mask is SO POWERFUL!</li>
            <li>I hope you love it as much as I do!</li>
            <li>This stuff is the greatest, and its a nice big jar so it&#x27;ll last me a good long time.</li>
            <li>This product is worth all the hype!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a month in I love it when I first used it</li>
            <li>and I use it on my body at first, and more often, now I use it once a week.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this.</li>
            <li>I was excited for this to come in the mail</li>
            <li>I think by July as I mentioned, I should be significantly clearer..</li>
            <li>I think by July as I mentioned, I should be significantly clearer..</li>
            <li>Also, once totally made my UPS guy&#x27;s day by being caught wearing it while having to sign for a package :-P</li>
            <li>I used a teaspoon full and mix with water until it can smooth over my skin.</li>
            <li>It was pretty ok.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I received my order in the mail and could wait to use it.</li>
            <li>Also, I originally used water as I didn&#x27;t have organic apple cider.  </li>
            <li>I used apple cider vinegar and it seemed to come out more consistent than when I attempted to use water.</li>
            <li>not expensive and my favorite.</li>
            <li>So after dinner I put the mask on my WHOLE face, and wow, it does hurt, but its more of a good hurt, and it does stink.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this clay, and i have to say I am 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li>this is the first reveiw I&#x27;ve ever written, I just cant keep how much I love this product to myself.</li>
            <li>Just search for &#x27;activated charcoal capsule&#x27; if you aren&#x27;t familiar with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oatmeal  </li>
            <li>Just search for &#x27;activated charcoal capsule&#x27; if you aren&#x27;t familiar with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oatmeal  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to use this</li>
            <li>Based on the reviews, I was extremely excited to try this out.</li>
            <li>My guess is that if you&#x27;re consistent with usage you&#x27;ll get better results.</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;ll be able see how it feels first before you put it on any delacate areas.  </li>
            <li>Pretty sure it&#x27;s just a lot of hype.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m golden now!</li>
            <li>but I figured it was worth the 9 bucks!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive and definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>Excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>The results are worth it!</li>
            <li>I use this product one time and as soon as I washed it off the pores on my nose shrunk significantly.</li>
            <li>This does not remove all blackheads in one go (so don&#x27;t get TOO excited), but I imagine if you do it every week</li>
            <li>First, the amount of clay for the price is outstanding.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure you could mold a pottery bowl out of this stuff if you wanted.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it consistently to know if it has many benefits yet.</li>
            <li>I just got home and was so excited to find the package.</li>
            <li>ive seen a significant difference in my appearance.</li>
            <li>The apple vinegar produces the most results and using hot water leaves the mud in clumps so unless u want muddy lookin&#x27;</li>
            <li>I originally got this to combat my clogged pores.</li>
            <li>I get a better result when I dilute the ACV with distilled water FIRST, then add the diluted ACV to the clay (instead of adding water and ACV to the clay as two separate</li>
            <li>This product was fun to try and will buy again!</li>
            <li>You can read more about it on their website if you&#x27;re interested</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time and works great on oily acnetic skin</li>
            <li>I am astounded by the results, what a success!</li>
            <li>but I am pretty sure they were pulled.</li>
            <li>I did have a lot more breakouts at first, BUT these are the pimples that were already below the surface and are just being pulled out.</li>
            <li>and I notice a significant difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Love this product and will purchase another jar after my first one is done.</li>
            <li>This cleared up what I originally went to the dermatologist with by about 75%.</li>
            <li>Yes, time consuming but so worth it!</li>
            <li>This mask has changed my life significantly.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised when it arrived as powder but am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>so I find it important to make sure my face is thoroughly cleansed and with the most natural, home remedy-like products)</li>
            <li>and so worth it!</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had an issue after the first couple of times and now I am glad I stuck with it.</li>
            <li>The first two times it was ok.</li>
            <li>Did not see any significant improvement.</li>
            <li>It is a bit of a hassle getting it off but is well worth it!</li>
            <li>Now that I know, I&#x27;m excited to get into the habit of using it.</li>
            <li>and i am very pleased with the results thus far.</li>
            <li>but the results are worth it!</li>
            <li>I woke up this morning and was so excited.</li>
            <li>Okay I was looking for this exact type of mud mask.  </li>
            <li>I love this, first time using it</li>
            <li>Maybe that means I really needed it! :)</li>
            <li>This is very good treatment to, especially if you have large pores or pimples.</li>
            <li>I gave some to my very critical mother and she loved it too (which is a huge compliment because she complains about absolutely everything!!!)  </li>
            <li>I mean, if ACV is as great for skin as many people claim, why hasn&#x27;t there been more companies to include it in their formulas?</li>
            <li>When ingested, it has great benefits for skin, but doesn&#x27;t do anything for the surface of the skin but smell funky and do a little bit more exfoliating.</li>
            <li>It takes a little to get off like most masks but your skin looks great afterwards.</li>
            <li>Pretty good at absorbing my super oily skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful, organic product from a wonderful little company I&#x27;ve fallen in love with, and it&#x27;s great following each of the above drying treatments, especially after Aztec Healing.  </li>

            <li>It cleans pores very well and seems to tone your skin, leaving it very smooth.</li>
            <li>Easy to mix, doesn&#x27;t clump if you start it off correctly and with the right amount.</li>

            <li>it works amazing and makes me skin and face amazingly soft and cleanses the pores.</li>
            <li>will update my review in a couple hours after the bright, burning red skin goes away...</li>
            <li>I first used this over a decade ago and it really is quite amazing.</li>
            <li>Still takes some getting used to but overall a good working mask</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need more than 2 Tablespoons for the whole face.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put any oils or extra stuff that people say it&#x27;s good when it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>but my face appreciated the mask, my skin was noticeably better.</li>
            <li>Overall I think it was a really good product.</li>
            <li>Really good as a facial.  </li>
            <li>I have my cheeks full of acne</li>
            <li>I use about two table spoons of the clay, a quarter size of coconut charcoal, a quarter size amount of coconut oil, and finally I add some of Braggs Organic apple cider vinegar until I get a good consistency.</li>
            <li>and it felt super clean.</li>
            <li>Feels good, just really messy and would prefer more detailed directions</li>
            <li>good for making pores smaller.</li>
            <li>It is not painful, just unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you apply generously as recommended, you get the full benefit.</li>
            <li>If you apply generously as recommended, you get the full benefit.</li>
            <li>to add to his regime since it&#x27;s gotten such good reviews for treating acne, as well.</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>Such a good price.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m using it for acne or enlarged pores, I follow up with a dab of good quality coconut oil and a drop of tea tree essential oil.</li>
            <li>Love this product it really works just mix with acv and put it on the face i would do it before I showerd and then just take it off in the shower</li>
            <li>grandson has fair complexion and he left on about 10 min.  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t be able to say much during this time.  </li>
            <li>I am 31 years old and now since i have used this product I can say I have not had any pimples I also use  Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera ~</li>
            <li>and then I need a good deep cleansing.</li>
            <li>I left it on for about fifteen minutes and loved the pulsing feeling.</li>
            <li>I attributed it to purging effects, or perhaps clay that I did not wipe off good enough.</li>
            <li>Within two uses (three days) they&#x27;d developed into full-fledged whiteheads.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me and you&#x27;ve tried every product from here to Timbuktu, this should be one of the most economic treatments you&#x27;ve encountered.</li>
            <li>The skin in-between blemishes is much cleaner and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>The skin in-between blemishes is much cleaner and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>It is as good as getting a facial done at home.</li>
            <li>I braided it that night for stretch, and the next day my hair was just gorgeous.</li>
            <li>1) I put it on more evenly (thanks to the brush) and I felt the pulsing, which to me, signified that it was working the way it was supposed to.</li>
            <li>1) I put it on more evenly (thanks to the brush) and I felt the pulsing, which to me, signified that it was working the way it was supposed to.</li>
            <li>After i rinse my face with the warm water my face felt so soft and that earned a star.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I ended up covering my full face, neck, shoulders, and chest and then hopping in the shower to rinse it off.</li>
            <li>I can see a real difference without anything on my face :)</li>
            <li>And it really doesn&#x27;t have a smell to it, so that makes it even better</li>
            <li>it works as good as the ones I pay for in facial salons.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>Didnt really work any better then</li>
            <li>It sucks all the dirt out of your skin and makes it look awesome!</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, my daughter has a friend who is a make-up artist and, through her, has tried several &amp;#34;Hollywood&amp;#34; super-expensive products and says this mask makes her skin look and feel just as good.</li>
            <li>I like that this is an effective, natural way to take care of my skin.  </li>
            <li>they are still full.</li>
            <li>but since I have sensitive skin, it kind of stung too</li>
            <li>Loving this product so far.</li>
            <li>and my skin is nice and clear.</li>
            <li>It does such a good job for facials.  </li>
            <li>I also adore the idea of an effective, natural product.</li>
            <li>Container was full, get some tips on how to mix well</li>
            <li>After suffering with severe cystic acne for 5 years and trying absolutely everything (from Proactiv, to urine therapy, to rx&#x27;s + more) I started using this mask every morning for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>I use about a teaspoon full for my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it (this from a sweet tooth.)&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>Excellent.reveiws where true to product</li>
            <li>Being athletes, we are prone to have more problems with clogged pores and get what you call &amp;#34;athletes face&amp;#34; and this has really helped keep the problems at bay.</li>
            <li>I will note that the directions says to put a layer on 1/4 of an inch thick for best results</li>
            <li>i love the intense tightening when the mask dries...</li>
            <li>Any real benefits you&#x27;re getting from this are probably the placebo effect working its magic.  </li>
            <li>My coworkers love it so much they ask me to buy them some.</li>
            <li>Immediately after, I applied a facial moisturizer and my skin has never looked so good.  </li>
            <li>so I washed it off immediately with cool water rather than keeping it on any longer.</li>
            <li>The rest of my face feels soft and nice.  </li>
            <li>It is a really cool experience too.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it really helps repair your skin overnight and you will see/feel a difference the morning after.</li>
            <li>and It&#x27;s got a cool hippy looking container</li>
            <li>And on top of all that, it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much of anything for my skin.</li>
            <li>I applied a full mask for 20 min before bed.</li>
            <li>Gives a fresh and smooth feel after use.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>but it was cool to see.</li>
            <li>, I use it for mosquito bites too because I swear im allergic to them, or they love me too much..</li>
            <li>Used this for the first time today, I LOVE it and will definitely buy more once I run out :)</li>
            <li>I like to use this once a week to clean my face and pull out toxins for quick removal.  </li>
            <li>It smooths and firms better than my fancy clay mask I paid 3x as much for.</li>
            <li>(I put make up on top of it, so don&#x27;t want to use too much)</li>
            <li>is I take a full sheet of paper towel, like Bounty (you need a durable brand) and place it in the sink so that as I rinse, all the chunks of mask collect in the paper towel</li>
            <li>you are okay with absorbing aluminum into your system, by all means, use this product.  </li>
            <li>Over the years, I have weeded out almost all of chemical products to replace them with things that are all natural, and that I can make on my own.</li>
            <li>next goal is to find a good food grade clay, to take to detox the inside of the body.</li>
            <li>next goal is to find a good food grade clay, to take to detox the inside of the body.</li>
            <li>so I added more water but that didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li>, I have very oily skin on most of my face</li>
            <li>My face didn&#x27;t pulse so much as felt like clay was shrinking on top of it.</li>
            <li>Nice baby soft complexion</li>
            <li>I think this is such a good value for your money.</li>
            <li>and I literally feel it cleaning my pores - but to the point where I can&#x27;t really have it on for more than 5 minutes because I start to feel this itchy sensation.</li>
            <li>One full tub has lasted me 4 months</li>
            <li>I mever thought this facial mask is really good for my sensitive/dry skin</li>
            <li>So if this bothers you, look into a good mixing agent such as ACV (apple cider vinegar).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an all natural kind of person.</li>
            <li>and that did some good stuff, but again nothing that could really vastly make an improvement.</li>
            <li>Then after the mask, I cool my skin with 100% witch hazel (no alcohol).</li>
            <li>but sometimes this crappy acne hides that true beauty.</li>
            <li>Then after the mask, I cool my skin with 100% witch hazel (no alcohol).</li>
            <li>but sometimes this crappy acne hides that true beauty.</li>
            <li>Gives a cool tingly sensation when applied.</li>
            <li>i honestly dont use it that often and the reason why is because its a complete pain to take off.</li>
            <li>At least THIS one leaves me with great results!</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t recommend this product because it doesn&#x27;t pick of most dirt and blemish</li>
            <li>Love it so much..</li>
            <li>I have good skin, but occasional break outs.  </li>
            <li>I am really loving this so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it four times, but my skin has never felt and looked this good.</li>
            <li>When you apply the mask, put the fan on full blast, and it will hasten the process so you can get on with your life</li>
            <li>This is a good home made mask that actually works.</li>
            <li>Whole foods, water, and healthy living will increase the beauty of one&#x27;s skin.&lt;br /&gt;I would encourage anyone to try this product.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t wait to see how much my skin improves with more uses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve explained how I use this clay, let me explain why I love it so much.  </li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t be to surprised it doesn&#x27;t have a nice smell.</li>
            <li>but it is so cool.</li>
            <li>I had been reading reviews with people raving how good this product was for acne and finally decided to purchase.  </li>
            <li>I followed with a cool rinse.  </li>
            <li>And I think that would be good enough for me.</li>
            <li>I recommend applying after a good 10 minute facial steam.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit...intense...but def not painful or anything.</li>
            <li>Economical and fabulous.</li>
            <li>I have very problematic skin and this stuff calms it like magic.</li>
            <li>It really pulsates your skin as it says but its not a terrible feeling to me.</li>
            <li>so far nice product.  </li>
            <li>I put it on some bug bites and the cool temperature of my Apple Cider Vinegar</li>
            <li>but you will never know the true feeling  until you try it.</li>
            <li>I also love the seller, the mask got here so stinking fast</li>
            <li>I also suggest doing the mask for a full 30 minutes to get the true effects of it.</li>
            <li>Honey is also full of antioxidants which are beneficial to your skin.</li>
            <li>Honey is also full of antioxidants which are beneficial to your skin.</li>
            <li>I intend to do this 1x per week, my skin really looks and feels both smooth and glowing!</li>
            <li>Overall a good product</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve liked it so far</li>
            <li>I love it, it really cleans your pores and your skin feels softer.</li>
            <li>(well so it felt), hemp oil has helped me the absolute most.</li>
            <li>You really do feel movement and the clay working its magic.</li>
            <li>Worked a whole lot better once I started using it with apple cider vinegar instead of water.</li>
            <li>Although I just used it once so far, I really liked the result.</li>
            <li>This really dries out my skin, but I guess that&#x27;s what most masks do.</li>
            <li>full of Aztec Clay &amp; add 2-3 tbsp of Bragg Organic Apple Cider Vinegar (also purchased from Amazon), mix together well</li>
            <li>effective and natural.</li>
            <li>Once you get this stuff mixed up it works good.  </li>
            <li>I learned a cool rehydration method for this and the Redmond Clay though.</li>
            <li>Ordered the 2lb one now,  love it so much</li>
            <li>So far... Loving it.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve got a lot of cool stuff, and hey, it might be a couple dollars cheaper</li>
            <li>I use it as a full face mask as suggested and also to spot treat my blemishes.</li>
            <li>For the price (a whopping $9 &amp; free shipping), it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>I love that it pulls so much dirt.</li>
            <li>good deep cleanser for skin</li>
            <li>so you can put the good moisture back in.</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>I used maybe two spoons of clay and just poured a guesstimate amount of AVC and the consistency was good enough for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend using it with a good quality apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>i love this stuff and it really works</li>
            <li>I mix it with apple cider vinegar, and it gives a really cool tightening sensation on your face.</li>
            <li>and when you take the mask off your face is red for a good 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used it in a bath and for mosquito bites and have had only good experiences with it in those situations as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to say that this stuff genuinely works and is totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>Love that while it&#x27;s drying, it really tightens up literally pulling your face up like a facelift.</li>
            <li>It was true.</li>
            <li>It adds a cool, tingly, freshening sensation while I&#x27;m waiting for the mask to dry.e ingredients).</li>
            <li>It feels lovely going on, but after 10-15 minutes I&#x27;m ready to take it off.</li>
            <li>Albeit my skin isn&#x27;t perfect, it&#x27;s better than it&#x27;s been for a LONG LONG time.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love it</li>
            <li>The only good thing was that it got rid of the blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li>Do NOT use it frequently with one drain, switch drains up or rinse it out in a bowl with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I work in an environment full of dust and grime and when I use this mask, it cleans my face to a T.</li>
            <li>Plus, the &amp;#34;pulsations&amp;#34; are more intense with the vinegar when compared to water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>PIMPLES.MY ENGLISH IS NOT THAT GOOD</li>
            <li>I read a bunch of reviews and they all said how you won&#x27;t be able to move your face because it&#x27;s so intense.</li>
            <li>I love it, it really helps my skin.</li>
            <li>I put a spoon full in an applicator bottle and fill the bottle up with water.</li>
            <li>does a really good deep cleanse.</li>
            <li>and my face feels super clean and refreshed when done.</li>
            <li>It does pulse a bit and that is cool, but not until the clay dries.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t notice pore shrinkage and honestly way too busy in my schedule to find time to do this often.</li>
            <li>It feels good to finally find a product that works and one</li>
            <li>This will last me a good while.</li>
            <li>Makes your face feel super clean.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive/dry mostly but it also has a tendency to pimple.</li>
            <li>I should really give it more time before I rate.  </li>
            <li>Skin looks nice and clear.</li>
            <li>So far i&#x27;m loving the results.</li>
            <li>Okay people you really are buying dirt from Amazon with this product.</li>
            <li>It is a good facial clay.</li>
            <li>Okay so I cant really say it works...</li>
            <li>But I do love how it really tightens your face....</li>
            <li>Feels cool when I use it though</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, and a lot of people have gotten results so it may be worth a try</li>
            <li>I really like this mask and it can be used way more than the package says, so you get a lot for what you pay.  </li>
            <li>In fact, in India some even use it for shampooing the hair, so it&#x27;s definitely not bad for hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You get a lot for a good price, so I think this will probably last me 6 months to a full year.  </li>
            <li>You get a lot for a good price, so I think this will probably last me 6 months to a full year.  </li>
            <li>No bad smell and</li>
            <li>I guess, if you want to try it, its not a bad idea.</li>
            <li>So far it seems pretty good.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really help for on-spot pimple treatment as others have noticed; for me, it seems to aggravate the pimple more, but I will say it does bring it to a full head</li>
            <li>not a bad product, just wasn&#x27;t for me</li>
            <li>I read some reviews and was pretty surprised by all the good things people had to say.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>All in all, I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to add something new and effective to their skincare routine!</li>
            <li>so of you want to wind down with a favorite book, put your muddy mask on and you won&#x27;t be bothered for a good hour or two.</li>
            <li>Face feels nice and clean and pores do seem cleaner and nice and  tight afterward</li>
            <li>I just wouldn&#x27;t use this first thing in the morning if you have to be somewhere right after. :)</li>
            <li>It is amazing and makes my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing and it makes your face super soft before this product acne was a problem for me.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to overlook more natural and &amp;#34;basic&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping love this stuff</li>
            <li>Feels pretty cool!</li>
            <li>Right after wiping it off your skin feels incredibly smooth too.</li>
            <li>The mixing is a little trying, but once you get it right it works!!!!!</li>
            <li>I think this huge jar will last 6 months or more!</li>
            <li>First let me say that the item arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li>because I imagine it would clog up bathroom drains pretty easily.</li>
            <li>Seller was easy to work with and provided fast delivery!</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t get deep into pores to clean out junk, but it does a much better job than most cleansers.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t get deep into pores to clean out junk, but it does a much better job than most cleansers.</li>
            <li>I found this clay to be mild, cool, and soothing.</li>
            <li>This seems to clean really well and has marginally helped with my adult cystic acne, but oh good hell, does it ever ITCH.</li>
            <li>If you mix with water, it&#x27;ll be lumpy but no less effective.</li>
            <li>The first listed review that has that wonderful tip about mixing and applying this mask is definitely the best way to do it because this stuff can be a mess and it can be hard to get a good consistent texture just mixing with a spoon or something…I always get clumps.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It mixes much more smoothly and completely with the ACV!  </li>
            <li>You could probably use pure aloe (it&#x27;s pretty cheap at Trader Joe&#x27;s or use a plant if you have one) and it would make your skin feel better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Based on my experience I think this would also be great for severe acne and would only caution someone with very, very sensitive skin to not use it as it is strong.</li>
            <li>I try to remove it by rubbing it off with wet hands making it a very effective exfoliate.</li>
            <li>My favorite face mask and so much cheaper than many high end brands</li>
            <li>My skin tone is even, and even better, the fine lines around my eyes, mouth and on my forehead are completely gone.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;- wash face gently with sulfur soap (I think my face likes to be very clean, but</li>
            <li>how much you mix up - it&#x27;s very easy to make way too much!</li>
            <li>When I wash it all out, my curls are extremely defined and my hair feels great.</li>
            <li>Also great on mosquito and other vampire-like bugs bites.</li>
            <li>Other than that, great product.</li>
            <li>Its natural tho and very safe even for the most sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Try not to smile or laugh because this stuff will crack!</li>
            <li>Other than that, great product.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get the tingling that the other reviewers have gotten, but I&#x27;m amazed how great my skin look since I started using this once a week.  </li>
            <li>After reading other reviews I thought this product would be great, not the case.</li>
            <li>Felt great on my face, plus it says you can use it for other parts of your body so I&#x27;ll have to try that out.  </li>
            <li>great stuff, just as mentioned in all the other reviews.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My pores look so much better, my skin doesn&#x27;t look as dull, and my breakouts have been greatly reduced after maybe 3 masks in 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Would suggest to my friends and will certainly buy again!!</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t be beat, and mixes incredibly well in raw apple cider.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a new, more natural beauty routine and after doing some research, I purchased this product along with Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera, Viva Labs</li>
            <li>The first 10 minutes are fine.</li>
            <li>My skin seriously looks the best it has in years!</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty fine.</li>
            <li>and I must say its intimidating at first because you have to measure things but its fine.</li>
            <li>I use this clay on my hair and it leaves it feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel clean and fresh</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Seriously you can have gorgeous skin for $8!!</li>
            <li>A pain to clean up but so worth it.</li>
            <li>feels fresh and clean</li>
            <li>This product is great at reducing my active acne.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It had tightened my skin tremendously.</li>
            <li>If you use it on your entire face too often, it will cause your skin to over compensate for the loss of healthy moisture and oil, which will bring more unwanted oil production and breakout.</li>
            <li>skin feels cleaner afterwards, more plump (probably from the pulsing), and most of my sebaceous filaments are gone (until the next morning).</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and mild acne.</li>
            <li>While I didn&#x27;t feel it burn while I had it on my face, I did notice my face felt like I had a mild sunburn once I washed it off.  </li>
            <li>While I didn&#x27;t feel it burn while I had it on my face, I did notice my face felt like I had a mild sunburn once I washed it off.  </li>
            <li>Nothing on earth works that quickly</li>
            <li>and I still have mild acne around my mouth/chin and blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li>more than confident when I mix the clay properly next time, I will have unimaginable results.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This is seriously an awesome product, but should only be part of your bags of tricks for overall skincare.</li>
            <li>This product is definitely one of the best facial masks that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Luckily I used it at night and by morning it was gone.</li>
            <li>I wanted this to work, I have mildly combo skin and used &#x27;&#x27;clay like&#x27;&#x27; mask before.</li>
            <li>I panicked when I first washed my face, because it seemed to me that I had more acne, but I realized, that this stuff brings out whatever is lying under the first layer of the skin to the visible layer of the skin.</li>
            <li>but they go away quickly</li>
            <li>I bought 2 pounds of it and it came rather quickly.</li>
            <li>The second time I used it, I applied the mask more liberally and got even better results.</li>
            <li>will however tell you why I will be a loyal customer.</li>
            <li>a jar and quick...</li>
            <li>It is as advertise and came quickly.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick too.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, works awesome on my troubled skin</li>
            <li>My skin is prone to breakout and this stuff does not break out my skin and clears up breakouts quickly.</li>
            <li>in all, this mask is super</li>
            <li>in all, this mask is super</li>
            <li>This product probably seems super overhyped</li>
            <li>Skin Care Lotion - Ozonated Olive Oil Super Oxygen (4oz)]]</li>
            <li>Apple cider vinegar gets it to a nice smooth consistency that pulsates on the skin and dries relatively even.  </li>
            <li>When I add water to mix, this brand quickly forms surprisingly-solid clumps that do not break up and mix into paste.  </li>
            <li>This cleared up the blackheads in my nose really quickly</li>
            <li>lovely sensation, decently priced too.</li>
            <li>Quickly dropped to once a week because the effects of both the clay and the moisturizer lasted.  </li>
            <li>I really feel like I experienced a facial.</li>
            <li>SUPER quick delivery.</li>
            <li>My skin did feel tighter and pores did appear smaller, but this is something that you&#x27;d really need to do weekly to get great results.  </li>
            <li>She used it 2 or 3 times a week and her skin cleared up quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those customers who once they find a product they like, they remain loyal to it forever.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel super tingly</li>
            <li>I guess I didn&#x27;t find the work of this product to be as worthy of the praises people speak of.</li>
            <li>product arrived quickly once again.</li>
            <li>Works great for my skin, fast and simple to use.</li>
            <li>I have been making homemade lotions and scrubs, and figured I should mix up some of those ingredients to make a super mask.  </li>
            <li>I have super oily skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everyone&#x27;s skin is different and will react differently to different products, good luck!!</li>
            <li>I have fairly mild acne.</li>
            <li>I have combo skin and usually mild acne.</li>
            <li>and you feel a mild pulling sensation).</li>
            <li>I suffer from mild acne</li>
            <li>It tingles when you first apply it and dries quickly in about 15 minutes!</li>
            <li>and when i applied it to my face, it made my face super itchy</li>
            <li>Shipping was really quick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great price, and it really does work well.</li>
            <li>make sure you use vinegar (i used white vinegar, not organic apple cider), makes the mask smoother and works 1000% times better</li>
            <li>Cheap, natural and works like magic.</li>
            <li>Mostly though what don&#x27;t care for about most commercial toothpastes is penchant for making things anti-plaque.</li>
            <li>While it may, or may not have been popular with the Aztecs, I find it helpful for a home spa day or after a camping trip,  Of course, anyone with serious, or ongoing skin problems should consult with a physician, but for me, this is a pleasant and helpful product to keep on hand.</li>
            <li>So, I quickly rinsed it off my face and phoned my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>(quickly too!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super drying.</li>
            <li>Super</li>
            <li>This product arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>If it does so, i will gladly come back and give it the rating it deserves :)</li>
            <li>Throwing everything away makes clean-up quick.</li>
            <li>I did a wrap over most of my body and still had enough mixture for 1-2 more wraps.</li>
            <li>I have never used anything that has worked so quickly.</li>
            <li>and this has helped tremendously in just one use.</li>
            <li>but then they quickly went away</li>
            <li>my skin immediately felt softer and after a couple of days my mild acne was gone</li>
            <li>but if you get blackheads and mild acne every now</li>
            <li>so this didn&#x27;t do anything for my pimples (witch are relatively mild)</li>
            <li>Mixed it with apple cider vinegar and water and this is a perfect pack for oily skin.the only hassle</li>
            <li>I have experienced with how much to use and I find that 1tsp clay with 1tsp and a couple extra drops water works well for</li>
            <li>(I had one that made me look like Quasimodo, which was quickly healed by this stuff).</li>
            <li>It went away quickly.</li>
            <li>When I wake up and before bed, I wash my face with Aquaphor Baby Gentle Wash &amp; Tear Free Shampoo, Fragrance Free Mild Cleanser</li>
            <li>Love this product:) would definitely recommend</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also amazed at how quickly it shrunk the pores on my face.</li>
            <li>I got this stuff and have been using it for a week and already see and feel a tremendous difference.</li>
            <li>I felt good about myself and my nice delicate skin.</li>
            <li>ENJOY NEW AND RENEWED SKIN NOW!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;To get the perfect consistency, I mix this in a 2-oz Tupperware container with water: the first day, it&#x27;ll probably be a bit chunky and hard to spread; however, by day two or three, it&#x27;s the perfect thick cream consistency.</li>
            <li>Next day I felt that my face was very fresh and had some kind of glow.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more from all the high reviews.</li>
            <li>Why didn&#x27;t I know about this magical clay in high school??</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t recommend this combination of products highly enough.r, it absorbs the anti-aging cream even better.  </li>
            <li>I love this and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Love it and would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
            <li>Love the natural aspect of it!!</li>
            <li>love how soft it makes my skin!!</li>
            <li>Love this makes my skin so soft and no break out!!</li>
            <li>Other than that this stuff is MAGIC!!</li>
            <li>Aztec Secret Indian Clay gets 5/5 because it works great and is a wonderful natural way to clean skin of oil and clear the pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mixes well, goes on easy, no crazy smell and does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>My only word of caution is to be GENTLE taking it off and make sure you use lots of water because it can easily pull of your top layer of skin and cause redness.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was quick and efficient.&lt;br /&gt;Works great on facial scarring and clearing the pores, I will definitely be buying more soon.</li>
            <li>and right after I washed it, it was clean.</li>
            <li>As funny as it sounds, I think positive thinking has also helped, and if not, it has led me to some of the most helpful skin products I&#x27;ve yet discover.update</li>
            <li>As funny as it sounds, I think positive thinking has also helped, and if not, it has led me to some of the most helpful skin products I&#x27;ve yet discover.</li>
            <li>My face was soft, smooth, and feels very clean, and it helps my acne and oily skin stay under control.</li>
            <li>However, after the first use, my mother and I both saw huge improvements in our skin.</li>
            <li>Started noticing her skin more drier than normal.</li>
            <li>Best clay mask ever, I can feel the &amp;#34;pulsating&amp;#34; action on my face stronger than any other clay mask I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros- removes blackheads, leaves skin feeling baby-soft and fresh, makes skin feel super clean and fresh</li>
            <li>The first couple times I used it, my skin felt sooooo smooth but after awhile, I stopped feeling the effects and it didn&#x27;t do anything for my acne</li>
            <li>first of all, CHEAP.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so smooth after using it consistently.</li>
            <li>I am overall very pleased with this mask.</li>
            <li>I have used other face masks but this works the best so far.</li>
            <li>My curls had a lovely defined but looser pattern that I don&#x27;t normally get.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t even need very much!</li>
            <li>I still have a pretty filled container.</li>
            <li>Then you feel very gentle pulses!  </li>
            <li>After applying the first time my skin felt really smooth.</li>
            <li>, luckily it&#x27;s pretty cheap though so</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t spend the time to write reviews but this product is so brilliant</li>
            <li>I just used it for my first time, and my skin is baby bottom smooth.</li>
            <li>Avoid doing it warm, the results are far better when its chilled.&lt;br /&gt;3) Get a bucket, and a old wash cloth.</li>
            <li>Overall very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s normal, healthy, glowing self.</li>
            <li>This is normal, just know that the mask has worked its magic.</li>
            <li>Some people said to use a foundation brush, I just made sure the blush brush was one that was a bit courser than a normal one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and the very first time is used it (with apple cider vinegar)</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling very smooth and cleansed!</li>
            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in a long time.</li>
            <li>, this seems to be a good combo for skin starting to age noticeably, at a far more affordable price point than m</li>
            <li>It works and it feels good on the face but don&#x27;t leave it on for too long.</li>
            <li>This clay feels so good on your face, as long as you use ACV with it.</li>
            <li>I use a Konjac Sponge for a more natural version of a loofah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so far really loving this routine.</li>
            <li>i  use a non alcoholic witch hazel (the real kind) after rubbing the mask off.  </li>
            <li>I always make my facial mask with organic raw apple cider vinegar with &#x27;mother&#x27;; it mixes beautifully and results in a nice, smooth application.</li>
            <li>Hands down this is the best mud mask that I have purchased thus far!</li>
            <li>So far, I love it, and I feel like my teeth are just as clean as the fluoride stuff.</li>
            <li>If this is too strong, it may be a good idea to dilute it slightly with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It washes off easily enough with warm water and a clean washcloth.</li>
            <li>im actually removing all the gunk and keeping my skin nice and clean.</li>
            <li>usually apply it with regular apple cider vinegar (because the other kind is honestly a bit more than I am willing to spend) one to three times per week and have had excellent results.</li>
            <li>I had great results from Origins high priced charcoal clay mask and figured if I added the charcoal to the Aztec Clay the outcome would be the same.</li>
            <li>work for a plastic surgeon, and this mask is better than most things we sell as far as a safe, all around facial treatment that has no downtime and can be used by any skin type, while allowing the ability to customize the intensity and effects by adding a diluted apple vinegar solution vs water, or  lighter vs heavier layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Feel free to ask me any questions, everyone is different and this so far has been the most affordable effective product i have ever tried.</li>
            <li>This is literally the best face mask I have ever tried, and I&#x27;ve tried everything from high dollar chemical peels to organic Dead Sea minerals.</li>
            <li>I feel very clean, my skin is fresh and the next day my complection is so much better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyhoo, I find the plastic scoop method works the best, and leaves minimal clean up, as opposed to using a kitchen bowl and spoon which tend to leave quite a bit more mess.</li>
            <li>It will keep your skin looking healthy without giving you new pimples.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay people - I always do my research before buying a new product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pain to always have to mix up a new batch every time, and most of the time</li>
            <li>/&gt;Rosehip Oil is my new love when it comes to beauty products.</li>
            <li>&quot; I can tell you this is my new favorite and a must have --</li>
            <li>Love it can live with out it</li>
            <li>I have used it in a bath previously with great results.</li>
            <li>Whether oily or dry, your pores will be cleaned out and tightened and your skin will be bright and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You end up with a comfortable smooth, clean, clear complexion.</li>
            <li>its also great in bring black heads to the surface.</li>
            <li>After you take it off your face will be bright red and hot</li>
            <li>We look odd while we are wearing it, but our skin looks great when we are not.</li>
            <li>The apple cider vinegar that I used worked really well and made it easy to mix.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m redoing most of this review just because its gotten too long for most people to want to read.</li>
            <li>however, it might be too much for my easily irritated skin to handle.</li>
            <li>I like to use it just for the blackheads on my nose because it&#x27;s so strong that it really pulls everything out in one go.</li>
            <li>After 20 minutes, I use warm water to clear up, the skin feels soft, smooth and bright; my pores are smaller</li>
            <li>It is somewhat challenging to estimate how much you will need, and I ended up mixing too much my first time.</li>
            <li>Leave on until it is good and dry.  </li>
            <li>Today I washed with Cetophil, followed it with 100% natural witchhazel toner (Dickinson&#x27;s), applied the mask for 12 minutes, and finished with Sweet Blessed Bee Magic skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t clean my skin, it doesn&#x27;t clear my pores, to be totally honest it doesn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li>Great as a full face mask or just use it on your trouble areas.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it every night mixing it with apple cider vinegar and letting a good layer dry on my face for 30 minutes to an hour.</li>
            <li>If you do leave it on for more than the recommended time (30min I think) be prepared for a reddened face, but if it&#x27;s a cheap and deep clean</li>
            <li>This is the first mask I&#x27;ve bought that I actually feel like DOES SOMETHING, besides just feeling good.  </li>
            <li>After your acne is clear you can do this facial once to twice a week and continuously have beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>More importantly it helps clean the deep blackheads and acne areas!</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin, please use a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I first bought this at whole foods about a year ago and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and easy to  use just once a week is recommended.</li>
            <li>Cool product, really nice facial.</li>
            <li>My face didn&#x27;t dry out which was surprising.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m left with glowing, taut and clear beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff as after I use it, my pores are smaller and face feels clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>Really really good it pulls you pimples out and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin 😊</li>
            <li>Not gonna lie, it did leave my face quite dry after i used it, but it&#x27;s nothing that a good moisterizer can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall we love this product &amp; will continue to purchase this reasonably priced (so affordable) miracle in a tub!oduct &amp; will continue to purchase this reasonably priced (so affordable) miracle in a tub!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive combination skin, and I just LOVE what this does for my skin.</li>
            <li>So - you have to figure out the best plan of action in getting it off of you without putting it down the sink.</li>
            <li>I just used this for the first time today and my skin feels tighter and my pesky blackheads are gone!</li>
            <li>&amp; it was exactly as described!</li>
            <li>When I first started using it people kept asking me if i was preggo, because my face was glowing!</li>
            <li>I almost felt that I could do a wash and go for the first time in my life!</li>
            <li>Used this for the first time today since I was too excited to wait.</li>
            <li>first try, left my skin red but the results were really great! ....</li>

            <li>It really really works wonders!!</li>
            <li>I use this mixed with ACV, then an enzyme mask, followed up with a hydrating mask and my skin has never been better!</li>
            <li>I am so thankful I found this mask and would absolutely recommend this!!</li>
            <li>First application and voila!</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s pretty worth it!</li>
            <li>This is my first review because it deserves one!</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this product and i&#x27;m hooked!  </li>
            <li>it really does make your face pulsate when it dries!!</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference on my skin!!</li>
            <li>Get it there if it&#x27;s near you! :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be warned: You will break out at first in the beginning!</li>
            <li>Felt like a baby&#x27;s bottom for real!!</li>
            <li>Seems to be helping much at this time, after 2 uses!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this stuff!!!</li>
            <li>I mixed this product with apple cider video and really enjoyed the results!</li>
            <li>It works great if you don&#x27;t mind the mess.</li>
            <li>Ive been using it for only 2 weeks and not one pimple has grown and most of my acne scars have disappeared!</li>
            <li>I have done a number of masks but this is the first one where I felt the change in skin as soon as I put it on!</li>
            <li>I saw some results after the first use!</li>
            <li>Definitely one of my favorite face masks!</li>
            <li>I used to be the kind of person to be so inpatient with new products and wanted fast result</li>
            <li>right after my first try my face was as smooth as of a baby.</li>
            <li>My skin is cleaner, dry and free of oil, smoother, tighter, and feels amazing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes in a nice wide mouth tub with a screw lid, easy for scooping out</li>
            <li>It is a helpful resource for anyone wanting easy, credible tips on natural beauty alternatives.</li>
            <li>I also think it&#x27;s great for oily skin because it will dry up your face but not so much and not cause a breakout.</li>
            <li>This takes care of the acne, seems to even out both the oily and the dry skin, and BEST OF ALL, lessens the Rosacea redness and veiny look the next day.  </li>
            <li>mask would be AWESOME for people with OILY AND NOT SUPER SENSITIVE</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t magically cured my mild adult acne as some said but does help my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is much more matte now and feels super soft.</li>
            <li>Soo tight lol</li>
            <li>My skin felt very smooth and soft</li>
            <li>But this mask can really help and I&#x27;m so glad it makes my skin feel baby soft and has caused many pimples to disappear after the first application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I use a clean ceramic soap dish and hot water.  </li>
            <li>Just mix with water, use plastic gloves to apply to face, and allow to sit for 20 minutes, and use a hot wash cloth to clean it off.</li>
            <li>It is a pain to make it a consistent paste, and it is a pain to clean the sink and counter afterwards.</li>
            <li>I find it easier to mix &amp; apply with a clean make-up brush (foundation brush to be exact)</li>
            <li>My face was pretty clean</li>
            <li>All i wanted was a brighter look and maybe a bit of shine since my face was already pretty clean.</li>
            <li>It does leave your face feeling pretty clean.</li>
            <li>over the years this is my second jar which comes in plastic and is durable,this is a good face toner it you mix with water its a sacred mud thing if you try it its a jar of all you need for a healthy complextion water is needed 2 mix and until smooth apply and let get totally dry on face that is all 2 it</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling very smooth and soft but the lessening of breakouts make it well worth buying.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to use with apple cider vinegar (the high quality kind) to make a make a paste.</li>
            <li>This product is great, it help stop the little breakouts I would have from time to time.</li>
            <li>You most certainly need to be gentle with it.</li>
            <li>I have a tendency to get the quarter/silver dollar size hard, incredibly itchy bites.</li>
            <li>My face felt a little warm, but I&#x27;m sure I can attribute that to the blood vessels and circulation being enhanced or</li>
            <li>My face felt a little warm, but I&#x27;m sure I can attribute that to the blood vessels and circulation being enhanced or</li>
            <li>Use a large bowl filled with warm water and a wash cloth and dump it outside after you have removed this from your face.</li>
            <li>It is super soft and feels very clean.</li>
            <li>very good four stars because it&#x27;s only external....</li>
            <li>I used it back to back and got very good results the 1st time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;m super excited about this product and definitely recommend it :)</li>
            <li>Overall this is an amazing product</li>
            <li>I followed with a gentle witch hazel toner and some oil free spf lotion.</li>
            <li>it can help calm hives from the itching and burning too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is an amazing facial you mix with vinegar.</li>
            <li>I never would have thought a simple clay mask would be so amazing.</li>
            <li>it dries out acne within 24hrs and leave skin very cleansed and smooth.</li>
            <li>I use Witch Hazel (organic, fragrance free) and there have been no skin reactions to so much being done at once.  </li>
            <li>I used Apple Cider vinegar and made a very watery paste, which I applied with a make-up/shaving brush -- Fantastic results.</li>
            <li>really cleans face and leaves it feeling amazingly smooth.  </li>
            <li>it would be an truly amazing product you actually feel it working.</li>
            <li>I applied it to my bug bites (green fly) which</li>
            <li>Once you get it off your face feels so clean and your skin is super smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Such an amazing product.</li>
            <li>I am using this for amazing facial masks</li>
            <li>I only purchased it because of the amazing reviews it had and the price.</li>
            <li>It gives amazing results and even made by pores smaller!!!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this is natural and it really makes  your skin feel so smooth once you&#x27;ve washed it off.</li>
            <li>I was only using this clay for my face (which works amazingly for acne btw)</li>
            <li>I am so happy eiith this product and wish i can use it everyday.</li>
            <li>we used what still an amazing deep cleaning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten all my aunts to use it and some of them , well into their 50s, have gotten amazing results after using it multiple times.</li>
            <li>After such amazing results I wanted to immediately do it again</li>
            <li>and when I looked up at my makeup free face, I immediately noticed how much smoother my skin looked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this mask for several months now and have had amazing</li>
            <li>This stuff was intense and made my face feel baby smooth.</li>
            <li>My nose has been a huge problem my whole life, and i have tried everything.</li>
            <li>It was amazing and gross</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m going to give it a 2 stars because I immediately found something else that I liked a lot better and probably won&#x27;t bother using anymore of the clay mask and felt I sort of wasted my money on it.</li>
            <li>it was very deep cleaning and amazing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not clumpy if you add enough acv, real smooth creamy texture.</li>
            <li>I use it weekly as part of my facial routine and my skin always feels amazing after.</li>
            <li>WORLD&#x27;S MOST POWERFUL FACIAL is accurate.</li>
            <li>Again, there are plenty of websites out there that preach the amazing reasons to use this essential oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but my overall complexion is amazing,</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a great mask without all the harsh chemical you should give this a try</li>
            <li>I hope by using this mask often (everyday) for a week I will see great improvement in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I have larger pores and this mask is amazing.</li>
            <li>Second application, my face looked amazing.</li>
            <li>I used regular acv and it still worked amazingly well.</li>
            <li>Amazing product, especially mixed with apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li>i actually use this stuff every week on fridays and my skin is so amazing</li>
            <li>and I look like a different, fresh faced, amazing woman.</li>
            <li>Such a bargain and an amazing product.</li>
            <li>You should use the apple cider as recommended instead of water since it would make the paste to put on your face much smoother and clump free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s greatly improved my uneven skin tone and makes my skin look brighter and tighter after use.</li>
            <li>I will only use with apple cider vinegar but amazing.</li>
            <li>In the beginning I thought it was a great product, leaving my skin smooth &amp; drying (nothing that moisturizer/oil can&#x27;t fixed) but recently after applying it all over my face it was very itchy.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using it, my skin looks and feels amazing, and it actually does make your skin tingle while it&#x27;s drying.</li>
            <li>my face IS BRIGHT RED AND BURNING WHERE THE MASK WAS APPLIED AND GENTLY</li>
            <li>My makeup went on so much more smoothly the following morning</li>
            <li>It minimizes my pores and makes my face look fresh.</li>
            <li>This is truly the worlds best kept secret.</li>
            <li>and I recommend it to anyone wanting to change up their beauty regimen with something more natural and not chemically.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product as a last ditch effort to save myself a trip to the dermatologist and I am beyond thrilled.</li>
            <li>well worth it</li>
            <li>I did actually feel my skin pulsating and there is a nice cooling effect also</li>
            <li>This mask is powerful and literally pulls EVERYTHING (water, dirt, oil, etc) out.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like a big jar of dirt that you have to mix on your own.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it does help to clear my pores.</li>
            <li>I wash it off in a seperate bin of warm waterd drain it outside!</li>
            <li>The nice thing is that the gritty texture acts as a exfoliating scrub as you are removing it.</li>
            <li>worth a try, its affordable and bullet proof.</li>
            <li>its worth a try, its affordable and bullet proof.</li>
            <li>can honestly say, after one use, that my skin feels and looks younger.  </li>
            <li>I mix this with equal parts apple cider vinegar and use it as a face mask - works great, my skin glows and is really soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>and I did feel my face actually pulsate, and the feeling of my face afterward is nice as well.</li>
            <li>Nice product, my face is oily, and that product really help me, complete recommend that</li>
            <li>It is worth the money</li>
            <li>I recommend this for anyone who especially has acne, or any kind of skin problem</li>
            <li>But I feel that its worth the trouble to get the great results.</li>
            <li>and now I rarely get zits ..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money--</li>
            <li>Better than Queen Helene&#x27;s Mint Julep mask and Lush&#x27;s Mask in Magnaminty.</li>
            <li>Trust me, it&#x27;s SO worth</li>
            <li>Trust me, it&#x27;s SO worth it.</li>
            <li>it is definitely worth a try, though.</li>
            <li>I felt the pulsating which was pretty cool.</li>
            <li>is directly after cleansing, I mix this 1:1 with distilled water and add a teaspoon of my favorite toner.</li>
            <li>So I decided to turn to a more natural alternative.</li>
            <li>but i figured it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li>and my skin looks healthy and clear.</li>
            <li>get this clay which is natural, cruelty free and loaded with minerals!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>okay using this mixture with was some tiny cheap brush</li>
            <li>okay using this mixture with was some tiny cheap brush</li>
            <li>I mixed the clay with the apple cider vinegar, but I have a friend who tried it with just water and liked it as well.</li>
            <li>thing worth noting:</li>
            <li>I mix up my own personalized clay mixture with the following ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Jump into warm shower (during shower, I wash my face last).</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd week of using this product and honestly, I cannot say it does miracles</li>
            <li>I put a warm washcloth over my face for a couple minutes to open up my pores and then applied the paste.</li>
            <li>Hello economical product</li>
            <li>The good thing about this sandwich bag method is that if you have any extra (and I always make too much)</li>
            <li>if you can with stand it then its all worth it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Months later update (6/11/11)&lt;br /&gt;I kept using this because I liked how it pulled out all the oil</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good mask for oily skin, but be careful it can clog your pipe drains like cement.</li>
            <li>The quantity you receive for the price is worth it, I recommend this stuff to my friends.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it does wonders for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I love mud masks, I make natural masks myself and was unsure about this one, but MAN did it exceed my expectations.</li>
            <li>My skin actually felt really nice after.  </li>
            <li>naturally if you want more then just follow through (eg 2 teaspoons one teaspoon of h20 or</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and my color looks so much better.</li>
            <li>and it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite thing I have bought off amazon.</li>
            <li>But if you use it more frequently like 2x a weeks you should use a moisturizing face mask as well.</li>
            <li>This clay is fun to mix up, like playing in mud.  </li>
            <li>Useful</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li>This product is 6$ and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The feeling of tightness/pulling results in a really effective deep cleaning of the skin.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth the effort.</li>
            <li>My face almost always reacts to face washes, so that&#x27;s kind of a regular happening.</li>
            <li>It was worth</li>
            <li>All worth a try...</li>
            <li>This product was worth taking the time to write a review..</li>
            <li>I did that the first time and did not get the full effect of the mask.</li>
            <li>Used a big bowl with warm water and a wash cloth to take off.</li>
            <li>Honestly, about a tablespoon is enough for your face</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to mix up and use</li>
            <li>but I guess it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>and I rarely breakout.</li>
            <li>This is so worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many mud masks over the years &amp; having my face pulse is pretty normal to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a fun product to use.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll edit when it&#x27;s off to let you know how it goes, but i&#x27;m enjoying it tentatively thus far.</li>
            <li>It works well giving my face a fresh glow and seem to have reduced the pores on my nose.  </li>
            <li>It is worth every penny and you can use it everywhere on the body even on scratches- dries up in a jiffy.</li>
            <li>However it is powerful.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and looks so much better.</li>
            <li>and it seems to be fun.</li>
            <li>I rarely break out anymore</li>
            <li>It was well worth the smoother skin and reduced acne.  </li>
            <li>It was well worth the smoother skin and reduced acne.  </li>
            <li>i LOVE using any type of natural clay in my skincare regimen.</li>
            <li>but this so far is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Kinda fun to mix it yourself</li>
            <li>After I rinse off the mask with a warm, damp washcloth and moisturize, my skin literally feels like butter, my pores are visibilly reduced, and my overall tone is improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Your hair will look and feel soft, shiny, healthy and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>With most face masks I can&#x27;t see any noticeable difference between the before/after, but within a day of using this my skin is soft and acne/redness is under control.</li>
            <li>After applying try not to smile or laugh...</li>
            <li>ehhh actually do smile and laugh</li>
            <li>Like many others said, this thing does pull away oil and make your skin feel soft.  </li>
            <li>I used warm water but still got a lot of tiny clumps.  </li>
            <li>I have used it twice so far and love the results.  </li>
            <li>: Mix this with natural yoghurt to create a better paste.</li>
            <li>I say it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I say it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the $10.</li>
            <li>I gave it 5 stars because it is totally worth it for the price and benefits.</li>
            <li>After every masque session, I use Thayer&#x27;s all natural Witch Hazel Rose toner (you can also find this at Whole Foods) and it soothes, cleanses, and closes up those opened pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>More product used the thicker and stronger the throbbing action is&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>Make sure to mix with apple cider vinegar for best effect (stinks, but whatever!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>I have been making my own facial masks for years, using ingredients that we all probably have located in our kitchens.</li>
            <li>I then removed the mask 20 minutes later in the shower with warm water and my hands.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that you feel instant results of freshness and smoothness on your face.</li>
            <li>but the results are worth it.  </li>
            <li>Fun tip:  </li>
            <li>I tried this as a face mask and liked it overall.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying.  </li>
            <li>I feel like it gives your face a fresh start.</li>
            <li>I used this one time so far, and I love it.</li>
            <li>this would be worth a try.</li>
            <li>Although I liked the way my face felt during and after wearing the mask, the next morning I&#x27;d wake up to 3-4 pimples on my forehead</li>
            <li>Those three ingredients are found in most acne treatment creams and face washes, so I had to steer clear of those.</li>
            <li>laugh lines.</li>
            <li>Who knew this stuff could be so useful?</li>
            <li>No artificial anything.</li>
            <li>Your skin feels fresh and glowing when you rinse off.</li>
            <li>For some, it may be useful.</li>
            <li>I can already tell this product is paving the way for success after 8 years, and hopefully with use of this I will be at ease.</li>

            <li>If you find this useful, please like the button that says you found it useful.</li>
            <li>I rarely have a breakout.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff, its as good as anything else you could use, you can mix it with different things depending on your needs.</li>
            <li>but by the time i wash it off my skin is so fresh.</li>
            <li>If u know ur skin very well u should be able to know when it starts to feel congested as if it has to much build up and junk in it.</li>
            <li>My skin has NEVER been more clear.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First, this stuff is pretty sweet.</li>
            <li>When mixed thoroughly it has a kind of \\&quot;whipped\\&quot; consistency.  </li>
            <li>That would be worth it.</li>
            <li>That would be worth it. ...</li>
            <li>Mixing it with vinegar makes it twice as powerful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit of work, but it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>and I am able to keep it on until it completely dries with no issues (using apple cider vinegar).</li>
            <li>So if you decide the risk is worth</li>
            <li>but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>For the price I got a lot for my money&#x27;s worth and will use it all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this product twice but am thrilled by the results.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth reading still, for those who&#x27;d like to know.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The next morning, I saw many pimples that have come to light...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a lot of product, so it&#x27;s really worth the price too.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff it makes your face soft.</li>
            <li>, I must say a best kept secret until I stumbled upon it here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Soft, almost pore free skin!</li>
            <li>Thus far I&#x27;m glad I made the decision.  </li>
            <li>After that it wasn&#x27;t worth the cleanup, the product had lost its allure for me.</li>
            <li>I love you so much, it is helped improve the texture of mine and my husband skin so much.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I apply lush cosmetics catastrophe cosmetic on top of the redness.</li>
            <li>Removing it is a chore in itself, but the results are well worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that a nice, even layer enough to cover your skin is all that&#x27;s needed.</li>
            <li>I guess if I liked the product enough, I would feel like</li>
            <li>Wow, it is definitely the strongest mask I have ever experienced.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels nice after I did the mask, and the pores on my nose do look smaller.</li>
            <li>but after this, worth it.</li>
            <li>; this may be dirt, but dirt worth every penny.</li>
            <li>My skin is very oily, especially in the summer, and this stuff does a great job of balancing my skin out and clearing up acne fast.  </li>
            <li>I can nearly promise that you&#x27;ll be happy with the results.the face than on the body; I&#x27;ve yet to try it on my facial</li>
            <li>Make-up is easier to apply and makes my face look fresh and renewed.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve also developed more acne.  </li>
            <li>It is all worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is worth it.</li>
            <li>And to be perfectly honest, the only reason I am using a separate moisturizer for daytime and nighttime is</li>
            <li>The next day my makeup went on my face so smoothly and my pores were looking much better.</li>
            <li>Its definitely worth it though.</li>
            <li>This product definitely tightens the skin and leaves it feeling nice and cleansed.  </li>
            <li>I am trying to use more natural products and stay away from chemical-based items, for that reason this product appealed to me.  </li>
            <li>it!This stuff is pretty sweet.</li>
            <li>Definitely have a nice face cream on hand after washing this stuff off.</li>
            <li>So far, I love hemp oil--</li>
            <li>But its totally worth it and goes away...</li>
            <li>I also apply aloe vera (fresh) on scars and redness to speed up the healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then I saw some reviews on this stuff and thought that it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>Then i mixed it with apple cider vinegar, much more smooth consistency</li>
            <li>Many people as well as myself recommend that you use an old make up brush or shaving brush to mix and apply the mask.</li>
            <li>This is very much worth</li>
            <li>This is very much worth</li>
            <li>and afterwards my face feels fresh</li>
            <li>(even with the cons it is worth it to me)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had this product for over a year and it is truly powerful.</li>
            <li>I then rinse my face with warm water just to remove any residue that was left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>that if it works it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>This product is no frills, but is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>After mixing this with apple cider and vinegar, my face feel soft and supple like a baby&#x27;s bottom :) .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pain to take off but worth the results.</li>
            <li>I mix it with apple cider vinegar and leave it on for 10 mins since my skin is more sensitive.</li>
            <li>, I couldn&#x27;t smile hehe</li>
            <li>but once I baught it it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>Hyper pigmentation always looks so much better - sometimes the marks are completely gone.</li>
            <li>Hyper pigmentation always looks so much better - sometimes the marks are completely gone.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>This stuff is worth the hype &amp; the five-star rating.</li>
            <li>I left it for about 15 minutes and rinsed it out with warm water.</li>
            <li>Love this for managing my adult acne, along with apple cider  vinegar.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>then it said it would which was really exciting.</li>
            <li>oh well, it&#x27;d be a fun thing to do.</li>
            <li>It arrived earlier than expected and sealed perfectly.</li>
            <li>With over 70 minerals, what more can you ask for in an all natural product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m someone who has used so many different products because it has always been important for me to take care of my skin.  </li>
            <li>For a price you can&#x27;t beat and frequent use its grand for us oil producing madhouses.</li>
            <li>When the mask dries though you can&#x27;t smile or else it hurts a lot.</li>
            <li>I just eyeball enough of the clay to put on my face and add warm water to it as needed when I mix it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better pore cleansers, but this one is supposedly natural.</li>
            <li>Then I saw the price and was even more surprised..</li>
            <li>I left it on for twenty minutes then rinsed with WARM water, and I&#x27;ve got to tell you while I was rinsing it off</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok so far, I&#x27;ve use it on face and it feel refreshed afterward.</li>
            <li>: Simple, natural clay mask, great for weekly or twice weekly use.</li>
            <li>stuff is totally worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But, I don&#x27;t think it was worth it...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had acne on and off for the better part of my young life.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth a try.  </li>
            <li>If anything, it only exacerbated my acne, which honestly wasn&#x27;t even that severe to begin with.</li>
            <li>I use it with Apple Cider Vinegar, and I love how it &amp;#34;foams&amp;#34; up and feels so soft going on to my face.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the product thus far.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really not that good.</li>
            <li>I love how  soft my face feels.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews</li>
            <li>Its worth it</li>
            <li>the mixture isn&#x27;t lumpy, but I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li>product is worth it and has been the strongest acne solution I&#x27;ve ever use and trust me</li>
            <li>I love this clay and you get such a generous amount for such a good price.</li>
            <li>but hey, it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>Completely amazed at how well this pile of dirt works :)</li>
            <li>Well worth the effort.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t cute the acne completely cuz they are teenagers after all.</li>
            <li>The last 2 times I have done it on my own</li>
            <li>Make sure you apply it with your hands for a thicker application, and when you&#x27;re ready to take it off, wet a washcloth in warm water, put it up to your face in sections and it just wipes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Love it so far.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still totally worth it.</li>
            <li>It actually was nice on my skin</li>
            <li>I can honestly state that my skin has improved and is actually glowing.</li>
            <li>Baiden mitten in the shower to exfoliate, clay mask, a nice facial oil or lotion to finish up.</li>
            <li>It may stink but it&#x27;s totally worth it for the results.</li>
            <li>All organic which makes it useful to anyone.</li>
            <li>Honestly the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the Apple Cider Vinegar smell...</li>
            <li>The great thing is that after using the mask it unclogs pores without the pain and swelling that happens from unclogging pores with a professional facial.</li>
            <li>This is mother natures best kept beauty secret.</li>
            <li>Just make sure that you do not allow this powder to come into contact with any metal as it will decrease its natural healing properties.</li>
            <li>My mom actually ended up purchasing her own tub to take home after her visit.</li>
            <li>If you invite your girlfriends over for a fun spa night to use this mud, they will kill you.</li>
            <li>If you invite your girlfriends over for a fun spa night to use this mud, they will kill you.</li>
            <li>I expected good things</li>
            <li>Many masques I have used for sensitive skin have done nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li>It tightens my pores and leaves my face fresh.</li>
            <li>but it is soooooo worth it.  </li>
            <li>Bought this with some Bragg&#x27;s Apple Cider Vinegar, and it was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth a try</li>
            <li>I received this in the mail today, I am a 34 yr old mother of 3 and have suffered with acne/blackheads most of my life.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend using it on your hair, since it will take out all your hair&#x27;s natural oil and will leave your hair oiler since your hair is trying to restore all the lost oil by producing more oil.</li>
            <li>cause i love natural beauty products and face masques.</li>
            <li>Powerful stuff,</li>
            <li>My skin is really sensitive to most products.</li>
            <li>but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>If you have not tried Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque, its worth a shot.</li>
            <li>The Aztec Secret is AMAZING!!!!</li>
            <li>I love this face mask, it helps to keep my acne at bay while helping to keep my pores clear.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend the Origin Charcoal Mask over this product, it&#x27;s definitely worth your money.</li>
            <li>but it would be worth it if I saw results</li>
            <li>This is a fun product.  </li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s all natural too.</li>
            <li>Def worth the hype.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to mix up, all goopy and muddy.</li>
            <li>After the mask completely dries rinse it off gently with warm water.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have it on right now (for the first time) and it does pulsate and burn!</li>
            <li>The skin is so clean, smooth and tight afterwards, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how effective it is against acne, but my skin feel clean, smooth and tight after doing the mask for 20 mins.  </li>
            <li>Normally, using any kind of product that many days would wreak havoc on my skin, break me out, and dry the eff out of my face.  </li>
            <li>I leave my mask on for 20-30 minutes to make sure it&#x27;s completely dry (you won&#x27;t be able to move your face easily, haha!)</li>
            <li>My skin became much less combination and much more normal, it&#x27;s good, man.</li>
            <li>I started using this clay as a mask because reviews were very positive about how it helps with acne problems.</li>
            <li>When I feel like I need to, I like to use a nose strip right after, just to get what&#x27;s left over, and my nose has never ever been clearer, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Using something natural on your face makes more since than putting chemicals on it, right??</li>
            <li>Very affordable and very worth it.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel nice and tight and clean!</li>
            <li>So, if you don&#x27;t mind paying $120 to a dermatologist to calm and soothe your skin and keep yourself from looking like a zombie with skin falling off your face, then go right ahead.  </li>
            <li>Once the mask is rinsed off, my skin is slightly red, but feels very clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>Microdermabrasion does the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it kind of feels the same as an acid peel, I&#x27;d definitely have a good soothing moisturizer with high SPF on hand - like 50 or 55 - before going outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I chose this mask due to the reviews and low price, felt it the best pick.  </li>
            <li>It surely works for many other people.</li>
            <li>I did many of the other reviews before trying it out to make sure I was using it correctly.  </li>
            <li>We use this for saddle sores (cycling) and various other skin eruptions and it works greatly!!  </li>
            <li>However, if mixed with other ingredients it is a wonderful detox tool.  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless, the effects are not as stunning as said by some people, yes, it would clean your skin nicely, but do not expect it to change your complexion dramatically, at least it was not the case for me.</li>
            <li>My fiance and I used it and it was fun putting it on each other and the both of us loved how it felt,once we took it off.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t even really get &amp;#34;strays&amp;#34; anymore; my face has never looked so clear and felt so clean :)</li>
            <li>Super Fast Shipping Speed!</li>
            <li>I used super hot water on the rag and wrung it out and laid it on my face to soften the mask (like they do at the spa), then rubbed the mask off keeping the chunks inside the rag and using the bowl to dump the clumps into.</li>
            <li>creative, it&#x27;s a pure product and high quality.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be hard to rinse off, but it wasn&#x27;t ( rinsed off very easily with warm water).  </li>
            <li>I could feel tightening and sucking, it feels kind of nice, fresh, relaxing, cooling, I was happy already, I did get frustrated at removal, I think that final battle to reclaim your face may be the cause for the irritation which in my case was very mild.</li>
            <li>Use a good hot-as-you-can-stand-it wet, rough washcloth to repeatedly wipe it off, then wash your face in warm water, finish in cool water.  </li>
            <li>omg love this in connection with this raw honey, vitamin c serum and rose water toner</li>
            <li>My face really feels fresh and clean of all impurities.</li>
            <li>I love this mask , saves my skin every time I need a deep clean.</li>
            <li>once off my skin felt clean and free of any grime or old makeup.</li>
            <li>I left it on for about 20 - 25 minutes (durring which time you cannot speak as the mask is SUPER tight) and when I rinsed it off my face felt incredible!  </li>
            <li>I find it makes my skin very clean and surprisingly soft.</li>
            <li>It is a very strong and powerful clay and I can feel it penetrating deep into my pores.</li>
            <li>still have blackheads and breakouts, but this clay has significantly improved the size and amount of the blackheads on my nose and keeps my skin from being oily- in spite of living in a very humid place.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>This is what I did, I used this straight for about 4 days, I mixed it with the apple cider vinegar, and also, I diluted a tablespoon of the apple cider vinegar  in water and drank it (no silly, without the clay) as it is good for you, don&#x27;t worry about the taste...</li>
            <li>More importantly, the small bumps I&#x27;ve had on my forehead that I&#x27;ve never been able to get rid of?</li>
            <li>as shampoo for problem scalp -- see other good reviews on this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It hasen&#x27;t really made a significant a change in my skin</li>
            <li>, it seems to do some good, but nothing like the other reviewers claimed.  </li>
            <li>That said this is a good powder for other stuff.</li>
            <li>Really clears the pores, and is fun!</li>
            <li>I read a whole lot of reviews regarding this mask and was really excited to use it.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve just finished my very first application process and so far not bad!</li>
            <li>not seeing the results in other reviews, but good.</li>
            <li>but I make sure to keep it really moisturized with a high spf sunblock.</li>
            <li>Because of the really high reviews and people writing success stories, I was filled with hope.</li>
            <li>Upon reading the numerous amounts of good reviews on this product, I had high expectations.</li>
            <li>I have this mask on right now as I&#x27;m typing this review.  </li>
            <li>I always put a nose strip on right after I wash this off.</li>
            <li>She uses it once a week right now.  </li>
            <li>I got it right away</li>
            <li>but to me something doesn&#x27;t seem right.</li>
            <li>and it comes RIGHT OFF.</li>
            <li>and it comes RIGHT OFF.</li>
            <li>so I bought it right away.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it right away.</li>
            <li>Add some water and clay into the tupperware until you get the right mixture, then stir with a plastic spoon until all the lumps are gone.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just itchy right away</li>
            <li>I did have a bit of peeling around the mouth area, but I exfoliated this morning and it came right off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wearing it right now (face &amp; neck)...</li>
            <li>This clay worked right after I used it.</li>
            <li>I put the mask on right away and afterwards</li>
            <li>I recieved it in the mail today as and of course tried it right away.  </li>
            <li>read the label &amp; it will get you going in the right direction.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m taking some acne medication</li>
            <li>Now, I don&#x27;t want to go into a pep talk lecture here, so let me get right to it, but I just want you all to know that 1)</li>
            <li>I mix it with Braggs Apple Cider vinegar until I have just the right consistency and leave it on for about 15-30 minutes and as soon as you rinse you notice and feel a difference.</li>
            <li>you get it in order to kinda turn your face around to the right direction.</li>
            <li>I went to the dermatologist right around the time that I bought this.  </li>
            <li>But go with what feels right for</li>
            <li>If you just jump right in and smear the cloth over your face you&#x27;re going to scream like Macaulay in Home</li>
            <li>But fear not, this stuff wipes right off anything.</li>
            <li>But fear not, this stuff wipes right off anything.</li>
            <li>it PULSATE to the point of tuck and pull the skin right off of my face while having a mask of burning needles jabbing at it all at once.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps this is a misuse of the the review feature, but right now (9/12/2013)</li>
            <li>It was all right, but after using it my skin was still clogged up.</li>
            <li>Right afer</li>
            <li>I can just mix the right amount I need just for that moment.</li>
            <li>Just try it and you will notice the benefits right away.</li>
            <li>Use a moisturizer right after use, because it does draw everything out of pores.</li>
            <li>You can see the difference right away.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see results right away but after trying it</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t put it on right before going out.</li>
            <li>so i rinsed it off right away.</li>
            <li>Well, it didn&#x27;t happen right away.  </li>
            <li>I like to moisture right away.</li>
            <li>so maybe I didn&#x27;t apply it right</li>
            <li>Still need to get the mixing done right to avoid clumps though.</li>
            <li>I prefer doing this right before a shower because it&#x27;s easier to wash off in the shower (comes off in chunks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:</li>
            <li>and I just washed it off right away in the shower</li>
            <li>I have some of this mask on my chin right now</li>
            <li>But I do this right before bed and go to sleep.</li>
            <li>Noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li>and I have it on right now.</li>
            <li>The mask is also drying so use moisturizer right after.</li>
            <li>Works like a charm, right from day#1.</li>
            <li>If using water this will not have the right consistency .</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think I used right.</li>
            <li>This right here will change your life.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t the right product for me.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use it right before going out.  </li>
            <li>I got this 2 days ago and tried it right away at night.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The price was right</li>
            <li>I use a spoon to scoop some out and then mix it with organic apple cider vinegar until I get the right consistency.</li>
            <li>RIGHT</li>
            <li>u just popped and it will heal right up.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t feel anything happening right off the bat.</li>
            <li>right.</li>
            <li>This stuff cleared me right up.</li>
            <li>I was a bit miffed at the person who shipped it, since they put their product sticker right over the instructions for use.</li>
            <li>Make it – clumps up, you have to stir it forever to make it right consistency.</li>
            <li>It happened right after I changed my shampoo.</li>
            <li>Right now.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I never had the right technique, or my instinctual nature to squirt something out of a tube</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t recommend to do a mask right before going out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a bit of a hassle to make the mask right.</li>
            <li>My friend is a make-up artist and recommended me this product, so I jumped right into it.</li>
            <li>it came right on time.</li>
            <li>I uses it right away</li>
            <li>, when you put it on right , you do feel a tingle</li>
            <li>the price is right.</li>
            <li>Right now I am about to start my cycle</li>
            <li>right before I get my period</li>
            <li>Apply to your desired area right away.</li>
            <li>Put the product in the baggie agger water mix it up with the baggie over your hand inside out and rubbed the mask on your face after you covered your face turned the baggie right side out and put it in the trash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just tricky to get the right consistency.  </li>
            <li>so I purchased it right away....</li>
            <li>I also noticed that for me the areas around my mouth and nose are a little more sensitive, so practice makes perfect in determining how much to use and where your sensitive spots are.</li>
            <li>Other reviewers have said to use an oil free moisturizer after, I&#x27;m not sure why it has to be oil free, but I listened to them and have been very happy with the results.eave</li>
            <li>Other reviewers have said to use an oil free moisturizer after, I&#x27;m not sure why it has to be oil free, but I listened to them and have been very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Quick, easy, and no mess.</li>
            <li>Great with raw Apple cinder vinegar.</li>
            <li>Okay, let&#x27;s get down to it: There are hundreds of rave reviews on this product, and like many other people reading through these, I thought it was too good to be true.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow - I don&#x27;t normally write reviews for things that often, but this stuff is honestly amazing.</li>
            <li>its pretty messy too but works great</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product -- the first time I used the mask I mixed with water</li>
            <li>My skin was tightening that I can barely move my facial muscles lol.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin, and I was fine.</li>
            <li>It really gives me a clean feeling after use.</li>
            <li>Was recommended this by a friend and feel that it really does clean out my pores.</li>
            <li>This really does clean your skin and pores well.</li>
            <li>I washed it off with warm water, patting first to soften the clay back up.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time last night and my face felt nice afterwards</li>
            <li>This makes a quick, effective facial and is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>This mask really makes your face feel clean.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay, this is one of the best masks I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>and you apply it out of the package, but this Aztec clay is far more intense!</li>
            <li>really pulls out all the oil and dirt from your skin, leaving it squeaky clean; and also helps a lot with breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I have recently started to mix my clay with hot distilled water and apply the mask while it is still warm</li>
            <li>Mix with apple cider vinegar for an intense clean, or just water for something lighter....</li>
            <li>We have used this for spa, and first aide I love this product - and it is natural.</li>
            <li>What a great job it does for so little money!</li>
            <li>my skin has never felt this amazing and if you&#x27;ve gone through life wishing for beautiful skin you will understand why such a strong reaction to such a little thing.</li>
            <li>If you want to keep your plumbing clear and save on paper towels, put a medium to large bowl (like a large salad bowl) in your sink and fill it with warm water.</li>
            <li>Just as it says in the description, it is a very strong facial mask.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to be over zealous and end up with a lot left over.</li>
            <li>Just tried the clay mask for the first time and i really like it!!</li>
            <li>I cant wait to see what several more times of using this will do!:) Definitely buying again.</li>
            <li>so you can stir out the clumps and make a smooth paste the day of use.&lt;br /&gt;**A high quality paper towel over the drain to avoid clogging.&lt;br /&gt;***Add</li>
            <li>and when I did my face (pregnant and couldnt stomach the vinegar smell on myself), I used moroccan rose water the first time and pure aloe vera the second.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s in a huge container and will last probably a full year!</li>
            <li>Anyway, I love this package, it just looks cool in a natural and classic sense.</li>
            <li>Once I rinsed out the mask, my curly, dry, chemically processed hair was softer, more manageable and cleaner than ever!  </li>
            <li>Afterward my skin feels dry, but I love that feeling because it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve never felt before!  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft, clean, and supple!</li>
            <li>new favorite is the Real Chemistry 3 Minute Peel.  </li>
            <li>I also use this on my face as I have very large pores.  </li>
            <li>I have very large pores and this shrinks them  every time.</li>
            <li>Great Company, hands down!!</li>
            <li>Leaves your face slightly damp and your pores open as an excellent prep for the mask.</li>
            <li>Since then I have repeated this procedure every 3 or 4 days and the results just keep getting better and better and my skin seems to be producing less oil.</li>
            <li>I mixed it with vinegar and the mixture was silky smooth and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently purchased super adorable backless shirts and tanks as a celebratory notion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works very well and is super fun to use.</li>
            <li>A gem, I still require a facial by a professional but this does a very good job at cleaning out the old layers of skin on my face.</li>
            <li>After you get the right consistency down, you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>(raw)and  it came across as a little on the runny side, but honestly after reapplying to my face, it applied fine.</li>
            <li>The single most important thing to do after using this clay is to moisturize.</li>
            <li>I was seriously surprised at how nice my skin looked, fresh and clear.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, I am blessed with good skin that makes me look like late 20s, but regardless I know that I am very close to showing signs of aging :).</li>
            <li>I usually get facials at the spa, but this is a great product for use between visits.  </li>
            <li>You really can feel your face pulsating, but it&#x27;s not painful.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in the top of it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, it is very useful and works wonders.&lt;br</li>
            <li>idk if that&#x27;s true but I will say it worked really well</li>
            <li>Went through all the reviews and found them very help full.</li>
            <li>It is very drying by design, so I recommend following it up with your favorite LIGHT nighttime moisturizer and going night-night.  </li>
            <li>On rare occasions, I hit Severe level 1 with a deep cyst or two, but haven&#x27;t experienced that recently.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too fond on using commercial product on my face and like to keep it as natural as possible, so this has been perfect!</li>
            <li>i love clay in general.</li>
            <li>It is worth it for anyone willing to try it.</li>
            <li>I love this product and even though I have only tried it once, it was by far shown me more results in 1 day than any face wash or acne medicine I&#x27;ve ever used in weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s true, this stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li>It can be messy to take off but it makes my skin feel amazing!</li>
            <li>This product did not work as well for me as it apparently has for so many.</li>
            <li>If the pimple is small, then when the mask comes off it might not be noticeable at all, which is great.</li>
            <li>This is another gift I purchased for my sister, I myself have used it with great success, the only thing is it must be mixed with apple cider vinegar!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re interested.</li>
            <li>Get some, get messy, and get the most smooth, supple, blemish free skin you&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li>I never get full rating but really this thing works</li>
            <li>If you want to prevent clogged drains (cus let&#x27;s face it, we are paying for mud), get a big bowl with warm water, wash most of it off, throw that water outside, and then finish washing the rest of your face in the sink.</li>
            <li>After I got out and put some face moisturizer on, my face felt SUPER clean and soft!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take long to make, I mix mine with just warm water.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to lie, it is pretty intense, but all worth it!</li>
            <li>but my skin was so soft and clean and it sucked the oil right out of my skin!</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re like me and have super large pores that would like them to disappear before you leave the house, but don&#x27;t have the time for a full mask routine added to getting yourself ready for the world, then try this:</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re like me and have super large pores that would like them to disappear before you leave the house, but don&#x27;t have the time for a full mask routine added to getting yourself ready for the world, then try this:</li>
            <li>It takes a bit of practice to get the right amount and make the clay paste just right, but the results on the skin are really visible!</li>
            <li>I use this about every week to really get into my pores and clean them out and let me just say that this really works!</li>
            <li>It began to flake off after about 15 minutes and since it&#x27;s clay, I didn&#x27;t think it was a good idea to wash it down the drains</li>
            <li>It was a fine pore-cleansing mask that was light on the face, but I didn&#x27;t feel like it had rid me of zits or extra deep-cleaned anything.  </li>
            <li>This is such a fine powder, it goes on so smooth.  </li>
            <li>I wore an old tank top and hosed off 90% of the clay in the yard and used a large face cloth to help with removal .</li>
            <li>Apple cider vinegar makes the clay smooth and easy to apply (although it smells pretty gross).</li>
            <li>me begin by warning others that before you open the can that it is a VERY FINE POWDER.</li>
            <li>Irritated my skin a little bit but overall it&#x27;s an awesome product!</li>
            <li>I have realized that if you make the consistency a little bit thicker it does work better then if it is on the more liquidy side.</li>
            <li>My skin looked a little clearer after the first (successful) application.</li>
            <li>the way I been using it is I take 1 tablespoon and add about 1 tablespoon of  apple cider vinegar, and start mixing it, then I apply it around my face, if the mixing is still more watery add a little bit more of the clay and mix again...</li>
            <li>Great product, very messy, gets everywhere</li>
            <li>I did another mask the following night, but didn&#x27;t leave it on as long, and my skin is just getting better and better!  </li>
            <li>I havent used it a whole lot but its great because it doesn&#x27;t expire as fast as the other pre-made face masks do.</li>
            <li>Only used twice so far, but so far so good!</li>
            <li>However, I could see improved results right from the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>After using it for the first time, I can already see the difference, my skin is incredibly smooth and feels nice and tight.</li>
            <li>it just came right out and healed within a day, which is pretty freaking amaizng.</li>
            <li>If your smart then you research your skin/beauty products before purchasing them, look no furthur!</li>
            <li>The nicest thing is the large amount of clay you get for the price!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product and it&#x27;s fun to use with friends!</li>
            <li>I have good skin that occasionally gets congested and a bit bumpy, but isn&#x27;t overly sensitive or acne prone.  </li>
            <li>the container claims,  i do use the mask at night though just to allow me skin time to freak out before seeing anyone outside of my house, just in case but so far so good.</li>
            <li>It works great although I haven&#x27;t used it with vinegar, I used it with water and the consistency wasn&#x27;t thin and smooth but my face felt like it was being cleansed and getting tighter by the minute.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for a good, deep clean.</li>
            <li>It is natural and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>For now, just using it as a mask is giving me more than my money&#x27;s worth back in results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This clay is great if you need a deep cleansing mask that you only need to use once or twice a month.  </li>
            <li>This clay is great if you need a deep cleansing mask that you only need to use once or twice a month.  </li>
            <li>Kind of made my face itch in some places, super, super messy during removal</li>
            <li>Works great but made my skin super dry so intensive moisturizing is necessary.</li>
            <li>Price, natural, and easy to follow directions.</li>
            <li>The toner that I find most beneficial for my skin type is the Paula&#x27;s Choice Purely Natural Gentle Toner.</li>
            <li>Im not going to exaggerate this review and call it a black hole in your face, but it does a good job.</li>
            <li>Once it is completely dry and you feel like your lips and eyes are about to burst, go wash it off with warm water.</li>
            <li>I went to take the mask off and realized “um wow okay this stuff is really, really, really hardened on there”</li>
            <li>It feels good to the face when it&#x27;s starting to dry, and rinsing off was relatively easy...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even gotten my skin totally smooth and blemish free, but of course those pesky hormonal blemishes come back.</li>
            <li>Larger pores that I tend to have around my nose were also a great deal smaller.</li>
            <li>The blackheads came back quickly, so will need to use this more often, but was amazed that it pulled them all out the first try (after a hot shower).  </li>
            <li>It really does help maintain healthy clear looking skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m somewhere between mild and severe acne, and this mask really calms my skin.</li>
            <li>It does pull your face skin back, and being all natural, it is a good alternative to some chemical masks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find more natural, organic solutions since reading [[ASIN:1456613588 Age-Proof: Beauty Alternatives You Need to Know]], which I also highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for deep cleansing your pores especially used with Braggs Apple Cider Vinegar .</li>
            <li>I really liked this clay for a facial masks, It really did make a difference.</li>
            <li>sure to follow the instructions, don&#x27;t put too much product on your face and rinse off completely and thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and didn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive skin(my eczema).  </li>
            <li>once it;s finished my skin is super soft and it feels really clean.</li>
            <li>I bought this a few weeks before my wedding because my skin was just getting more and more out of control, and I felt like it made a difference.</li>
            <li>and I was able to get a nice, thick layer on.</li>
            <li>I think most of that pulsating action happens at the end when the mask is really drying up.&lt;br /&gt;After 20 minutes, my mask was still moist when I cleaned it off.</li>
            <li>Product is easy to mix, makes skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>, I am happy to report that the healing clay has FINALLY cleared my back!</li>
            <li>I would strongly suggest this product for those who want to remain naturally young looking.</li>
            <li>Overall a great simple product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is nice and light, its a sizable amount, and the clay has purported detoxifying properties (pulls heavy metals and pollutants).</li>
            <li>This stuff works great for my teen with acne issues, but it is something we have to do on a regular basis</li>
            <li>Never in my life have I experienced such a mind blowing mask, the effects are instant!</li>
            <li>Came super fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been battling acne for a few years now and this mask makes your skin nice and soft and smooth, and makes it look more evenly toned and what not afterwards; but this did absolutely nothing regarding my acne.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and really tightens to the point where it hurts to talk</li>
            <li>This indeed is the world&#x27;s most powerful facial.</li>
            <li>No wonder this is known as the world&#x27;s most powerful facial.</li>
            <li>Would you really wanna put chemicals on your face when you can use a natural clay that does an even better job?</li>
            <li>I had only bought it because it was 10 bucks lol who would of thought it actually improves acne</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re OK with a few more ingredients in your products</li>
            <li>I realized it was not red, no red bumps like some had experienced,</li>
            <li>This product was easy to use, and made my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t lie about world&#x27;s most powerful facial, I have acne problems and</li>
            <li>Also the delivery was quick and fast.</li>
            <li>The only reason for 4 stars is the price on Amazon--I happened to stop by a natural good store nearby 2 days ago and found it for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>Works quite well and leaves the skin feeling super clean and soft</li>
            <li>This leaves my hair clean and super soft.</li>
            <li>The first day was AMAZING, my curls were poppin, and they were stretched too.</li>
            <li>I live this!!!</li>
            <li>This is a great mask when I can get the consistency right, which isn&#x27;t hard.  </li>
            <li>and once you remove it with your face scrub or however, what is left is a very fresh and smooth feeling face.</li>
            <li>and when I wash it off my face feels nice, tight, and clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge advocate of natural things!</li>
            <li>I think if you have oily skin this would be perfect, but for normal to sensitive skin might be too harsh and drying.</li>
            <li>Makes her skin smooth and soft with no flakies!</li>
            <li>When I was ready to remove the product I put a very hot cloth over my face to soften up the clay.</li>
            <li>Thanks very much!</li>
            <li>mixed with water for my first try and as others have posted it is messy, using a plastic sandwich bag to mix and apply is a very good idea!</li>
            <li>I went with a more whipped texture, like thick cool whip. :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an unusual, though not unpleasant, feeling.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using a lint-free wash rag and warm water to remove the clay at the sink (or in the shower) as it feels much better than a normal rough washcloth.</li>
            <li>I like to use this prior to the weekend&#x27;s activities, or right before I go to an audition or shoot, to take years off and give my skin a healthy, glowing look.  </li>
            <li>Plain vinegar is more acidic, so yo would end up with a slightly more acidic mixture.</li>
            <li>This was good the first time I used because I used for less then 10 min.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an important step to keep your skin looking clean and fresh especially if you have big pores that collect a lot of gunk no matter how many times you wash your face, you need a deeper cleanse every once in a while.</li>
            <li>Eventually a nice, cool wash cloth takes it off really well and your face is tight and feels super clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin looked bright and tight.</li>
            <li>With regular use, fine lines and wrinkles...gone!  </li>
            <li>I do not recommend for older skin, but if you do moisturize, moisturize, moisturize!!</li>
            <li>Received this clay very fast from the seller.</li>
            <li>use it once every two weeks or so, just because it is very very strong.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I do not break out very much.</li>
            <li>but the didnt but my skn was very smooth and my pors appeared smaller.im going to use it again tomorrow and see at happens.ill write an updated one later.</li>
            <li>Like the fact that it is very fast on delivery.  </li>
            <li>Very, VERY lumpy when you mix it.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin very smooth instantly after using it.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>so this product is very reasonable...</li>
            <li>This mask is very very powerful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face was very smooth after only one use.</li>
            <li>The packaging was pretty funny to me, with claims about feeling your face move, the most powerful facial on earth, etc.</li>
            <li>very effective but be careful if your skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>My face was very smooth after only one use.</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use very much.</li>
            <li>This is very intense stuff.</li>
            <li>and it was fine with my sensitive</li>
            <li>Not exactly the awesome product I expected.</li>
            <li>The powder is fine textured and has a soft mint-green/gray color.</li>
            <li>perhaps it&#x27;s good for skin, but it&#x27;s too hard to clean the clay on face</li>
            <li>after some use you can expect great results with clearer skin and nice even tone and even a few less wrinkles</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 45 year old female, and for the first time in years, I can easily walk out the door without any makeup on, feeling totally confident.  </li>
            <li>the positive reviews are right.</li>
            <li>I mixed it with raw apple cider vinegar and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I mixed with raw cider vinegar and the consistency was perfect, no lumps.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it was a good product it can be a little bit of a pain to use compared to face masks already in a tube.</li>
            <li>It stings a little when you know it&#x27;s working, but it stings soo good.</li>
            <li>Wicked excited about my new skin journey.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin smooth and clean, I even notice my pores look smaller.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling clean and smooth and definitely treats acne.</li>
            <li>I leaves my skin feeling fresh, young, and clean.</li>
            <li>Way more effective that you think it will be, but a serious pain in the butt to mix up.</li>
            <li>make sure it&#x27;s one that you never really want to use again but that it&#x27;s clean, and add the powder in and some water.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face once a week for 20 mimutes and my skin feels fresh, young and clean.</li>
            <li>It pulls all the toxins out of your face leaving it fresh, clean and clear after a mask.</li>
            <li>Modern, clean, fast, and OMG</li>
            <li>Let it dry completely and jump in the shower and my skin is soooo smooth and soft after and my pores and blackheads are more and more diminished each time I use it.</li>
            <li>Make sure to super moisturize after as this can make your skin dry.</li>
            <li>I need to use more frequently to leave a decent review but kinda tricky when mixing it since comes in a powder form.  </li>
            <li>Your face will feel super dry afterwards so make sure to moisturize your face afterwards.</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted - arrived very fast.  </li>
            <li>the hot water running for a little while for good measure.  </li>
            <li>It has to be great or it wouldn&#x27;t have such a large following.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re anything like me you will search high and low on reviews reading all about a product before you purchase it, let me just tell you, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>My pores are small and I&#x27;m 44 years old and my skin looks very good.</li>
            <li>I can say with absolute certainty that I&#x27;ll be back for more as soon as I am done with the first bottle !</li>
            <li>I love the smell, it is in a cute little bottle, and my skin feels ready to tackle the day after using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure most people who have acne, whether major or minor, can sympathize with the frustrations that come with it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and could keep it on my face for up to 30mins, really helped clean my face, helped with pulling up blackheads and dirt!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a more natural face mask that is not expensive, and detoxifying.</li>
            <li>I love how tight and strong it felt.</li>
            <li>well, after reading the amazing reviews of pulsating face , i quite got curious about</li>
            <li>Not to mention - this stuff really makes a difference!</li>
            <li>this mask is very cleansing!</li>
            <li>One warning however, it does tingle, pull, and then got pretty itchy.</li>
            <li>Also, I accidentally used metal the first time... woops.</li>
            <li>never felt that before pretty interesing.</li>
            <li>I really like what this does to my face!</li>
            <li>The first time I used this mask, it was unlike any mask I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>Then I went back and added a thicker layer, just to make sure that the mixture got into my pores.  </li>
            <li>I already did my first treatment</li>
            <li>and I felt exactly what was posted;</li>
            <li>This is not my first time purchasing this product.  </li>
            <li>First time from this seller.  </li>
            <li>My scarring and hyperpigmentation have remained but I&#x27;m pretty sure that both will take time to improve and the scarring is likely permanent</li>
            <li>And you will wake up with more acne and redness in the next morning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m writing this as I use it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I ran hot water into the bowl and on the spoon for a while so it wouldn&#x27;t stick.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stress enough how much I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be the first to admit that the name doesn&#x27;t do the product justice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it some more time since I only use it once a week maybe twice.</li>
            <li>Now she only has scars but it better than having a faced that is inflamed with cystic acne.</li>
            <li>I have mostly oily skin, especially around my nose</li>
            <li>I use a warm wet washcloth to wash it off.</li>
            <li>also use ponds daily to make sure to keep moisturized.</li>
            <li>As a young adult and with my hormones constantly changing, I&#x27;ve experienced some breakouts which in turn have affected my self esteem and made me picky about the environments I go into.</li>
            <li>, I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>I noticed that on the first two weeks using the mask, my skin was a bit aggravated.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am exremely pleased by this product.</li>
            <li>I really like this!</li>
            <li>who would have thought, something that works for such a cheap price!</li>
            <li>we tried it with the water first, when i receive the apple cider vinegar i will have to update this about the experience if its that drastic.</li>
            <li>the funny thing is my acne discoloration has even looked like it&#x27;s decreasing</li>
            <li>You will absolutely get one!</li>
            <li>out\\&quot; exactly, although they are dryer than before the mask.</li>
            <li>No one wants to have to break out the powder, vinegar, bowl, spatula and spend time mixing every time you want a mask!</li>
            <li>I just used a warm wet towel to soften the hardened clay and it came off</li>
            <li>This is exactly what&#x27;s written on the bottle.</li>
            <li>Mix with a wooden spoon, and immediately, you&#x27;ll see the magic working.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i decied to follow some of the reviews and took a bowl with some hot water and a cloth and cleansed everthing taking care not to over scrub it.</li>
            <li>At first i got scared</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this!</li>
            <li>:) But overall, I&#x27;m in love with this product and will definitely buy again when I run out!</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re drains, had to higher a plumber</li>
            <li>I could tell a difference from the first use.  </li>
            <li>Worked the first time I used it</li>
            <li>Used this product for the first time this weekend</li>
            <li>it suggests to do and it worked really well!</li>
            <li>At the same time, I haven&#x27;t tried many mask type products.  </li>
            <li>I applied it twice a week for the first 2-3 weeks then went to weekly use and it cleared up my face and keeps it that way.  </li>
            <li>I made a batch with water first.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>This is my first review - I never write reviews</li>
            <li>you can feel that it works even for using it the first time.</li>
            <li>method that I use is first putting tea tree oil on my face, you can buy 100% oils.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this product (with the Bragg Apple Cider Vinegar, I don&#x27;t know what the results are with water)!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff but man does it feel GROSS when it dries!</li>
            <li>I chose to use the apple cider vinegar because so many people stated that when they mixed it with water, it clumped up and wouldn&#x27;t mix well.  </li>
            <li>This product has never failed me.</li>
            <li>I steamed my face for 15 minutes, extracted as many blackheads as possible with a comedone extractor tool</li>
            <li>sure you either rinse your face outside or cover your drain with a towel or washcloth...</li>
            <li>when it&#x27;s all off make sure ur not doing anything for the next 30ish min cause your face will be like a tomato.</li>
            <li>I love this clay facial mask!!</li>
            <li>He really enjoyed this and his skin didn&#x27;t get red at all</li>
            <li>I was a skeptic at first</li>
            <li>I probably should have mixed it more thoroughly because it had clumps in it.</li>
            <li>Next time will wait 15 or 20 minutes instead and see if it works more.</li>
            <li>My face was red for about 10 minutes afterwards as most said it would be.</li>
            <li>I made sure to put lip balm on my lips and pull my hair back.  </li>
            <li>The first time out there was no discernable difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance.  </li>
            <li>drink it really fast!</li>
            <li>My goodness did my face heal fast!</li>
            <li>: I rarely review things, and I never upload photos, but I really want to show you how my face was and</li>
            <li>it only leaves your face oily, muddy and your pores more clogged than when it went on.</li>
            <li>My face didn&#x27;t turn red when I took the mask off by my face was smooth and glowing!  </li>
            <li>I really like this mask!</li>
            <li>Funny thing, as it was drying</li>
            <li>First time I used it I broke out on my forehead.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a noticeable freshness and smoothness after just the first use.</li>
            <li>Once the pimples have developed fully, I would recommend using a comedone extractor (can also be found on amazon--I got mine for $0.79 and free shipping) to extract them, and then swiping over with a toner of your choice (that&#x27;s when you use salicylic acid or BP--in the toner.)</li>
            <li>I spread it on my face with my fingers and then use an old paddle foundation brush to smooth it out and attempt to even out the coverage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that it works a lot better if you run a washcloth under hot water, wring it out, and press it to your face to open your pores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an OK mask, but definitely not a holy-grail product.</li>
            <li>The shipping and delivery was fast!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who is willing to take the time to mix &amp; apply it.</li>
            <li>Benzoyl peroxide, AHA, crappy products advertised by pretty teenagers who&#x27;ve been layered by makeup and Photoshop.</li>
            <li>Although I didnt have any apple cider vinegar, I figured id try it with water first.  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s my first experience.</li>
            <li>exactly...</li>
            <li>BUT, this mask was actually pretty gentle!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my first time using it</li>
            <li>First, it does not dissolve well in water.</li>
            <li>I personally get the most out of my clay treatment</li>
            <li>first jar</li>
            <li>My acne is more moderate, but leaves scars.</li>
            <li>I got this for myself as a deep cleansing mask and love it for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first time trying this I got some friends together.</li>
            <li>I havae used this for a facial mask for many years.  </li>
            <li>if you have larger pores or clogged pores you will be able to see the stuff that came out and is know on the mask when you peel it off.</li>
            <li>I first tried it with water</li>
            <li>First off, you WILL need vinegar to get this clay dissolved.</li>
            <li>Let me first start off by telling you my skin type.</li>
            <li>Next was the preparation, I have read plenty of reviews and many people said that it was time consuming.</li>
            <li>Get this stuff, it&#x27;s pretty badass.ppy with a product.</li>
            <li>Get this stuff, it&#x27;s pretty badass.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything to treat my acne and this worked first use.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive but more on the normal side.</li>
            <li>The first night I used the clay (mixing it with Bragg brand apple cider vinegar)</li>
            <li>Now my son wants me to put it on his face too!.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does help!</li>
            <li>but it just isn&#x27;t exactly what I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li>This mask worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>and it was a med coating not too light and not heavy...</li>
            <li>Just tell me how much to use!</li>
            <li>I think I made it too liquid-y on the first go-round.</li>
            <li>This was my first try at a mask  </li>
            <li>It’s intense for a first-timer!</li>
            <li>Haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it again the next night because I was eager to try again and play around with it some more.</li>
            <li>Haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it again the next night because I was eager to try again and play around with it some more.</li>
            <li>I really can’t wait to see what using this stuff for 3 weeks will do!</li>
            <li>I just used a warm, wet washcloth for the removal.  </li>
            <li>Next time I will keep it on for 30min to see if I get even better results.</li>
            <li>The real deal !</li>
            <li>I also used a skin strip on my nose after using the mask and I was able to get out more blackheads than usual with this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;VE TRY WASHING MY HAIR IN HOT AND ROOM TEMPERATURE WATER</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>The first two uses</li>
            <li>Really recommend!</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can really feel the pulsate!</li>
            <li>Very generous amount for the money will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>This product turned out to be my favorite facial mask at all times.</li>
            <li>Having been concerned when my product first came, I researched this.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I&#x27;m not seeing any results</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it did much at first</li>
            <li>This really does make your face tingle!</li>
            <li>and it did!&lt;br /&gt;I made sure I used equal parts clay powder and apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li>I could really feel this stuff getting into my pores!</li>
            <li>When I first found out about this product, I did a mask twice in one week during the summer time and my oily summer face started</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product first since I didn&#x27;t have the time or money to spend at a spa.  </li>
            <li>It has never failed.</li>
            <li>I even tried boiling the water first to see if that helped</li>
            <li>I came across this and was immediately interested.</li>
            <li>I will definitely make the most out of this purchase.</li>
            <li>Since this is the first time I was using a pack on my face</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin baby soft and extremely smooth.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t feel much, so was surprised to see such good results.  </li>
            <li>I, sadly am not one of them.</li>
            <li>When I first started using it after a while my face started to react.</li>
            <li>Made that mistake the first time,  </li>
            <li>But it scared me the first time i used it.  </li>
            <li>Just like most deep pore cleansers I use..</li>
            <li>Now, I have skipped my $50 facial appointment this week because this product works so much better.  </li>
            <li>I noticed the areas where I applied thinner mask, were the most red.</li>
            <li>I rinsed in the sink once everything was off to make sure no residue was left (another step people miss, causing breakouts).</li>
            <li>I rinsed in the sink once everything was off to make sure no residue was left (another step people miss, causing breakouts).</li>
            <li>but I get blackheads on my nose and forehead, and when I do get zits they last awhile and are in pretty prominent areas.</li>
            <li>I woke up the next morning and my face had more bumps then what I started with.</li>
            <li>I have even mixed it with milk as I feel it is has more benefit than water does for my skin</li>
            <li>I got this for both daughter &amp; daughter-in-law - they used it and compared it to much higher priced face masks.  </li>
            <li>if doesn&#x27;t give exact measurements for mixing.</li>
            <li>Applied first application, did nothing for me.</li>
            <li>First use:</li>
            <li>For all first time users.</li>
            <li>my first time hence the 3 stars.</li>
            <li>By week 3-4 you should really notice a difference!  </li>
            <li>then the softest and smoothest skin possible, love it.......</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>I am going to do this again today, and see if more white heads will come out to the surface of the skin.</li>
            <li>The raving reviews are what caused me to buy this product in the first place.</li>
            <li>I have struggled pretty much all my life with blackheads on my t-zone and chin and this clay mask has reduced it on my cheeks and nose!</li>
            <li>It worked even better, the tiny break out blemishes I sometimes get minimized.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>I definitely feel that my pores are cleaner and my face can breathe better.</li>
            <li>and they are a lot better than big ones.</li>
            <li>&quot; the acne in the first place.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t work wonders on the first try.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I steam my skin first</li>
            <li>I was only able to leave it for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Your skin really does pulsate!</li>
            <li>My skin is glowing and feels better then it has after any facial!!</li>
            <li>I love this clay I use it for facial and my feet,  this clay make my feet like I have baby feet again.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li>Further experimentation with the addition of honey, olive oil, lemon juice and/or tea tree oil made it even better.</li>
            <li>At first it didn&#x27;t feel curly ( while washing )</li>
            <li>This is such a refreshing clay.</li>
            <li>, the first 5 mins after I get it off I feel that my face is irritated.</li>
            <li>I decided I would try a face mask that will help bring my face back to life and this one for sure</li>
            <li>My face was soft, smooth, and looking basically</li>
            <li>Not only did it tighten my skin, but rid many, almost all of my blackheads.</li>
            <li>Spritz your face with a gentle toner to replace your acid mantle, it will calm and quench your skin.  </li>
            <li>It did make my face hot after 10 minutes but that part didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>It may take me a year to use this whole container!  </li>
            <li>I like to wash my face first and then apply before I take a shower</li>
            <li>I used water the first time and it didn&#x27;t work as well as it did with the ACV.</li>
            <li>I had acne problem and tried many different products but none seem to work cuz the acne doesn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li>after trying this indian clay, the red bumps seem to get much better</li>
            <li>I bought this based on stellar reviews and it worked pretty well for a while.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>Got rid of all the blackheads on my nose on first use.</li>
            <li>I just tried this mask for the first time.</li>
            <li>smaller!I will cleanse first then use a toner</li>
            <li>First time user....</li>
            <li>Great  product long lasting</li>
            <li>First of all it doesn&#x27;t have a smell.</li>
            <li>Really improved skin w/ repeated use!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything known to man on my face to rid the pimples and nothing has worked consistently.</li>
            <li>I bought this product and decided to use it for the first time this weekend.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give exact answers solely because I just started using it, but by reading the reviews I believe it is what people say it is.</li>
            <li>It is tingly but not uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>I told my husband about it and somehow convinced him into doing the first application with me.</li>
            <li>but it also looks pretty clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just added it to the clay exactly as in the directions.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It dries your skin out so have moisturizer ready!</li>
            <li>First off, this is going to take some time.</li>
            <li>better than anything topical you can try.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it will do, though.</li>
            <li>I also used it as a facial and was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Then I take a paper towel &amp; run it under hot water (I like my water hot) &amp; then just rub it off my face.</li>
            <li>I tried that at first</li>
            <li>I have been struggling with adult acne and this product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>When I use it consistently I have noticed a change in the appearance of my pores.</li>
            <li>Very spa-like!</li>
            <li>First, I use water, not vinegar.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using both products for quite some time now, and my skin glows, is soft, line free (thank you Bel Essence), and the clay also helps to minimize pores so my skin is smoother looking.  </li>

            <li>It brought all of my impurities out to the top of my skin (which I am still treating with Epiduo, which I received after the clay from the dr) and left the rest of my face feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>It did leave my cheekbones a bit red, but I&#x27;m sure that was my fault for applying it on a non-acne area.</li>
            <li>Get into a hot shower and let the water an steam soften it up..</li>
            <li>but this stuff really deserves all the 5 star ratings!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been interested in trying [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I just used this for the first time tonight, but I can already see a noticeable difference in the reduction of my pores and smoothness of my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When most of the clay was off, then I reverted back to the washcloth method.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used this mask for the past 3 days in a row and it has incredibly helped clear up my face.  </li>
            <li>The mask feels good for the first few minutes, the problem arises as soon as it starts hardening.</li>
            <li>I used this product with vinegar and water, but works better with water only.</li>
            <li>It seems to help give me back my \\&quot;youthful glow\\&quot; and I use it whenever I want my face to look more refreshed (keep in mind though</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m sure that was my imagination), as the days went on (we only plan on using it once a week)</li>
            <li>But besides that it works really well!</li>
            <li>I have used Proactiv, Acne Free, Natures Miracle wash and natural pills, Neutrogena and anything else</li>
            <li>I used this mask and started noticing results within the first 2 uses.  </li>
            <li>I shower at night and don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, so for the first couple weeks I used the mask on nights I didn&#x27;t wash my hair.</li>
            <li>but I really felt the need to do one for this!</li>
            <li>I use this twice a week, wash daily with an acne wash, tone with a rose water witch-hazel toner daily and moisturize with an oil free</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Used this for the first time today.</li>
            <li>oops, too much water!</li>
            <li>Oops, too much powder!  </li>
            <li>Pulls at your skin, but helps my skin to look so much clearer!</li>
            <li>You can mix essential oils, rose water, and activated charcoal with the Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay to make a great anti-acne mask.</li>
            <li>just make sure everything is well mixed otherwise you&#x27;ll have watery parts and clumpy parts.</li>
            <li>The proof is evident after the 1st use.</li>
            <li>I used this first on my son, who is acne prone, and then on my self.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve suffered with pretty severe acne since being a teenager.</li>
            <li>so you definitely get more bang for your buck with this product.</li>
            <li>when i first received the product, i used it once a day for a week.</li>
            <li>after the first week, i used it once a week.&lt;br /&gt;it has been about a month or two since my purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;the product doesn&#x27;t make my face &amp;#34;pulsate&amp;#34; and it doesn&#x27;t make my face red after removal, as many others have mentioned it doing.</li>
            <li>I lOve this facial clay!</li>
            <li>we first started this routine, we did it twice a week.  </li>
            <li>Amazing stuff, Because of health reason I take testosterone everyday, the result of this gave me a chest full of acne and shoulders sore with acne.</li>
            <li>MY SKIN WAS LEFT WITH A GLOW, AND MY ACNE IS A BIT VISIBLE , WHICH I LOVE.</li>
            <li>THANKS !</li>
            <li>it is much better than your regular vinegar (you could still use any brand vinegar</li>
            <li>The blades bent on my on the first time I tried an onion.  </li>
            <li>I thought I was having an allergic reaction the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>It tightened, cleaned, smoothed, and purified my face so much my face was glowing!</li>
            <li>Seemed okay until I opened it to use a second time and it was MOLDY.</li>
            <li>It was pretty amazing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;ll be pleased with results, especially with consistent use.  </li>
            <li>when i first got it i used it every 2 days for 6 days until my acnee was gone.</li>
            <li>when using it on him it worked in first try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely tempted to use it more than the two times a week it recommends because it feels that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I should start by saying I am a pretty even-skinned person to begin with.</li>
            <li>I am an avid mask user, tried all kinds.</li>
            <li>My first use was a clay treatment for my transitioning hair.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been consistent as I should be.</li>
            <li>First off, I haven&#x27;t given myself a mask treatment since I was a teenager</li>
            <li>You can not go wrong with a wonderful price like this one!</li>
            <li>I see a lot of hyperbolic claims about this stuff&#x27;s miraculous properties, with none explaining exactly how rubbing glop on your face is supposed to kill the bacteria that causes cystic acne or whatever.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li>It had made my acne go away for the most part, make my scars fade, and makes my loves appear a lot smaller.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helped me tremendously with my oil production which was the main reason why o&lt;br</li>
            <li>the jar is still full, including what I wasted on making deodorant (though my mom still loves and uses that deodorant and even bought some of her own just for that).</li>
            <li>cause I never tried anything like it before and the first week or two</li>
            <li>i was told the first week</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it stands for.  </li>
            <li>Really, really liking this product!  </li>
            <li>I risked it and gave it a try wondering if it would cause more breakouts, but it has only improved my skin and become part of my regimen.</li>
            <li>The overall results are a lot more pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I searched acne on amazon and this came out first.</li>
            <li>It really does pulse!</li>
            <li>This will make more than enough clay mixture for your face.</li>
            <li>I saw a difference the first time i used it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say it&#x27;s great for cleaning pores</li>
            <li>It pulls out my blackheads and my face is soft and smooth after.</li>
            <li>used with apple cider vinegar in a baggie and it was pretty clumpy but it was my first time mixing it.</li>
            <li>Mixing can be tricky, I measure out the powder first and set it aside.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to everyone!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it to use apple cider vinegar as well as water, because the vinegar really amps up the effectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li>Ok, so back to sephora.</li>
            <li>I tried more stuff like Dennis Gross peel pads and Peter Thomas Roth pads.</li>
            <li>Let me just warn you, the first week you will breakout.</li>
            <li>Let me just warn you, the first week you will breakout.</li>
            <li>I read that you have to use this a couple times the first month</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This clay is working pretty well.</li>
            <li>Really leaves skin feeling cleansed and refreshed!</li>
            <li>It &#x27;sucked&#x27; out so many toxins, I looked years younger.</li>
            <li>Use it as hot as you can stand.  </li>
            <li>but u can feel it working and tell a difference after first use</li>
            <li>But even if not, who cares, this is the first product I&#x27;ve found that does that.  </li>
            <li>I use it with a combination of water and organic cider vinegar (it makes a cool fuzzy sound when mixed).</li>
            <li>Pretty neat concept.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it regularly now for lack of time, but when I start getting breakouts again, I&#x27;ll use it for about a week and it works like magic.</li>
            <li>I am someone with pretty yucky skin.  </li>
            <li>sometimes i even leave it for more that 20 mins and it doesnt leave my face red at all.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely use more in the future.</li>
            <li>I use organic apple cider with it, and although at first the vinger smell is a lil,</li>
            <li>My face was oh so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a whole lot of product for your face!  </li>
            <li>I first tried with water it did not came out well</li>
            <li>I just used this product for the first time</li>
            <li>This works exactly as they say.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty neat</li>
            <li>When I first received this product, I used it 4 days in a row.</li>
            <li>So I put on several more coat of vitamin C serum</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first product I&#x27;ve tried in ages that actually gets makes the SFs (sebaceous filaments) on my nose look better.</li>
            <li>I love this facial clay.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would repurchase, as I have already ordered more after the second use.</li>
            <li>I wish I had ran into this product earlier, I love it.  </li>
            <li>I think you have to use more than once a week to see big results.</li>
            <li>But from my experience, this clay does exactly what it&#x27;s described to do.</li>
            <li>Still, the benzoil-peroxide routine not only works (if you stick to it) it works for most people according to doctors.</li>
            <li>(the act of it drying is what cleans but also kills those top skins cells with dryness and makes people believe its actually shrinking pores).</li>
            <li>(the act of it drying is what cleans but also kills those top skins cells with dryness and makes people believe its actually shrinking pores).</li>
            <li>I first tried it on my arms and chest to test it.</li>
            <li>The first 3 reasons are superficial, meaning they can be felt &amp; seen by others than just myself:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t psoriasis, but it was pretty close.  </li>
            <li>I noticed it on the first try,  but now after a month or so of using it twice weekly,  friends have noticed it as well.</li>
            <li>my skin feels great after using this product but&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure this really cleanses my pore or not.</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;m using it</li>
            <li>This time, I used regular vinegar and it was a million times better.</li>
            <li>The first couple times I used it</li>
            <li>Then I take a wash cloth into the shower with me to wash it off, works better than simply rinsing over the sink.</li>
            <li>what can I say I love how it pulls my pores and the very next day</li>
            <li>From the first day I applied it</li>
            <li>The first week I used this, my skin went through a purge.</li>
            <li>exactly in the borders of the mask.</li>
            <li>Dramatically improved my acne, made my skin feel silkier, and I saw results after the first use.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin soft and break out free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many different ones and heard about this one one reddit /skincareaddiction</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had it for 3-4 months and used it twice the first month.</li>
            <li>this really cleans your skin!</li>
            <li>I tried that the first time and it fell off in pieces.  </li>
            <li>Gentle, but does contain bentonite as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Get hot wash cloth and wipe off.  </li>
            <li>I read a lot of the reviews along with the description of the product and was specifically interested in what it could do about that.</li>
            <li>I first got it, I tried it out on my face, neck and chest.</li>
            <li>you get so much for your money!</li>
            <li>and thats what this product does when you use it consistently.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, I used 1.5 teaspoons and slathered it all over my face</li>
            <li>I just know my face is clearer in a week and feels overall better.</li>
            <li>It did remove most of my scars but every time I use it, I only leave it on my skin for a while.</li>
            <li>The first time my face had some redness-</li>
            <li>Used it 3 times in the first week.</li>
            <li>my face has improved drastically and I can just imagine how it will look like in 2 months ;)</li>

            <li>I wanted to get a real sense of how well this works before writing a review: the wait was well worth</li>
            <li>The first time this happened to me</li>
            <li>The first time this happened to me</li>
            <li>You can literally see and feel results within the first couple uses.  </li>
            <li>Oh, and it&#x27;s quite fun to see how my face changes (esp eyes and lips) as this dries hahaha</li>
            <li>First of all I have been using this product for about two years</li>
            <li>And this was the first product to come up.</li>
            <li>Within two days of the first use I noticed my skin clearing up.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of most of the Burts Bees products</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend and it&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
            <li>My skin does get red if i keep teh mask on for more than 20 min, but it cleans so well.</li>
            <li>A better way to benefit from its properties is to take a a capsule, break it open and add 1/2 to 1 capsule of charcoal into the mask.  </li>

            <li>bentonite is what this is made of, harmful in the powder from especially and when adding liquid even more harmful.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t feel your face pulsate at first, but as it dries, it gets stronger.</li>
            <li>I can even say that this is my favorite deep pore cleasing mask.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am willing to give it a try one more time and will update my review if I see different results.</li>
            <li>Hopefully I have better luck next time.</li>
            <li>My skin was smoother softer and almost completely acne free.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, this is the top rated Amazon facial cleanser for a reason ... try it.</li>
            <li>I mix it with coffee &amp; milk when out of apple cider, store in a ziplock in the flidge and heat up under hot water before applying.</li>
            <li>The bowl catches the debris and you can just toss the used water outside. :)</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I know some people expect immediate results, but it&#x27;s best not have these expectations, as it&#x27;s unrealistic.</li>
            <li>Within the first application I noticed that it either pulled the pus out of the cysts or brought them to the surface.</li>
            <li>works better when mixed with ACV(apple cider vingear)</li>
            <li>Some people love it, I don&#x27;t necessarily like it but</li>
            <li>at least I know that when my face starts to do that, something great has happened.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will be buying more of this product in the future.</li>
            <li>will update &#x27;cause it was my first time using, so</li>
            <li>Once it dries I put a hot towel over my face for a minute to soften the mask and it comes off easier.</li>
            <li>We both left it on for 30 minutes without any notable effects afterward.</li>
            <li>The pimples I had been depressed over were much smaller and some were completely smooth!  </li>
            <li>and I am sure it will last me a while.</li>
            <li>I could still feel the pulling and it felt hot even after cleaning it off.</li>
            <li>Buy it and have it shipped expedited to you because this stuff with change your life ;)</li>
            <li>Love this item for regular masking!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not something I use every night just because it&#x27;s pretty time-consuming but when I have the time and when I feel my skin needs it</li>
            <li>The first time I used it was before I went to sleep.</li>
            <li>This really does work!</li>
            <li>After my first use, I noticed the effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I think it&#x27;s safe to use daily if you&#x27;d like to.</li>
            <li>Though the instructions recommend equal parts ACV to clay, i prefere to add some more moisture to make it easier to spread.</li>
            <li>and I actually feel more awaken almost like i drank a cup of coffee.</li>
            <li>I did my first mask today.  </li>
            <li>The funny part about this mask to me is the drying process.  </li>
            <li>Created a DIY mask recipe from Pinterest with one application I’ve had at least five strangers tell me how great my skin looks ands</li>
            <li>this stuff litterally pulled the stuff out of my pores the first time i used it.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well without drying my skin out</li>
            <li>Sealed only by a sticker on the top.</li>
            <li>Just used this for the first time tonight.  </li>
            <li>Then I would take a washcloth with water as hot as I could stand and lay it over my face in the tub to soften the clay up before I scrubbed it off.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;pulsating\\&quot; is a definite hyperbole, as is most advertising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first use</li>
            <li>Make sure you have enough water to powder ratio.&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li>So if you do try it on your forehead first.</li>
            <li>So I think I actually like the Redmond Clay better, but I ran out of my tube of it, and had this still kicking around.</li>
            <li>It definitely works better when you use the apple cider vinegar, it&#x27;s WAY smoother that way.</li>
            <li>First time I used it with just water it my hand</li>
            <li>The only advice that i have is to mix it with apple cider vinergar instead of water because the mixture would have a better consistency thus easier to put it on your face.</li>
            <li>It really does tingle!</li>
            <li>And my face fells so much smoother and refreshed afterwards!</li>
            <li>therefore it tricks your face into believing it has enough oil and won&#x27;t keep overproducing and ending up with more acne .</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>It has minimized the appearance of pores from the first use.</li>
            <li>And only for $5, so I&#x27;m kinda glad I didn&#x27;t get it here</li>
            <li>Used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li>rinse with a warm wet washcloth at the kitchen sink (with a garbage disposal</li>
            <li>Noticed a difference with in the first use.</li>
            <li>I used retin A for many years without a problem, but when I switched medical plans to an HMO the dermatologist didn&#x27;t want to prescribe retin A for me.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>

            <li>Been using it for a month now and my face feels smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Really a must face product!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found it, and I can&#x27;t wait to go back to my esthetician and show her my results.</li>
            <li>That is If i even need her to do a facial! :).</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found it, and I can&#x27;t wait to go back to my esthetician and show her my results.</li>
            <li>That is If i even need her to do a facial! :)</li>
            <li>I used water with it the first time I used it</li>
            <li>First application, didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li>I am aware that this isn&#x27;t the products fault</li>
            <li>I tell you, it&#x27;s clearing them up so much!</li>
            <li>I saw the difference immediately after removing it, I had a lot of white heads and most of them where gone.</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time and and it itches and burns while its on my face.</li>
            <li>all at the same time :) I had a 20 minute timer and kept it on for the fully 20 and rinsed off.</li>
            <li>It has only given me more acne.</li>
            <li>Love this deep cleanser.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it on my face</li>
            <li>tiny bit goes a long way, so it is also a great bargain.  </li>
            <li>Tried two more times and ended up with the same results.</li>
            <li>you wont get any more breakouts if you use this regularly (for me 1-2 times a week does the trick)&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>You could use a cleanser before applying the mask to get impurities off your face first if you choose.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I have a coupon code for this site if you want order the first time:</li>
            <li>After the first use, I noticed a difference in the pores &amp; texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li>It worked really well!</li>
            <li>Your face will be a nice shade of red everywhere that the mask was applied, but don&#x27;t worry, that&#x27;s normal and it fades.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t do it before a first date</li>
            <li>Even w/ my first time using it.</li>
            <li>Next time I will let sit longer for better results.</li>
            <li>Bentonite clay works better on clearing my skin than any facial ever had.</li>
            <li>definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>Its not uncomfortable though so don&#x27;t be scared.</li>
            <li>After the first time using it, i was sold.  </li>
            <li>First I tried the plastic baggy, and putting some clay in</li>
            <li>You can pay a lot of money for a facial or do one yourself with this clay, and have fantastic results!</li>
            <li>Have only used it a couple times but love the results on my face</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and made my face feel so soft after applying.</li>
            <li>I managed to freak out my husband :)) It only burns your skin a bit after you remove it</li>
            <li>and it really keeps the pimples away!</li>
            <li>But my face was extremely soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Although my skin feels soft and smooth after using it, I have not noticed any improvements with regard to my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The next day I woke up and my cystic acne felt so much better.</li>
            <li>- so don&#x27;t watch anything funny while you have this on.</li>
            <li>Once the mask is removed, my face feels so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>so do say, more like mearly red dots on my face  like if it was turning into a pimple</li>
            <li>I just used this clay for the first time</li>
            <li>I saw a difference in my skin after the first use.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t be alarmed when using for the first time.</li>
            <li>not uncomfortably so...</li>
            <li>Many uses and will last forever</li>
            <li>Even after the first use of this clay, my skin is visibly smoother, clearer, and glowing.</li>
            <li>At this point I can only blink :)</li>
            <li>At first I used it with the vinegar</li>
            <li>Maybe you just have to be consistent with it for a couple months??</li>
            <li>The next morning I woke up and my skin was more evenly toned, supple and</li>
            <li>Also, it is real mud, and will clog up your drain!</li>
            <li>Personally feel more when I mix it with water</li>
            <li>It sees t work much better when mixed with the apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s just the first</li>
            <li>it shut an mixed it around with my hands, then I apllied it to my face just wiping the Baggie on my face without touching the clay.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Enjoy your dirt ;)</li>
            <li>and my skin is near blemish free.</li>
            <li>The container last a long time, great deal for your money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Affordable&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin smooth and soft</li>
            <li>But it works very well!</li>
            <li>Pretty neat.</li>
            <li>After that, my skin was so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Feels like a real mask!</li>
            <li>I noticed my acne lessening after the first use.</li>
            <li>There is so much product in this jar!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is by far the cheapest and most effective skin treatment I have ever used (and I have tried quite a few).</li>
            <li>Well, sure enough, after letting it sit on the bite for about 15-20 minutes, I washed it off and noticed an immediate difference.</li>
            <li>a layer to cover the face is more than enough.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for in a facial mask?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time and I was amazed at how well it clarified my hair.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it when he&#x27;d had it awhile</li>
            <li>First of all, the blackheads on my nose and between my brows are gone.</li>
            <li>It mixed well with the apple cider vinegar and made more than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>I just received mine today and the product looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>My face is really clearing up!</li>
            <li>The longer you leave it on, the drier it gets and the more red</li>
            <li>I will be ordering this again;)</li>
            <li>but my pores were the same but one thing for sure</li>
            <li>She kept this product on hand because it was able to actually draw the stinger out of the skin.</li>
            <li>It worked way better than pore strips and definitely helped a ton with my acne.</li>
            <li>my pores have substantially shrunk and my makeup applications look even better than before and last a lot longer.</li>
            <li>Its not expensive</li>
            <li>I have been using this for several months and am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I will totally get some more - have shared it with my grown kids too</li>
            <li>you can feel a difference from the first use.</li>
            <li>The product is exactly what it said it would be.  </li>
            <li>First time I used this boy was</li>
            <li>...use exactly as directed.  </li>
            <li>Only part I dislike is not being able to just rinse my face off in the sink.</li>
            <li>I have given this away to so many people and constantly have people borrowing it.</li>
            <li>It works so much better than regular powder and heals irritations incredibly fast!</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>First application of this clay was horrendous.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what happened, I mixed it with water and wiped it on</li>
            <li>i absolutely love this stuff and wish i wouldve found it sooner, i personally use it once a week.</li>
            <li>after the first use.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product on and off (mostly off) for the last 12 years.</li>
            <li>I tried plastic silverware at first, then a plastic baggy, but still have tons of chunks and they fall off all over.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it...</li>
            <li>but I just need to be consistent with it by applying it 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li>This stuff is deffinately intense!</li>
            <li>But I do also want to note that I take daily vitamins, birth control, maintain a healthy diet, and workout (but even before using this clay mask I&#x27;ve maintained this lifestyle).</li>
            <li>it works for you as much as it has helped me!</li>
            <li>First time &amp;#34;Clay-er&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Having used many, MANY, masks in the past, I wasn&#x27;t expecting immediate results.</li>
            <li>I love doing my facial masks with this clay!</li>
            <li>My husband came home and the first words was what did u do to your face?</li>
            <li>Overall, it cant get any better for the price.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used 4 times, the first 3 times made me break out (the purge), and the 4th time my skin is GLOWING.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna have to buy a larger one because I am gonna share with my two sisters and mom :)</li>
            <li>The reviews I read some were concerned about plugging drain pipe from mask,  no worries there just run hot water when you are out of shower.</li>
            <li>i have put the mask first day, noticed a change.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says on the container.</li>
            <li>because you really get your moneys worth, I feel it working on my face, its smoother now</li>
            <li>but once I rinsed it off my face felt smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>The product is inexspensive and the reviews are stellar.</li>
            <li>I used Aztec for the first time over the weekend and it felt like a spa day for my hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and the next day my face looked remarkably better already, used it twice</li>
            <li>When II first used it I didnt have any</li>
            <li>after first application could see a difference.</li>
            <li>My skin has smoothened out and simply looks better in tone and hydration.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s only slightly better than my proactiv face mask.</li>
            <li>This clay mask is quite funny to use.</li>
            <li>I also exfoliated my face first before using this mask.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, this is a cheap &amp; natural mask that seems to help.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the actual feeling of the tingle as it cleaned my pores and the feeling of it hardening on my face.</li>
            <li>I did break out after the first couple of uses...</li>
            <li>however, be aware when opening that it may go everywhere</li>
            <li>do want to say that I find the more regular I use the product,</li>
            <li>I used to think the longer I left the product on, the better.  </li>
            <li>Love this I see a big improvement on my face</li>
            <li>Thanks in advance!</li>
            <li>Product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>skin feels soft and smooth after.</li>
            <li>I will say this tightened just a bit more though and made my caramel colored skin red for about 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the first time and air got inside the container.  </li>
            <li>but this product has definitely made my face look better.</li>
            <li>the first couple times  </li>
            <li>first then i apply the mask.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, my acne prone skin is clear and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Really cleans out your pores!</li>
            <li>Skin feels smooth and soft after.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>This stuff makes me feel pretty.</li>
            <li>And yes you will break out after the first use, it is drawing everything up and out.</li>
            <li>So far I have been acne free for one month and that has not happened in over 3 years.  </li>
            <li>so I got my biotin first and started to get acne</li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t have exact measurements of water)</li>
            <li>I do not care for this clay, I have a better one I ordered around the same time.</li>
            <li>most acne is internal it could be hormonal, bacterial, digestive system out of whack, liver being overworked ect.</li>
            <li>and I have faith that it will only get better.</li>

            <li>pro&lt;br /&gt;-works great&lt;br /&gt;-product not expensive</li>
            <li>This is my first review after using amazon for years.</li>
            <li>I read several reviews before purchasing this and listened to many recommendations.</li>
            <li>First whoever said use of baggie to mix and apply this was a genius.</li>
            <li>Soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I combined the clay with organic apple cider vinegar, and found that it was a bit too strong-smelling for me.</li>
            <li>but maybe I have to use it more regularly.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this facial.</li>
            <li>The boyfriend uses it too to get rid of blackheads, and his skin is soft and smooth after he uses it.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li>Need more actually...</li>
            <li>Just did my first treatment--really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>But when I first tried it on my sister</li>
            <li>This stuff really does do the job in cleaning your pores!</li>
            <li>From youtube and pint rest tutorials I was able to use this product with multiple uses.</li>
            <li>I use it about 3x/week and it has really made a difference in my skin!</li>
            <li>I saw results after my first use.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have severe acne in the first place,</li>
            <li>This is my first time i am using any clay packs and also my first time that I am tempted to put on my face pack every 4-5 days...</li>
            <li>I come back to the clay and add some more water and make a paste out of it.</li>
            <li>The first day it almost immediately reduced the redness on my face, bumps and pimples.</li>
            <li>Now, Tuesday the 13th, 8 days after using it, My face has gotten a lot better.</li>
            <li>would Recommend at first, to leave it for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Be aware thus stuff will peel your face off.        </li>
            <li>My skin actually has a healthy look now.</li>
            <li>I tried to mix it with water first</li>
            <li>Just used this for the first time.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>i felt a difference in my skin after the first use.</li>
            <li>i have moderate acne, sometimes cystic, with lets say, alot but not TERRIBLE acne marks</li>
            <li>and the one pounder is More then enough for one person.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and works like it says!</li>
            <li>this is the first product I&#x27;ve found to trully unclog pores.</li>
            <li>This is the first review I&#x27;ve written althought</li>
            <li>Once I took it off (I used warm wet paper towels) and put on moisturizer</li>
            <li>Arrived sooner than expected, durable packaging, safety seal (nice bonus).</li>
            <li>: I love this product enough to write a review about it--</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li>me first explain to you how I use this product:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>Today I first tried this clay.</li>
            <li>so I was interested to see results with this product.</li>
            <li>I just received my mask today and tried it for the first time.</li>
            <li>(nothing moisturizer can&#x27;t help), but it&#x27;s also insanely soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>At first, I freaked out.</li>
            <li>seems good for a monthly treatment but a weekly treatment would be too harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li>A good brush or exfoliating sponge will remove ALL dead skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years on my face, neck &amp; hands &amp; I&#x27;ve always loved the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usin Olay hidratating cream also, because it&#x27;s always good to use everyday.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking of buying this as a Christmas gift for a few people who appreciate good skin care products.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been applying this everyday and used witch hazel after which is good for oily skin..</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been applying this everyday and used witch hazel after which is good for oily skin..</li>
            <li>The mask dried, and I could feel it pulling at my face which is a good sign.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping with a few more uses it will leave my skin nice a clear.</li>
            <li>I nice muddy consistency that is fun to spread everywhere and watch turn into a dark earthy color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I nice muddy consistency that is fun to spread everywhere and watch turn into a dark earthy color.    </li>
            <li>Good product but too messy to use often.</li>
            <li>So the few blackheads were a good sign.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I have never had clear skin, not terribly bad, but never COMPLETELY clear.&lt;br</li>
            <li>got the recipe from an online blog for making healthy toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t have chemicals and such, so we&#x27;re using it now and so far so good, although can&#x27;t comment as to the long term benefit yet.</li>
            <li>I dumped equal parts into the little chopper/mixer and it made a nice smooth cream that was easy to change in thickness by adding fluid.&lt;br /&gt;--Use</li>
            <li>I used warm water and swished my hand in the sink to make sure it was all more or less dissolved, then ran the tap a little longer to ensure no clay chunks were latching themselves in my s-pipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and this stuff helps clean out the pores and leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I remove the mask is by wetting a wash cloth with very warm water, and gently pressing it against a large area of skin for a few seconds.</li>
            <li>and my skin feels clean and very soft</li>
            <li>This stuff is great hands down!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and my skin feels soft, tight, and gives me a healthy glow</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my skin so clean and soft!</li>
            <li>I still have not had the other major changes in my skins that others have experienced.</li>
            <li>He is extremely happy with how his skin is looking and is far less self-conscious about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>next day my skin felt really clean and my pores looked clean.  </li>
            <li>next day my skin felt really clean and my pores looked clean.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, once the time is up, and the mask is basically half-completely dry, I gently wash off with warm water.</li>
            <li>The only reason I purchase this product is to qualify for FREE Super Saver Shipping.</li>
            <li>My acne scars are getting less visible, my acne is diminishing, my face looks brighter, softer, clearer, and most importantly, healthier.</li>
            <li>plus I like to co wash instead of constant shampooing so this product was great in cleansing all the build up without striping my hair and making if feel dry.</li>
            <li>This is great not only fora news prone skin, but also dry skin.</li>
            <li>Skins feels super smooth and pores look much smaller immediately.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel great also helps clear my pores I have been getting less breakouts.</li>
            <li>I might should worry about the clay clogging the pipes, but I really just use a super warm washcloth to remove the mask and let it drain down the sink.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m constantly blotting with oil absorbing sheets (my life savers!!!!)</li>
            <li>After one use of this, I was like wow!!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very excited to see how my face will look with future uses.</li>
            <li>This is a great clay mask, but due to my busy life, I don&#x27;t have much time to make it.</li>
            <li>Fortunately it didn&#x27;t burn (I was worried because I have VERY sensitive skin), but it didn&#x27;t do much else either.</li>
            <li>Since it kind of feels the same as an acid peel, I&#x27;d definitely have a good soothing moisturizer with high SPF on hand - like 50 or 55 - before going outside.   </li>
            <li>Educate yourself about this product (or rather bentonite clay, you can get it much cheaper than this) and then decide if it&#x27;s right for you and your situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The whole point is to purify your face right?</li>
            <li>But my face feels lighter and looks much brighter right after.</li>
            <li>and I will have to be ready to jump in the shower right away</li>
            <li>It stays good as long as it&#x27;s in a air safe tight container.</li>
            <li>It is a simple raw powdered bentonite clay which is readily available all over the world and used in many many cosmetics that you probably have in your bathroom right now.  </li>
            <li>This is such an amazing and natural product!</li>
            <li>It really does deep cleansing and leaves your skin smooth and squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>This way you can make it into more of a smooth paste then a chunky mess.</li>
            <li>skin feels as if I just had a salon facial- soft, clean, healthy.  </li>
            <li>This product is not for someone who wants a quick and easy facial.</li>
            <li>I have used tons of facial masks and this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this clay mask twice so far and my skin has never been more clear!</li>
            <li>It cleared up significantly and he hasnt even had the desire to have his back scratched a full week after I applied it.</li>
            <li>At first I kind of felt my face pulsing but nothing extreme.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not going to clear severe acne or anything, but it&#x27;s a decent facial mask for a good price.  </li>
            <li>I have used this at least a dozen times now and LOVE it!!  </li>
            <li>I also use the oil cleansing method, which I like a lot, but its nice to have a few different natural things around to keep you skin in good shape.</li>
            <li>i highly suggest it to anyone who has acne or gets the occasional bug bite and just wants to treat themselves to a nice spa treatment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good preventative treatment in the long term, because it doesn&#x27;t let the toxins in your skin develop long enough to turn into full-fledged pimples.</li>
            <li>I was lucky to never have acne as a teenager, unfortunately right now at 22, I am suffering from adult acne.</li>
            <li>But i would say it&#x27;s worth a shot at trying because the price is pretty decent.</li>
            <li>I tried mixing it with apple cider vinegar first then water; none of the mixtures gave me positive results.</li>
            <li>I saw many people say that it clogged their drains, and I found a way to get the mask off of your face easily while not clogging your drains or making a mess!</li>
            <li>I bought this clay due to all the amazing reviews, hoping that it would help me with my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Our faces were a bit pink for a little while after, but the result was great!</li>
            <li>I originally purchased it to combat adult acne, but I have not seen difference when using this product.  </li>
            <li>It really made my face glow after my first application, but the following days i broke out - which was okay because i heard this can happen.</li>
            <li>no more acne, my chest and back are healing up good and without being attacked by more acne.</li>
            <li>Its far too powerful!</li>
            <li>Its far too powerful!</li>
            <li>The original recipe also called for baking soda, which I eventually became sensitive to.</li>
            <li>I had no bad reactions afterward, but the intense itching sensation really didn&#x27;t make it feel very therapeutic.</li>
            <li>many problems happened for (ppl who left it long time/ used it many times per week)</li>
            <li>I have heard that eating or drinking clay , not this one specifically , one that is safe for internal use, also helps to detoxify the organs and help clear skin from breakouts, how true is that?</li>
            <li>Its kind of miraculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to keep using this mask and have begun using it on other parts of my body that also have acne.</li>
            <li>Its kind of miraculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to keep using this mask and have begun using it on other parts of my body that also have acne.</li>
            <li>It was just as effective on my acne spots as any other mask I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t feel a difference from this product to any other clay mask I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin with minor breakouts (mostly my forehead &amp; chin area) &amp; eczema on the top of my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved the difference that I saw in my face right after using this but after a few hours the fresh, clear complexion seemed to vanish.  </li>
            <li>Some good recipes also use a bit of raw honey.</li>
            <li>I definitely was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li>Moisturize now.&lt;br /&gt;One note: the first time; I applied way too much and did not get the consistency right while mixing it thus really crippling its potency.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After removing his skin was bright red for several hours.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend Clean &amp; Clear 3 step cleanser over this any day.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin red and irritated after use, but amazing way to clear your face out.</li>
            <li>and it definately brings circulation to your face, so don&#x27;t be surprised if your face is bright pink when you remove it.  </li>
            <li>i personally have a vary pail complexion so it leaves my skin bright red.</li>
            <li>As soon as I began washing the mask off my skin was burning and I was left with a bright red, blistered face.</li>
            <li>So happy I gave this stuff a chance, I seriously don&#x27;t know what I would do without it now.</li>
            <li>Moral of the story: use this stuff sparingly and carefully, and it works great.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference, and it makes my face feel clean and clear.</li>
            <li>It did turn my face bright red for a while, definitely don&#x27;t use it if you have to go anywhere soon.</li>
            <li>, feels great and isn&#x27;t harsh on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>After applying you may feel clear and clean .</li>
            <li>it leaves my face clean and clear.</li>
            <li>My skin felt tighter and more clean and the pores appeared less visible.</li>
            <li>Also I didn&#x27;t apply essential oil for him because again, his face gave off a bright red rash appearance.</li>
            <li>Then I grabbed my super soft microfiber towel and wet that with warm water to wipe off the remnants.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a natural cleanser, and is also used to clean marble of all impurities as marble is a porous stone.</li>
            <li>and it always clears my face up and leaves it feeling so soft and clean.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel really soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>Wow... this product will clean your face, hair and blemishes.</li>
            <li>After I rinsed off the mask, my skin felt so clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Your&lt;br /&gt;face feels soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>As for my pores it does clean it well but doesn&#x27;t make my blackheads completely disappear (wasn&#x27;t expecting it to).</li>
            <li>My skin felt clean, soft and brighter.</li>
            <li>I havent seen result yet but so far I like how it makes my skin clean.</li>
            <li>it does clean them out completely in the moment, and I have never had that before.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for month, once to twice a week, my face gets so soft, clean after using it.</li>
            <li>My face feels so soft and clean after using.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>and my face is so soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so soft and really clean.</li>
            <li>and I feel it leaves it soft &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>So far, this stuff works and leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I had realistic expectations buying this product based off all the success stories on the reviews here.  </li>
            <li>My face was clean and felt soft.</li>
            <li>Skin feels truly clean and soft after.  </li>
            <li>My face looked and felt so clean, soft, and my skin felt like I had a tightening done</li>
            <li>Love it ,really helps calm breakouts and dry out pimples.</li>
            <li>I have faith that you will achieve your goal of having clear and soft skin. :)</li>
            <li>I used a warm, sopping wet, washcloth to gently coax it off at the kitchen sink.  </li>
            <li>I mix this with warm water until nearly smooth and apply in a thick layer.</li>
            <li>It felt good until I took it off; my face was red and swolen, its been sitting in the back of my cabinet ever since....</li>
            <li>This clay doesn&#x27;t kill the bacteria in your acne so much as it brings it to the surface--a process that is actually a lot better for your skin than killing the pimples with salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li>This mask stopped the progression of more acne, took the damage that was already done, and slowly but surely subdued it.</li>
            <li>This mask stopped the progression of more acne, took the damage that was already done, and slowly but surely subdued it.</li>
            <li>I echo what others have said as well - the whipped consistency is really the key to getting the most out of the mask.</li>
            <li>I love my brushes too much) and the only brush I felt</li>
            <li>I love my brushes too much) and the only brush I felt</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin so having to rub it off with warm water is counterproductive to actually working.</li>
            <li>I put on a good moisturizer (another key component) and will report further findings in about 6 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>I put on a good moisturizer (another key component) and will report further findings in about 6 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>You get an instant glow, and your face is super clean.</li>
            <li>price is reasonable, especially considering that I will be able to get 15 masks or so out of the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great quality and price and lasts a long, long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not being sure of how much I needed to make, I mixed 1 Tbsp + 1 tsp each of the clay and Vitaminshoppe brand unfiltered apple cider vinegar.  </li>
            <li>I have recommended it to several friends and can not say enough good this about this product.</li>
            <li>I really did not think I this product would work for me, but for the bargain price of 10 or 11 dollars, it really was worth a shot.  </li>
            <li>by the 3rd week I really feel like it&#x27;s refreshing my skin.</li>
            <li>Anyway, after a close inspection of my skin following the removal of the clay, I saw many pusses that have come very closely to the surface.  </li>
            <li>The tingling was expected, but still peculiar.&lt;br /&gt;After 15 minutes, I rinsed gently with warm water...</li>
            <li>A friend of mine who is a holistic health and wellness professional told me about this product when I asked her to recommend a natural mask without too many chemicals.</li>
            <li>I mixed it up with apple cider vinegar just like the directions said, and left it on for a good 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>I only write reviews if I really love a product or really dislike it.</li>
            <li>So this is quite unusual for me, I would love if people reading this have had any similar situations, if so please comment on this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>1/2 T of both this and Bragg;s mixed more than covered my whole face.</li>
            <li>I use witch hazel as a toner then use mu tria blue light (pricey but worth it) and moisturize with argan oil.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really used this product enough to be madly in love with it..</li>
            <li>it is more soft and clear of blemishes.</li>
            <li>It is a good overall deep cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very cautious about what to put on my face since many products have only irritated it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>Okay, I finally used the whole 1lb jar.(I</li>
            <li>I love that this product is completely, 100% natural clay.</li>
            <li>I get hormonal cystic acne breakouts when I&#x27;m really stressed on top of my regular period</li>
            <li>so I put it on his back and when we wash off we&#x27;re all nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I fill a large bowl with hot water and use a wash cloth.</li>
            <li>Just tried it yesterday for the first time and it certainly lives up to its reviews.  </li>
            <li>The tub is pretty large</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and I used to have problems with some mild to sometimes severe acne.</li>
            <li>My younger sister and I tried this healing clay out as a facial and honestly, it really isn&#x27;t anything special or amazing by any means.</li>
            <li>I have not been using the product long enough to rave over it, but so far so good!</li>
            <li>very gently wash mask off, don&#x27;t scrub, this step is a process in its self, be gentle with washing mask off as skin has been cleaned by the mask, don&#x27;t need to agitate skin.</li>
            <li>Also, if you understand that &amp;#34;clay&amp;#34; is texturally consistent with &amp;#34;mud,&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t see how you could be surprised at it being &amp;#34;messy.&amp;#34; Use an old soft toothbrush to apply if you don&#x27;t have those nice brushes.</li>
            <li>it is very easy to remove but for someone lazy like me, it can be a pain (but still worth the effort!)</li>
            <li>I tried both water did nothing to my skin and was hard to mix together but the apple cider didn&#x27;t AMAZING!</li>
            <li>The next day she did, and she told me that her black heads all just came the very top and where so easily extracted.</li>
            <li>Then you can apply the mud to your face with the back of the spoon - this way your hands stay clean - and just rinse the spoon off when you&#x27;re done!</li>
            <li>but if you are looking for something to get your face deep clean give this a try!</li>
            <li>I like it less than the mint julep masks, but if you&#x27;re looking for more pulsating masks, use this!</li>
            <li>After I washed it off, I can see reduced of black heads and my skin was so smooth!!</li>
            <li>I keep in the bathroom just for masks and stuff; a plastic spoon to scoop the clay powder (I break the handle so it&#x27;s short enough to keep inside the jar), a plastic fork for mixing (find heavier duty forks), lastly, ELF $1 foundation brush (its complete plastic bristles makes it a good clay applying tool, easy to clean up too!)&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I felt the pulsating and my skin looked smooth with smaller pores right after both treatments I did.</li>
            <li>Every time I&#x27;ve done it, I&#x27;ve made too much or it wasn&#x27;t done the right way (too watery or the clay clumps too much).</li>
            <li>My skins feels so soft and has cleared right up!</li>
            <li>Mix with a little water, make a paste...apply to clean skin and enjoy the super cleansing clay.</li>
            <li>Actually it washed out relatively easy and feels pretty silky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 43 year old woman who has been pretty lucky in the skin department.</li>
            <li>So take it easy and start small, you can always make more.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll notice outbreaks at first because it&#x27;s purifying your skin, but your skin will clear up quickly.</li>
            <li>all these positive reviews?</li>
            <li>have nothing but positive things to say about this product.  </li>
            <li>When I saw all of the positive reviews for this mask, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I agree with all the positive review of this clay.  </li>
            <li>, I made a mask and washed with it and each usage showed positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews of this product before deciding to purchase and they were positive, but when I used it, it didn&#x27;t seem to have any noticeable changes after using for two weeks</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and was optimistic at all the positive results.</li>
            <li>I used REN Hydra-Calm Global Protection Day Cream, which usually calms my skin right away, and it kind of felt like when you put aloe on a burn, so it felt better immediately.  </li>
            <li>I used REN Hydra-Calm Global Protection Day Cream, which usually calms my skin right away, and it kind of felt like when you put aloe on a burn, so it felt better immediately.  </li>
            <li>I have a pretty clean, chemical free lifestyle, but this mask was still able to reach down deep and draw out impurities.</li>
            <li>I have combination/oily AND delicate skin, and I always use so many products that have chemicals and harm my skin; and many of those chemical products made my skin dry which caused my skin to be MORE oily.</li>
            <li>I leave the hot water running for a little while for good measure.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, once the clay mix is completely dry in the bowl I used to whip it up, it&#x27;s easy to wipe the excess into the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Overall I think it&#x27;s amazing and definitely worth the buy, especially since it&#x27;s so cheap and works better than most of the expensive skin care products I have purchased over the years.</li>
            <li>Pores are pretty much gone.</li>
            <li>I used water the first 5 times, and no matter how much you stir, the clay will stay chunky.</li>
            <li>and I made too much the first time</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>If there are related products (a facial mask), would love to buy but haven&#x27;t seen anything available.</li>
            <li>It dries pretty fast.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;just have a pack on hand for quickies but can pretty much eliminate the need for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All help is much appricated ;-)</li>
            <li>bought this due to the extensive great reviews.</li>
            <li>I used too much of both components when I first tried mixing.</li>
            <li>Even with the tingling, this is actually pretty gentle for a mud mask.  </li>
            <li>I felt very itchy when it first started drying on my face.</li>
            <li>For the first month it didn&#x27;t really do a whole lot</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I went pretty much by the reviews as I stumbled on it during a search for something else</li>
            <li>It is very drying, so I like to first wash/dry my face and apply a layer of Extra-virgin Coconut oil for 15 minutes before applying the mask</li>
            <li>and since it was my first time, it wasn&#x27;t very even</li>
            <li>You get used to it though, just be ready when you first try</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid as much for ONE clay mask as this whole jar contains!</li>
            <li>Any acne sufferer has tried hundreds of different products, read thousands of Google searches/reviews/blogs, and experienced an endless amount of frustration, pain, and confusion.</li>
            <li>I have seen such a great improvement in some of the acne and other skin problems we all experience.</li>
            <li>I have tried pretty much every thing else, from fruit extracts, to toners, creams, diet, etc.</li>
            <li>It pulls in pretty much everything it</li>
            <li>I use it 3-4 times a week &amp; my blackheads are continuing to decrease and my pores are becoming smaller.</li>
            <li>At the end of the 30 minutes, you are ready to have the stuff off of your face, but it&#x27;s not extremely uncomfortable, either.</li>
            <li>but I have found it goes away pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>i seem to be the only one who&#x27;s experienced this according to all the other reviews.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know how much I can contribute to this product, but it really seems to do what it says it will!</li>
            <li>The first two times I tried this product I put way too much of it on my face (the instructions tell you to put a 1/2 inch on your face??)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not surprised as most products do not do as theyre supposed to.</li>
            <li>It is a pretty intense product.</li>
            <li>The clay cost 5.99 and you pretty much pay 0.99 cent and shipping fees.</li>
            <li>OK, so I have had acne for a long time but</li>
            <li>It is intense and pretty inexpensive which is a plus.</li>
            <li>I really feel like my pores were minimized when I used it the first time..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Alright, that pretty much sums it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Alright, that pretty much sums it</li>
            <li>and I must say it really does work at first</li>
            <li>It also loves to clog my drains, and if I remove it with a towel, the towel is pretty much ruined, unless I rinse it off, but then it clogs the drain.</li>
            <li>This product has really improved the quality of my skin, the first week I got it</li>
            <li>I used too much the first time.</li>
            <li>Sure it would make it go away as long as I&#x27;m on it</li>
            <li>I was very scared at first</li>
            <li>My usual opaque and sallow skin looked and FELT fresh and healthy, and I didn&#x27;t even bother to use foundation makeup for work!</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to minimize pores and came across this product, I really didn&#x27;t think much of it at first until I read some reviews and went on U tube.</li>
            <li>It works pretty much how everyone else on here describes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a dude; been using this stuff pretty much once every two weeks.</li>
            <li>Also, I use it with hot water and use a sandwich bag to apply it on my face because it is much easier.</li>
            <li>yet it&#x27;s simply because it is evacuating pimples which were becoming at any rate.</li>
            <li>I made a mistake the first time I used it by putting too much on my face.</li>
            <li>i love it and it lasts a long time... will order again when i use all mine up.</li>
            <li>Unbelievable how good this stuff works</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t see much results, after the first couple uses my skin was still very oily, and bumpy.</li>
            <li>I looked into reviews about all natural acne products, and this was was mentioned due to its good pore cleaning ability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i use it once not bad so far</li>
            <li>Use just 1/4 spoon of the power is good enough for my whole face, this product is gonna last forever, and works forever.</li>
            <li>TI does not do as good of a job as a cleanser with AHA  (alpha-hydroxy acid), which can dissolve the gunk in your pores, and is usually prescribed/recommended by a doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>After i remove, i use Thayer&#x27;s rose witch hazel toner &amp; follow with Neutrogena&#x27;s fight &amp; fade gel for my dark spots.</li>
            <li>but also pretty cool if you need to get rid of those little bastards fast and furious :)</li>
            <li>After using this I still see a lot of my pores around my nose and that is the main area I want clear and smooth on and around the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really makes my face feel soft &amp; clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about four days now, and seriously my skin looks better and better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love that it can get quite messy when you clean up your face.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my face feels once I clean the dried mask off.</li>
            <li>Make sure the bowl is big enough to fit your whole face in and submerge with water.</li>
            <li>first of all, i&#x27;ve seen people blaming real customers for being payed to write the reviews, well, i&#x27;m a real customer and this was my first time buying this because i was absolutely lost.</li>
            <li>I use it for external and internal it works great with my skin as well as detoxing my body from heavy metals, i put one teaspoon in a glass of water and mix it up, i do this every morning before meals and it had helped me wonders with stomach problems as well, make sure you it doesnt come in contact with metal it will decrease its power.</li>
            <li>I searched high and low and stumbled into this magic clay.</li>
            <li>I only purchased it because it had so many high ratings ...</li>
            <li>After going to many dermatologists and trying tons of different things (both over the counter and prescription) I went on acutane for a year in High School.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend it and if you have other people in your household that want to use it, trust me, this one jar is more than enoughfor everyone!</li>
            <li>It seems fine for very sensitive skin, however I would still only use it every 5-7 days, with the apple cider vinegar, and apply moisturizer quickly after washing.  </li>
            <li>Really does deep clean your pores!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this product really done much for my face other than make it feel nice.</li>
            <li>Your skin will feel tighter, smoother and look fresh and new.</li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING for clearing up my skin and making my black heads disappear.</li>
            <li>Worked amazingly the first few times.</li>
            <li>Not noticing a huge difference in my pores/blackheads/breakouts, but I&#x27;ve only used it twice since receiving it about a week ago ;)</li>
            <li>Huge container for a small price, what&#x27;s not to love</li>
            <li>For the low price, the amount you receive and results I can easily see this being a staple in my beauty regime.</li>
            <li>Make sure to use a moisturizer because it can make your face quite dry.</li>
            <li>The only thing I miss about mint julep is the easy to dispense squeeze bottle.</li>
            <li>It will take more than 10-15 minutes to dry, but whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It will take more than 10-15 minutes to dry, but whatever.   </li>
            <li>Super surprised, will buy again.</li>
            <li>I had this whole army of pimples attacking my face and they were defeating me big time because I was becoming depressed</li>
            <li>Make sure after you use it you apply a moisturizer because it can really dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>Simple to put together, and goes on easily.</li>
            <li>I like that there is no fragrance, and that it is so simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Then I read the back of the jar in more detail and found that this is normal.  </li>
            <li>my forehead is always bumpy and gross, but after using this it&#x27;s soft, smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling super soft and we have both noticed that it has reduced the amount of clogged pores we have.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and your face does actually pulsate.  </li>
            <li>I have mild adult acne breakouts from time to time and I was having one yesterday.</li>
            <li>My suggestion either hop in the shower or re-wet the entire mask to come off easy or it will hurt your face.</li>
            <li>I also love that my face isn&#x27;t dry after I use it -</li>
            <li>Makes your skin super soft after 1 use.  </li>
            <li>After washing it off, my skin felt super soft.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin super soft when I take it off.</li>
            <li>You need to rehydrate your skin after use, and since you have completely cleaned your face, it will absorb any product quickly.  </li>
            <li>The healing process took a while, but I was able to speed it up with my dry bush.</li>
            <li>The healing process took a while, but I was able to speed it up with my dry bush.</li>
            <li>At any rate, this is a fantastic product; and cheaper from Amazon than it was at my local Whole Foods!</li>
            <li>It warns on the side that you will feel your skin pulsing while wearing the mask and although I have SUPER sensitive skin, I did not feel this.</li>
            <li>I can almost guarantee your face will be a glowing canvas if you let this dry for about 30 minutes or more.</li>
            <li>Can just as easily be used with water with the same effect.</li>
            <li>but it leaves my face super soft and dewy.</li>
            <li>My pits have never been more dry...</li>
            <li>My sister has had ulcerative colitis for a long time, and she gets diarrhea that lasts for as much as 10 days or more whenever she has a flare-up.  </li>
            <li>It was simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Makes my face super soft</li>
            <li>Your skin will be really dry afterwards so make sure you have a moisturizer at hand even if you have oily</li>
            <li>Your skin will be really dry afterwards so make sure you have a moisturizer at hand even if you have oily</li>
            <li>I love that you can use vinegar to mix in if your skin is oily, or water if it&#x27;s dry.  </li>
            <li>cuz my skin is super sensitive</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased that I did because this is exactly like the green clay mask I used so many years ago and just from two uses it cleared up the skin problems I&#x27;ve been fighting with for these past 15 years.</li>
            <li>Be sure to get a moisturizer because after cleaning your face it will be dry.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin &amp;</li>
            <li>What I really love, is it that it didnt dry my face out like alot of cleansers and masks I have tried.  </li>
            <li>has helped my face clear up greatly, plus no more peeling skin.&lt;br /&gt;hope</li>
            <li>my daughters were very against this at first but really like how this cleans their faces.</li>
            <li>Takes a while to dry say more than 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Deep cleaning, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>recommend using before you shower to make the cleanup as easy as possible without having to scrub your skin to get this product off.</li>
            <li>I plan on using it once a week to clear up my mild acne and acne scars.</li>
            <li>Soaking your face with it first, and breaking the mask up around your face really helps, because otherwise it really hurts.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have any redness afterwards - and I have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>There is redness after removing the mask, but it goes away quickly and completely.</li>
            <li>The oily tzone is at bay, and my dry flakey chin is getting better with each use.</li>
            <li>The oily tzone is at bay, and my dry flakey chin is getting better with each use.</li>
            <li>Washed off easy enough.  </li>
            <li>it was easy enough.</li>
            <li>This product temporarily tightened my pores and made my skin soft, but it isn&#x27;t super miraculous like I was lead to believe by all the rave reviews.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix it with either water or apple vinegar and mix/mash it in a ziploc bag for easy disposal and storage for any left over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had acne my whole life pretty much</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s only easy to remove in the shower, which means you will end up clogging the pipes eventually.</li>
            <li>I bought this with hopes that it would help with my &amp;#34; mild adult acne&amp;#34; that I&#x27;ve dealt with for over 10 years now.</li>
            <li>I have mild acne and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>but if you want it to dry and don&#x27;t have all day, thinner is better.</li>
            <li>and I was sure my skin would be dry after rinsing, but...</li>
            <li>After using many lotions to get my face to get back to normal</li>
            <li>However, after the first use, I didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference.</li>
            <li>This product is really strong you actually feel the pulse on your face like the mask is pulling out all impurities from your pores and cleaning it..</li>
            <li>Strong mask gives a deep cleansing feeling  for days after</li>
            <li>(this one is strong, for deep cleansing, so you may want to dilute it with almond or jojoba oil).</li>
            <li>Strong mask that helps in deep cleansing of skin and improving fairness.</li>
            <li>Really, the price is right and it does the job much better than any other product on the market...</li>
            <li>and it starts to feel tingly on your skin, leaving it fresh and VERY soft.</li>
            <li>and It feels very soft and fresh now.</li>
            <li>It has helped me with my oily skin and large pores.</li>
            <li>It brought some clogged pores I had to the surface and got rid of the large pores around my nose.  </li>
            <li>I have large pores and lots of blackheads on my nose...</li>
            <li>product is a pure unlimited Jackpot for the skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have large pores and often treat them with a BHA liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also works well for drying out acne if used in certain spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has helped a ton and has reduced the amount of time that I have a large lump under my skin from the acne.</li>
            <li>clay and you don&#x27;t have to worry about the harshness of certain compounds.</li>
            <li>I follow it up with either pure coconut oil or The Body Shop Vitamin E moisture mask.</li>
            <li>Afterwards I apply another product bought here at Amazon: pure Emu oil.</li>
            <li>The large pores are on my chin cheeks and nose.</li>
            <li>so I need to get a large bowl and put it in the sink to rinse.</li>
            <li>I will certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li>And right before my son&#x27;s 2nd birthday party, right on!</li>
            <li>this is the pure truth.</li>
            <li>It does wonders on skin with large pores, Sebaceous Filaments, and helps to reduce acne and inflammation.</li>
            <li>I ordered this to improve the appearance of large pores and for acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>From this product I was hoping to reduce the appearance of large pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 100% pure dirt.</li>

            <li>I have large, clogged pores that occurred after moving to desert.</li>
            <li>In addition, the pores in the corners of my nose are quite large.</li>
            <li>Pure clay.</li>
            <li>And yet, with large pores and the occassional breakout  (because I dont; stick to routine) I seek out products like these.</li>
            <li>comes in a powder form, was thrown off and still haven&#x27;t reopened it because you have to mix it a certain way with water.</li>

            <li>acne is GONE and my large pores have shrunk.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s pure clay, which means no fragrance.</li>
            <li>I ordered a large 2lb bag of this off of ebay.</li>
            <li>I certainly fond this mask.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and large pores.  </li>
            <li>It clears blackheads, exfoliates, softens skin and is made of pure earth, no added whatevers.</li>
            <li>But this product certainly lives up to the hype!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>ON OILY SKIN AND SHRINKS LARGE PORES.</li>
            <li>I have large pores and this helps reduce the appearance of them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Yesterday afternoon I noticed a large insect bite on my forearm.</li>
            <li>I feel like im not just peeling my skin like certain peels out there--</li>
            <li>maybe people who force large amount of it had problems with drains</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re basically getting is a large jar of powdered mud.</li>
            <li>My mother has large pores on her nose.</li>
            <li>me and my mother have struggled with sagging skin and puffiness under the eyes as well as large pores.</li>
            <li>So I rinsed off my face in a large bowl which was not helping the mask come off.</li>
            <li>I have Seborrheic Dermatitis in certain areas of my face, and acne all over my forehead.</li>
            <li>I have large pores that get clogged often</li>
            <li>I used it on my hubby who has large pores and you can see them clogged...</li>
            <li>OR my pores are too large</li>
            <li>I have oily skin with large pores...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really interested in pulsation, just smooth clean skin.</li>
            <li>A very fine, soft, odorless powder meant to be mixed with water or vinegar.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin amazing and mask gets super hard.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice now and so far it&#x27;s made my face really soft and smooth and seems like it&#x27;s really gonna start to fade my acne scars!</li>
            <li>It leaves your face soft and beautiful and has helped clear up a couple trouble spots on my face.</li>
            <li>Your face feels and looks fresh after each use, and the fact that it clear my acne is a plus!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my first mask of any kind, so I was not really expecting too much wow factor.</li>
            <li>It tightens your face to the point where you cant even open your mouth, so it&#x27;s kind of a hassle if your significant other is home, and you can&#x27;t do anything but whimper at them</li>
            <li>this was the first time i mixed my own facial</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin fresh and soft!</li>
            <li>This did live up to the hype and my skin looked much better after using it only once</li>
            <li>/&gt;Washing it off is pretty easy, I ran hot water for 2 mins to make sure that it washes off the mud in the drain.&lt;br /&gt;After, I can physically see that my pores were 90% smaller, I can barely see it.</li>
            <li>far I&#x27;ve only used this product twice a week for two weeks, yet the results are far more exceptional than I had expected.</li>
            <li>The left over mask does not dry out in the plastic container and is just as effective as the &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; batch.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>id half to buy another $17 worth of products from amazon  to be able to check out.</li>
            <li>It mixed to a very smooth,creamy consistency and was quite easy to put on my face.</li>
            <li>It does dry the skin so you definitely need a good moisturizer after.</li>
            <li>I splashed my face and neck thoroughly with warm water (without rubbing the skin) until all the clay melted away, then I patted dry with a soft towel.</li>
            <li>Easy, fast and simple.</li>
            <li>Once the mask is dry I rinse with warm water and a soft cloth.  </li>
            <li>Amazing tight cleansed skin.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel nice and tight.</li>
            <li>The mask feels nice on your face, it gets really tight.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it pulls so tight across the bridge of my nose, it opened my sinuses.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it pulls so tight across the bridge of my nose, it opened my sinuses.</li>
            <li>So I just added a bottle of my usual hair conditioner, which I essentially got for free because it gave me the magic number I needed for free shipping.</li>
            <li>I was able to clean up pores around my nose, easily with the proper tool, because of this prep, and I then followed my usual skin care routine.  </li>
            <li>Honestly my skin is pretty much the same after several uses.</li>
            <li>Rinse mud off with a lot of warm water (pat the dried mud with wet hands first to get the ball rolling), then use more water to massage it around and eventually rinse off fully.</li>
            <li>have been using the mask for about 4-5 months now, once a week or before special or major events...</li>
            <li>Sure it&#x27;s more pure than what&#x27;s out back and has less worms, but it&#x27;s just dirt.</li>
            <li>This stuff seriously works and it is amazing!</li>
            <li>For me I noticed my fine lines diminishing after the second mask.  </li>
            <li>After washing my face clean, I can actually feel the difference in my skin; it  feels soft, clean and renewed.  </li>
            <li>I keep my tub in a zip-lock bag the powder is extremely fine, also I recommend tying the hair back.</li>
            <li>It feels refreshing and exactly like any other toner I have ever used.</li>
            <li>it sure worked wonders for my dry aged skin... :)</li>
            <li>It has not improved the fine lines I have around my eyes, but it has definitely reduced the pore size and seems to have started some collagen production.</li>
            <li>I use it for the occasional blemish, works fine for that.  </li>
            <li>I just bought it a couple days ago, but my first results have been better than other masks I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It left my face squeaky clean, literally, and I&#x27;ve never had skin this clean or soft... ever.</li>
            <li>I have always mixed it with water &amp; it worked fine</li>
            <li>It worked fine on all three applications, and I used it with equal parts apple cider vinegar to clay powder.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is an all-natural, decently priced godsend!</li>
            <li>This mask in particular has changed my face!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried it with the water as a facial mask, but it did make my pores seem invisible, and my face was super smooth!</li>
            <li>Kind of messy, but easy enough to apply.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think of it as a mask to make your face smoother and vibrant but as a pimple killer!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think of it as a mask to make your face smoother and vibrant but as a pimple killer!</li>
            <li>A friend recommended this VERY highly, she has been using this mud for years.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin with large pores</li>
            <li>A friend of mine, who suggested this to me, has oily skin, large pores and breaks out a lot, so she uses the vinegar, and it works really well for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I really guess I thought it would keep my skin pure</li>
            <li>Be sure to moisturize after using it because your face will be very dry afterward</li>
            <li>There is a very noticeable pulsing and your face will most likely be red afterwards, but it fades quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update - the weather is getting a little cooler and drier now, so I don&#x27;t do the mask as often, maybe once a week max, but the anti-aging cream I recommended, Bel Essence is amazing in the cooler and drier weather.  </li>
            <li>Amazing mask, dries pimples and evens skin tone a little.</li>
            <li>I went through the greenbelt in austin the other day, its enormous, lush and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Getting the mask off can be a little challenge, even if you use copious amounts of warm water.</li>
            <li>and it felt a little tingly, but really nice.  </li>
            <li>I mix with filtered water and a little rose water.</li>
            <li>So nice, I like to use this for a little &#x27;me&#x27; time.</li>
            <li>Honestly this makes me break out in little pimples all over my forehead.</li>
            <li>I took a warm facecloth to melt it off little at a time.</li>
            <li>Another good way to mix the clay is to use raw and unfiltered honey!</li>
            <li>I mainly wanted to try this to give my skin a &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34; pretty much.</li>
            <li>The product arrived fast and the price was pretty decent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the easiest thing to mix, and I can usually never get the right texture...</li>
            <li>I grabbed a Tupperware bowl and poured quite a large amount of the clay into it which when mixed with the apple cider vinegar ended up making a huge batch.</li>
            <li>it is very easy to remove but for someone lazy like me, it can be a pain (but still worth the effort!)oil control</li>
            <li>I use the clean and clear dual action moisturizer, it works really well!</li>
            <li>so I used witch hazel with a little lavender essential oil and it was great.</li>
            <li>For the rest of that month my mom used a whole shampoo bottle of Nizoral on my scalp &amp; effectively got rid of practically all the fungus except for two little parts on the nape of my scalp.  </li>
            <li>but I waited a little bit before writing a review, to make sure that I can give a useful feedback.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This says good for 10 uses, but I&#x27;ve covered my face in it now 4 times and hardly see a dent in the amount gone.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s hard to blend to a good result.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to get a good consistency as well.</li>
            <li>I mixed 2 table spoons of clay and 2 tablespoons of organic cider vinegar plus a tiny bit more water in a non - metallic bowl and mixed with a plastic fork until very smooth .</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant to put oil on my skin, but it has only made my skin better, and it works better than any chemical anti-aging cream I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant to put oil on my skin, but it has only made my skin better, and it works better than any chemical anti-aging cream I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ok so I thought my skin looked brighter, I looked at my pores and thought ok, they look a little smaller.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit hard to mix with water into a smooth paste, so I recommend pre-mixing a batch in a cup or bowl and letting it sit overnight with saran wrap over the top of the container.</li>
            <li>Ok, like many of the other reviewers, I&#x27;ve had acne for a very, very long time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very clean pure powder and the apple vinegar recommended below taste like crap but its very good when mixing with the aztec powder.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, all was great being acne free but now for the past 3 days all around my mouth I have been breaking out really-really bad, I honestly have counted 15!</li>
            <li>I finally decided to give this a try after seeing it a few times , and I am happy I bought it.</li>
            <li>My skin is slightly red after taking it off, but the next morning my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this for just one time, I woke up the next morning and noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>It totally shrunk my huge pores on my nose and</li>
            <li>I did my whole face last night and he commented on how smooth my face looked today.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it enough to truly give an accurate review, but seems to do the job.</li>
            <li>However what I am most pleased with is how it has peeled off the old dead skin on my legs and clear up the eczema/dry like skin</li>
            <li>my boyfriend had huge pores and red skin</li>
            <li>I went from worrying about when the next huge breakout would happen to having no worries at all.</li>
            <li>It works great on facial issues, blackheads, and also on dead skin on feet and athlete&#x27;s foot.</li>
            <li>My skin felt smooth but not great or amazing.</li>
            <li>I had a huge pimple that wouldn&#x27;t go away for 2 weeks and was deep under my skin.</li>
            <li>When i work out or sweat, i get huge bumps on my inner thighs.</li>
            <li>Ive used this several times on my clients and have noticed a huge difference with blackheads and acne.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it is a huge hassle to mix(clumps, splashes, etc), and I have tried the vinegar mix as well as the water mix with identical results; it does help with pimples and blackheads, but it is no miracle worker, and when used as instructed it dries out my skin during use to the point where it begins to burn, and leaves my face red and ultra-sensitive for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>Although it will not give you amazing skin in 3 days, it will do the following from my personal experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My mom actually bought this and since this container is absolutely huge...</li>
            <li>But I can&#x27;t help myself when there is a huge white pus bump on your face).</li>
            <li>I was having a huge breakout when I started using this product and only used it twice at this point and was amazed by how fast my face is clearing up.</li>
            <li>but it is so worth it for me to have my fave clear up as much as it has.</li>
            <li>It comes in powder form, so mixing it with water yields a different texture every time, and it&#x27;s too much work to put it in a plastic baggy every time in order to make a completely smooth mask.</li>
            <li>Huge tube, will probably last me forever.</li>
            <li>Definitely intense suction, and left my skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Huge container, will last forever.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-It made such a huge difference in shrinking my boyfriend&#x27;s pores.</li>
            <li>but now I only have battle scars (Blemishes), white/black heads and huge pores on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The amazing result is: it actually caused about 30 tiny breakouts on my face in just one night;</li>
            <li>but I have already seen a HUGE change in the texture of my skin, especially my forehead.</li>
            <li>if you want to clear up your acne you would need to first figure out what&#x27;s causing the acne in the first place</li>
            <li>Add these to your skin care routine and in a few weeks you should see amazing results.</li>
            <li>I have huge pores and a deep rooted whiteheaded pimple that wouldn&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li>but once I rinse the clay off my skin is soft, clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>With only two uses I see drastic results, my pores are smaller, acne vanished, amazing even skin tone.</li>
            <li>This is assuming that you&#x27;re using it on your whole face.</li>
            <li>The stuff really pulls everything out of your face.</li>
            <li>but I am going to see if it makes as much of a difference as everyone says.</li>
            <li>I feel like it really helped my skin.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t need that much for your face-</li>
            <li>I would like it this much.  </li>
            <li>the process of peeling it off, I realized this stuff really does get into the pores.  </li>
            <li>Can anyone tell me how much I should mix with vinegar</li>
            <li>and it didnt show much improvement</li>
            <li>Mix really well.  </li>
            <li>I really like it and will use again.</li>
            <li>this stuff dries, it really shrinks and pulls.</li>
            <li>I felt like this product really helped with combination issue.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s really no secret that it helps cleanse the pores and tighten the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things to try to cleanse my skin but nothing ever really worked.</li>
            <li>This did work really well for me.</li>
            <li>and I was very depressed and started looking online for a remedy.</li>
            <li>its so time consuming to come off, since I recommend not washing it off straight in your bathtub or sink; the material turns into dirt once it dries</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 37 and don&#x27;t really have acne anymore</li>
            <li>Her whole face was inflamed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found a microfiber cloth takes it off much easier than a washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Forget clay - join this century and check out what modern science can do for you.  </li>
            <li>but it really hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>However, on the third week onward, my face starts to feel smooth and the pimples are reduced in size and number.</li>
            <li>All in all, i am very please with this product and</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Trust when I say this stuff is really helpful for acne prone skin..</li>
            <li>I saw this on amazon whole browsing and had to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know its dirt, or whatever, and I know some people question what the reAl ingredients and authenticity of those ...</li>
            <li>I know its dirt, or whatever, and I know some people question what the reAl ingredients and authenticity of those ...</li>
            <li>Really tightens pores.</li>
            <li>I was absolutely astounded at the improvement in just one application (I used [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>He rinsed it off gently in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>and it has really helped with my skin.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t believe you get so much for the price.</li>
            <li>It made my face really itchy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It can take you a bit to figure out how much powder and liquid to mix.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li>really recommended</li>
            <li>I made a mask for my husband and I, and I still made too much (I used a quarter cup of the clay and a quarter cup of apple cider vinegar).  </li>
            <li>Really helps with acne and scarring.</li>
            <li>Upon washing it off, my skin looked smooth, the pores were smaller, and my pimples had diminished.  </li>
            <li>When I woke up the next morning, my face was smooth, my skin looked rejuvenated, and the pimples were reduced in size and severity.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be continuing the regimen with high hopes!</li>
            <li>but it leaves my face feeling fresh and soft</li>
            <li>It really works .</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t do that much.</li>
            <li>It is reasonably priced for the benefits that it delivers.</li>
            <li>Let me tell ya, I changed my whole face routine in hopes that my face will heal soon.</li>
            <li>The mask will leave your face somewhat red but its temporary and a smooth look.  </li>
            <li>It does wonders for cleaning up my skin, really.</li>
            <li>I have really acne-prone, oily skin as well.</li>
            <li>As most reviews say, be careful using this stuff in the shower.</li>
            <li>It was delivered fast and once I got it home</li>
            <li>I havent seen any improvement really in my skin.</li>
            <li>if you struggle with acne-prone or oily skin, I highly, HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li>it.ly, HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li>but I feel like this product doesn&#x27;t do much for my face or acne.</li>
            <li>, it suctioned so much, that it had drawn the corners of my nose &#x27;in&#x27; some and</li>
            <li>This clay really works.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It is so gentle on my skin and my daughter uses it as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Here&#x27;s what really happened to me:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Overall, I enjoy the product.</li>
            <li>really?</li>
            <li>After years of suffering acne and the inflamed wasteland that comes after, I finally see a light at the end of the tunnel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make the commitment to use it as much as you need.</li>
            <li>Make the commitment to use it as much as you need.</li>
            <li>I really like it and so does my sister.</li>
            <li>Make sure to wash your face carefully after.</li>
            <li>I saw it here on Amazon and was contemplating buying it, but then I saw it in the beauty section at Whole Foods and bought it along with the Apple Cider Vinegar.</li>
            <li>It really makes the skin cleaner.</li>
            <li>evenly so my clay mix was very watery.</li>
            <li>I only have light acne</li>
            <li>And it didn&#x27;t really start the \\&quot;pulsing\\</li>
            <li>but nothing intense.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really think it works for acne, except it shrinks my blackheads sometimes.</li>
            <li>sometimes so much that I can&#x27;t even leave it on for one minute.</li>
            <li>This thing really does wonder.</li>
            <li>And it is very affordable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason I got the Clay is because of all the minerals it can deposit into your skin and to help tighten pores, which this does very well.</li>
            <li>This jar I skeptically mixed and put what looked like mud paste with clumps I couldn&#x27;t quite smooth out on my face.</li>
            <li>Well, I ordered it and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>and my skin was much smoother.  </li>
            <li>Nothing seems to work very well.  </li>
            <li>It could be improved if it was ready to use instead of mixing powder with water to put on the face.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, which means that I am also acne prone.</li>
            <li>It really cleans well</li>
            <li>The second night using this product made my face feel smooth as a baby&#x27;s ass</li>
            <li>I really want to like this product</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It feels like it really cleans your skin and penetrating in to your pores and getting the filth out.</li>
            <li>When I tried mixing with water, the clay clumped and had a really lumpy texture.</li>
            <li>i guess time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;The pulling and tingling feeling is definitely intense.</li>
            <li>I really like the product.</li>
            <li>realized I had no idea how much to mix</li>
            <li>I used a pre-moistened face wipe but that didn’t really work.</li>
            <li>I really can’t wait to see what using this stuff for 3 weeks will do!nd of course then my friends asked me to go out.</li>
            <li>I really like this clay.  </li>
            <li>This is very cost effective for me, it saves me time and money than going to spa for a deep pore cleansing facial, which earns another star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This mask works great!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and for the price</li>
            <li>and this clay is very alkaline.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-aloe vera gel (to soothe)&lt;br /&gt;-turmeric powder (an anti-inflammatory agent, not too much though as it can</li>
            <li>I am becoming a life long customer and will always trust this company with all my heart.</li>
            <li>I cant say much yet as iv used it once</li>
            <li>Hopefully my face recovers very</li>
            <li>I also put too much on (the directions say</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s VERY inexpensive and works.  </li>
            <li>really well.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make me break out, leaves my skin looking fresh and soft.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t notice as much oil the day after using the mask.  </li>
            <li>I was really hoping for the miracle everyone was talking about...</li>
            <li>- it doesn&#x27;t cost much for the number of uses you can make from this product.  </li>
            <li>But i am reviewing this from my point of view and it really burned my skin.</li>
            <li>but it really did disappear even though I thought it wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s Much easier to use with ACV than water.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t want to clog my drains or my washer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t want to clog my drains or my washer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing for my son&#x27;s acne.</li>
            <li>I really like this mask, it does what it claims.</li>
            <li>This product really works and results are seen within a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>this wasnt really a miracle.</li>
            <li>it is however like ive heard very tightening</li>
            <li>We tried Proactiv, but it didn&#x27;t have much of an effect for either of us.  </li>
            <li>I had no idea of how much to mix up</li>
            <li>Try a tablespoon at a time, until you know how much you require.  </li>
            <li>Mix a bit of water with it, and as it dries it really pulls on your skin.</li>
            <li>You really feel this working</li>
            <li>We have had the whole family try ouet.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Once I am done with my bath or when the tightness is too much for me, I remove the mask with a washcloth.</li>
            <li>I also notice my pores seem to get smaller and if I use it before an event, my makeup looks more natural( I also don&#x27;t have to use much)</li>
            <li>When I do do my whole face</li>
            <li>Not so much.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>This really cleanses the deepest layers of the skin, you can feel it sucking out all the oil.</li>
            <li>but it performs better than I expected it to.</li>
            <li>Man this stuff really gets the job done with pores/ acne.</li>
            <li>It will really itch and make you crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I personally put mine in a plastic baggy and cut the tip and apply it like you would decorate a cake and then smooth out.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t use as much as you think.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like anything else, it&#x27;s as much what you put in your body as what you put on it.</li>
            <li>it really makes a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>Thanks to all the reviews too.  </li>
            <li>I whole-heartedly I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This works really well.  </li>
            <li>My skin has been very acne prone</li>
            <li>If you use too much it can clog up your sink/shower.</li>
            <li>and it was really embarrasing</li>
            <li>The mask really does pulsate...</li>
            <li>Being very inexpensive, I decided to order it and try it out.</li>
            <li>I think this is what really stopped my body from \\&quot;making\\</li>
            <li>Tanda blue light 1-2x/day on problem areas.</li>
            <li>I havent really seen improvement..</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and sebacious cystic acne.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I use this on spa night once a week and the next morn by face is smooth.</li>
            <li>or I gently press on acne pimple to remove puss</li>
            <li>It was very clumpy, very un mask like.</li>
            <li>I really didnt see a difference in my skin after taking it off.</li>
            <li>I absolutely L.O.V.E.</li>
            <li>This really cleans out your pores but it itches like hell</li>
            <li>My face felt so much smoother, and there was no irritation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It then made me realize how much healthier this is rather than premade masks.</li>
            <li>It really cleared up alll my acne.</li>
            <li>If it starts to burn too much</li>
            <li>Really, I have used this stuff for about a month</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I ddnt really feel much of the pulsating feeling of it</li>
            <li>You really can feel it working.</li>
            <li>For the record, I have very oily skin, and after reading all the 5 star reviews I figured this product had to do SOMETHING for my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>HAHA</li>
            <li>Best of all, when I felt an emerging acne cyst--which can develop and last for MONTHS--I put the mask on it a few nights in a row in desperation, and it actually stopped and reversed the progress of the cyst!</li>
            <li>amazing!My pores are soo much</li>
            <li>Never thought I would like this as much as I do.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>As I started using it, you can really tell that it opens up your pores</li>
            <li>It has a very earthy feel and smell.</li>
            <li>It has helped my face so much.</li>
            <li>The bottle lies, you don&#x27;t need much at all.</li>
            <li>It really pulled out all the junk in my pores.</li>
            <li>Really like this stuff</li>
            <li>, I had a dermatologist, the whole nine yards.</li>
            <li>Like, it literally started drying on my cheek as I moved to my nose, haha.</li>
            <li>Like, it literally started drying on my cheek as I moved to my nose, haha.</li>
            <li>, I do not think that I am breaking out quite as much, and if I have acne, this helps to heal it faster.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will make a liquid paste and apply to whole face or just the acne</li>
            <li>I used this mask for 3 days in a row and the acne isn&#x27;t really improving.  </li>
            <li>and i see what the whole \\&quot;pulsating\\&quot; thing is about.</li>
            <li>my whole face feels like it&#x27;s bumpin and grinding to some dubstep,</li>
            <li>I really like this mask.</li>
            <li>I never heard of the Aztec brand before but this product really works.</li>
            <li>Does what it says it does, and my skin feels much cleaner afterwards.</li>
            <li>Very affective mask.</li>
            <li>I am very</li>
            <li>it really does pulsate as it dries.</li>
            <li>This is very good.&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li>I expected more of the cleaning effect from this clay...</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t really work so well for</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I bought this on a whim and didn&#x27;t expect much from it.</li>
            <li>like really, really break out like</li>
            <li>Your skin really feels like it&#x27;s pulsating</li>
            <li>, therefore to incorporate this \\&quot;magnet\\&quot; to any detox routine is very beneficial as Dr. Bernard Jensen discusses in his book</li>

            <li>my surprise, my face was much smoother.  </li>
            <li>I have suffered from acne my whole life.  </li>
            <li>I had to wear a cast for a whole week, so I couldn&#x27;t wash my face.  </li>
            <li>My skin literally looked like gravel on Monday - it is now Thursday and some of my skin is smooth and the rest of the pimples are significantly smaller in size.  </li>
            <li>The premixed is much easier.</li>
            <li>I really like how it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li>/&gt;While some people say you can use it with water, I really don&#x27;t recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I had to aggressively wash it off and it took so much longer to do.</li>
            <li>Very misleading.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It really opened up my pores and cleaned them out.</li>

            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty normal skin</li>
            <li>it really helps a lot.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see a difference</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon, you have really thought about what your customers may need and</li>
            <li>Really tightens my pores</li>
            <li>, made a thousand times too much for my face.  </li>
            <li>and you can mix as much as you like.</li>
            <li>I used my clay, and I can tell you it was the real deal.</li>
            <li>so I added as much water as I felt needed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard so much about this mask refering to acne</li>
            <li>I really like this product, but I really recommend applying this stuff maybe - to start - once a week.</li>
            <li>Another note, I find that 1 tablespoon of the clay to 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar (or water) works really well.</li>
            <li>really?</li>
            <li>I mix a very miniscule amount of powder, maybe 1/2 tsp with bentonite clay liquid.  </li>
            <li>and you really can feel that tightening/pulling sensation.</li>
            <li>You really can feel the pulse as it dries on your skin.</li>
            <li>, i don&#x27;t really care about that.&lt;br /&gt;after</li>
            <li>I really like it and&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>works well, too much, and</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Fast service too</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, the whole \\&quot;feel your skin</li>
            <li>it really is a mud mask</li>
            <li>Give it a chance to really work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This really DETOXES you, so be prepared.</li>
            <li>This really DETOXES you, so be prepared.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s drying, at this point, and it&#x27;s really tightening...</li>
            <li>It really cleaned our faces and shrinked my pores.</li>
            <li>My scalp has so much build up</li>
            <li>but it  really does help with everything</li>
            <li>thanks to this mask i dont have acne anymore&lt;</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need that much at all with each use.</li>
            <li>It has really increased my confidence.</li>
            <li>It was very lumpy</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it really lifted all the dirt and oils frm my face</li>
            <li>I was really hoping it would take away my blackheads</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really get it</li>
            <li>and my skin glows, feels tighter and much healthier once I wash it off.</li>
            <li>but she has also found it works really well as a neutrally colored finishing powder.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make much of a difference, I don&#x27;t think.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>As the mask dries, you can really feel the clay pulling out the impurities from your pores.</li>
            <li>I really felt my face tighten up this stuff is legit</li>
            <li>and it really makes my skin feel so much softer.</li>
            <li>Never had a product tighten my pores so much.  </li>
            <li>, it really is.</li>
            <li>but it really works to help pull curl pattern out of your hair</li>
            <li>For some reason I thought the consistency was going to be much thicker.  </li>
            <li>I really like the product and use it once weekly.  </li>
            <li>Results are fast.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t make out how much clay, water, and apple cider vinegar to use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really think it worked too well.  </li>
            <li>This came soooo fast, I almost couldn&#x27;t believe when I found the package on my doorstep in what just felt like three or four days.</li>
            <li>Cant really be beat for that price.</li>
            <li>Made my skin look and feel smooth and made my pores appear smaller.  </li>
            <li>But the reason I continue to put so much care into my routine is to maintain it.</li>
            <li>really wish I came across this sooner.</li>
            <li>It really does feel like it&#x27;s sucking all the impurities.</li>
            <li>I used it with white vinegar and it just makes my skin look so smooth.</li>
            <li>REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>ITS VERY CLEANSING, IT DRAWS OUT A LOT OF IMPURITIES</li>
            <li>Really, where do I begin.</li>
            <li>But in college, you really expect by about the time you&#x27;re 18, your acne should be dissipating.</li>
            <li>never thought there would be a miracle product, because we&#x27;ve always been led to believe there really isn&#x27;t a miracle product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to really stock up on this stuff.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d just say use whatever cleanser (GENTLE cleanser) works for you.  </li>
            <li>it on for 15-20 mins or 30.. depending on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Use witch hazel with cotton pads (trust me on this) gently wipe skin with it</li>
            <li>besides your cleanser and moisturizer, but that&#x27;s why I advise using a quality, gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>go to Skinstore.com or dermstore.com and do some research on a gentle cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been ranting for well over 10 minutes now, but clearly the reader can tell that I&#x27;m venting about this success story.</li>

            <li>works really well.</li>
            <li>I think I got this whole tub for about $5.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is getting it smooth.</li>
            <li>Id say go for it, especially since it is so cheap.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use as much as they say to.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for me...used it for couple months.</li>
            <li>I do NOT suggest adding water to the clay, it absorbs really fast</li>
            <li>Works very well as a body mask/wrap.</li>
            <li>Really helped shrink my pores</li>
            <li>The clay is very well milled.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>It works, and it works fast.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin.  </li>
            <li>Turn on your faucet and let the water run very</li>
            <li>I was absolutely astounded to see, after ONE use, its lifting effects.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be curious to see if repeated use of the clay makes that effect more permanent.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I mix with apple vinegar and it really gets the blood flowing in my face which creates a glow after the mask is off.</li>
            <li>Dealt with acne my whole life.</li>
            <li>is being sucked haha..</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>but I find myself not doing it as much because I have to do it before I take a shower</li>
            <li>These works really well for cleaning out my pores.</li>
            <li>this thing really opens pores.</li>
            <li>Such a fabulous clay mask for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li>It really has improved the health and vitality of my skin.</li>
            <li>and ruff i thank it works very well</li>
            <li>I really wish I would&#x27;ve found this sooner.</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin</li>
            <li>I can really feel it working while I have it on.</li>
            <li>and this has work really well for me .</li>
            <li>but it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>You can make different scrubs for your face that leave your face feeling smooth and cleansed.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much it pulled out of my skin.</li>
            <li>As for me, my skins pretty normal</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>, it really burns when it say pulsate believe me</li>
            <li>but it burns too much</li>
            <li>, it all soaked into my skin as fast as I put it on.  </li>
            <li>also it made my face really itchy while it was drying.</li>
            <li>So when you&#x27;re ready to take the clay off, just keep wiping all of it off with the cloth and wring it out in the bucket.</li>
            <li>Haha...</li>
            <li>the Vitamin Shoppe has this product on sale for 4.99 plus 20% of your entire order PLUS free shipping for orders over $25.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much and even a think</li>
            <li>, twenty minutes doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>Works well, but it REALLY clogs the sink.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a real challenge to unclog.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this clay much at all.</li>
            <li>to finally have a cheap product that will salve ALL my problems.</li>
            <li>used it with Bragg&#x27;s Apple Cider Vinegar (which you can also purchase here on Amazon) and used about 4 tsp of each for my whole face, although I think you could get away with 3.</li>
            <li>Fast forward to 2013, I saw &amp; read (through youtube &amp; blogs) about some people doing a mud wash on their scalp to help them get rid of product buildup, dandruff, and psoriasis or to keep the psoriasis at bay for a while.  </li>
            <li>For the price, I absolutely recommend.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really get anything from it.  </li>
            <li>The sulfur mask really felt like it was working my skin.  </li>
            <li>Although I added this as a &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; got get free shipping on my total order, I had tried it before.</li>
            <li>but I think its the apple cider that you use with it that really has the effect.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really need clay to help your skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is all oily in the morning and this helps it sooo much</li>
            <li>I accidentally created a mixture that was too much</li>
            <li>Got my whole family using it.</li>
            <li>Also, don&#x27;t talk with this stuff on as it hardens when it dries and can stretch the skin if you move too much with it on.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews on here about how it works so well, and I thought I might as well give it a try since I really have nothing to lose.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had acne since puberty hit (which was a loooong time ago) and nothing has ever really worked.</li>
            <li>Found cheaper at Whole Foods (hence 4 stars), but they were out, so I bought online as a gift for a friend.</li>
            <li>The pores look the same and all it does feel smooth...</li>
            <li>Reading the 3, 2 and 1 star ratings was very illuminating and made me too nervous to use it on her, considering my redness.  </li>

            <li>U really do feel tightness and ur face pulsing...</li>
            <li>Works really well to help suck up oil from my skin.</li>
            <li>Really clears up the skin.</li>
            <li>There is nothing I can say to express how much this saved my skin.</li>
            <li>people really mixing this with water?  </li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t tell my roommates, and try to get as much of it off before hitting the shower.  </li>
            <li>Bentonite is really great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it really cleans out my pores.  </li>
            <li>and I must say this is a much cleaner and smoother application than using your fingers.</li>
            <li>My face was not bothered at all by the burning-which is a really itchy sensation but my neck and chest were.</li>
            <li>Rub it between your hands and really squish the mixture</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>-it made the process much easier.</li>
            <li>Rub it between your hands and really squish the mixture</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this isn&#x27;t too much of a chore, but</li>
            <li>Consequently, much of this stuff is still lying around my bathroom.</li>
            <li>I like this because it pulls oil from my face very well, without drying it too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I drink this clay every evening before bed it really helps with elimination.</li>
            <li>I used it and it really drew out impurities.  </li>
            <li>It remained very lumpy</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>I can really feel my skin tightening when I use this.  </li>
            <li>that really aren&#x27;t compatable with my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting this skin forever, and it&#x27;s largely in thanks to this product that I have it.</li>
            <li>suggest you use this once or twice a week on your whole face and then however often you need it just on those problem areas.</li>

            <li>I have really oily skin</li>
            <li>I tried mixing it with water and it came out very clumpy even after mixing and mashing thoroughly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has helped my skin so much.</li>
            <li>Yes, very annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You feel your whole face pulsate</li>
            <li>This can prevent scaring from itching bug bites too much which is a quality thing to have in a medicine cabinet too!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Also I&#x27;m a straight  guy  </li>
            <li>Really gets out impurities</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>But u really need to follow the instruction cuz theres</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this mask, or whatever you want to call it.</li>
            <li>It really does help draw \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; (ie.</li>
            <li>Then I gently rub, rinse the cloth, and repeat until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it as a \\&quot;maintenance\\&quot; skin care product, because I really do think it does what it says regarding removing gunk from your pores.</li>
            <li>Just use a wet paper towel to remove most of it and then wash off.</li>
            <li>I am really fond of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Activated charcoal makes for an incredible mask on its own, but is quite messy and can be difficult to remove from your skin.  </li>

            <li>I bought this mask from Whole Foods for $6.99.</li>
            <li>Overall i liked this product especially it being so reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>really wish that there were an easier way to use this.</li>
            <li>Yes whole foods even sells it for about 8 dollars.</li>
            <li>So if you cannot wait go to whole foods and buy it or order it off here.</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon for your services.</li>
            <li>I was very hopeful for this product.</li>
            <li>(It really hurts, man).</li>
            <li>haha).</li>
            <li>I really like this as I feel when I use this ( which take a while since I put it on the thicker side)</li>
            <li>it really is drying and cleaning out my skin.</li>
            <li>Better than expected.</li>
            <li>but i did not have any redness and wouldn&#x27;t really mind if I had.  </li>
            <li>It really removes blackheads with ease and calms any signs of acne.</li>
            <li>stop thinking about it and go for it because you really won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic mask especially mixed with apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li>I saw all the real benefits.</li>
            <li>I suggest once or twice a week, no matter how much you want to speed things up.</li>
            <li>I really encourage anyone to try it.</li>
            <li>This stuff (as well as a strict skin regimen) is truly responsible for building my self confidence up again.</li>
            <li>So let&#x27;s face it, this stuff looks really hokey.</li>
            <li>Not expecting much, I gave it a whirl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really works.</li>
            <li>Make no mistake, you really feel this stuff contract and pull at your pores, you&#x27;ll literally feel like your face is pulsating.</li>
            <li>However, it is VERY drying.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>Ok I&#x27;m going to start off by saying that I&#x27;ve never really had pimple problems...</li>
            <li>I have had oily skin and acne problems my whole life.  </li>
            <li>This really is a miracle product.</li>
            <li>but it really didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s ready to take off</li>
            <li>Nearly every comment was a success story.</li>
            <li>The real shocker was when I applied my make up.</li>
            <li>but i really did not like it.</li>
            <li>We both really like it</li>
            <li>My skin really likes this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not the type of person who wants to spend a lot of time on my appearance, so I don&#x27;t use this nearly as much as I probably should to fully benefit from it.</li>
            <li>After about 2 months of using it, it did not do much for me.</li>
            <li>I really wanted it to work for me</li>
            <li>My skin is always left feeling super soft and clean.</li>
            <li>but I really like this product.</li>
            <li>(I have a whole arsenal of oils I use on my skin--olive, pomegranate, rosehip seed oil, grapeseed oil, coconut oil)</li>
            <li>.that&#x27;s when I could really tell the difference.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to fellow reviewers for introducing this to me.&lt;br /&gt;6.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- wipe face gently with cotton ball</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s really because of the apple cider vinegar though.</li>
            <li>Nothing has helped my blackhead issue as much as this clay.</li>
            <li>it just really did help get this stuff out of my pores.</li>
            <li>I open the bag up wide and I lightly scrape off what I can, most of it cracks and falls off into the bag</li>
            <li>everytime i do use it, my skin feels so much softer and much cleaner than an already made clay mask.</li>
            <li>but boy does this really kill zits.</li>
            <li>and it did come off really chipped</li>
            <li>Follow it with a gentle moisturizer.</li>
            <li>So when I use a toner it really shows how much of the clay gets into my skin.  </li>
            <li>It really does the trick.</li>
            <li>You can really feeling it working on your pores as the application dries off.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do much for me.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell if it worked.</li>
            <li>I bought bentonite clay really cheap, like 3lbs of it for a couple bucks, it&#x27;s the same thing as this</li>
            <li>I figured it would really pull out everything from all the reviews I read on line.</li>
            <li>clays will suck absolutely anything out of your pores.</li>
            <li>I do a heaping tablespoon of the powder and a tablespoon of the vinegar then mix it really well, getting rid of all the lumps.</li>
            <li>This mask (when made with the apple cider vinegar, NOT water) really helped my skin.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t seem to get it mixed smoothly.</li>
            <li>For the price though, I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>i really like it.</li>
            <li>You can really feel it working.</li>
            <li>It cleans my skins really well.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the very earthy feel of it.</li>
            <li>REALLY HELPED UNTIL I TURNED 3O.NOW</li>
            <li>I would always make to much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it it helped with my acne and scars!</li>
            <li>Once I start feeling the mask pulsate (it really does make my face feel</li>
            <li>and at that point you really want it off).  </li>
            <li>The sensation when it was drying was really neat haha.</li>
            <li>Over all, I am content with this product and would absolutely recomment it.</li>
            <li>Very drying, don&#x27;t forget your moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell the difference.</li>
            <li>How much water should I use?</li>
            <li>I just wish the product were sent in a package fully ready to apply.</li>
            <li>I have sooooo much leftover.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>It really does pulsate.  </li>
            <li>Its occurred to me now that it was working all the time, and It just took cumulative progress for me to finally really notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to buy it</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t have to wear much makeup anymore</li>
            <li>I actually really do like this product.</li>
            <li>I did notice that if you try to mix it with just water it has a very clumpy consistancy</li>
            <li>I really wanted to see the effect on the problem areas (chin-to-lip area), which is grand.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Not so much changes about the acne.</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin</li>
            <li>Yes, it really pulls on your skin, like it&#x27;s trying to suck your face off (</li>
            <li>Those are the really bigs ones I use this mask for.</li>
            <li>It doesnt do much to the skin, but I guess I will just keep using it.</li>
            <li>It cleaned out my pores very well.</li>
            <li>But if you have problematic skin that is very oily, plagued with whiteheads, etc.</li>
            <li>this might be very helpful for you.  </li>
            <li>Has really helped with my acne.</li>
            <li>As described, fast delivery, looking forward to trying it.</li>
            <li>I keep promising myself I will use it as it was intended, as a face mask.  </li>
            <li>You really feel it when you put it on...</li>
            <li>really worked on my acne prone skin</li>
            <li>There is just too much to wash off.  </li>
            <li>its cheap as hell and will probably last you a year if you use just a teaspoon or so at a time, which is all you need for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried everything to stop acne.</li>
            <li>I also recommend leaving it on for 30 mins and using a moisturizer (I use straight up aloe) afterwards.</li>
            <li>It is also quite gentle.  </li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>But now I will cut a bitch if they even so much as sniff my dirt.</li>
            <li>It really works for my oily skin and it arrived sooner</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t really see the benefits.</li>
            <li>But it really burned my skin</li>
            <li>So fare it didn&#x27;t do much for my skin and didnt help acne.</li>
            <li>You really can feel your face throbbing..</li>
            <li>I dont have to use as much makeup to cover up...</li>
            <li>It will be lumpy if you mix it will water, but surprisingly smooth when mixed with apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even consider the thought until it began to tighten, and I don&#x27;t think I had that much on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried to peel and rub off as much as I could and toss it as to not clog up my drains.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much experience with clay masks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very affordable price.</li>
            <li>I honestly expected more from this...</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>This mask is really intense.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very drying</li>
            <li>This really shrinks the pores.  </li>
            <li>It gets really clumpy/chunky though.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My pores really tightened up after using this and I will keep using it.</li>
            <li>but no biggie there is so much in a container</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t see much improvement on my blackheads.</li>
            <li>I had a lot of problem areas that were very bumpy and nothing seemed to get rid of them.</li>
            <li>✿✿ ABSOLUTELY</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fast solution.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fast solution.</li>
            <li>My face was pinker , my skin , especially on my upper chest was smooth as silk.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not going to be the frilly mask that smells like cucumbers and roses - it&#x27;s the real deal.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t want to find out what it&#x27;ll do if too much of it gets caught up in my pipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If it wouldn&#x27;t look so bizarre to walk around with this mask on, I might just do so to look 10 years younger!</li>
            <li>You can really feel that it&#x27;s working which I like.</li>
            <li>I expected more</li>
            <li>The divine beauty this product brought to my face brought a whole city into turmoil.</li>
            <li>it gives you real (life changing) results.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT WORKS VERY WELL</li>
            <li>VERY DRYING to skin.</li>
            <li>When used as directed, this product really pulls the dirt from your pores.</li>
            <li>and I really can feel my face pulsate like they say on the label.</li>
            <li>this \\&quot;healing\\&quot; clay really lives up to its name.</li>
            <li>: works really well, closes pores, doesn&#x27;t break out my skin, oil control</li>
            <li>really hope this helps my hormonal acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I can keep track of how much I&#x27;m drinking.</li>
            <li>I can control how much sugar I&#x27;m ingesting and to me</li>
            <li>I can control how much sugar I&#x27;m ingesting and to me</li>
            <li>and it was a bit too much for my skin.</li>
            <li>I did not experience redness following my application, I think because of the steam and lightly rubbing my face in a circular motion.</li>
            <li>But I just can not believe how much it cleared up my face.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t think it did much of anything . . .</li>
            <li>Like I said, too much work.</li>
            <li>I put on my acne lotion after, so it gets soaked up really fast.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li>I would mix for 10 minutes but it was still very lumpy.</li>
            <li>This mask works really well to cleanse face tighten pores.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I have very acne prone skin</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>For $7.50, I didn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li>, at 20mins I didn&#x27;t really see any changes</li>
            <li>It really helped their faces.</li>
            <li>THANKS FOR THIS</li>
            <li>but the solo cup with a spoon is much easier.  </li>
            <li>Nothing really out of this world</li>
            <li>, I know nothing about it, but it got here fast</li>
            <li>can really feel the tingling sensation, which I like because it means it&#x27;s doing something.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>Now my mother wants to try it.  </li>
            <li>So I try to get as much as I can peel off my face into the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I try to get as much as I can peel off my face into the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You will feel the freshness write away and the mask gets really really tigh as it pull Al of the dust and crab from your face</li>
            <li>but it turns out that this mask really does make your skin baby soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use a really think layer, maybe 1/8 of an inch.</li>
            <li>use this clay mask (5) rinse off (it comes off easiest if you use a wash cloth to collect water and splash it on your face just as you would if you were rinsing your face after washing it and using the cloth to gently remove the mask.</li>
            <li>but it makes too much</li>
            <li>First off let me say I have normal skin.</li>
            <li>It is too drying for me, not doing much.  </li>
            <li>I have used this on my skin and in my hair and both ways the products worked very well.</li>
            <li>He has really oily skin and since he shaves his head, the oily skin doesn&#x27;t seem to end until the neck.</li>
            <li>This mask is fun to apply and makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>yes it really does pulsate as its pulling gunk from your face.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to everyone no matter what skin type!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need the whole scoop to use on face.</li>
            <li>but it does not mix very well...</li>
            <li>It really made a difference to my skin.</li>
            <li>You can tell how much it dries out your skin.....</li>
            <li>Intense, and really tightens.</li>
            <li>I really do see some difference after using this product.  </li>
            <li>This is an intense mask.</li>
            <li>so I figured I didn&#x27;t have much to lose.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li>You want to have all skin covered throughout the whole process.</li>
            <li>because I let the shower rinse it off gently</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference with the size of my pores, but I&#x27;ll update my review after a longer time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is really clingy.</li>
            <li>I really feel it pulling all the gunk out of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>and it really worked.</li>
            <li>she tells me i have to try it with her because the stuff really works...</li>
            <li>she was upset that her face was broken out but happy that she had just the product to fix it...</li>
            <li>Have to admit I was very intrigued by this product.</li>
            <li>No matter how much I stirred and adjusted the water/mud ratio I still couldn&#x27;t get the lumps out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(this didn&#x27;t have much of a scent).</li>
            <li>So I say why not go straight to source and just use the real stuff.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this face mask, my husband and I both use it and like that it doesn&#x27;t have any additives or extra chemicals in it, it is just clay.</li>
            <li>Even my husband had pointed out how much cleaner my face is getting.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel like it is too much at all.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast though</li>
            <li>Heck ya, it&#x27;s much cheaper than going to see a doc and take medicine.</li>
            <li>Heck ya, it&#x27;s much cheaper than going to see a doc and take medicine.</li>
            <li>Really tightens</li>
            <li>You really do feel your face pulsating..</li>
            <li>This stuff is promising.</li>
            <li>It also has a very noticeable tightening effect on the skin.</li>
            <li>Cant say how much it helped with acne or scars after 3 weeks</li>
            <li>I am olive complected with very oily, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>and you can really feel it working while it dries.</li>
            <li>Every household should have some at the ready.</li>
            <li>my skin&#x27;s so much happier since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have crator pores thanks to my genetics</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it as a mask, but I don&#x27;t really need to use masks.</li>
            <li>I struggle with acne and very oily skin.</li>
            <li>, my body was very reliant on it.</li>
            <li>with the vinegar it is much smoother on the face.</li>
            <li>I wash with a gentle face wash before applying this.</li>
            <li>It really does make your face pulsate.</li>
            <li>It really does make your face pulsate.</li>
            <li>It really tightens the face and feels like it cleanses the pores.</li>
            <li>Just need to find something for the scars as neither one of these products helps much with that.</li>
            <li>I have not broken out since I started using this stuff two weeks ago</li>
            <li>I really like the cooling effect.</li>
            <li>This product really is the answer.</li>
            <li>After, I use gentle cleanser and</li>
            <li>was expecting much from this product</li>
            <li>I really hope this works.....</li>
            <li>and I have really acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I really did like this mask, I tried it with both vinegar and water but found it a bit drying after using.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to do a whole lot.</li>
            <li>This mask really shrunk her pores.</li>
            <li>You really feel that pulling sensation like your faced</li>
            <li>This has helped my face so much.</li>
            <li>but my skin is so much smoother and even.</li>
            <li>However, VERY EFFECTIVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really do..</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>mask is really a wonder.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s under $5.00, fast shipping</li>
            <li>Once the clay was smooth, I stirred in 1 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil.</li>
            <li>However, if making a mask and figuring out just how much you need</li>
            <li>and when you mix it with water it wont really stick to your face or pulse.</li>
            <li>It is a great secret .</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t see why theres so much hype to it</li>
            <li>This does what it&#x27;s supposed to do- absolutely TONS of clay</li>
            <li>but now I really like it.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t even feel like it does as much as it says it does.</li>
            <li>I Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my skin..</li>
            <li>I noticed my face was literally turning blue/purple and was very puffy.</li>
            <li>I didnt have much acne before I used this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made my skin look and feel much smoother and even-toned.</li>
            <li>That way I don&#x27;t have to use a washcloth which causes too much irritation.</li>
            <li>Really regret it.</li>
            <li>I was very concerned this is a drain clogger.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin...</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li>And it is soooo much product as well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize that you had to mix it to make the face mask, but mixing it isn&#x27;t too much of a hassle</li>
            <li>Really like this product</li>
            <li>I guess I don&#x27;t use this as much as I should</li>
            <li>does on the skin it really lets you know that</li>
            <li>/&gt;Incidentally, the tingly and pulsating comments by others is very valid.</li>
            <li>begun mixing a bit of water and 3 tea spoons of clay.mix til its smooth no clumps.mix honey or substitute the water with green tea for a more delicate clean.and remove with warm water only!!let</li>
            <li>so it really depends</li>
            <li>My face gets really oily in this hot-humid season.</li>
            <li>Cleans and shrinks pours very well</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t understand what the fuss is about.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this twice, don&#x27;t really see what all the hype is</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really liking this.  </li>
            <li>used it with apple cider vinegar (you can use water if you want) and put it on my very wrecked skin.</li>
            <li>I havent really seen a difference.</li>
            <li>cause Giiiirrrrlllll it does not dissolve very well.</li>
            <li>It really helps with my acne and replenishes my skin.</li>
            <li>I gave it four stars because I was hoping it would help with my blackheads that I have literally all over my face, but it didn&#x27;t really seem to do much.</li>
            <li>I use the apple cider vinegar and it really makes a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a miracle worker, but as a part of my skin care regime, it has worked really well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s changed my whole appearance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really not quite sure what to think about this clay.</li>
            <li>I used it a handful of times and didn&#x27;t really see any results at all.</li>
            <li>The reviews here about it are very persuasive</li>
            <li>Probably won&#x27;t  use it very often.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>My cat stared at me the whole while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this purchase!</li>
            <li>and I can say that this mask has really improved the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li>haha..</li>
            <li>but i am okey with it as I think this mask has really added glow to my face.</li>
            <li>My skin felt soft and smooth.. Will definitely be using this product regularly :)</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>Havn&#x27;t used it for much time</li>
            <li>I was skeptiical of buying skin care products off of Amazon because you don&#x27;t really know what you&#x27;re getting</li>
            <li>Really did shrink my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didnt really see much of a difference</li>
            <li>it really agitated my skin...and it isn&#x27;t eligible for return.  </li>
            <li>its really clumpy.</li>
            <li>- really deep-cleans my pores.</li>
            <li>Your face really does pulsate.</li>
            <li>this stuff helped so much with my breakouts.</li>
            <li>wherever you apply the mask because the pull is SO INTENSE as it hardens.</li>
            <li>I have very problem skin, pores, acne, oily..</li>
            <li>And after rinsing it this time, my skin felt much softer than before when using water.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gently towel dry.&lt;br /&gt;8.</li>
            <li>Follow the directions carefully and be sure you consult with your health professionals.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more in the near future thanks again.</li>
            <li>and it really works.  </li>
            <li>Its cheap and last me months too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ve only used it twice so far but my breakouts look tons better,  </li>
            <li>Not only does it mix better than water, its a natural antiseptic, analgesic, and reduces inflammation.</li>
            <li>you probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to handle it more than once or twice a month because it is irritating.  </li>
            <li>you probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to handle it more than once or twice a month because it is irritating.  </li>
            <li>, it was too harsh for my face, when I removed it with a warm towel it scarred my skin.</li>
            <li>Wen I washed it off, my skin didn&#x27;t redden, looked so super clean, and I went to feel my face while it was wet</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best kept secret for truly deep cleaning your skin even if you used once a month.</li>
            <li>However, I recently started using this mask regularly and I am thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>You do need to have a good face lotion to use with this, since it kinda sucks everything out of your face...</li>
            <li>Then the warm weather hit and my back acne came back.</li>
            <li>I mix a few tablespoons of clay with milk, water or rose water and plaster it</li>
            <li>After I took it off my face was clear, toned, smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Do not chip off dried pieces, remove with warm water (as the instructions say)</li>
            <li>When you go to wash it off, soak a wash cloth in warm water and place it on your face for a few minutes to loosen the mask.</li>
            <li>The aztec secret is the best clay facial I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I do apply a good amount of it and leave it on for at least 30-40 minutes.</li>
            <li>It seems like this will last months to a year or more depending on how frequently it&#x27;s used.</li>
            <li>This Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay Deep Pore Cleansing is awesome.</li>
            <li>The entire process was pretty cool.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has made my pores smaller, and my acne more manageable, but it hasn&#x27;t completely solved that issue.</li>
            <li>I have recently been trying to find a more natural and organic skin care routine.</li>
            <li>Use with water for more sensitive skin or apple cider vinegar for deep cleansing.  </li>
            <li>I guess I was secretly hoping for some magical effect, but I should have known better.</li>
            <li>Kind of messy though.</li>
            <li>Really love using this product as a facial mask so far.</li>
            <li>I am so in love with this product, especially since it is all natural.</li>
            <li>Definitely mix with natural vinegar; it works much better than water.</li>
            <li>Equal parts clay and ACV is a good starting point, but don&#x27;t be afraid to experiment with ratio to get a nice mousse-y consistency, and you really don&#x27;t need more than a teaspoon of clay</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and heard many recommendations online from this specific product.</li>
            <li>it makes your skin soft, smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>This surprised me as I was sure that it was the extra oxygented blood being pulled to the surface that aided in the healing process.</li>
            <li>trendy stuff that she swear the gimmicky stuff is doing somethng.</li>
            <li>After reading all the other reviews I feel confidant they are all true and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>ordered the 1 pound container, and I can honestly say, it will last me an entire year... if not more!&lt;br</li>
            <li>just as good a a thick one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why this clay does what it does, but it certainly made my hair react differently that it has to other hair products...and in a good way.</li>
            <li>Sure, everybody&#x27;s skin is different and I&#x27;m usually warry of most products because my skin is super sensitive</li>
            <li>With that said, I used only water for the first 3 times and still love the results: very clear and soft skin.</li>
            <li>I love this, I mix it with some other ingredients to give my skin more \\&quot;food\\&quot; and my skin feel baby soft after, the black head are all clean.</li>
            <li>At an average of $12 a tub, that&#x27;s less than $3 a month for the most effective skincare product I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>And this helped clear up my acne a lot!!!</li>
            <li>my face is clear !!!</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW!!!</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>Wish they sold this mixed and ready to use !!!</li>
            <li>The microdermabrasion REALLY improved my right cheek and forehead, and today it&#x27;s quite clear because of it.</li>
            <li>If your skin is drying out too much from it, just moisturize right after, it&#x27;ll leave your skin ridiculously soft.</li>
            <li>If your skin is drying out too much from it, just moisturize right after, it&#x27;ll leave your skin ridiculously soft.</li>
            <li>The first day it made my face super red..</li>
            <li>the first time i tried it i did get scared  because after washing it off my face got super red!</li>
            <li>You aren&#x27;t supposed to leave it on for too long either, it will completely dry up your skin, which isn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li>you can actually SEE it pulse if you look in the mirror - super intense!</li>
            <li>you really do feel the pulsating on your face that it claims and my skin is red for about 20 minutes but other than that nothing but good things from this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It calls for Apple cider vinegar, which is an irritant to the skin, but it also good for you in small doses!</li>
            <li>And it hurt taking this thing off, but it was that good hurt if ha know what I mean.</li>
            <li>These were to be seen on my entire face, but the most powerful effects were on the areas above the eye, you know, those puffy places beneath the eyebrows that begin to droop over your eyelids as you get older.  </li>
            <li>So far, I love this mask and it seems to be working for what I needed, which is to clean out my pours, make them appear smaller and help the overall appearance and texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>At first, I ignored the new pimples because I believe it&#x27;s the purging.</li>
            <li>After the first week of using the product (with ACV), I was observing new pimples on my face, but I persisted with the product anyways after falling for this &amp;#34;initial purging period&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>If you lie down on your clean bedding, or put on your clean clothes you will start the cycle all over again.  </li>
            <li>I let everything fall into the bowl and make sure you dump it outside and not down your drain.</li>
            <li>We mixed it raw apple cider vinegar and it made a nice smooth (and bubbly) paste.</li>
            <li>Use raw unfiltered organic apple cider vinegar and only add just enough to get it into paste form for best results.</li>
            <li>In one instance I used it two times within a week (2 days apart) and on the second time I noticed that I was able to easily remove the black heads on my nose.</li>
            <li>But in the shower last night, while washing my face, I wasn&#x27;t even thinking about having used the mask earlier, and noticed how smooth and clean my pores felt.</li>
            <li>Not much to add to all the other great reviews of this product.</li>
            <li>I have seen success stories on other posts, and for those people that&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>I also used the tip from other reviewers to splash some warm water when removing to soften the clay and use paper towels to wipe them away instead of rinsing directly into the sink.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, but only if you mix with an acidic liquid, in order to balance the ph, since the clay itself is highly alkaline and will destroy the skin if you use with water alone.</li>
            <li>for acne scarring it really doesn&#x27;t do much, in fact it may actually make them more apparent</li>
            <li>for acne scarring it really doesn&#x27;t do much, in fact it may actually make them more apparent</li>
            <li>its first use and my skin is very clear, blackheads is reduced and hope they will disappear at all.</li>
            <li>I really like it, especially for the price you can&#x27;t beat the clean feeling</li>
            <li>It likes to clump up and can easily get messy quick.</li>
            <li>I have acne and this really gives you the deep clean you need.</li>
            <li>It really pulls all impurities to the surface of your skin and allows for a very deep clean.</li>
            <li>it can either be extremely messy or quick and easy; that depends on you.</li>
            <li>The vinegar helps to clear up any bumps/acne since it offers a deeper clean.</li>
            <li>I get those huge, mountain sized pimples that usually take a week or more to completely surface</li>
            <li>This mask  hardens on your face like concrete!</li>
            <li>and I definitely noticed a SIGNIFICANT difference in how oily my face was throughout the day.</li>
            <li>i am not saying they are completely gone, because they are not but definitely smaller then they have been, I also have body acne and have used this on my tush ;) and have seen a huge improvement there as well.</li>
            <li>It has worked better than any other treatment/product he has used.  </li>
            <li>Another friend that has been using a bentonite clay for years told me there are many other uses, so I plan to be experimenting soon.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s normal and goes away!</li>
            <li>The Regimen from Acne.org, and many other acne products you can pick up at Walmart.</li>
            <li>The mask works better than any other mask I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>There are people that have claimed they notice their drains stay more clear(probably partly due to the acidity of the vinegar.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the second day I tried it, I steamed my face first for 7 minutes (something I&#x27;ve done now once a week for 20 years) to open up the pores, added more ACV and waited.</li>
            <li>I was really excited when my facial powder came in.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so excited to have finally found something that works!mething that works!</li>
            <li>Nothing changed in my face other than more hurting.</li>
            <li>Mixing was not a problem to me unlike many other reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li>Other products are better.</li>
            <li>(And it&#x27;s not just me, other people have commented how my skin has started looking better too,</li>
            <li>originally bought it for my daughter&#x27;s face and back blemishes.</li>
            <li>I would choose one of the other many pore cleansing options out there..  </li>
            <li>Next time, I put some in a pan on the stove and whisk until it&#x27;s smooth and steaming, then whisk until it&#x27;s cool enough to put on my face.  </li>
            <li>It is much better than any other clay product I have used.</li>
            <li>I tried to reused this, which albeit easier than kitty litter, and it is never quite the same as the original batch.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe that for $8 this thing did more to improve my face than what all the other products I have used put together.</li>
            <li>i noticed changes in my skin and also other people throughtout the college and co workers i love it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found many other products that work as well.</li>
            <li>i tried once more, thinking maybe it was just that one time, but once again my face was itching, it wasn&#x27;t a pulsating sensation it was an extreme itching.</li>
            <li>Really love that it doesn&#x27;t have all the additives that other clay masks have.</li>
            <li>First facial left skin a bit red...must have worked:)</li>
            <li>The only problem I have with this is that it dries out your skin significantly.</li>
            <li>This works better than other mud masks I have.</li>
            <li>I got a prescription for Differin gel (which didn&#x27;t work when I was younger, but over the counter treatments don&#x27;t work, so I figured it&#x27;s worth another shot!)</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of the blackheads on my nose like it has for other people, but i think it&#x27;s still a fantastic product!</li>
            <li>I am so excited that this product actually works.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve majorly scaled back to one latte a day and drink mostly water with lemon for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>I have never been so excited about a facial</li>
            <li>Is that normal?!</li>
            <li>The next morning, my child had significant clearing in their skin.  </li>
            <li>Excited to hear back from you.</li>
            <li>it according to the directions I didn&#x27;t find it any more gunky for the sink than any other clay mask that I have used; therefore, I do not see any reason to go through all of the acrobatics to remove the mask that others suggest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love its versatility and I can&#x27;t wait to try it with ACV and other mixes to see what it does</li>
            <li>While my pores are smaller, they aren&#x27;t completely unclogged, though it&#x27;s done an impressive job (especially compared to all the previous products I&#x27;ve tried).</li>
            <li>Even in my low humidity apartment in the middle of winter with the heater making static electricity out of everything, the 20 minute dry time is more like 1 hour and 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend toning with ACV and using an oil free moisturizer if you have similar skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin because I have Seborrheic dermatitis and have not found a product to clean my face without major irritation.  </li>
            <li>it was a mess to clean out of the bowl and it was a chore to wipe clean off my face.  </li>
            <li>After completing radiation therapy and waiting 8 weeks for the full treatment to run its course, I made a giant tub of the clay using vinegar and water until it was smooth and runny, mixed it into a warm bath, grabbed a big bottle of water and rested for as long as I could take it.</li>
            <li>It has limited my clothing choices and has made me insecure when it comes to exposing my back (which is a shame, as I am in great shape and it would be a good asset otherwise).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>The clay keeps your skin clear, and then putting the natural moisturizer on your skin (and using a little of the oil in the clay), has given both of us amazing skin, soft, smooth and</li>
            <li>This product, together with the raw apple vinegar is amazing on the skin.</li>
            <li>I think it works amazingly on my forehead because it is very tight skin.</li>
            <li>kind of like very tight and puffy.</li>
            <li>My hair, on day 7, still looks clean after I last washed it 24 hrs ago.</li>
            <li>In the past I have tried all kinds of washes and been to the dermatologist many times and never had much success.</li>
            <li>It gives your skin a deep clean and helps with anti-aging as well.</li>
            <li>next day, my face was smoother, softer and generally looked better.</li>
            <li>next day, my face was smoother, softer and generally looked better.</li>
            <li>as only clean skin does-as my hands passed over the surface.  </li>
            <li>In the first 7-10 days, my face felt cleaner but did experience a few more breakouts while the skin detoxed...</li>
            <li>I use this mask every couple of weeks, especially on my nose, to clean out and shrink the pores in my skin.  </li>
            <li>It does deep clean and my skin is thankful for it.  </li>
            <li>only reason this is getting 2 stars instead of 1 is because my skin does feel clean after I use it.</li>
            <li>but it left my hair clean without any build up in it.</li>
            <li>Next I will be using it as a face mask to clean out my pores.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After it dries I&#x27;ve been filling up my sink with water and using a wash cloth to clean off the clay, I then smearing the larger chunks around until they break up in to mush</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to deep clean my pores, and shrink pore size.</li>
            <li>make sure to not leave this on too long if you&#x27;ve got sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Not only did it clean my pores, but it brightened my skin...</li>
            <li>clean up is the only crappy part of all this</li>
            <li>and I felt like it helped me deep clean throughly.</li>
            <li>and you end up having to clean the sink or shower to get the &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; out since it is in big chunks.</li>
            <li>so it definitely helped clean and tighten my pores.</li>
            <li>The only mask that makes my skin feel clean.</li>
            <li>This is the only mask that leaves my skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li>The clean up with this is the only reason I cannot give 5 stars.</li>
            <li>and I use this once a week to deep clean.</li>
            <li>, my acne and blackheads looked the same, but my face felt and looked refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li>you can use this and actually tell your face is clean.</li>
            <li>I always wash things like masks or scrubs off my face in the shower instead of over the sink, so that I don&#x27;t have to worry about clean up later.  </li>
            <li>It gunked  up my sink and shower , so be prepared to have some extra time to clean your drains out after you use this.</li>
            <li>It also feels really clean which is what I want in a deep cleanser.</li>
            <li>Deep clean</li>
            <li>This product actually lives up to the the results, it causes the face to pulsate as it clean and tightens the skin.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin clear up pretty fast</li>
            <li>I clean the bowl I use to mix it in outside.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason I took one star off is that it doesn&#x27;t clean my white heads well.</li>
            <li>BUT needless to say this actually is a great product for people that don&#x27;t wear makeup, or for people that don&#x27;t have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Because my skin tends to be more on the sensitive side, I didn&#x27;t want to take any risk leaving in on for too long.  </li>
            <li>It super tightens your skin, and my pores are noticeably smaller (and I never had large pores, but after using this and noticing the difference it makes, I guess my pores were getting</li>
            <li>It pulls on my skin after a while, but like magic, the next day my skin is very soft and clear.  </li>
            <li>The mixing ratio is an estimate, so I ended up needing to play with a little more vinegar and then a little more clay to get the consistency right.  </li>
            <li>This is a real amazing product with high quality and small spending for facial clear product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my late 20s and had spent my life with occasional pimples but mostly very good skin (albeit fair, dry and very sensitive.)  </li>
            <li>I have tried other masks, but they don&#x27;t seem strong enough, and still left me feeling kind of oily.</li>
            <li>Well, of course it will come off, but make sure your face is down into the bowl, and you will need a washcloth to gently get it off.  </li>
            <li>Well, of course it will come off, but make sure your face is down into the bowl, and you will need a washcloth to gently get it off.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really is great but make sure you don&#x27;t over coat your face because once it dries it will take a lot of scrubbing with a wet rag in order to clean it off, other than that it really tightens up on your skin and makes it extremely soft for at least 12 hours after using it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;I am very much into natural organic health remedies.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little tricky to get the right ratio mixed (doesn&#x27;t seem that 1:1 is enough liquid), but it works great</li>
            <li>I have used other brands of healing clay before and love using it for deep cleaning, so when I was offered this Aztec Secret Indian healing clay I gladly accepted it at a promotional price in return for my my honest opinion&lt;</li>
            <li>&amp; kudos for being smart enough to read reviews first ;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this mask several times now, as well as on my boyfriend, but I haven&#x27;t seen anything special or any improvement.</li>
            <li>This clay mask has helped me a lot with my extra olily skin, specially if you use it with apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li>It does smell a little funky, but I definitely got a better texture and smooth feeling afterward on my face.</li>
            <li>my skin is a little sensitive, but it worked out great as a facial mask.</li>
            <li>But I think it makes a lot more if you use less than how much it recommends (1/4-1/2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This product feels great and after a few minutes it dry&#x27;s up and forms a mask.</li>
            <li>I tried a few products over the counter and quickly realized it was a huge mistake.</li>
            <li>I can see a real difference without anything on my face :)producing less oil.</li>
            <li>Let dry 10-15 min and remove with facial wipes (the pre-moistened kind).  </li>
            <li>Add some aloe vera juice for moisturize, leave on for a while but don&#x27;t let the clay dry, wash out with warm water then deep condition your hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for overall skin tightening but my black heads remain.</li>
            <li>Also to get this off, I have to use warm water and a wash cloth, and slightly soak the clay before it gets soft again.</li>
            <li>I have mild to moderate acne and combination skin, but I can&#x27;t really call this stuff a miracle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a dry powder, which was unexpected but made even better by mixing with apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li>It is easy to mix with the ACV and after I wash the mask off it makes my face feel tighter, my pores looks smaller, my skin feels soft.</li>
            <li>Yes, it will be red for a good half hour after you wash it off, but that is no reason to not try this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my skin tone is more evened out, no new breakouts, old acne drying up &amp;</li>
            <li>Tried using it to condition my hair, but I didn&#x27;t really see much difference, since I have very soft hair anyway.</li>
            <li>(like I thought there would be) and the huge pores I have around my nose area were actually diminished considerably!</li>
            <li>I moved a month ago, and the increase in humidity has made my otherwise pretty clear skin a wreck.</li>
            <li>This stuff if used consistently made my skin clear up, like if I was using it every 2 nights or so,</li>
            <li>Even my husband noticed how clear my face was the day after my first time using it.</li>
            <li>once its wet enough it ll slide off easily - Wipe it clean with the paper towel to avoid sink</li>
            <li>Messy..other products available that do just as well but don&#x27;t leave your towels grey.</li>
            <li>Within a couple of hours the color of each bite turned from bright red to a pink color, and the feeling of itchiness completely went away.  </li>
            <li>My face is red for about a half hour afterwards, but then my skin is so clean and smooth!</li>
            <li>I have blackheads and minor blemishes, instantly cleared up the blackheads and this morning my minor blemishes are greatly reduced.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because of all the fantastic reviews, but unfortunately I didn&#x27;t have such great results.</li>
            <li>Figured it would be ok as it says you can take mud baths with it, and I normally apply tick layers of other kinds to my skin.</li>
            <li>apparently that&#x27;s what makes this mask so powerful.</li>
            <li>Strongest facial I&#x27;ve ever experienced, good grief.</li>
            <li>The first thing that surprised me was when it said there was no chemicals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an African American female and this product is good for remove oil and clogged pores.</li>
            <li>But suddenly my acne returned in full force and I was devastated.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product and can tell it will last me a long, long time.</li>
            <li>Not sure why this product is do popular.</li>
            <li>My hair had never had the type of curl definition and soft texture it had after my first use.</li>
            <li>I first wash my face with an all natural soap and then i use this mask.</li>
            <li>I bought this clay to see if what I&#x27;ve read about clay masks actually was true.  </li>
            <li>out\\&quot; but last night proved it true.</li>
            <li>The first couple of batches I made were a bit chunky, but I used the smoother parts to apply to my sensitive, combination skin.</li>
            <li>I put it on him and his wrinkle on his forehead nearly completely vanished on the first day.</li>
            <li>I tried other drugstore brand moisturizers and anti-aging creams, and the Bel Essence gives me the best results that last - you don&#x27;t go back to your &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; picture even if you stop for a short time (as if I would).  </li>
            <li>Today I tried it for the first time with Apple cider vinegar and WOW.</li>
            <li>I use about 1/2 spoon full and I have enough for my face.</li>
            <li>My only drawback is that this is messy and kind of clumpy, but it&#x27;s worth it for the clearer skin.</li>
            <li>First off, this product has changed my skin completely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep it short and sweet since my review itself is a novel...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep it short and sweet since my review itself is a novel...</li>
            <li>Even with regular use of twice weekly, my face is still full of blackheads.</li>
            <li>I tried mixing it with water the first time in case my skin would be sensitive to it, and no improvement.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve decided to switch my routine to all natural products and for the first time in YEARS my skin is clearing up.</li>
            <li>winter break my skin decided to go all out - I became fed up and was not about to go back to school with my face full of acne and blackheads.</li>
            <li>Next I plan to try and make a more natural hair care routine, and then find natural alternatives for deodorant and toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Next I plan to try and make a more natural hair care routine, and then find natural alternatives for deodorant and toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Honestly, still not sure how I feel about this product.  </li>
            <li>My skin is pretty sensitive and Thai has been a struggle for years .</li>
            <li>It definitely helps clear up your skin but the consistency isn&#x27;t great which makes it really messy.  </li>
            <li>I do use essential oils after the mask and I do use full apple cider vinegar to mix the mask.</li>
            <li>i have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Caution, it is an intense mask and will leave your face red after using especially if you leave it on for more than 10-15 min.</li>
            <li>and my skin is also pretty sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Its not worth all that hassle for a face mask to me, and I love DIY facials.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling soft after the first use.</li>
            <li>It is TRUELY a mud facial in a jar!</li>
            <li>so I just got a small cotton towel and put warm water on it and rinsed it that way.</li>
            <li>Such a weird feeling, but I kind of liked the pulsating.</li>
            <li>It definitely felt tight, but it didn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely need to figure out a good way of mixing it tho.</li>
            <li>Your skin may feel uncomfortably tight as the clay dries (good luck making any sort of facial expression)</li>
            <li>It is a little hard to wash off but, the results and skin tightness is wonderful.</li>
            <li>You can literally feel your face pulsing (especially if you mix it with apple cider vinegar, but it&#x27;s best to mix half water and half ACV as it doesn&#x27;t tighten up as much as straight ACV does).  </li>
            <li>I read many of the reviews so I decided to mix my clay with raw Apple cider vinegar, first I placed three tablespoons</li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin and this mask has been fine for me when mixed with Apple cider.</li>
            <li>Make sure to follow the instructions, and do not wash down the drain.</li>
            <li>After one use I was able to squeeze out the pus and it went down to 1/3 its size.</li>
            <li>but you just have to remember to make sure none if it goes down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure you buy some sort of filter that will catch the chunks of clay in case you do decide to wash it down the drain.</li>
            <li>Sadly, it will not heal your acne or make you beautiful overnight, it may take TIME to get the results you want, and your expectations have to be REALISTIC.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions used Bragg&#x27;s Apple Cider Vineger and hit the bathroom, at first I got a bit of a tingle and was underwhelmed but quickly changed my mind as it began to dry.  </li>
            <li>My skin was a little red but nothing extreme, and after washing the rest of the mask off I put Vitamin E oil on my face and after 10 minutes my skin was glowing, rosy, and wonderful.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very self conscious about the acne and large pores.</li>
            <li>My skin was bright red and burned a little after removing this stuff.</li>
            <li>In full disclosure, my skin has gotten exponentially better since my teens, but I still break out regularly and have an oily unpredictable complexion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It definitely pulls out any oil you have in your skin, so if you have dry skin or combination skin, I am not sure if this would be the best for you.  </li>
            <li>Your face will be a little red afterwards, just put a good moisturizer on and relax.</li>
            <li>The skin feels tight and very smooth after removing the product.</li>
            <li>and my skin was very smooth and tight after removing the mask.</li>
            <li>Live this face mask!</li>
            <li>you will feel like a new person!</li>
            <li>Made my skin smoother and has stopped new acne from forming on my face!</li>
            <li>I had a new skin complexion!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel brand new!</li>
            <li>It takes everything off your face like you will feel like a brand new person!</li>
            <li>My new beauty staple!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this for anyone who is wanting to lighten some lesser acne scarring (full disclosure:</li>
            <li>When mixed with Apple Cider Vinegar it breaks down easily into a smooth paste.</li>
            <li>but it leaves your skin feeling dry but other then that its really good</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to not use the clay for a couple days then just put a fair amount of water so it doesn&#x27;t dry up due to</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every over the counter treatment there is, and I&#x27;ve balked at trying Proactiv or any other really strong product because I don&#x27;t really want to put that on my face.</li>
            <li>(maybe excessive, but I&#x27;ve only seen positive changes, one must experiment) for about two weeks, always followed by a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>(maybe excessive, but I&#x27;ve only seen positive changes, one must experiment) for about two weeks, always followed by a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This clay squeezes out all of the old sewage built up in my deep pores and minimizes those little pot holes, making my skin feel smooth with a nice soft glow.  </li>
            <li>I mean, clothes only look as good as the skin that wears them right?</li>
            <li>omg, it was a whole new product.</li>
            <li>and I have not had any new breakouts, my skin also looks very radiant and glowing</li>
            <li>I was only able to prevent wasting most of it in lumps by using a super tiny whisk and mixing it in a cut-down paper cup, adding a very small amount at a time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll be smooth, clump-free, and although it smells faintly of apple cider, it&#x27;ll feel amazing.</li>
            <li>I got two HUGE soft cyst like pimples one on each temple and the are still there over a week later</li>
            <li>Face felt fine after first use with a slight burn from the moisturizer applied afterward.</li>
            <li>If you are like me and dry out using clay, put a capful of olive oil in with it as well...makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I know, it sounds odd to have to rub that onto your face, but trust me, your skin will love you for it.</li>
            <li>Less is more.</li>
            <li>You might need to use it more or less often.</li>
            <li>I always mix it with apple cider vinegar to a clump free, whipped texture and leave it on until it is all the way dry.  </li>
            <li>Whereas the water mixture was harder to mix, came out clumpy, latched on to my skin and could not be removed as easily.  </li>
            <li>Pores were small and clean and complexion was fresh looking (reddish at first) but it works well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have many black heads</li>
            <li>My pores do look much more refined and blackheads are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Smooth and in the morning my face didn&#x27;t feel dry like it does in the mornings.</li>
            <li>In my case I suffer from black heads more than pimples.</li>
            <li>I am truly satisfied with this product I don&#x27;t understand how any one could give less than 5 stars</li>
            <li>Immediately after I took off the mask, I noticed the black heads on my nose were better.</li>
            <li>Got most of the black heads</li>
            <li>Love it so odd</li>
            <li>and I got much better results with less sit time.</li>
            <li>Less is more with this mask.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten a few friends to try it and they love it as much as I do</li>
            <li>Second, DO NOT USE ON YOUR ENTIRE FACE more than once a week.</li>
            <li>I have always used face masks since my teenage years, mostly to combat acne as it occasionally flared.</li>
            <li>If you make a decent quantity, its easier.&lt;br /&gt;--Read the directions and follow the directions on usage.</li>
            <li>If you make a decent quantity, its easier.   </li>
            <li>My skin gets shiny by the end of the day, but it normally stays pretty clear.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more in the future when I run out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My last trip to the dermatologist resulted in her telling me I&#x27;m lucky for oily skin...</li>
            <li>I am an older woman and have been having all kinds of problems with my face breaking out.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s the best thing you can do for your face without having to suffer expensive medical costs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used better ones from Deep Sea Minerals from Australia and it came pre mixed.</li>
            <li>I particularly like it in my hair.</li>
            <li>I was having problems with clogged pores and was considering going to get a facial at a local spa for more than $100.  </li>
            <li>It felt nice and dried completely after about 25 minutes.  </li>
            <li>The only thing you need to be careful about is not letting it clog up your sink when you rinse it off, I just use a warm washcloth and rub it off chunk by chunk.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve given it several honest tries, and every time I do</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t think it really did anything besides clean my face and make it dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I gave this simple mask mix a second chance.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t totally eradicate her problem since it was cystic (and that requires more than a simple mask)</li>
            <li>I had some mild cystic acne on my left cheek,</li>
            <li>My advice to anyone reading this review is to have plenty of disposable paper towels on hand, because it is better that it ends up taking you ten minutes pulling it off your face with a bunch of paper towels, and then rinsing the last portions off in the shower, than to try to wash it</li>
            <li>I wet several washcloths in warm water and apply to my face to soften the mask.</li>
            <li>And, yeah, I have the classic &#x27;</li>
            <li>I used it to pull impurities out of the skin on my arms, and it left my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>You will not believe how soft and smooth your skin is after this facial/cream, and your pores are immediately smaller.  </li>
            <li>was super red.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We are definitely looking forward to trying it again and will keep an eye on the &#x27;benefits&#x27; of doing it over a period of time and report back if anything is out of the ordinary.h my face felt more smoother, even-toned and even firmer.  </li>
            <li>After it&#x27;s off, my face is super red since all the blood was being sucked to the surface</li>
            <li>If you mix this with apple cider vinegar it leaves your skin looking vibrant and feeling soft/smooth.</li>
            <li>Cheap, natural and with instant results.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels vibrant afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>It left my skin smooth and soft after just one application.</li>
            <li>I risked it and gave it a try wondering if it would cause more breakouts, but it has only improved my skin and become part of my regimen.how deep they are.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not 100% sure it actually was a deep pore cleansing mask</li>
            <li>week later  and face is still  soft and smooth as a  baby&#x27;s bottom.  </li>
            <li>The ancient Indian seceret helps cleanse pores to the core it helps seal them up not all the way since I have big pores but it definitely helps out I love it</li>
            <li>my first try was last week it felt stinging at first</li>
            <li>I definitely can&#x27;t use as a facial more than twice a week, but I don&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li>Luckily after another 3 months, my face finally recovered.</li>
            <li>My pores are smaller, my face is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin and the next day is like a breath of fresh air for my pores.</li>
            <li>I tried tons of different methods and this is the most efficient way I have personally found works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive and yet it does more than more expensive masks.</li>
            <li>If you buy the nose strips, you should switch to this because it works better and this giant jug will probably last for longer than a year.</li>
            <li>I like that a company has conned me to purchasing mud for a decent amount of money.</li>
            <li>I have used so many of the more expensive products out there and</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and forms a solid mask.</li>
            <li>You just have to find out what your particular skin type needs.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly in the summer as a facial mask mixed with the apple cider vinegar when I think that my pores need some tightening after all the heat they endured.</li>
            <li>Definitely contains enough clay for more masks than the packaging claims.  </li>
            <li>Add a few drops of tea tree oil and coconut water and you have the perfect hydrating mask that sucks out all the nasties.</li>
            <li>I mainly purchased this for my enlarged pores--they&#x27;re not craters</li>
            <li>All my life I&#x27;ve had decent skin.</li>
            <li>The older I get</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m older &amp; have sensative skin.</li>
            <li>The next day, more white heads started to surface around my jawline.  </li>
            <li>(I left it on for like 20 minutes the most recent time).</li>
            <li>I think it really does work by pulling impurities to the surface so after 2 or 3 times you&#x27;ll really start to notice how clear your skin is.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t tried it as an face mask yet and that will be my next step as I have mild acne and combination skin with that oily &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; zone.</li>
            <li>I have mild acne and big pores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the apple vinegar is totally an acting agent with helping but out of every mask and acne product I have ever used, this is the only thing that has ever shown the fastest results and gotten rid of those mountainous zits in a speedier manner.</li>
            <li>My pores are smaller and my face is clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>; Still, fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked really well, and while my face was indeed red for about 30 min, that went away and someone actually said I looked tan later in the evening, which is a welcome compliment in the middle of the winter when in reality I was pasty white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different topical products.</li>
            <li>It does burn/tingle a teeny tiny bit so make sure you dont have any open sores.</li>
            <li>I mainly wanted this for my pimples and on times of the month when I break out with cystic acne bumps.</li>
            <li>and I have mild acne, especially on my cheeks and forehead.</li>
            <li>felt refreshed and soft and smooth, and my pores were visibly smaller.</li>
            <li>I started out using a regular kitchen bowl and spoon when mixing it, but was having a lot of trouble getting a good consistency</li>
            <li>I washed it off with warm water and my face was not red at all, it was pink in some areas from me scrubbing to take the clay off.</li>
            <li>You skin gets oily throughout the day and if someone touches your face you will most likely get a zit there the next day.</li>
            <li>I have acne-prone and super oily Asian skin.</li>
            <li>I definitely would use apple cider vinegar instead of water, because its super lumpy when you use water.</li>
            <li>This product dries quickly so you have to rinse well and deep condition.</li>
            <li>I am still very hopeful as its only been a week since I started using, but just for the softness alone its worth it.</li>
            <li>Decent product.</li>
            <li>i mixed it with equal parts of water and ACV and it worked magically.</li>
            <li>My pores are slowly releasing blackheads constantly which is great, but it does make my skin a bit greasier than it used to be now that all the grossness is coming out of my pores.</li>
            <li>I do not know how well it works for that particular issue.  </li>
            <li>mainly cause of the hassle of using this.</li>
            <li>My face was red afterward (as they say it will be), but that redness went away rather quickly.</li>
            <li>tried it several times just to be sure and am only writing this a month after being off of the stuff and realizing it caused a lot of my skin troubles.</li>
            <li>thing is the main reason my skin is clearing up.</li>
            <li>I have had mild acne on my face since middle school (I&#x27;m 24 now)</li>
            <li>I also woke up the next day with my eyelids swollen, which was super</li>
            <li>I use it as the main ingredient in my homemade face masks.</li>
            <li>Seriously I am never using another mask ever again.</li>
            <li>Very easy to mix, I use a 1 cup glass sugar spoon and a wooded butter knife to stir this product with Bragg&#x27;s Raw vinegar.</li>
            <li>I recommend trying it mixed with apple cider vinegar first, and if that&#x27;s too much you can certainly use water.</li>
            <li>It does dry my out a little more than others do, but in regards to my pores or acne, it works just fine.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant as I do have pretty sensitive skin, but I am so glad that I purchased this.</li>
            <li>I can so notice a significant difference with consistent use: less breakouts, and any breakouts that do occur are much smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This feels pretty good on my skin, didn&#x27;t make me break out like a lot of other products do and it also seems to reduce black heads.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found that using this clay every other day to start with is very good, if a bit hard on the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Enjoy your day and think positively in the pursuit of clear skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Enjoy your day and think positively in the pursuit of clear skin.</li>
            <li>really useful and make my face clean and tight.</li>
            <li>Really does clear out your pores!</li>
            <li>After using it twice in a row I broke out pretty bad, but its my own  fault because this is meant more for a weekly use anyway.</li>
            <li>This really helps to clear up my skin alot!</li>
            <li>Used this about 2-3 times a week and it has really help clear up my skin!</li>
            <li>I was worried, but then later while it was still drying, it felt like it was giving a relaxation tingle like a mini facial massage, and ,first it felt like bunch of vacuums were sucking out each pore one by one, and it was bizarre.</li>
            <li>But this cheap looking miracle is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that has actually worked CONSTANTLY.</li>
            <li>(I used olive and had soft gorgeous skin afterward, but too much oil is no good for me.)&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li>(I have very old drains/pipes!).</li>
            <li>Works really well for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I just tried this product last night for the first time and it was much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I do love the cool pulsing sensation you get as it starts to dry...makes me feel like its sucking out the impurities in my skin, but after a few weeks of use, I was hoping some specific skin issues I was having would have been cleared up, but they were not.  </li>
            <li>As our skin surface is weakly acid, I think using vinegar to neutralize is good.</li>
            <li>I noticed this really matters when your applying this product because it can cause an opposite effect if you don&#x27;t use it the right way.</li>
            <li>Immediately after rinsing my face is a little red, but it fades quickly into a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>It comes off pretty easily and isn&#x27;t messy, unless you make a wave pool with the water and</li>
            <li>Its pretty powerful and could dry out your skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tingly and tight and it just feels satisfying.</li>
            <li>Your face gets incredibly tight, more than you&#x27;ve ever felt before, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li>It sure gets the gunk out and makes your pores look really tight.</li>
            <li>Talk about a tight fit!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mild astringent that doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like many other astringents</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different skin care products, and I have found very few that make a huge difference on my skin, and this is one of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend trying it.</li>

            <li>Highly recommend anyone try this out.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I had high expectation for this products.</li>
            <li>I bought this item because of the high reviews.  </li>
            <li>My pimples have decreased by a tremendous amount and leaves my skin feeling clean, smooth, and clear.</li>
            <li>It did make my skin a little red right afterwards (try touching the skin with an ice cube gently) but the color faded after 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I am a real person who has VERY sensitive acne prone skin; I am female, 40, have oily skin and large pores.  </li>
            <li>WOW, This stuff is amazing, and one jar will last a very long time.</li>
            <li>it never fails to make a huge mess all over the bathroom counter</li>
            <li>and it was both aromatic and great for the skin and left my face much less red than just using the clay &amp; vinegar without the EO.</li>
            <li>I also have some uneven texture due to acne scars, and this seems to soften it a great bit.</li>
            <li>Do your own google searches and you will be amazed at the significant weight loss people have been experiencing, cures it has provided for things deemed &#x27;incurable&#x27;, etc.</li>
            <li>but this mask has worked wonders to clear what many other products couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>After a long day of work I&#x27;ll come home and take a hot shower, my face is usually pretty hot and red from work, but a hot shower helps me relax a bit.</li>
            <li>thing I would add is that I was really surprised at the POWERFUL tightening effects of the mask as it dried, so strong</li>
            <li>thing I would add is that I was really surprised at the POWERFUL tightening effects of the mask as it dried, so strong</li>
            <li>I have an oily face, and after using this it has minimized the oil, and leaves my skin very vibrant and soft.  </li>
            <li>but I found re-wetting my face with just water and using a wet wash cloth worked fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay is so pure, safe and effective that it can replace every other mask you&#x27;ve ever used, no matter what the price.</li>
            <li>I have a problem with large pores, old acne scars, and blackheads.</li>
            <li>Some products overpass the test of time because they are pure and natural.</li>
            <li>Yes, these are all oils, but pure, organic, unrefined natural oils that do wonders for the skin.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, do a test patch before applying it to a large area.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s working, but I may look in to using a large Tupperware container of bowl to avoid any clogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I a 42, with combo skin, large pores in the t-zone that are a struggle to keep clear.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it twice, the first time I put too much, trust me less is more.</li>
            <li>I went and had a facial after the wedding, about 3 months later (using it 1x a week to maintain) and the girl doing my facial was blown away at how good my skin looked, literally no black heads to extract except that part just under your nose where you cant put the mask (hello vinegar).</li>
            <li>have also started putting it on the top of my hands for dark spots and see results already!  </li>
            <li>usually leave the mask on for 30-45 minutes, which is a bit longer than what the packaging recommends, but my skin is, like I said, extremely oily, way more oily than most people who complain of oily skin, so my circumstances call for &#x27;stronger&#x27; skin care measures, if you will.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so surprised I&#x27;ve never heard of it before and that it was so affordable!!</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>:)lved, then ran the tap a little longer to ensure no clay chunks were latching themselves in my s-pipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>like an inactive zit) that needed to &amp;#34;purge.&amp;#34; There&#x27;s a difference between your skin getting rid of these little comedones and having a reaction to a product, so make sure you watch and know which one it</li>
            <li>just make sure you have a little scooper, and bowl to mix.</li>
            <li>So far I like it, my face was pulsing!!</li>
            <li>but wow! Must have !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little too soon to tell, but I love the pulsing effect this gives off</li>
            <li>My skin looks a little better and feels a little better already.  </li>
            <li>I ended up putting a little bit more water anyways.</li>
            <li>Tried again and was a little better.</li>
            <li>I did feel the tingles and a little itchy, not pulsate for sure</li>
            <li>note I have been trying proactiv, and that stuff has not been helping on my face, if you have been using it more than 30 days and your face has not been healing  just a little bit,</li>
            <li>I noticed the size my pore smaller the first time I used it!</li>
            <li>and if i do its just a couple at most little zits.</li>
            <li>I also still have the little pimple thingy on my forehead but a bit better than before.</li>
            <li>I found the mixing portions to be a little off and ended up adding more water than suggested.</li>
            <li>After rinsing my face is glowing the next day and looks so clean and clear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with acne and decent sized pores and uneven skin tone for most of my life.</li>
            <li>It is a bit messy to clean up but worth it.</li>
            <li>Every mask that sephora offers to deep clean the pores, has clay in it.</li>
            <li>You start to feel it dry fairly quick, but after about 10 minutes, your whole face feels pulsating.</li>
            <li>and you will have super tight, clean, clear skin.</li>
            <li>was by far the most intense mask I&#x27;ve ever had, in terms of how tight my face got.</li>
            <li>This mask works better than other much more expensive ones and you get a huge amount that will take years to go through.</li>
            <li>My acne did get worse after the first few days, but it&#x27;s getting progressively better and better!</li>
            <li>This product would have been amazing if it wasnt so hard to get off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of hard to remove when you&#x27;re finished.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of hard to mix together.</li>
            <li>It was kind of hard to wash off</li>
            <li>Afterwards, you can put a few drops of pure lavender essential oil on a warm damp washcloth and use as a compress.</li>
            <li>face was nice and smooth and it seemed to clear some of the previously noticeable black heads around my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Preparation and cleanup is a little messy, and the smell isn&#x27;t great, but this product is very clarifying and purifies your skin.</li>
            <li>Normally I wake up with a nice layer of grease on my face, but there was hardly any grossness to my face that morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s very hard for companies to sell me onto something new if I&#x27;ve found something I&#x27;ve really loved.</li>
            <li>She couldn&#x27;t believe it either, but that zit not only went almost completely away after she washed it off, but her skin looked so great after that she used hardly any foundation</li>
            <li>It does get super tight on your face but that&#x27;s the fun in it for my daughter and myself.</li>
            <li>No pimples, nice tight pores, not oily and not dry..</li>
            <li>You can take plain (NOT flavored/sugared pouches) oatmeal and run it through your food processor until pretty fine.  </li>
            <li>You can take plain (NOT flavored/sugared pouches) oatmeal and run it through your food processor until pretty fine.  </li>
            <li>Meaning that it doesn’t smell wonderful like a perfume, but the smell isn’t bad and take away from the awesomeness of this product.</li>
            <li>I really think if your skin is sensitive like mine</li>
            <li>I really think if your skin is sensitive like mine</li>
            <li>It is a really weird feeling, but you know it is working great.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive oily acne prone skin I have tried absolutely everything for my acne</li>
            <li>As far as acne goes, I don&#x27;t think this product does a whole lot</li>
            <li>Just a warning though, it can be like concrete when it dries, so</li>
            <li>, I have sensitive and very oily skin(face) and to my surprise</li>
            <li>, I just wet my hands and slowly using circular motions re-moisten the clay all the while rubbing gently and greatly reducing the clog factor as the slower method</li>
            <li>After reading all the hype about this mask all over the web, I had to try it, so I ran out to Whole Foods early in the morning to get my hands on a tub of this stuff.</li>
            <li>I ended up using it on my body, as it really does make your skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>PocketDerm is all I really rely on now to keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li>It really makes my face soft and reduces the pores.</li>
            <li>gonna lay it on the line about the whole acne thing, I&#x27;m 30 yrs old</li>
            <li>This clay really helps define the natural curl pattern of my hair and cleanses my hair as well.</li>
            <li>I use it in combination alternating between this and a moisturizing mask because it can be very drying to your skin if used too frequently.</li>
            <li>did use this with several different liquids, and I can say that all are amazing, and after 3 months of 1-3 times/week use, my complexion is noticeably clearer and my pores are smaller.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s all too much ,just to clear your pores.  </li>
            <li>Sorry, I had hoped I found a great pore cleanser, but I would not recommend this product to others...</li>
            <li>If you wait until the mask is fully dry, the mask wil cleanly peel off with the gauze.  </li>
            <li>I have adult acne and this has really helped when all kinds of prescription meds did nothing.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it too often, because my skin feels squeaky clean and dry afterwards...</li>
            <li>I has really helped to clear up my skin and made by skin glow.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really help as far as my acne goes.</li>
            <li>Real classy like.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then peel, wipe wash, clean, dry, moisturize, repeat?</li>
            <li>Then peel, wipe wash, clean, dry, moisturize, repeat?</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling absolutely baby soft.</li>
            <li>I have acne prone, extremely sensitive skin and really like it.  </li>
            <li>Made my skin soft, but didn&#x27;t really see an improvement for my acne</li>
            <li>It really made my face red and kind dried it out.</li>
            <li>I really like that it’s a natural product and can help me limit the chemicals that I use to fight the signs of aging.</li>
            <li>My blemishes clear up much quicker compared to when I do not use it.</li>
            <li>I may grade upward after a few more times but will not use this product more often than a few times a month.</li>
            <li>and you can really feel the natural mud cleansing all of the impurities from your skin.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised it came fast in the mail.</li>
            <li>Sure I look like a green monster every time I use it, but wow this stuff really works.</li>
            <li>But i really have seen a difference in my skin tone and it leaves my skin feeling so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>It works really well and has helped clear my son&#x27;s skin.  </li>
            <li>Really gets toxins out of skin, I notice my skin is clear and firmer</li>
            <li>I really wanted this help clear my pores</li>
            <li>I have been FIGHTING with my skin so much as a 27 year old woman.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel happy afterwards either, because it was difficult to rinse it</li>
            <li>The product works great, but it&#x27;s difficult to remove and keep from clogging the drain...</li>
            <li>but this was too much for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My hair is baby soft and retains so much moisture after washing with the clay.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily, sensitive, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>It sets up like concrete and it may clog your pipes.  </li>
            <li>The pull is so intense when it hardens completely.</li>
            <li>This is all normal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s waaaay too harsh to use more than once a week.</li>
            <li>but that is said in the instructions that it&#x27;s a normal result.</li>
            <li>but that is said in the instructions that it&#x27;s a normal result.</li>
            <li>I tried to get most of the dried on mask in the trash so it wouldn&#x27;t clog my drain</li>
            <li>I will update in a few weeks to see if I notice any magical results.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff kinda messy but</li>
            <li>but i sure had the sweating, tingling and a bit of tightening as the mask dried up which makes sense to</li>
            <li>, i pretty much believe this product is similar to it and hence is doing its work.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The shedding has lessened in just a few weeks and my curls are more defined.</li>
            <li>and I felt like my skin was greasier than normal,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally use either, and it was probably just my skin flaring up from the introduction of unfamiliar chemicals.</li>
            <li>when I finally went to wash it off my face, I had to laugh because it made my nose look like &#x27;Miss Piggy&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I washed the mask off my face and followed my normal face cleansing routine.</li>
            <li>but it is not my favorite since it is a bit messy.</li>
            <li>will give it a month and a few more masks and see how I feel about it.</li>
            <li>I normally just dampen it with some water again</li>
            <li>mixed it w/Braggs ACV rinsed after about 15 min and reapplied to freshly opened pores.</li>
            <li>I mixed up WAY too much the first time I used it</li>
            <li>My skin has a normal amount of sensitivity.</li>
            <li>But what I did is I made it into a cream, which saves you more clay powder and makes the product last REALLY long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfectly normal as the bacteria is flushing from your skin.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know that is normal reaction or</li>
            <li>I have read that&#x27;s normal for your skin to breakout</li>
            <li>I then rub it off with hot water and a wash cloth and after I use bare minerals moisturizer.</li>
            <li>&quot; daily (juice fresh carrots, parsley, apples, ginger root, lemons, and celery)So, combined with the clay regimen</li>
            <li>Well worth the money, will buy the 2 pound next time.</li>
            <li>The tiny pimples are pretty much everywhere on my face.</li>
            <li>I will use this a few more times &amp; update after.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to everyone with problem or even normal skin.</li>
            <li>I plan on applying it on again in a few more days after the redness goes away.</li>
            <li>I waited a few weeks before writing this review to make sure it continued to work.  </li>
            <li>and then a normal application in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it dried it out even more.</li>
            <li>I just know I&#x27;m not going to a club with green armpits in a sleeveless top.</li>
            <li>but once I got past that second week my skin started looking really good and clearing up</li>
            <li>normal cause</li>
            <li>It really makes your face pulse when it is on and the FIRST time I actually saw the blackhead come out of my cheek.</li>
            <li>Acne is normal, it&#x27;s everywhere.</li>
            <li>This is such an exciting product.</li>
            <li>This is such an exciting product.</li>
            <li>My skin is typically normal with no break-outs.</li>
            <li>and I just wash my face with the normal cleanser at night, witch hazel toner in the morning and use the mask twice a week.  </li>
            <li>I will warn you that this mask is powerful, it definitely tightens and pulsates.</li>
            <li>Too messy an application for me to love.</li>
            <li>The first week I only used water and it didn&#x27;t mix well very clumpy</li>
            <li>This thing took everything out and made my pores look normal and</li>
            <li>This size tub is lasting me for ever, it&#x27;s worth every penny</li>
            <li>which is completely normal -</li>
            <li>This has hindered me from wearing swim suits, backless dresses, cute tank tops, etc.</li>
            <li>I will indeed finish the rest of this mask until it expires because I don&#x27;t want my money to go to waste however, anyone who is thinking of buying this you would be better off doing a DIY mask.</li>
            <li>I mixed it with apple cider vinegar and this stuff reallly tightened up, I could barely smile.</li>
            <li>Totally normal.  </li>
            <li>but I read that that&#x27;s normal</li>
            <li>I love this mask, not to harsh.</li>
            <li>Only been using it for a few days, and so far so good.</li>
            <li>And if I stop use and just use my normal soap, my face clears.</li>
            <li>But as it dried more, I feel it sucking my face, and I sat there laughing inside</li>
            <li>Sucks everything out and leaves your skin nice and silky.</li>
            <li>I think with another few treatments I&#x27;ll probably see even better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll do it a few more times and then do a follow-up review if I have anything else to add.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin and have never had problems with pimples, except for the one or two popping up before my period.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;pulsating\\&quot; sensation can be a bit irritating, but once you wash off the mask and feel how smooth &amp; soft your skin is and see how youthful &amp; radiant it looks, you know that sensation is the mask working its magic.</li>
            <li>but it is actually a lot of fun to me.</li>
            <li>but it is actually a lot of fun to me.</li>
            <li>but well worth the extra effort</li>
            <li>Just make sure you have a heavy duty moisturizer to use after.</li>
            <li>where I normally breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally believe all the reviews but</li>
            <li>Purchased for a friend who has not complained about it.</li>
            <li>This is normal but plan accordingly if you&#x27;re going out after.</li>
            <li>Once the mask had fully dried and gotten all crackled like it does, I was able to peel a few flakes off and see even more blackheads on the underside of the mask flake.</li>
            <li>Is that normal?</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>I am an African American, 21 year old woman with more acne scars than acne</li>
            <li>always laugh when I read the back of the bottle, though: &amp;</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s on, you will feel your face &amp;#34;pulse.&amp;#34; Don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much creating an electric current when it&#x27;s introduced to liquid.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll have to try it a few more times to see if it lives up to the hype of improving your complexion (some review claim a drastic difference after just 3 uses).</li>
            <li>its normal.</li>
            <li>i like to take long showers so after 10 more min there is almost no mud left in the shower.</li>
            <li>No wonder so many people reported that their skin really dried out with this.</li>
            <li>(this is longer then normal, but the longer I want, the softer my skin is afterwards).  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know if it was normal or not.</li>
            <li>, I leave it on until it fully dries which is normally 45+</li>
            <li>I mixed way too much to do my face the first time.</li>
            <li>My skin type has gone from oily, to dry/peely (when I tried using benzoyl peroxide), but it&#x27;s fairly normal now.</li>
            <li>Pretty thick clay.. will bring all impurities out, as it did for me, almost through my retinol away, but then I thought NO WAY, to many uses with retinol.</li>
            <li>but that is normal for a clay mask</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a rare breed of mutt, a lot of my heritage is African</li>
            <li>I use it once a week in place of my normal cleanser.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a woman of color with normal skin if this helps anyone</li>
            <li>This is the only one worth it.</li>
            <li>But after reading that this is normal, I kept using it.</li>
            <li>Maybe a few times more should have effect.</li>
            <li>Still worth a try though, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Aztec Secret is a really good product.</li>
            <li>I mix mine with apple cider vinegar (since it also has its own cleansing properties) and it gives the clay the texture of a thick mousse and easier to work with than if you just use water.</li>
            <li>A slow but effective ninja.</li>
            <li>A slow but effective ninja.</li>
            <li>Good results, not great.</li>
            <li>nothing Secret here, buy a good scrub instead.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strange feeling, but not a bad one.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling very clean and tight.</li>
            <li>so now I use it a little less.... but still think it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>Really tightens pores and makes your face or other areas feel clean and tightened.  </li>
            <li>far, I&#x27;ve seen my face feeling tighter, less acne, smaller pores, and just overall feeling great.</li>
            <li>I have also started taking it internally and feel more mental clarity and more hours in the day of energy, less need for sleep.</li>
            <li>Also it left my arms, definitely the next day, super smooth.</li>
            <li>I thought they looked smaller after the first use, but it was so slight that I wasn&#x27;t completely sure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard to take off</li>
            <li>I used it on myself and several other people , who all have different skin types,-oily, sensitive, aged skin, and the results were great!</li>
            <li>I had so many black heads on my nose and look !</li>
            <li>I loved it so much, i made the mistake of using it too often and got a small dry patch.</li>
            <li>Was weird at first and is weird when it is all bubbly and even more when it dries (feels like your face is tighter than everrrrrrrr) but it worked great and my face was SO clean and SO clear.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, highly reactive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin was a little red, but felt clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>13 minutes have passed and there was no irritation or allergic reaction and it left my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to escape acne as a teenager, but now that I am in my early 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li>only time I ever had clear skin was when i was pregnant...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m always wishing it was super clear especially since I&#x27;m not longer in my teens.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive and reactive skin, with eczema especially on my hands.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and strongly recommend though it&#x27;s not for the faint of heart.</li>
            <li>IF you have dry skin do NOT keep it on for more than ten minutes.</li>
            <li>This clay mixed with apple cider vinegar gives an extra kick and foams up for an easy, mousse-like application.</li>
            <li>for me personally it made my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>I recently turned 21, but for nearly 2 years I have struggled with mild acne.</li>
            <li>I mix equal parts clay and vinegar and leave it on until most of it is dry.</li>
            <li>This will probably be hit or miss with a lot of people just because it can be super irritating to your skin, but for under $10, I don&#x27;t think it would break the bank for most people.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend applying an oil-free acne moisturizer after washing off the mask and not following washing off the mask with washing with any strong acne cleanser (clearisil, proactiv, etc.)</li>
            <li>I suffer from mild breakouts but what was even more frustrating for me</li>
            <li>Part apple cider vinegar and part clay is all it takes for amazing skin, unbelievable!</li>
            <li>my pores would probably return to their original size but at least I have found something that gives me noticable results that last for more than one day at a time.  </li>
            <li>my pores would probably return to their original size but at least I have found something that gives me noticable results that last for more than one day at a time.  </li>
            <li>I was immediately turned off by the fact that when I opened the jar this product did not come with a protective cover that cosmetic items normally have when they are brand new.</li>
            <li>2 tsp Plain yogurt - More moisture needed</li>
            <li>Receive the product promptly and use it right after the same day received at that night.</li>
            <li>Right around the time when you think you regular cleanser isn&#x27;t working for you any longer</li>
            <li>The only thing is trying to find a right balance between powder and water</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect totally miraculous results right away.</li>
            <li>But I can&#x27;t complain because the price is right in my area when it comes to facial products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s chunky and gross and it doesn&#x27;t go on your skin right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a trial and error to get the process right</li>
            <li>Right now, my face is continuously at a Moderate level 2.</li>
            <li>After I stopped the microdermabrasion sessions, again my breakouts started coming back (even on the right side and forehead).</li>
            <li>I had an extraction facial right after i used this mask</li>
            <li>I had a deep cystic blemish from using Oil of Olay, and the mask brought it right to the surface.</li>
            <li>I just rinse right away when it burns, doesn&#x27;t leave a mark, nor lasting pain.</li>
            <li>I believe it works better than the plain water.</li>
            <li>The second time I used it was right when the spots started showing up.</li>
            <li>very good aztec secret indian !!</li>
            <li>Make sure to get the raw apple cider vinegar to go with it, makes a big difference and its worth it as well.</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin and acne, use Sweet Almond Oil, or Avocado Oil, to mix it...and just leave it on for the 10 minutes, no longer.  </li>
            <li>is becoming less oily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not easy to wash off and that takes more time.</li>
            <li>It was SUPER itchy on me, and I wore it as long as I could stand it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>nice but big mess after</li>
            <li>This particular brand seems to be a bit more harsh, and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It adds a cool, tingly, freshening sensation while I&#x27;m waiting for the mask to dry.</li>
            <li>Ok so I tried this and at first I was a little taken back by the smell of it and sizzle noise when I added the vinegar</li>
            <li>It feels amazing on my skin and when washed off, my skin feels tight and refreshed and my pores are smaller.  </li>
            <li>After that I have huge pimples from eating too much junk, so I reluctantly use this product once every week without complaining how stink and tight it is.</li>
            <li>the clay is very messy and has a drying effect, I would suggest using a glove to apply, it works best with a tight medical glove.</li>
            <li>the clay is very messy and has a drying effect, I would suggest using a glove to apply, it works best with a tight medical glove.</li>
            <li>I found the product to be very hard to use, you need to create the clay yourself, i bought it because the reviews were great, but i do not like the entire process.</li>
            <li>When my face had dried completely, I applied a few drops of Kiehls Midnight Recovery Concentrate and when I woke up the next day, my complexion was absolutely flawless and glowing!</li>
            <li>I have very large pores and can pick at them daily.</li>
            <li>This seems like a fine simple American product.</li>
            <li>Rinse off (in a basin, not down the drain) and you can gently extract.</li>
            <li>I heard that if you wash everything down the drain, you can easily clog your sink.</li>
            <li>I am the type of person who does not like to spend a ridiculous amount of money on beauty products and I find most masks and things like that, you are paying for the brand and the pretty label.</li>
            <li>Leaves face red but only overnight it&#x27;s fine in the morning.</li>
            <li>The price is right and it doesn&#x27;t take much at all for a single use.</li>
            <li>When I took it off of my face (I usually pull off the big chunks and then use a warm wash rag to gently remove the rest)</li>
            <li>This is a miraculous product and so cheap compared to all the other treatments I have purchased.  </li>
            <li>You need to use it religiously and don&#x27;t stop when you see your skin pushing out a few more blemishes in the first week or two.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a few weeks since my first review and my results have only gotten better.  </li>
            <li>I AM SO CURIOUS ABOUT OTHERS&#x27; success stories from this product!</li>
            <li>I AM SO CURIOUS ABOUT OTHERS&#x27; success stories from this product!</li>
            <li>The instructions say that this is normal, however the next day I really did not notice that much of an improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>It gets a little messy and takes a bit of work preparing, but its great.</li>
            <li>It was a little messy, but otherwise a great product.</li>
            <li>I first mixed it with green tea, and it was okay.</li>
            <li>Also, the first few times you use this, your face will turn red and you will get even more breakouts.</li>
            <li>but after I take the stuff off then my face turns red, and heats up, &amp; kind of gives me a headache for a little while.</li>
            <li>After I washed off my skin was feeling warm and a little red.</li>
            <li>Perhaps she has more sensitive skin and with such minor blemishes doesn&#x27;t need a product like this.  </li>
            <li>Now here&#x27;s the shower part - if you try to wash this off in the sink like any other masque - be aware it does not just rinse right off.  </li>
            <li>I am hooked, and I hope it works for you if you decide to try it.re&#x27;s the shower part - if you try to wash this off in the sink like any other masque - be aware it does not just rinse right off.  </li>
            <li>Once I dried off I must say my face doesn&#x27;t feel dry, it actually feels pretty good.</li>
            <li>Every time I use this I find a new pimple on my face</li>
            <li>to dry/chap with New England winters.</li>
            <li>I cannot express how mug I live this stuff</li>
            <li>I still have scars, but preventing new acne to make new scars will help the healing process.  </li>
            <li>If you are reading this and live in NJ....</li>
            <li>My foot felt brand new.</li>
            <li>All of my blackheads are gone as well as the newly formed pimples.</li>
            <li>I have to be using a new makeup.  </li>
            <li>I have to be using a new makeup.  </li>
            <li>Still giving it a chance to live up to it reviews.</li>
            <li>Definitely my new go to.</li>
            <li>im a new person now</li>
            <li>skin feels renewed (TOTALLY NEW SKIN!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My new favourite mask</li>
            <li>/&gt;The KonjacSponges are a new addition to my routine.</li>
            <li>Sponges are a new addition to my routine.</li>
            <li>I then apply acnedot spot treatment from Alba which is a new product..</li>
            <li>I received a new mosquito bite --</li>
            <li>Bought it on a whim after getting a severe breakout from a new supplement ive been taking for an bum shoulder.</li>
            <li>I cannot live without this mask.</li>
            <li>so you may notice new pimple growth afterward</li>
            <li>And by then, new acne has shown up - ah, what a pain.</li>
            <li>This has become a new holy grail product for me, I will be buying this again when I run out, if I ever run out this is a lot of product.</li>
            <li>My face literally felt brand new.</li>
            <li>After taking off the mask it felt like I had a new face.</li>
            <li>My skin is like new again.</li>
            <li>My skin soaks up the moisturizer like a champ and looks brand new post-treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin soaks up the moisturizer like a champ and looks brand new post-treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s from the clay or a combination of all the new products, but I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li>I bought this just to try out a new mask</li>
            <li>Truly live changing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that, I really do believe it has helped with my acne tremendously.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to believe because it&#x27;s so reasonably priced compared to most skin care masks</li>
            <li>, if you are doing this with a friend you will not be able to talk while doing the face mask, it really tightens up your pores and makes it hard to move your face.</li>
            <li>Super hard to clean though unless I just clog up all my drains.</li>
            <li>After applying it for a few more days after my skin would get a little red in areas that are kind of sensitive</li>
            <li>After using it for the first time I immediately noticed that my pores looked smaller and my skin was so soft!!</li>
            <li>thank you guy with the super long review!</li>
            <li>My skin was not especially soft or smooth, but it definitely feels clean and not overly dry.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s face definitely looked brighter from the beginning but that might have been due to lack of even washing her face on a regular basis but she liked it&#x27;s effect and wants to do it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s face definitely looked brighter from the beginning but that might have been due to lack of even washing her face on a regular basis but she liked it&#x27;s effect and wants to do it again.  </li>
            <li>I feel like leaving a positive review for this stuff at this point is overkill--but I bought this clay a little over a month ago, and I&#x27;m so in love with it, I actually wanted to spend 4 minutes out of my day to write a review.</li>
            <li>but I think it would&#x27;ve worked even better if I had used the raw, full-strength stuff.</li>
            <li>Make sure to use the raw apple cider vinager.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re using it with the Bragg&#x27;s raw apple cider 50% of the time for greater results.</li>
            <li>I love that the recipe requires to mix it with raw apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li>Make sure you purchase raw apple cidar vinager to mix with it.</li>
            <li>Use the raw apple cider vinegar though cause it&#x27;s way better.</li>
            <li>holy cow, this stuff is on my face for the first time right now</li>
            <li>As it drys your face does pulsate and it makes your face feel like its getting very tight which I love.</li>
            <li>It was red for 30 mins after I washed it off but the difference in pore size and skin clarity made such a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>When I rinsed it off my skin was red, but not super bright red.</li>
            <li>I wish this would be easier and worked for me because I do need something that will clean my skin minus the side effects.</li>
            <li>Was fun to use, I&#x27;m not very observant about whether it worked or not, because I have very discrete acne.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t leave it on any longer than the 15-20 minutes recommended since it can be kind of intense and irritating though.</li>
            <li>When I initially mixed the mask up, it puffed up some of the dry clay into the air and started fizzing, which kind of scared me actually, because I hadn&#x27;t read anything that said that it would react like that.  </li>
            <li>This mask works to cleanse &amp; possibly helps with maintaining an acne free complexion if used regularly but all the sensations that you might feel is just the mask drying up.</li>
            <li>Mainly because I have sensitive, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not only a relaxing facial, but it will smooth your skin and help remove any blemishes while doing</li>
            <li>I recommend moisturizing after every use because this will make your skin feel super dry.</li>
            <li>Used ONCE by far, really at a loss for words, WOW....</li>
            <li>Now that I am over that 2 week hump, my skin is clear and I feel that the scars I have from older blemishes are lightening.  </li>
            <li>My whole face would be very red after removing the mask, even when I was gentle with the removal.</li>
            <li>but overall I have not seen much improvement or much of a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I put a lot of vitamin C serum on but it was super dry.  </li>
            <li>I think you should definitely try this out, and for the price, you really have nothing to lose., and for the price, you really have nothing to lose.</li>
            <li>I have to make sure to moisturize my face after with lotion as this does dry my face out, but it definitely makes my face BABY soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing absolutely no makeup for about a year now, but finally feel confident without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once dried, I simply use a washcloth and warm water to scrub it off with.</li>
            <li>I used to use this a few years back, and I remember loving it.</li>
            <li>I tried scrubs but none that I have tried have ever been really effective at removing the dead skin flakes, it seems to only make it worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was a decent mask but clearly overhyped</li>
            <li>only issue is that it&#x27;s kind of a pain to get off of your face because it&#x27;s literally dried mud</li>
            <li>I still break out, but not as much as I used to, and they don&#x27;t last as much anymore.</li>
            <li>My skin looks so smooth, air brushed, smaller pored, hydrated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it to my cousin who has more resilient skin than I do in hopes it will work wonders for her, but for my sensitive skin, it&#x27;s just too harsh and leaves it feeling like it went through a war zone.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t bother if you have sensitive skin, or already decent skin.</li>
            <li>I liked the product, but I don&#x27;t think it made a lasting impact on my skin even with a few uses.</li>
            <li>By a mile it is better than all the expensive products that are available.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I am fortunate to only get the occasional pimple</li>
            <li>Mixed with water helped alleviate some of the dryness but not enough to comfortably continue using this product.  </li>
            <li>This mask 1) really helps to clear up my breakouts 2) hasn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive skin 3)</li>
            <li>A good base for most mask recipes.</li>
            <li>After rinsing I put on a small dab of pure 100 percent jojoba oil to moisturizer while I sleep ( go easy on it)</li>
            <li>Made my face a little red after first washing it off but it made it so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other masks before but this stuff is very, very powerful.</li>
            <li>The clay mask cleans out my impurities, leaves my skin very soft and I now have skin that I am comfortable enough to walk out the door with without wearing make up (this is a big deal for anyone working with make up ;</li>
            <li>first it was a little too painful but its soo worth it after you rinse it off :D</li>
            <li>If I had a HUGE problem with acne, I would continue to use this product and probably get decent results, but for someone who just wants a weekly deep cleanse, I would highly suggest the Queen Helene Masque or the (more expensive but</li>
            <li>/&gt;Exfoliation is usually too harsh for my sensitive fair skin, but this seems to have given me the benefit of exfoliation with no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed!  </li>
            <li>and I can really see a major change.</li>
            <li>is a little hard to mix to a smooth consistency but is makes my skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li>, you feel the pulsation of your skin, the instructions are very clear on how to apply and take off the product.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any irritation, but noticed some reviewers saying that it caused irritation, so it may cause irritation for people with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin &amp; this is non-irritating.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you want to care for your skin into old ago.</li>
            <li>The transport is very fast and quite a big bottle.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, but if you do have sensitive skin I wouldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling very soft</li>
            <li>It is very masculine</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin with some cystic acne.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel very soft after I moisturize.</li>
            <li>Not for very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the miracle mask i was hoping, perhaps because my skin is very sensitive and not oily.</li>

            <li>I was VERY surprised when I put the Indian Healing Clay on.</li>

            <li>I have very sensitive acne prone skin with scarring and have seen improvement since using this product.</li>

            <li>My son and I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>it make my skin very soft and bright.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it makes your skin very soft and reduces the pores.</li>
            <li>I guess my face is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>No, but it gave me nice fresh skin, calmed some redness and preformed as well, if not better, than products that are much, much more expensive.</li>
            <li>It says in the description that your skin will be red and look slightly irritated right after the mask, BUT when you wake up in the morning, your skin will me smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li>Its easy to apply and hop to shower so to avoid mess in sink</li>
            <li>I bent into the sink and turned on very warm water and started slowly washing my face, no rubbing just gently moving the water over the mask until it started &#x27;melting&#x27; and washed off completely with no chunks of clay in my sink, it just blending into water down the drain like normal.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even say that this product caused me to breakout, because many of the new blemishes were in the usual troublesome locations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It sucks it right out and doesn&#x27;t leave a huge swollen bump that squeezing would.</li>
            <li>Right now, any pimple I get is completely halted after a night of this stuff.. even the deep cysts.</li>
            <li>Right now, any pimple I get is completely halted after a night of this stuff.. even the deep cysts.</li>
            <li>base is mostly the apple cider vinegar, but in addition to the apple cider vinegar, I add some pure aloe vera juice and some rose water.  </li>
            <li>I mixed the clay with rose water and a little vegetable glycerin , i like the effect on my face so far.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference the night I did it, but the next day a lot of the little pimples had gone away, my skin was a lot more toned</li>
            <li>Pay special attention to the outer edges and make sure they aren&#x27;t too thin, or they will dry first and pull the hardest.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>I would completely reccomend this product to anyone looking to deep clean their skin, refine pores, and who wants a natural skin care product that actually works!</li>
            <li>But my skin is already dry, so not sure this is good for people over 50.</li>
            <li>Got tight very quickly.  </li>
            <li>The mixture came out really lumpy and kind of gross and hard to apply in any sort of even coating.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, if you are using it as a face mask with ACV be sure to only use a tiny bit as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t cause it to become more dry like other face masks can, which I appreciated.</li>
            <li>Then I rinse and wash with a gentle cleanser and the little \\&quot;scrublet\\&quot; that came with Loreal&#x27;s 360 Clean cleanser.</li>
            <li>I tried it once using bottled water to keep it simple and pure (not vinegar as suggested) and as it dried, my skin started breaking out in large puss filled bumps.  </li>
            <li>and my skin is practically clear!</li>
            <li>my pores are almost all clear!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s helping clear my skin!</li>
            <li>Upon waking up my skin was clear!</li>
            <li>Clear skin!</li>
            <li>It looks so clear!</li>
            <li>Hopefully as I continue to use it my face stays clear!</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt so soft!</li>
            <li>put the mask once with my fingers, and I had some areas that hurt more than others, almost causing a skin irritation in small areas.</li>
            <li>It does smell funny once mixed with the apple cider vinegar but</li>
            <li>My dark circles are clearing up, my skin feels so smooth,</li>
            <li>Looked in the mirror and my face was smoother and better than it had been in the past without any trace of the allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first mixed by hand and it turned out clumpy.</li>
            <li>If only he would be consistent on using it.</li>
            <li>so I overmade my first batch with 1/3 cup of each in a glass bowl and mixed it with a a plastic butter spreader.  </li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t make any funny faces while applying it as a facial mask.</li>
            <li>This is the first skin care product I&#x27;ve EVER used that has actually substantially helped the appearance and quality of my skin.</li>
            <li>I wish I could be of help to somebody, if you have sensitive skin please don&#x27;t bother, it will just disappoint you!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>like this mask though, but the people who read how \\&quot;good\\&quot; this clay mask is, be aware that you would feel the same experience like the others including me have.</li>
            <li>It shrinks pores withing tqo uses, makes skin baby soft!</li>
            <li>I mixed it up about an hour after I opened the package, I was pretty eager.  </li>
            <li>think I will be cleaning other areas of my skin next :) Why not?</li>
            <li>Wow after reading the reviews I went ahead and purchase this product!</li>
            <li>My skin is baby soft!</li>
            <li>My skin is baby soft!</li>
            <li>and I am not sure that it is making my skin look any better.  </li>
            <li>This made my skin feel so soft!  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I find myself looking forward to my next at-home spa session featuring this and a hot bath.</li>
            <li>but i can say that first time i used it all my back heads on my nose were gone!</li>
            <li>I was like, WOW!</li>
            <li>After using it for the first time last night, I can tell you that this mask lives up to all the hype.</li>
            <li>I tried the mask for the first time today and saw instant results.</li>
            <li>My face cleared up in about a couple days and my scars have lightened considerably too!</li>
            <li>but in the long run it is worth it you also can use water</li>
            <li>I would have used it more often in the past if I didn&#x27;t have to mix it.</li>
            <li>I have been using is for about 3 weeks pretty religiously.</li>
            <li>My first try mixed with apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>The first time i used it i mixed it with water.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>A pal recommended I use it on my hair and , WOW! .</li>
            <li>The jars are pretty big</li>
            <li>WOW is all I can say.!</li>
            <li>I also use it on my hair and it made it so incredibly soft!</li>
            <li>My skin feels velvety soft too!  </li>
            <li>pour just a tad of apple cider vinegar in a plastic tupperwear bowl &amp; add small amounts of the clay &amp; mix with a plastic spoon until I get a smooth (not too runny!)</li>
            <li>a big thank you to the person who tipped me off that I could buy it at Whole Foods!  </li>
            <li>I even put hot pack on several days in a row.  </li>
            <li>You want be disappointed MIX with the vinegar for best results.</li>
            <li>I first tried my usual warm wet washcloth to start wiping the mask off.  </li>
            <li>Yes, even my fine lines on my forehead have become less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Yes, even my fine lines on my forehead have become less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I have put excess in the fridge and used it later with no ill effects</li>
            <li>I was aware of the red face side effect but it just goes away after 30 mins.</li>
            <li>The first time i used it, I began by mixing it with water and a small amount of apple cider vinegar and left it on for about 20 minutes (which was really too long) and then rinsed with warm water.</li>
            <li>It definitely took some time though - the clay really sticks to your face!  </li>
            <li>I would definitely buy this again, as it is an all natural cheap product that actually does what it says it does.</li>
            <li>To begin, I will steam my face to open my pores by applying a towel that has been moistened with hot water.  </li>
            <li>Anyways, I discovered this recently and it really, really works!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I mixed it with water.  </li>
            <li>(you rinse off the clay in the shower), however, I usually wipe a lot of the clay off with a paper towel before jumping in the shower, just to be safe that I don&#x27;t clog the drain.  </li>
            <li>Simple, as other reviews have stated, the mask is drawing all of the dirt to the top of the skin.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, scrubbing is needed--as hot water doesn&#x27;t seem enough.  </li>
            <li>My face felt like a baby&#x27;s butt afterwards and that&#x27;s soft!</li>
            <li>This clay comes ALIVE on your face after you apply it - you literally feel it moving and getting it on with your skin!</li>
            <li>it is pretty essential to the healing method.</li>
            <li>I am a male and wanted to get pretty to find a lady.</li>
            <li>Received yesterday, used last night for the first time.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been consistent enough to notice a difference</li>
            <li>I should store it beside a small bottle of apple cider vinegar to promote myself to use it more often.</li>
            <li>When first using the mask for a facial your skin will start a purge</li>
            <li>after  first  use, I seen I  big difference.</li>
            <li>For people who are using this for the first time, make sure you test it on your hand first before you use it (just in case it feels uncomfortable).</li>
            <li>First time using the clay mask, I used ACV, mixed together and within minutes the clay hardened.</li>
            <li>rather use some other face wash from the local store and works better</li>
            <li>It took Aloe Vera gel applications every hour the first day and every three hours the next to get rid of the burning sensation and the redness.</li>
            <li>love this stuff, it&#x27;s like any other facial mud mask u would put on just tat</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars because I&#x27;ve gone through various treatments for my acne (prescription and nonprescription) and it has truly improved my complexion after the first try.</li>
            <li>I instantly notice a difference after i first used it.</li>
            <li>First time using this last night</li>
            <li>my 28 year old acne ridden face like nothing I&#x27;ve ever used before!</li>
            <li>Does make face red for a bit afterwards so just be aware that&#x27;s norml</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t leave it on too long, it can irritate the face because it is so powerful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li>BS  and mixed up a batch for my first go.</li>
            <li>This was my first and only rip off.</li>
            <li>I used it on my hair and it made my natural curls pop!</li>
            <li>/&gt;BE AWARE that this only cleans out your face</li>
            <li>/&gt;BE AWARE that this only cleans out your face</li>
            <li>Probably since I was like 8-9 years old!  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>As a woman in her 30s who recently developed troublesome skin, this stuff is a lifesaver!  </li>
            <li>First time i used it, i mixed it with the suggested viniger.  </li>
            <li>They are so soft!</li>
            <li>They are so soft!</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time last night.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how affective this mud, sorry - clay, really is, but it sure feels fun.</li>
            <li>Usually you end up making much more mud</li>
            <li>Worth every penny, just don&#x27;t leave on for too long or your face will look sunburnt for hours.</li>
            <li>I had purchased other products to help w/my sporadic, stress/hormone-induced acne for much more and hadn&#x27;t seen any lasting results.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>The first time, I mixed it with water; and like others have said, it does make the mixture clumpy, but it still works.</li>
            <li>Simply amazing.i just tried it for the first time.</li>
            <li>I mixed it up with ACV and after using it I felt like my face looked so much nicer!</li>
            <li>My skin was pretty red afterwards for about 30 mins.</li>
            <li>My skin was sooooo soft!</li>
            <li>i first mixed it with water, but it did not blend well</li>
            <li>When I first take the mask off, my skin is initially very red.</li>
            <li>I follow with Young Living Tea Tree Oil to soothe!</li>
            <li>This was her first step in doing a facial.</li>
            <li>My skin does turn red at first</li>
            <li>She paid something like $25 for this exact same thing except hers came from some boutique,</li>
            <li>Just used this for the first time last night.  </li>
            <li>This is a first of having Amy sort of reaction to facial products.  </li>
            <li>First I apply to my chest, shoulders, and back.</li>
            <li>(I thought it might be more solid like other clay masques I have used, as in already damp in the jar).  </li>
            <li>but wow what a deal!</li>
            <li>my significant other use these</li>
            <li>It makes pretty big claims, but it lives up to them.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>My first attempt in using this clay was last night.</li>
            <li>On my second container (first lasted nearly a year!</li>
            <li>This mask rivals all other much more pricey facial masks ANY day of the year!</li>
            <li>First thing I should say to anyone wanting to buy this product- OPEN IT OVER THE SINK!</li>
            <li>i have used other similar products and they have done better job than this ..</li>
            <li>I usually leave it on for 20 + minutes (more than direction say to).  </li>
            <li>I just used it last night for the first time.</li>
            <li>I would buy it again only because it does seem to help more than any other products that I have tried.</li>
            <li>When I use it on my face my skin gets red and hot when I wash it off.</li>
            <li>I have only used it twice (once Friday and once Sunday) and my skin is already much clearer!  </li>
            <li>You could feel and see the difference on your face in the first facial treatment.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m slowly switching over to more gentle and natural products for my skin and</li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle at GNC last weekend</li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle at GNC last weekend</li>
            <li>and WOW..my hair felt incredibly soft and managable!</li>
            <li>I was like wow!</li>
            <li>Really smooth and clearer, a type of clear I dnt get from my other face masks.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s a small price to pay for porcelain skin if you ask me. :)</li>
            <li>Wow did this work!</li>
            <li>small amount of clay and a small amount of the apple cider vinegar, it fizzes up and mixes perfectly, something you cannot do with regular water.</li>
            <li>Delivered today, I tried for the first time, mixed with water.</li>
            <li>well was I surprised!</li>
            <li>Ive used other products before that I was excited about</li>
            <li>Pretty basic, works well though.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 20 and use this on my acne prone skin and it works wonders, I noticed a big difference after the first 2 weeks of using it</li>
            <li>I decided to check my blackheads and WOW!</li>
            <li>This was only my first use</li>
            <li>Completely recommend!</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin red at first</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use vinegar… I used hot water so it can open up my pores.</li>
            <li>I mix exactly 50/50 powder to water ratio using only plastic bowl and utensil.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin really soft!</li>
            <li>I have a sudden outbreak for the first time in my 23years of life.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Applying the mask after it&#x27;s done is pretty simple.</li>
            <li>To my surprise, I saw results instantly after the first use.</li>
            <li>I mixed this with water to use for my first try.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I requested, and I&#x27;m now on my second jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I never quite &amp;#34;believed&amp;#34; in masks to make a significant different in your skin, but this definitely proved otherwise.</li>
            <li>pH. First time users, leave it on for around ten minutes</li>
            <li>First time I used it, I saw a difference the very next day.</li>
            <li>It does make your face pretty red for about 30-60 minutes after use.</li>
            <li>I also heard this does wonders on your natural hair, but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet!</li>
            <li>it definitely helps improve the complexion but if you&#x27;re an acne sufferer you definitely want to look at more internal things.</li>
            <li>Without a doubt feel like my face gets detoxed and when I take it off my face is pretty red.</li>
            <li>It also helps with my 17 year old son&#x27;s breakouts!</li>
            <li>First day I tried it I mixed a couple spoons with organic apple cider vinegar as some reviewers say to do so.</li>
            <li>ONLY if you&#x27;re using it consistently.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Almost completely HEALED!</li>
            <li>It clears my blackheads, especially my nose for exactly a week.  </li>
            <li>It is green in color as it should be and make a good deep cleaning facial mask.</li>
            <li>I used up a whole tub of this clay trying many different ingredients and have come up with a few</li>
            <li>/&gt;It may have been not mixing it with ACV yet, not a whole lot of tingling, but it was kinda cool with the tightening thing.</li>
            <li>liked the soft feel of my skin after the mask and will be using this product a few times a month, in addition to the daily scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has some too good to be true reviews along with some normal and of course bad ones.  </li>
            <li>Its pretty strong and will leave your face red for a little while afterwards, but my face has never been softer or clearer.  </li>
            <li>You will not be able to make facial expressions comfortable once it is dry, so do leave plenty of time to make a facial, have it dry completely, and then to remove it.</li>
            <li>It leaves both soft and supple and my hair is not hard or crunchy from the clay.</li>
            <li>I was a little scared from the label that it would be too strong.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product because every ones in awhile, i feel i need that extra feeling of DEEP clean skin.</li>
            <li>I use this mask to deep clean my pores around once a week, which it definitely does.</li>
            <li>I bought this to help deep clean my pores and give me a facial without paying $30.</li>
            <li>Such a deep clean</li>
            <li>smeared it on, easy enough, and waited for it to dry for about 30 mins.&lt;br /&gt;It tingled and after awhile, I could not move my face at all.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>-- I use Bioderma and Neutrogena face wipes to take off my make up (only on days that I wear make up), then I use the clarasonic mia and cetaphil daily face wash to clean my skin.</li>
            <li>It feels as if after using this for several months, my skin definitely feels detoxed and clean.</li>
            <li>This bite did feel a bit itchy, only sometimes, even with the paste on it, but instead of feeling like I needed to intensely scratch it, like I did the older bites, this one began to heal faster.  </li>
            <li>Definitely gave me a deep clean</li>
            <li>Lastly, once the clay mix is completely dry in the bowl I used to whip it up, it&#x27;s easy to wipe the excess into the garbage.  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and this stuff did not irritate or dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>For acne seriously this really does help but make sure you combine this with the apple cider vinegar, you wont regret it.</li>
            <li>It just takes longer to dry and is less effective.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find that the 6-month old henna that I thought had grown out to the tips of my hair was vibrantly all over my hair.</li>
            <li>It really keeps your skin and pores clean along with removing dead skin .</li>
            <li>I seriously cannot say enough good things about this face mask.</li>
            <li>It never pulsated the first few times but did last time and was kinda cool!</li>
            <li>The container is a large container filled with lots of powder, im not sure if i can use it all before the expiration date</li>
            <li>It cleans and detoxifies ur skin to give you a clean feeling unlike other cleansers.  </li>
            <li>I just add water and put it on, not with the other stuff.&lt;br /&gt;*makes skin glow-you definitely will feel a fresh, clean face with a glow.&lt;br /&gt;*prevents major breakouts</li>
            <li>One thing I read though is that you should clean this off your face into a bowl or pot or something other than your sink since the clay can build up and cause a clog after a while.</li>
            <li>There will also come a time when you will have to decide if you prefer to have a clean face and blocked drain or the other way around.</li>
            <li>plus it doesn&#x27;t cost that much compared to other stuff you are probably buying right now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have it for the occasional (or frequent) facial, and I&#x27;m probably going to try it on my shoulders next.</li>
            <li>Definitely has tightening qualities-time will tell if it lasts beyond a few days following application, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>One of the big reasons I use the Bel Essence cream is because after using the clay, I put oil back into my skin, so I don&#x27;t end up with super dry skin, and also, Idon&#x27;t end up with super oily skin.  </li>
            <li>It turned out to be enough to put a pretty thick mask layer on my face and a thinner, more normal layer on my neck.  </li>
            <li>The ultimate soft feeling that is left behind is ideal.</li>
            <li>I use this product with my acne medication and then go on top of my acne medication with a very heavy over night cream.</li>
            <li>For the first time I was also able to apply a very thick layer as the lable suggests.</li>
            <li>thing I have to complain about is it&#x27;s a little messy trying to clean up :)</li>
            <li>I wipe most of it off first with a paper towel so there are no chunks of clay going down my sink than I rinse with warm, than cold water to close my pores.</li>
            <li>For dry skin it&#x27;s best to mix it with a little moisturizing agent like milk cream and honey (and a little water) to apply so it does not dry your skin out.</li>
            <li>It really makes your face super tight when it dries up</li>
            <li>I am always on the look out for new, natural products that I haven&#x27;t tried before.</li>
            <li>I am always nervous about putting new products on my face because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin that breaks out in acne if I try a new makeup product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long the redness lasted because I went to bed right after.</li>
            <li>It is hard to remove but with a little hot water you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will continue to use this mask faithfully, experimenting with different liquid mixers despite the unpleasant feeling as it dries because the results are so impressive.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell amazing when made, but it works, and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>It last a long time and it keeps my face youthful and smooth.</li>
            <li>my face is free of acne and black heads.</li>
            <li>which may work for them, but I have arthritis in my hands and they give out long before the mixture is smooth enough to be usable).  </li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic and it is long lasting.</li>
            <li>i also believe it would be fine for sensitive skin if you only mix it with water and dont leave it on for too long.</li>
            <li>It applies lumpy and not smooth and does not remove easily.</li>
            <li>It takes awhile to dry, but I think that&#x27;s part of the fun with masks.</li>
            <li>A few of the cysts were brought to a head that I could easily pop (I know it&#x27;s not recommended to pop your pimples...</li>
            <li>I let the clay dry on my face and upper portion of neck for about 15 minutes, until dry, and then washed off with warm water and a cloth towel.</li>
            <li>next time I will try for 5-7 minutes instead of the full ten minutes.</li>
            <li>next time I will try for 5-7 minutes instead of the full ten minutes.</li>
            <li>I barely stirred the mixture before it became a fluffy, mousse like consistancy, completely free of lumps!</li>
            <li>I was kind of skeptical when I first bought it, but</li>
            <li>love green clay in general.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely messy but cleans up easily as long as you don&#x27;t use a nice towel.</li>
            <li>I make sure that I put on a pretty thin layer.</li>
            <li>(I also have had eczema like skin occasionally on my legs and arms, so I have pretty sensitive skin.)  </li>
            <li>But yeah, if you can find it at  your local natural aide-type place, look around there first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also mixed the mask in an old protein scoop, which works pretty well too.</li>
            <li>I was pretty skeptical about this product, but I have used it twice now and can honestly say that it does, in fact, produce immediate results.</li>
            <li>I went to two dermatologists, paid for countless microdermabrasion facials (which I love by the way and ultitmately helped with dark spots caused by acne, and also unclogging the pores,)</li>
            <li>The combination of ACV and the bentonite clay left my skin feeling pure, clean and it only left some redness that subsided after about 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I had multiple large break outs on my cheeks and it was pretty gross looking, but I used it once</li>
            <li>We let it dry and then applied a large bandage to cover the whole area.  </li>
            <li>: The first few times stick with the instructions (specially the first time); however, I would recommend waiting longer and let the mask dry completely on your face.&lt;br /&gt;3-</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;First, if you have oily skin and aren&#x27;t very sensitive, use the apple cider vinegar for mixing; if you are sensitive use distilled water.</li>
            <li>My adult acne has cleared  and my skin is very soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 31, so I have adult acne, and very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Sure, it was probably just a few years, but when you&#x27;re one of the only teens with pizza-face in both your high schools, it seems like an eternity or two.</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t &#x27;unclog&#x27; my pores any more than any other generic facial cleaner.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels and it cleans your face down to the last bit.</li>
            <li>Also, if you have white pillow cases, the mask leaves a striking stain when you lay face down on the pillow.</li>
            <li>I suggest not washing it off down the drain first, but removing it with a makeup remover towelette first to get it started in the removal process.</li>
            <li>your face will get dry and also open up your pores by steaming your face with very hot towels then applying the mask so it really works.</li>
            <li>This is the first thing that made a very obvious and very significant difference after the first use; I wasn&#x27;t waiting for weeks to see any improvement or forced to use an entire skin care line and not mix product to see a difference after weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>This is the first thing that made a very obvious and very significant difference after the first use; I wasn&#x27;t waiting for weeks to see any improvement or forced to use an entire skin care line and not mix product to see a difference after weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>how I felt it getting tight on my face after about 1-2mins I left on for about ten mins, my face has been so shining and Oily after washing off my face feels refreshed and cleaned , I can tell I&#x27;m going to love this product by my first use of it.</li>
            <li>The next day, he said he could still feel the positive results of having this clay sit on his oily skin for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>only have positive comment about this product.  </li>
            <li>I recommend that you will want to listen to the other comments and DO NOT try pulling this off your face, it is very strong and you will tear your skin and it really hurts, I did it by mistake in a very small area and it really really hurt!</li>
            <li>Instead of washing it off and making a huge mess in the shower, I peel it off in chunks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to not do the &amp;#34;before shower&amp;#34; step, but I always end up making a HUGE mess in my sink</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin and this hasn&#x27;t caused any problems, but it has helped clear up my acne!</li>
            <li>Also these reviews of pulsating and blackhead free skin are just not true.</li>
            <li>I accidentally mixed it with cooking wine the first time, so it was really itchy, but when I actually used ACV it worked amaizingly well.</li>
            <li>I really have only used it probably 3-4 times and the first time I left it on for about 20 mins until I felt my skin start to pulsate</li>
            <li>At least five white heads popped out of no where, I am sure if I waited another week, they would pop out by themselves and it won&#x27;t be pretty.</li>
            <li>It pretty messy, but I enjoy the fact that I can give myself an at home facial.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, yeah, but I also think I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth it if it makes my skin really red, seems like I shouldn&#x27;t be doing that to my face, you know?</li>
            <li>You WILL BREAK OUT after using this the first 3 or 4 times but stick with it, its getting gunk from the teenage years out (haha I&#x27;m 27) and its gross.</li>
            <li>My pores are not small as yet, but hoping to see a change in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>so I had my other items full of powder.</li>
            <li>my breakouts got worse before they got better, but my skin became the softest it has ever been after 3 uses!</li>
            <li>True to all of the other reviews-</li>
            <li>Mixed with Apple cider vinegar and water, 3 equal parts, kinda cool watching the bubbling action of the mixture.</li>
            <li>1981 called and wants its skin care product back - nothing new here.  </li>
            <li>I bought this after starting a new medication that caused some unusual breakouts for my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sensitive to certain products and is somehow simultaneously really oily in the T-zone and really dry along my cheeks and chin.</li>
            <li>I use this mask every other night (if you don&#x27;t have acne / oily skin or if your skin is really dry and sensitive, I would only do 1 or 2 days a week at very most and see how your skin does).</li>
            <li>and then when I came back to check on his face about an hour later, it was amazing how the redness and inflammation (from the acne) had gone down.  </li>
            <li>My skin leans more towards the dry side, so i have to be careful as to how often i use this clay.</li>
            <li>This product works very well on my face, however it does dry it a bit too much.  </li>
            <li>black heads come to the surface and even 2 to 3 days later love it</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use it too much because it really does dry your skin</li>
            <li>Next advice LESS IS MORE- when it comes to mixing it.</li>
            <li>I thought, maybe I need to dilute it more, only made a negligibly slight difference.</li>
            <li>it was really fun to do together, and the pulsing claim is real, it tightens and you can feel a slight pulse as it drys..</li>
            <li>Softens your skin, helps reduce black heads and acne, and overall makes your face feel better.</li>
            <li>This is the only item that was able to 100% pull all of the black heads out of my nose.</li>
            <li>had no problems, but just be careful if you have super sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Id be careful mixing with apple cider vinegar if your skin is super sensitive, but its definately a MUST in my skin care regimen now.</li>
            <li>WELL I read on a website from this super knowledgeable person that the white stuff is actually the over-refined/bad quality clay, so THERE.  </li>
            <li>WELL I read on a website from this super knowledgeable person that the white stuff is actually the over-refined/bad quality clay, so THERE.  </li>
            <li>I strongly suggest this for men too but only thing is we need to be careful while mixing this with water as it forms lot of lumps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it off for about 10 minutes now, and my skin still feels tight and smooth.</li>
            <li>Not only is the clay powder so fine it makes a mess of absolutely everything (both in preparation and removal), the resulting mask feels like you&#x27;re setting your face on fire.</li>
            <li>At first, when I read that this is the world&#x27;s most powerful facial, I was skeptical.</li>
            <li>swelling of one of an emerging zit went down significantly and it was no longer hurting.</li>
            <li>The swelling had gone down significantly and the bite did not hurt anymore.</li>
            <li>and it is completely dry remember to go in with a moisturizer, because now any treatment you want to use with sink right in.</li>
            <li>and it is completely dry remember to go in with a moisturizer, because now any treatment you want to use with sink right in.</li>
            <li>If you use the moisturizer right after you take off the mask it shouldn&#x27;t dry out your face at all.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s cuz the vinegar dissolves some and leaves you with a dry, unmixed turd, so you have to keep adding and adjusting til the consistency&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li>You need to apply serum and moisturizer right after rinsing the clay off because your skin will feel quite dry.  </li>
            <li>It leaves no mess!</li>
            <li>I had no foundation on, and my skin was a little red from removing the product with a small towel, and yet my face still looked good!</li>
            <li>No mess that way!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this twice so far, but I&#x27;m already seeing some positive changes.</li>
            <li>My hair looks extremely shiny, which is pretty amazing considering that I have pitch black natural hair (natural meaning textured &amp; of African ancestry)&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>Regardless, leave it on for 10-15 minutes especially in a dry cool environment and you will feel your skin and pores tighten like never before.</li>
            <li>Soft, soft, soft!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with different skin types, just be sure to use a moisturizer after so your skin doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li>it did not magically clear up my entire face in 30 minutes, but it did significantly reduce what was on it.  </li>

            <li>I pretty much evaluated/tested my skin for every other factor the rashes could be from, but I could not find any indicator of it being anything else ....</li>
            <li>This will probably be hit or miss with a lot of people just because it can be super irritating to your skin, but for under $10, I don&#x27;t think it would break the bank for most people.ls off in clumps, so I&#x27;d recommend washing your face over your kitchen sink if possible</li>

            <li>35 minutes later I washed my face in the shower, and as long as you are patient and let the warm water to the majority of the work with light rubbing, the clay should turn back into mud and rinse off nicely, not in clumps.  </li>

            <li>but it certainly isnt the same product I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li>The container is large and I think it will last me a while.</li>
            <li>It got rid of almost all of the blackheads on my nose with the exception of one or two large big ones.</li>
            <li>Simple fix, just paint some more on until your whole face is covered in a decent layer and there are few dry patches [ normally at the edges ].&lt;br</li>

            <li>I misjudged and did like a half cup of water/apple cider vinegar and couldn&#x27;t get the right consistency of mud without adding the whole container.</li>
            <li>I am ready to greet the day.&lt;br /&gt;-I intend on using this on my full face weekly, and doing the T-Zone daily or every other day.ng</li>

            <li>This isn&#x27;t a magical product but it seems helpful, I wonder if it&#x27;s worth the mess and trouble though.</li>
            <li>Make sure you buy raw Apple cider vinegar to mix with this product- DO NOT USE WATER!</li>
            <li>use with acv and raw honey! :)</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t bounce back with extra oil the next day like many products that are supposed to remove oil and really just dry out</li>
            <li>Works very well and makes skin look and feel great, but it can be very hard (and messy) to remove.</li>
            <li>I mixed 1 tbsp of the clay, 1 tbsp of Bragg&#x27;s ACV (Apple Cider Vinegar) &amp; 1 tbsp of water in a large plastic cup (old cottage cheese container) with a plastic spoon.</li>
            <li>And worth the price, I mixed my first mask in a small tupperware, let the extra dry and added more water when I wanted another mask.</li>
            <li>I mixed the water and acv in the bag and then poured  little bits of the clay into the bag, I locked the zip bag and gave it shakes until I got the consistency I was looking for, adding more clay as needed.  </li>
            <li>(Aug 29): ok, i did it with Apple Cider Vinegar this time and mixed it in a little ceramic cup instead of a ziplock baggy...</li>
            <li>I do agree that some of my pores did look a little bigger, but I guess that could be because its bring the acne to the top???</li>
            <li>I suppose I should have researched this product a little more, but there was nothing in the description or reviews that led me to believe it would be such a</li>
            <li>Oh, and a little advice, many times beauty products will say to apply a product to your face and neck so with that prior advice</li>

            <li>it will then just run off on its own, use your hands a little if necessary, but only after its softened.</li>
            <li>I am just blown away by how amazing this product is and how inexpensive it is compared to all the other &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; products on the market that are like it that don&#x27;t work half as well as this...</li>
            <li>The next night I mixed it with water, and found that it mixed a little easier but worked just as good.</li>

            <li>I felt completely at its mercy.  </li>
            <li>I do not recommend using it with the apple cider vinegar to anyone with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Night Oil for Sensitive Skin--</li>
            <li>my face feels sooooo moisturized and soft..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cleans well and leaves your face with a soft, glowing look to it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive combination, adult onset acne-prone skin</li>
            <li>directions call for a quarter inch of packed mud, but if you go that far, you&#x27;re looking at a 45-minute-plus commitment.</li>
            <li>No perfumes, all natural.  </li>
            <li>I mix it in an old hair dye mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>i tried it with the facial mask recipe to remove impurities from my skin, it works very well.</li>
            <li>I  have natural kinky 4a(B) texture hair and this clay made my hair feel so soft and</li>
            <li>Do not put it under your eyes as it is too drying for that sensitive</li>
            <li>I have combination skin that is sensitive.</li>
            <li>I used the sensitive skin time and the apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li>It made my skin soft</li>
            <li>especially I have a very greasy face, i recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>I recomend using natural oils as a moisturizer (coconut or almond oil)  after using this mask since it can be drying if you use lotion.</li>
            <li>I use this on my natural hair after mixing with apple cider.</li>
            <li>or if you become overly sensitive to it, try leaving in on for shorter periods.  </li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and oily and this mud mask seemed to pull out a lot of impurities.</li>
            <li>BUT MY FACE IS SOOOOO SOFT</li>
            <li>My face has a natural glow every time I do</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it once so far</li>
            <li>There should be a warning for sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>After 3 uses I see no improvement in complexion or uniform color, but I still can see the value in a natural product that is an alternative to harsher products for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My acne is almost completely gone</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have generally sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>has just about cleared them completely.</li>
            <li>skin is a bit on the sensitive side so as for the redness, that does happen but as stated in the instructions it goes away in approx.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 22 years old</li>
            <li>I think my skin is too sensitive for this.</li>
            <li>Wow I wish I had known about this sooner.</li>
            <li>Absolutely spa-grade quality facial mask.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even get acne till I as an adult.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all either.</li>
            <li>can definitely vouch for the pulsating effects, as this felt like it was sucking the crud straight out of my pores.</li>
            <li>can definitely vouch for the pulsating effects, as this felt like it was sucking the crud straight out of my pores.</li>
            <li>I have acne prone, sensitive, oily skin.</li>
            <li>but I have sensitive skin and the clay plus apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>My final input is that this product is too much hassle for me.  </li>
            <li>Afterwards, my skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this works on me.</li>
            <li>i have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t noticed a marked difference in my skin tone or texture.</li>
            <li>However, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Use a gentle moisturizer afterwards such as [[ASIN:B00DS842HS Viva Labs</li>
            <li>I also noticed a bit of redness after I completely took the mask of</li>
            <li>I bought the clay to reduce my adult acne.</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s been making my skin feel so soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>When you wake up in the morning, your skin will be so soft.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s, I later saw, had some peeled off especially around her mouth because of facial movements and constant touching of her face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I broke out at like 10 years old</li>
            <li>you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Leave skin incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>all natural cream.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The pimple is completely gone and no redness today.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried virtually everything to control my adult acne and this was another product to add to the list.</li>
            <li>every 3-4 days, it makes my skin really really soft and cleans it, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to treat my acne.</li>
            <li>and this mask has changed my skin completely.</li>
            <li>My skin was so soft and the swelling of the blemishes had diminished.</li>
            <li>Reading the reviews I was able to get the least messiest and easiest way to apply the clay.</li>
            <li>Wow this stuff is fant&amp;aacute;stico</li>
            <li>totally recommend see results fast</li>
            <li>It also makes the mask easier to wash, and boosts the exfoliating action of the mask.</li>
            <li>Birth control cleared my skin completely, but after getting off from it and in my early 20s I started to have hormonal breakouts.</li>
            <li>My skin felt amazingly soft and clear afterward.</li>
            <li>get so much for your money &amp; It actually works.&lt;br /&gt;-Its</li>
            <li>I have bought every clay mask sold old there.</li>
            <li>but it hasn&#x27;t had any effects so far.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and feeling refreshed.  </li>
            <li>if you have sensitive skin (like myself), it does tend to burn in the beginning.  </li>
            <li>also, never use it around your eyes and lips, the skin is sensitive and it WILL cause it to wrinkle</li>
            <li>I have adult acne and the two of these products</li>
            <li>Still a few lumps here and there but mostly smooth once on my skin and rubbed in the circular motion.</li>
            <li>I followed with a gentle facial scrub.</li>
            <li>I will keep on using it because it leaves my face soft (:</li>
            <li>so I only use it on the oily areas and it is very refressing</li>
            <li>product completely blew me away.</li>
            <li>Seems to work really well for both &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; and teenage skin.  </li>
            <li>My hair is natural and sometimes I have a habit of but a lot of product on it</li>
            <li>Besides clearing her skin, it made it baby soft</li>
            <li>How ever this mask is NATURAL and its results are not gonna happen over night.</li>
            <li>I have insanely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I changed the recipe several times, and found that I very suck at that.</li>
            <li>After about 3 weeks of using this mask in combination with Insta Natural Age Defying serum</li>
            <li>I would give five stars, it even came a day early</li>
            <li>I have a sticker placed directly over the directions</li>
            <li>Once I rinse off, my skin is so soft, I finish with a night cream.</li>
            <li>Then with the same scoop I measure out my apple cider vinegar into a bowl, then I add my powder and mix fast as it bubbles.</li>
            <li>I have used this product on clients before and so far none of them reported irritations or sensitivity to the clay mask.</li>
            <li>and when I finally got it I put it on my face and it made my face very itchy</li>
            <li>and I was surprised because I feel like I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>After mixing it and letting it sit (I waited until it was completely cracked, aka &amp;</li>
            <li>You can really see the difference after washing it off even if it&#x27;s only temporary.  </li>
            <li>I also use this as a spot treatment for my cystic acne - it really helps with the pain and seems to even bring them to a head after a day or two or just makes them smaller and disappear quicker.  </li>
            <li>HADN&#x27;T HAD ANY PROBLEM WITH DRAIN CLOGS SO FAR.</li>
            <li>Not for a soft sensitive skinned fellow like me.</li>
            <li>I came across a prescribed professional line called M.D. Forte.</li>
            <li>and you can vent to me about your situation, but I promise this will work for ANY skin type because again it&#x27;s completely natural there are no chemicals..</li>
            <li>My forehead is completely spotless, my nose is spotless, my chin is spotless.</li>

            <li>My forehead is completely spotless, my nose is spotless, my chin is spotless.</li>
            <li>:B00HJD8NLY Vitamin C Serum - Antioxidant Treatment - Natural &amp; Organic - Incl.</li>
            <li>So much so that my nose tightened enough to make my breathing different haha.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t worry too much about the amount, because I save extra in a food storage container.  </li>
            <li>I had to mix with only water because the scent of the vinegar was too much when I tried that option.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions (for sensitive skin), but still got severe inflammation.</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t itchy or smelly whatsoever, the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was to much work to do.</li>
            <li>Plus, the areas in between my healing acne are softer and smoother, with the blackheads around my nose almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling soft and a noticeable glow.</li>
            <li>Though it doesn&#x27;t completely solve the problem (my pores are clogged again within the hour)</li>
            <li>i never had my skin feel so soft it use to be bumpy</li>
            <li>I have suffered from acne since I was 13 years old.</li>
            <li>Very dense so you only need about 1/2 teaspoon for your face and neck.</li>
            <li>and so far my holy trinity is working.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was causing it, and have tried everything natural to get rid of it...</li>
            <li>soak the clay in water for 4 hours and it gets really soft to mix and applies well on the face..</li>
            <li>The facial itself is intense</li>
            <li>I have mildly sensitive skin, so if you do I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to use for face masks, and the only reason I don&#x27;t think I would ever need to buy it again is because it comes with so much product.</li>
            <li>the skin is soft, and I can&#x27;t wait to do it all again.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>So much in fact that I decided to use it again the next night - that was a mistake.</li>
            <li>Leave it on until completely dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling so soft.  </li>
            <li>And it pulls in oils and organic chemicals natural to your skin.</li>
            <li>Wow, where do I start??</li>
            <li>After two uses those blemishes were completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After use, my scalp is completely clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but the clay didn&#x27;t irritate.  </li>
            <li>and my skin is so soft</li>
            <li>wow.  </li>
            <li>if you want to feel old and wrinkled this is the stuff...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s made any improvements to my skin, I&#x27;ve used it twice only because for some reason it makes my face so itchy to the point where I can&#x27;t leave it on no longer than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>We use this for my 12 year old&#x27;s complexion and now it&#x27;s a date routine on Sunday nights.  </li>
            <li>Definitely use it with organic ACV (it doesn&#x27;t mix with water very well).</li>
            <li>The reviews completely sold me.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft and clearer looking.  </li>
            <li>Even my daugher&#x27;s boyfriend likes to use it as he says he likes how soft it makes his skin feel.</li>
            <li>It is all natural as well, I would reccomend trying it out.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to everyone who wants a deep pore cleaning.</li>
            <li>Sensitive skin types should do research before applying.</li>
            <li>No complaints thus far and would recommend.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed a decrease in pore size, but it is still early.</li>
            <li>It made my face really soft.</li>
            <li>Oh wow.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Inexpensive, and natural.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The results, WOW.</li>
            <li>people with sensitive skin, dilute vinegar with water or honey or just use water.  </li>
            <li>I use this product once a week and my acne is completely gone..</li>
            <li>You really just need to apply it like a regular mask.</li>
            <li>, the pulsating thing happens far into the drying process.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin but a friend reccomended this to me...</li>
            <li>It was smooth and and dried even and was a tighter feel on my skin.</li>
            <li>So, sensitive skinned girls, this product won&#x27;t be for you if you have problems with &amp;#34;allergy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Only thing that really got rid of my daughters acne without the irritation.</li>
            <li>And it leaves my skin feeling firmer, soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>ACV is a natural astringent &amp; toner.</li>
            <li>The fizzing action of the apple cider vinegar helps the powder to dissolve fully.</li>
            <li>Using the recommended portion on the instructions makes waaay  too much if you intend on using it as a face mask only.</li>
            <li>I only use it a couple times a week though, because it is very drying and can cause irritation, which is why I took off one star.</li>
            <li>oh my was i surprised at the way it made my skin feel and</li>
            <li>I did get a bit of skin redness immediately after use, but it goes away in a few minutes after I toned and lightly moisturized.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>watch a lot of dermatologist video blogger (Veronica Gorgeois) who recommends using a clay mask that is 100% natural calcium bentonite clay, like this product.  </li>
            <li>I made way too much, and I only used three capfuls (cap from the vinegar bottle) of water and cider.</li>
            <li>My skin was so soft.</li>
            <li>I did not expect the sudden and very noticable results.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re oilier (and the back tends to get very oily--hence the acne problem...)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a waste to try.</li>
            <li>Me and my Mother used it today and it works, afterwards our skin was soft and tighter.</li>
            <li>However, I took the plunge since it is natural.</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>my 14 old son has been using this 1 time a week since we bought it and his pimples seem less..he mixes and apply it to himself and showers it off..</li>
            <li>though I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s done much for the existing acne, I think it may be preventing the breakout from going any further, since it&#x27;s purging my pores each time.</li>
            <li>really help him with facial cleansing and remove acne.</li>
            <li>I just took it off, and my face is soo soft.</li>
            <li>My face glows, and it looks soft, too.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin that can be a bit sensitive.</li>
            <li>I only use around 2-3 drops a night to cover my whole face.</li>
            <li>The only downside in my opinion is it does not absorb quite as fast into my skin as the rosehip oil does.</li>
            <li>They are made from a plant root and another natural ingredient.</li>
            <li>I also feel a bit indulgent every time I use them because of how soft they</li>
            <li>They are made from a plant root and another natural ingredient.</li>
            <li>I also feel a bit indulgent every time I use them because of how soft they</li>
            <li>The powder substance immediately spilled all over my bed and dresser which was totally unexpected.</li>
            <li>I mixed two spoons of the clay with 3 spoons of APV which turned out to be too much for my face and neck.</li>
            <li>old and</li>
            <li>(I just rinse in the shower, so far no clogs).</li>
            <li>Fast forward to today, 15 years later, I ran across this product on Amazon and bought it on a hunch.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that this product doesn&#x27;t come ready to apply.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have had no problem with this mask.</li>
            <li>Rosewater makes your face beautifully soft and it smells divine.  </li>
            <li>No specification on this product as far as how to use it.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, you may have a reddened face after applying this.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin &amp; helps to even out my skin tone as well as decrease blockages.</li>
            <li>The mask really cleaned pores when mixed with the vinegar as described.  </li>
            <li>I did this facial for a week straight</li>
            <li>I marked on my calendar the day I started using it-which was June 3.  </li>
            <li>It stripped my natural oils.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural, moisturizing and cost-efficient.</li>
            <li>About a month ago after having my son, I developed severe cystic acne on every inch of my face.</li>
            <li>I was completely mortified every time I looked in the mirror.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really do anything for my skin, my pores were the same size</li>
            <li>&amp; it made my face soo soft.</li>
            <li>and it closes my pours which makes my face feel soooo soft.</li>
            <li>so I  used it with water - already my skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li>it is a natural spot treatment gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using Witch hazel ( 100% all natural one)</li>
            <li>It is natural.  </li>
            <li>I do not recommend this product if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>After about 2 weeks using it, my face is really soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others (including professional facials) and for the money, and the result you get, there is nothing like the Aztec Clay Mask that I know of on the market.  </li>
            <li>Now that I am an adult</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re wondering how many applications is in the jar, I&#x27;d say at least 20</li>
            <li>Does what it is supposed to do and does not irritate my sensitive yet oily, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>so he knows what I normally look like but now after a few weeks of using it maybe every 3 or 4 days along with my usual acne facial wash my face is looking great.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So far I like this product.</li>
            <li>(No broken skin, please.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned how to make this as a facial from an aesthetician.</li>
            <li>While rinsing it off my face felt SO soft.  </li>
            <li>My pores are noticeably smaller after using this and this has really helped my acne out.</li>
            <li>but my skin is sensitive</li>
            <li>After applying I had a cooling and tightening sensation then it got really itchy after 10 mins and then started to sting/burn, 5 mins left to spare</li>
            <li>I have used GlamGlow and an Origins Charcoal mask as well as this one, and I must say, for my skin (sensitive), I wouldn&#x27;t buy again probably.  </li>
            <li>but I am 33 years old</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not harsh at all on your skin and has no scents so it can be used by someone even with sensitive</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see it on Amazon.com</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much a pound of this stuff actually is!</li>
            <li>It makes my sling feel soft.</li>
            <li>(I do not have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>I am 42 years old and nothing at all has ever worked this well .</li>
            <li>So far I use it once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>early 40s?  </li>
            <li>When I mixed it it became really clumpy.</li>
            <li>but so far I like it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really helps close my pores up, and I only use it a couple of times a month.  </li>
            <li>And regardless a lot use glycerin in their toothpastes which as the effect of not letting minerals settle in the teeth and leaves them sensitive.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>this is a natural product you wont be dissappointed</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by it&#x27;s effectiveness at clearing my problem complexion.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t pulsate much unless left on longer than 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>So natural and works wonders.</li>
            <li>i noticed my zit was almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>adult acne has been a pain in my butt</li>
            <li>I follow up with the Olay 7 moisturizer (I&#x27;m old, haha!).&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to help with adult acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it once so far</li>
            <li>My skin has never been so soft and blemish-free.  </li>
            <li>mix it all together (using my fingers) in a plastic container (With a lid), then I have it ready for the next time.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>So far I have used this mask twice</li>
            <li>My face feels soft from the mask</li>
            <li>I have larger pores and this really helps if I used it once a week.</li>
            <li>It takes me about 15 minutes to get this completely rinsed off.</li>
            <li>nothing has worked completely until I found this product.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve just used water to mix it, perhaps I&#x27;ll try the vinegar method sometime.</li>
            <li>I have always had \\&quot;problem\\&quot; skin and walked into a natural health store.</li>
            <li>It has helped considerably.</li>
            <li>Do not put anywhere near eyes because of the pulling that occurs.</li>
            <li>I do like it so far, just hope the cysts go away soon.</li>
            <li>I have used another brand recently that is ready made</li>
            <li>I have problematic frequent breakouts &#x27;that time&#x27; of the month</li>
            <li>(a far cry from the Tbs recommended on the tub).</li>
            <li>My skin was soft too.</li>
            <li>My brother wanted to use the mask too, so far we both like it.</li>
            <li>You can tell results immediately however when you wake up the next day is when you can really tell.</li>
            <li>I rinse this off in the shower (please use a screen catch in the drain as clogging can likely happen) and after about 15 minutes of redness have much healthier looking and feeling skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect such fast results.</li>
            <li>and I always get ppl telling me how young my skin looks</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft</li>
            <li>You can feel clay in action</li>
            <li>Would not recommend this for someone with sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li>My face really wasn&#x27;t red afterwards.</li>
            <li>I use apricot scrub afterwards, and moisturize with burts bees natural acne solutions moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My 17 year old uses it constanty for his acne.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels softer, healthier and my adult acne is at bay.</li>
            <li>this stuff really does work, I had pimples on my face not big pimples</li>
            <li>i dont even have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have suffered from acne since I was 10 years old.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it works wonders on me.  </li>
            <li>and so far it&#x27;s working.  </li>
            <li>but so far it does tighten and make my skin glow.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a clay mask to use to help clear up adult acne, so I read the reviews and purcahsed this product.  </li>
            <li>I only gave it 4 stars because its really lumpy with you mix it with your liquid of choice.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start this off by saying that I have sensitive, oily, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 20 years old and get a lot of breakouts on my face.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>We were pleasantly surprised at the way our faces felt when the mask was removed.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin clear and soft.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft too which is a bonus.</li>
            <li>Wild Yam Oil - ladies</li>
            <li>Wild Yam Oil - ladies</li>
            <li>It makes me feel like an old aztec warrior.</li>
            <li>I use it as mud wash, leaves my hair soft and moisturize.</li>
            <li>No messy cleanup for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple yet so very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not noticed much improvement with the pores on my nose, but again, that could be because I only use this once or twice a week.</li>
            <li>I am now 43 years old.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and am always looking for something that won&#x27;t irritate me but will work on my oil and blackheads.</li>
            <li>The mask is really stinky if you mix it with vinegar (obviously) but that&#x27;s really the only way to do it.</li>
            <li>And when you take it off, your skin is SO soft.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone, sensitive skin or not.</li>
            <li>face gets a bit red because it really does work.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been using this after I break out</li>
            <li>Though I don&#x27;t suggest doing that if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried this product a couple times so far</li>
            <li>I have a problem with adult acne, so I have tried just about everything.</li>
            <li>Oh and I do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>100% natural</li>
            <li>I am 27 years old</li>
            <li>It is not harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li>With people with adult acne issues, this won&#x27;t solve your problem, but it does help acne heal faster.</li>
            <li>and my hair was so soft.  </li>
            <li>I use the clay for my natural hair kinky texture.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I haven&#x27;t really tried this, but the bf likes to take this with fiber drink and such to absorb the toxins from his insides.</li>
            <li>Ironically, wild elephants know to do this to absorb the toxins they eat from all the foliage in their diet.</li>
            <li>and I used it for the suggested 15 minutes for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My face feels soft</li>
            <li>My hair is natural (no chemical processing).</li>
            <li>(this is my husbands account) and i&#x27;m completely blown away by the results after just one use.</li>
            <li>My face felt soft, but it always felt that way, not any softer.</li>
            <li>(don&#x27;t forget that i cover my whole back</li>
            <li>Completely changed how my pores looked.</li>
            <li>and now they are almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks, I feel like my skin has gotten so much smoother.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my pore size get smaller and how much  healthier my face looks.</li>
            <li>I also read several comments about bath and sink drains being clogged - when I&#x27;m ready to rinse</li>
            <li>While I like the idea that Aztec clay is natural and does not contain harmful chemicals, it was a lot of effort to: 1.</li>
            <li>I rated this product a 5 star because it makes the skin brighter and soft.</li>
            <li>oh so baby soft.</li>
            <li>I leave the mask on for 15 minutes and it leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>The pulse is so strange, but it really works!</li>
            <li>You can literarily see it working now</li>
            <li>so i try it and the next day my face is a wreck, like a real break out.</li>
            <li>As stated above, I have very shiny, oily skin.</li>
            <li>Mixed with the apple cider vinegar, it worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>the old school packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a lot of blackheads even though I am 27 years old and my pores around my nose and adjacent area are too noticeable for my liking.</li>
            <li>If I pick at them, I of course get pimples and it makes me feel like I am forever 15 years old.</li>
            <li>I surprised.</li>
            <li>, I finally used the whole 1lb jar.(I</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>Acv makes u sensitive to uv.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t felt that they really do what they are supposed to, and now I can say they definitely don&#x27;t!</li>
            <li>I tried that tonight and not only did it hurt but it took much longer for</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I leave the mask on for about 15-20 minutes, or until it completely dries.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has lasted me over a year so far</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for sensitive, combination, oily and acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>i mix with apple cider vinegar with mother and completely cleans skin once a week or 2 times if i remember&lt;br</li>
            <li>has nearly healed completely.</li>
            <li>I have yet to feel any &amp;#34;pulsing&amp;#34; but once the mask dries, WOW.</li>
            <li>This clay makes my skin incredibly soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is some redness directly after use, however it fades within an hour or so.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even used it in my natural hair with no problems.</li>
            <li>Im 19 years old</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>My skin was so soft I couldnt believe it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just too much work for me, especially when I didn&#x27;t feel it did anything after use.</li>
            <li>Well it made my skin soft but hasn&#x27;t helped clear up acne or acne wounds.</li>
            <li>It cleanse out my pores a bit and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>Also, I have hyperpigmentation and sensitive skin, this seems to help with my coloring.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend even commented on how soft my face was.</li>
            <li>Was sensitive to touch even the morning after.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The very first time applying the product to my face, it felt like any other clay mask but 2-3 mintues in I could feel the clay drying and tightening on my face, neck and chest.</li>
            <li>My hair had defined curls and felt soft.</li>
            <li>if you are looking for a natural clay mask, this is it.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>Lush&#x27;s Charcoal soap and my acne is almost non existent now.</li>
            <li>she is 70 years old.</li>
            <li>Once the mask was completely removed, I noticed my face was brighter and some spots looked like they were lightening up &amp; healing already.</li>
            <li>YOUR LOCAL WHOLE FOODS cause the one on here is a rip off.</li>
            <li>all you really need is a tiny jar of this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I am 23 years old, and I have been struggling with cystic acne for 10 years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything from antibiotics, to OTC washes, to natural remedies from Pinterest, and nothing has worked for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m nearly 30</li>
            <li>My face felt completely stripped and irritated.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just saying that it aggravated my adult acne</li>
            <li>but once they do, my skin feels so soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Skin feels incredibly soft after each use.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin I recommend not using this product.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and its easier to detangle.</li>
            <li>Maybe my skin is too sensitive for this.</li>
            <li>I leave it on until it completely dries</li>
            <li>It did leave my skin feeling soft but made my skin peel.</li>
            <li>it really provides a deep cleanse.</li>
            <li>in looooooove and its too much i think its last for 100 time of use</li>
            <li>It does make me peel, but sometimes that is what it takes for clear soft skin.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it cleared my face almost completely.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a week, so far it&#x27;s been 3 weeks</li>
            <li>this is the only thing that has really cleared my skin.</li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>but my skin felt soft</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t bode well with my sensitive combination skin.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any issues so far.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t agree, it does help prevent pores from clogging but if you have severe acne or get frequent cystic pimples this does not prevent them at all.</li>
            <li>So far I like it.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and clear.</li>
            <li>I mixed the clay with water, it took 1 tea spoon of powder and one spoon of water to get ready.</li>
            <li>Plus, my my very oily skin is starting to behave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this twice so far</li>
            <li>So far I hav noticed any changes</li>
            <li>are almost completely  gone when i remove it</li>
            <li>My skin is really soft after and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a mostly 4a natural ( o and s for Lois system)</li>
            <li>I have some adult acne on my chin area.</li>
            <li>Im 19 and have suffered acne since my early teens.</li>
            <li>The whole time it ranged from moderate to severe.</li>
            <li>, I guess I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin</li>
            <li>came off in the shower with no problem, did not clog my sink, And my face feels soft.</li>
            <li>(I will be doing possibly 4 days straight ).</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Follow the instructions and use the organic Apple Cider Vinegar to get the tingling, pulling, cooling action - I used it on face, neck, arms and legs (which is what she told me she is doing, per a nutritionist).</li>
            <li>I have a naturally oily face.</li>
            <li>the headache isn&#x27;t worth the 5 extra seconds it takes to fill a bowl to dump outside</li>
            <li>some days it&#x27;ll clear it up, sometimes it won&#x27;t; my skin&#x27;s also pretty retarded and bipolar, so it could be just me) but as to general deep cleaning and firming, it&#x27;s awesome!!</li>
            <li>I had been using Glamglow, which I liked a lot, but was so expensive for how much you got that I wanted to find a replacement.</li>
            <li>I do see minimal change regarding smile lines</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>I would recommend, but use it carefully because it is so powerful.</li>
            <li>blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;the product also turns out pretty chunky when you first mix it; however, letting it sit in an airtight container or bag for a while (few hours, days, whatever works) makes it smoother.&lt;br /&gt;all</li>
            <li>It also has vitamins, fatty acids, and omega 3s that your skin needs to build healthy skin - I especially like that.  </li>
            <li>maybe 8 times (and wasted most of it each of those times, even only using a Tablespoon each time) and</li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of application, it is messy like most clay masks so just pin all your hair back</li>
            <li>a dozen facial scrub seemed to only be worth the trash</li>
            <li>My skin was left dried out so most def.</li>
            <li>Love the suction feeling and pores seem to be smaller after just a few uses.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll do it a few more times and then do a follow-up review if I have anything else to add.the same way: it just means its removing a layer or two of your skin.</li>
            <li>it drys like all facial mud and feels crackly but is worth the time use of 1 time or 2 times daily</li>
            <li>For the quantity it is worth the price as it will last a while to finished the entire thing.</li>
            <li>I bought it to help with my acne, so hopefully a few more times will show some results with that, although if all it gives me is smaller pores and softer skin</li>
            <li>This was well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>I even let the water run a few extra seconds to make sure its plenty rinsed.</li>
            <li>used only once so far, but my face felt cleaner and it was more clear after the mask, the only thing I didn&#x27;t really like is it is so messy, I would recommend taking off with a moist papertowel, otherwise it gets everywhere and might even clog the sink.</li>
            <li>Repeat with a fresh wet towel until all mask is removed.</li>
            <li>i bought this product because of all the good reviews and wonder what in the world am i doing wrong when i used this on my face because for one it doesnt do what it says it should.</li>
            <li>(just enough to mix it into a nice, thick paste)</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s better not to put too thick of a layer on.</li>
            <li>It made a lovely, thick paste which I then applied to my face.</li>
            <li>Actually, better, because when I put it on thick, pieces of it would fall off my face.  </li>
            <li>and they all have their own bottles of [[ASIN:B0014P8L9W Aztec Secret - Indian Healing Clay, 1 lb clay]].</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s as good as the expensive masks.</li>
            <li>I like to take a bigger bowl and fill it with warm water and then grab a rag and slowly take off the mask</li>
            <li>Unfortunately the good reviews had me fooled.</li>
            <li>is slowly but surely clearing up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>we loved it, but it can be difficult to wear for the time instructed.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and large pores and wasn&#x27;t really seeing results OR feeling the &amp;#34;pulsing&amp;#34;, so I made a small adjustment to the mixture (a teeny bit more ACV and a teeny bit less clay) and am finally feeling and seeing what this mask can do!  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty large container of a dry clay powder which is reconstituted with water or it suggests apple cider vinegar so in reality the giant tub you receive is doubled in amount of product.</li>
            <li>It took me a while to get the amount right as I always put too much or too little.</li>
            <li>I have tried many things, but this is my answer to getting my face to feel subtle and very soft.  </li>
            <li>When i purchase this product i did not have any high expectations, i just wanted to try a new facial mask for my face and stumbled upon this product and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>The mask really helped at first, but I kept breaking out, so I went down to using it twice a week.</li>
            <li>Every time I mix mine, I use really hot water but its still super clumpy and hard to blend.</li>
            <li>The first couple of times I used it, it left my face a bit pink, but the more times I have used it, the less my skin seems to react this way.</li>
            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t been this clear &amp; pretty in a LONG time!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just because my skin is super sensitive (very acne-prone)</li>
            <li>If you mix it just right not only will you feel pulsating and tightening, you will feel as if your face has moved( such as your lips puckering)</li>
            <li>I had a giant pimple right in the middle of my forehead.</li>
            <li>I wash my face with Clean and Clear liquid foaming cleanser, I use CVS astrigent for sensitive skin, facial scrub by Equate, 100% African white shea butter and or Hollywood Beauty tea tree</li>
            <li>Works beautifully with aging, complicated skin (dry and acne).</li>
            <li>smearing it on for coverage is enough and it took the full 25 mins to dry with a fan.</li>
            <li>Face (n pores) looks clean after and feels tight..</li>
            <li>It helps keep my skin tight and my pores clean.</li>
            <li>It works well, my skin felt tight and really clean after use.</li>
            <li>My face feels so clean and tight after.</li>
            <li>After one use, my skin in brighter and my pores are CLEAN and TIGHT.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this product for a lot of reasons, one of which is due to the relief I felt when I realized I didn&#x27;t wind up being a total sucker.</li>
            <li>Now understand this; each and every one of us have different skin type, different circumstances and many other variables</li>
            <li>I was excited to use it, but a little nervous.</li>
            <li>There are sooooo many other internal and external benefits.</li>
            <li>Within 20 minutes, my skin was back to its normal color and my pores were practically non existent!</li>
            <li>I mix it with other things like green tea extract and sometimes a tiny bit of apple cider vinegar if I want a good purge of my pores.</li>
            <li>I put it on, a thin layer, and use a very warm, wet wash cloth to remove it.</li>
            <li>Where the mask was thicker, were barely pink right after removal.</li>
            <li>It took a couple tries to get the right consistency</li>
            <li>The water is harder to mix and it ends up being clumpy, but the vinegar makes it glide right on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strange the first time you do this, you may have a metallic taste in your mouth when this is accumulating.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strange the first time you do this, you may have a metallic taste in your mouth when this is accumulating.  </li>
            <li>I get occasional little pimples and on rare occasions, I&#x27;ll get a cystic pimple (I suppose this wouldn&#x27;t do much to help with those kinds anyway) and I didn&#x27;t really notice this help with my acne very much as I&#x27;ve seen other reviewers say.</li>
            <li>EVERY single black and white head I had was sitting on the top of my face ready to be washed away.</li>
            <li>I peeled off a large chunk of it from my face, and i could see little oil stains on it, it really did draw out the oil/gook from my pores!</li>
            <li>Only downside-- 1lbs for $10 when its 2lbs for $7 at other retailers with free shipping.</li>
            <li>It has really helped with my complexion, more radiant, less breakouts and black heads on face/nose.  </li>
            <li>My pores are small, my face is smooth and soft, and my acne marks are fading!</li>
            <li>in all my pores are smaller and its a cheap alternative to the other clay masks out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use my regular daily cleansers, but I&#x27;ll use this product as a mask every two weeks or so to get that deep clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been breaking out like crazy due to stress and my dr put me on antibiotics which had me incredibly dizzy for a week!</li>
            <li>As I let the product dry, I felt exactly what the product description said I would.</li>
            <li>(figured I would try that first and then see if I needed the apple cidar vinegar) and then after rinsing off and patting dry, I applied organic unrefined shea butter (which I also purchased on here) on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>tried even more extreme methods like chemical peels, and even spent $750 on a 6 week session of microdermabrasion.</li>
            <li>I just think it&#x27;s easier to use other face masks that are already mixed into the form ready to apply and also find that other face masks leave my face feeling kind of the same</li>
            <li>nose gets pretty dry, flaky, and I have eczema.</li>
            <li>My nose of course was the first to dry so you could feel the tingling/mild burning sensation.</li>
            <li>Normally my skin would breakout all around my chin area, after using the mask about every other day for the first couple of weeks</li>
            <li>I leave it until dry and by then I am ready to take it off!</li>
            <li>My skin is so much smoother, my pores are so clean and my skin is hardly oily at all.</li>
            <li>My face feels refreshed afterwards, when I do a full face mask I typically wash it off in the shower and apply a hydrating cream afterwards.</li>
            <li>Since it is a strong mask, I usually use it once a week.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, but not amazing as every other review that I read.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it made a difference on my pores because I would definitely need to get 10x mirror magnifier, but I don&#x27;t see huge difference on the large pores that I can already see.  </li>
            <li>I made a major mistake with buying Walmart brand pink grapefruit cleanser instead if putting out 8 more bucks to get the Neutrogena pink grapefruit cleanser.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and the tingling sensation you feel on your face is pretty cool.  </li>
            <li>It does get tight so be aware that it really, really tightens the skin and takes some time to wash off.</li>
            <li>I live in the French Quarter(old pipes, old septic system, old everything!)</li>
            <li>clean up - soak the towels in hot water, then lay it over your face for 10 seconds, then slowly drag the cloth down your face.</li>
            <li>Good bye high end expensive facial products.</li>
            <li>I tried some of the most irritating and powerful acne serums, but still had generally had mixed results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to try it for the other uses as well!!</li>
            <li>Thick paste on your face will take a bit longer to dry, but the point in this mask is to when it even dries you keep it on for a little bit more time while its magic is still regenerating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Every time I stop using it my pores get bigger and when I use it they shrink, but seriously THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING.</li>
            <li>made my skin more or less oily or dry.</li>
            <li>I put my usual moisturizer on and within 15 minutes, it was back to normal but super soft and REALLY</li>
            <li>Worked just as it is said to, made my face feel so clean and soft after a few days of use</li>
            <li>its strong and leave it only for 20 minutes less</li>
            <li>For someone who has up and down skin conditions, it is heaven to hear this!don&#x27;t end up with super oily skin.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it it was a little intense</li>
            <li>It mixes much better with the apple cider vinegar than water and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, so you will get way more facials than the description says.</li>
            <li>2 min apply and no mess.</li>
            <li>And the effect lasts for pretty much the entire day, maybe even partially into the day after that.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t just try to rub it off unless you want your entire dermis to go with it, I would suggest taking a wet towelette and holding it on your face for a while to soften the clay first before wetting the cloth again and using it to gently rub it off.</li>
            <li>its gross but at the same time its cool because you actually know it is working!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it did make my face extremely sensitive and red the next day but after a couple of uses, that went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I discontinued use of all of my other products and just use this clay mask, Aveeno face lotion, and fresh lime juice as a toner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit messy but definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>When I opened the lid, there was no mess.  </li>
            <li>After using the healing clay for a few months, I have noticed my skin has cleared up significantly</li>
            <li>No mess.</li>
            <li>Your skin will get better after the first few uses!!!!</li>
            <li>I recommend Aztec Secret most highly.</li>
            <li>My breakouts were a little more serious than minor but not exactly dreadful.</li>
            <li>The entire week in new york I didn&#x27;t use this mask and I didn&#x27;t break out ONCE!</li>
            <li>The entire week in new york I didn&#x27;t use this mask and I didn&#x27;t break out ONCE!</li>
            <li>/&gt;****Wet entire face with a hot rag (just hold it there for a few seconds and gently press down) before removal to loosen the clay and a warm, wet rag</li>
            <li>skin feels super soft and the pores appear tight.</li>
            <li>skin feels super soft and the pores appear tight.</li>
            <li>Another thing that I was not super thrilled about was how tight it gets on your face as it dries.</li>
            <li>i suggest use when going some place special or a little time before a bath</li>
            <li>I recomend not being cheap and buying Braggs raw organic apple cider to use along with it *</li>
            <li>Starting last year after switching to a new birth control, I really broke out all over my face.</li>
            <li>only do this once a week because my skin is pretty normal and do not want to dry it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m left with incredibly smooth and soft skin and my pores are considerably less noticeable.</li>
            <li>Its sort of a messy clean up as well because you dont want it getting into your drains.</li>
            <li>(so my hair doesn&#x27;t feel dried out and brittle) and leaves my hair looking fuller and so so clean.</li>
            <li>My face felt smooth though dry and the next day it even felt smaller</li>
            <li>It comes in a fine powder, which she mixes into a paste that she applies onto her skin using a small paint brush when using as a mask.  </li>
            <li>Ok, so let me start out stating that this product works, it works ridiculously well.</li>
            <li>I will say this is easier to clean off in the shower as it can get a bit messy for the sink.</li>
            <li>My face seriously has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>It may be slightly messy to clean up</li>
            <li>Too messy to clean up in your home.</li>
            <li>it leaves my skin soft and clean my pores are really small afterwards although the skin is red its very temporary.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve tried other clay masks from my beauty supcription boxes that run for about $35 for less product, this actually works better!</li>
            <li>Once my 20min were up, I went to my bathroom, grabbed a few sensative babywipes and turned on the hot water and gently cleansed off the clay.</li>
            <li>I Have been using the mask for about a month, and have had no deep cyst pimples and the small ones are beginning to look better.</li>
            <li>The first time, I mixed it only with water because I was still waiting for the organic apple cider vinegar to come in the mail.  </li>
            <li>I washed it off before it had all dried completely, but my face had started to tighten, which is a cool feeling.</li>
            <li>I used a washcloth and warm water to rinse my face, and immediately saw where a few of my recent breakouts had reduced in size, and the dry skin which sometimes scabs up around the area of a zit was gone and healed.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s a bit of a stretch if you&#x27;re a long time acne sufferer to assume this mask will magically heal you in a few days&#x27; time.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s a bit of a stretch if you&#x27;re a long time acne sufferer to assume this mask will magically heal you in a few days&#x27; time.</li>
            <li>Same really red face as the first time, and</li>
            <li>Same really red face as the first time, and</li>
            <li>First value-for-cost is terrific, especially compared to drug-store and department-store competitors.  </li>
            <li>I used it last night for the first time and my skin looks younger and fresher this morning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money and the 1lbs jar should last a long time.  </li>
            <li>I mainly use it to fight acne in 2 different ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Did my first facial last night</li>
            <li>I did, however, spend many long minutes in the shower trying to get the dried stuff out of my hair.</li>
            <li>first I didn&#x27;t get the whole face pulsating thing, just thought as the mask dried</li>
            <li>I mixed it with apple cider vinegar the first time I used it and noticed tighter skin and a big reduction in blackheads!  </li>
            <li>My sister and I are sharing it, and by looking at it, it will last a long time, so definitely worth the money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As I have gotten older my pores have gotten larger.</li>
            <li>in all, this product is only worth the price because of how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I used this product as a facial, I mixed in apple cider vinegar.  </li>
            <li>This is the first deep pore mask that actually does what it says and&lt;br /&gt;I could feel it working.  </li>
            <li>One small tub will last more than a year.</li>
            <li>Since adding this two months ago, I have had maybe two pimples that went away quickly, and my blackheads are way, way less noticeable and fewer.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t feel &#x27;pulsating&#x27; but it definitely was sucking my skin to the point where my eyes and lips looked bigger.</li>
            <li>I use this particular brand to give to my dog, along with topical usage (skin issues, baths, etc.).  </li>
            <li>I use this only when I feel like I&#x27;m breaking out more than usual</li>
            <li>: I recommend mixing it with water in a small skilled bag and then simply applying to skin with hands on skin.</li>
            <li>After the first application her face was definitely smoother and the days following</li>
            <li>you make the mask the first time it does take some time, but if you save the extra from the baggie the next application is quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Using just water, the mixture is pretty lumpy and thus more difficult to apply.</li>
            <li>mixed it water since it is my first time using it and planning to use cider vinegar the next time I use it to see if there are any difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the first use I promise you will notice a decrease in redness and irritation and if possibly you will have already gotten smaller pores.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This clay makes your curls pop like nothing else, just add a tsp or so to your favorite conditioner and deep condition as usual.</li>
            <li>My method was pretty simple, just put water and some clay in a plastic bag and rub the bag so the contents are completely mixed all over the surface area of the inside of the bag, turn the bag inside out, and apply.</li>
            <li>My family had been using this product for over 20 years to pull infections out of BIG and small wounds/bites :) we wouldn&#x27;t be without it</li>
            <li>I have mild occasional acne and dry/ combination skin, and just after one use, my pores were noticeably smaller THE NEXT DAY.</li>
            <li>(Im sure it would go on a little smoother but Idc about that as long as my acne is gone!)</li>
            <li>Mainly, I use this once or twice a week as a facial mask.</li>
            <li>Two days later after initial application, I developed a large cystic like acne on my neck near my face.</li>
            <li>Your face might feel a little dry afterwards so be sure to apply face lotion.</li>
            <li>Most of the time I have to take it off before it is completely dry because, it starts to hurt a little bit.</li>
            <li>Your face will get red after use, it wil only last about 30 minutes, but your face will be left clean, so soft and it even removes blackheads!</li>
            <li>This might work for people with little tiny blackheads that are very mild</li>
            <li>was very skeptical when I first heard about it and read so many positive reviews here.  </li>
            <li>I was very skeptical when I first heard about it and read so many positive reviews here.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t dump the clay down your sinks though, many reviewers have mentioned it causes issues and</li>
            <li>Use it at night since if you are pale like me, it leaves your face pretty red right afterwards.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;ve finished applying I IMMEDIATLY scoop out what&#x27;s left and put it in the trash (so the clumps don&#x27;t clog my drain) and wash my little bowl and whatever I used to mix with down the sink making sure to use soap and plenty of hot water.</li>
            <li>I still get some acne, and my 11 year old daughter is getting major acne as puberty begins.  </li>
            <li>I had several really vivid red marks and those have really lighten up through my use of this clay.</li>
            <li>I have always had major skin problems since I was young girl</li>
            <li>mask does pull really hard on your skin, so I strongly advise not to put it anywhere near your eyes.</li>
            <li>My face is so red and tight after using this because I can actually feel my blood being pulled to the surface on top of everything else it draws out.</li>
            <li>The other reviewers are right - Use it with apple cider vinegar and you&#x27;ll see the difference.</li>
            <li>Right now, I can tell you it is unlike any other mask I have EVER put on my skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend keeping a bottle of this in the house for multiple uses.</li>
            <li>My hair was definitely clean and soft after, but the big surprise came later when it was dry.</li>
            <li>We had such high hopes for this clay.</li>
            <li>highly recommend using apple cider vinegar with this vs only water.  </li>
            <li>I mixed this product with apple cider vinegar, I highly recommend using that with it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to use a deep moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li>There are clay mask out there that comes with such a high price tag</li>
            <li>Short of using a blender, I am not sure it can be mixed to a smooth, consistent, spreadable texture.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for multiple uses.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this a couple times a week to deep cleansing.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for a facial as well as use in a detox bath (1 cup clay, 2 cups cider vinegar, and 2 cups epsom salts or epsom and</li>
            <li>Feel free to enjoy the paluse feeling as long as the clay surface is still dark green and in chunky pieces.  </li>
            <li>Feel free to enjoy the paluse feeling as long as the clay surface is still dark green and in chunky pieces.  </li>
            <li>Afterward, my face was slightly red but my pores instantly felt smaller and my skin looked VERY VERY CLEAR!!!!</li>
            <li>This stuff does not mess around, it truly purges your skin and can be alarming at first.  </li>
            <li>First few times all it did was make my face super dry</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently pregnant and all the hormones have made a mess of my skin.</li>
            <li>It does Dry up pretty quickly on your face and it can be messy taking it off.</li>
            <li>Most people freak when they break out worse when using a new product.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to make too much of you&#x27;re new to this stuff.</li>
            <li>In fact, I just bought a new jar after having the old one last for 16 years.</li>
            <li>In 3 days my back was clear!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes so little to make up enough for one application, I&#x27;m sure that the one pound jar will last me quite some time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the apple vinegar is totally an acting agent with helping but out of every mask and acne product I have ever used, this is the only thing that has ever shown the fastest results and gotten rid of those mountainous zits in a speedier manner.t&#x27;s still a little puffy</li>
            <li>This does major wonders for my hair, skin, and teeth!</li>
            <li>Spread over clean, dry face, let dry.  </li>
            <li>It really does pulsate, and it really will freeze your face into whatever position you lie in for half an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m talking apply way less makeup the next day - smooth.</li>
            <li>Anyway I applied it liberally in that area, and also in the eyelid crease and lightly on about the upper half of the eyelid itself.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised, it did dry up fast.</li>
            <li>and it sucks up too much oil, too quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely will firm your skin, but is strong.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it on the frequent to know of its true effects, but the first time i did use it, it dried out all my existing pimples!!!</li>
            <li>how much but too much clay makes it too hard and too much water makes it too watery.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also not very messy.</li>
            <li>I have extremely oiy skin with very large pores and being 42, I have tried everything to address these issues.</li>
            <li>I took antibiotics, had a special shampoo to wash with and the infection on my upper back would not clear up.</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel SO soft and my pores were noticeably smaller and very clear.</li>
            <li>Product left my skin very sensitive, think twice if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I used it with the Bragg Organic Apple Cider Vinegar, mixing it in a small bowl to a whipped, smooth consistency and keeping it on in a thin layer until all parts were dry (a good time to shave your legs).</li>
            <li>So, I mixed up a half cup of the clay with equal parts aloe vera juice (for best PH level) little by little until it had a pudding-like consistency.</li>
            <li>So the first time I used this , my preteen daughters and I got little salsa bowls and our apple cider vinegar from the kitchen and headed upstairs to the bathroom, I grabbed a older foundation brush</li>
            <li>Love how much my pores have reduced,my blackheads are all but gone and I&#x27;ve not glad a single white head.</li>
            <li>have extremely huge pores, and oil pours out of them excessively.</li>
            <li>This made 3 different skin types soft, shiny, soft, and clear.</li>
            <li>One bottle lasts a long time, its very potent.&lt;br /&gt;--Make</li>
            <li>Which should be the minimum time given for any product to really do their job as it takes a long time for skin cell turnover.ess for some people?</li>
            <li>Which should be the minimum time given for any product to really do their job as it takes a long time for skin cell turnover.</li>
            <li>And I am switching over to foxbrim vitamin C lotion natural moisturizer on my face instead of the bare minerals to see how that works.</li>
            <li>It takes soooooo long and so much water to get it off.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin clean and soft in less than ten minutes.</li>
            <li>Just know how much and how long you wanna keep it on your face.</li>
            <li>It just really really really itches if you leave it on too long.</li>
            <li>so no more free or discounted stuff for me :&amp;lt;</li>
            <li>so even though I generally get it from the manufacturer directly I went ahead and ordered it to have on hand.</li>
            <li>Very drying so don&#x27;t leave on too long.</li>
            <li>I have only had a chance to use this once so far, but I&#x27;m already wondering why in the world I&#x27;ve been paying as much as I have for GlamGlow, Arbonne and other masks that don&#x27;t do nearly as much as this one does in one use.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper to make my own mask out of the same ingredients used in the expensive tubes of clay mask.  </li>
            <li>Apply as much paste as you can on your face and let sit for as long as you can!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Take a small ceramic ramekin (2 inch) and a popsicle stick to stir and smooth out lumps with apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li>This and a bottle of apple cider vinegar are more than enough to last for a few months.</li>
            <li>I woke up an hour later barely able to open my mouth because it dried up on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>normally I have to get a facial for it to come out.  </li>
            <li>The directions say redness is normal and should last about 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>The directions say redness is normal and should last about 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I use it as a full facial and shower it off, and other times I mix a minute quantity and just dab it on blemishes -</li>
            <li>I instantly followed up with my normal Ponds moisturising cream.</li>
            <li>I must say, I didn&#x27;t expect anything when I tried this clay, but I definitely saw a difference from what my hair normally does.</li>
            <li>but like it says in 30min will go back to normal..</li>
            <li>I am very much excited to start my first review with AZTEC SECRET INDIAN HEALING CLAY.</li>
            <li>I read that it was normal for your face to be red.</li>
            <li>so its def something to use at night to give your face time to go back to normal color.</li>
            <li>first time I used this I was so excited, but when I saw that it was a powder, I was a bit confused.</li>
            <li>exactly what I expected yay thank you</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know enough about clays to know if that is normal or not.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you are back to normal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this masque consistently (every two days) and now those scars are a distant memory and those clogged pores are no longer there.</li>
            <li>for my skin to return back to normal.  </li>
            <li>it was back to normal.  </li>
            <li>There is nothing more embarrasing than having red inflamed spots build up on your face as you watch it slowly destroy your confidence and ultimately, your face.</li>
            <li>I use it with organic apple cider vinegar (1/2 tbsp each) and I wash my face with cetaphil normal skin facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>Your face will be red afterwards, it&#x27;s normal, it&#x27;s the blood being pulled to the surface of your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Your face will be red afterwards, it&#x27;s normal, it&#x27;s the blood being pulled to the surface of your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I would be back to normal.</li>
            <li>My skin looked pink at first and got progressively redder...</li>
            <li>It was alarming at first, but I&#x27;m use to it now.</li>
            <li>This can be alarming at first, but rest assured that the redness *</li>
            <li>This can be alarming at first, but rest assured that the redness *</li>
            <li>I guess this is normal since this is a deep pore product so it cleans, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I know that it&#x27;s normal for your face to turn red after taking off the mask</li>
            <li>It actually made my skin look &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; opposed to the oily look I normally have.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t cleanse with your normal cleanser after rinsing this off just let it do its job with regular water.</li>
            <li>I use a flat paintbrush to apply the mud and a hot washcloth to remove it twenty minutes later.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I broke out but that was to be expected because of everything it was pulling out of my skin.  </li>
            <li>That evening or the next morning I return to my normal routine.</li>
            <li>It actually looks normal.</li>
            <li>I used this as a full face mask a few times and didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>This morning I only had to put a small amount of BB cream and a very light amount of powder on my face (I am considering looking into home-making natural makeup as my next project).</li>
            <li>The dry powder requires no refrigeration, and will certainly stay fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Afterward my skin felt tight and smooth but, my cheeks are really red and looked almost burn.  </li>
            <li>This product help clean deep into my pores, The reason why I gave it 4 stars is because the only thing I didn&#x27;t like is the smell of the product on your face, especially you have to go out of your way to get Apple Vinegar Cider just for the item to actually work on your face compared to using water.</li>
            <li>skin care routine is very low key -- I use Bioderma and Neutrogena face wipes to take off my make up (only on days that I wear make up), then I use the clarasonic mia and cetaphil daily face wash to clean my skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff helped to slightly, this isn&#x27;t a miracle mask, reduce the appearance and that&#x27;s after the first use!</li>
            <li>I had a little redness afterwards but it went away quickly.</li>
            <li>Sounds like a dumb thing to say, but the directions on the jar are very accurate.</li>
            <li>Lift, Firm, Tighten Facial Skin and Fade Fine Lines - 1.5oz]]</li>
            <li>is becoming less oily.skin never went dry</li>
            <li>and this helps calm my cysts down .</li>
            <li>It took weeks to get it to calm down after using it once.</li>
            <li>I promise it&#x27;s worth driving down to the store to buy apple cider vinegar (I use braggs).</li>
            <li>The first time I used this I noticed how soft my skin was but had a few new breakouts after use.</li>
            <li>However, if you only want to use it on a certain portion of your face and you use it sparingly, you could easily double this usage.</li>
            <li>I usually put this mask on right after I take a hot shower to open up my pores and this product will pulsate and the vinegar will sting you</li>
            <li>I guess ancient Aztecs, fleeing the crushing defeat of Spaniard conquerors, took only the essentials: such as, their Indian clay recipe and a goat for milk, keeping the secret safe for future generations of oily-skinned men such as myself.</li>
            <li>never had \\&quot;trouble\\&quot; skin except large pores &amp; they&#x27;re starting to get smaller -</li>
            <li>This may sound a little gross but this dirt or &amp;#34;clay&amp;#34; literally sucked out the blackheads on my nose &amp; on my face.</li>
            <li>Once it dries, you can gently peel it off a little bit at a time, or scrape it off gently.</li>
            <li>first time I used it I was waiting for the mask to dry completely, which isn&#x27;t necessary-</li>
            <li>If used consistently as directed the skin will be less likely to breakout, but if not, the whole process must happen again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You get THE EXACT same results in the tightening of your pores as you would with the typical method of letting it sit until it&#x27;s all cracked and ready to wash</li>

            <li>I have used sodium bentonite for face masks and it&#x27;s really hard to apply as it tends to ball up and not spread easily.</li>
            <li>I have absolutely no more acne and the scarring is fading away fast!!!</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s a very THICK mask, it&#x27;s best to just hop in a shower, whereas a thin mask may be washed off at the sink.&lt;br /&gt;6.</li>
            <li>I bought this product simply because nearly every single review was stellar.</li>
            <li>Also, due to the light, powdery nature of the dry product I recommend holding your breath when opening the lid.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I use this and we can see the black heads and other guk rise to the top of our skin in a day or so.  </li>
            <li>the only down side is that it took more than 30 min for the mask to dry.</li>
            <li>I have only used this twice, but judging from other reviews, if it&#x27;s going to work it works quickly, and that was not the case with me.</li>
            <li>It cleaned my face, when it dried I loved the feeling of the hard clay cracking.</li>
            <li>used different clay masks before ranging from very low price to very high.</li>
            <li>So my new objective was to shrink my pores.  </li>
            <li>I deep conditioned after and my hair has new life to it.</li>
            <li>and recently I was in New York for about a week and didn&#x27;t get to use the mask at all.</li>
            <li>and recently I was in New York for about a week and didn&#x27;t get to use the mask at all.</li>
            <li>This product is definitely one of those I can&#x27;t live without.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t ever use this during winter months, especially if you live up north.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m hesitant to try new things on my skin, especially on my face.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m hesitant to try new things on my skin, especially on my face.</li>
            <li>Using all of the above has cleared up my skin and are preventing new ones</li>
            <li>A day later I had 4 new blemishes.</li>
            <li>My pores are smaller, acne size is reduced and amount of new acne forming is reduced after using it.</li>
            <li>so you may see new pimple development subsequently</li>
            <li>Makes an incredible face mask when mixed with ACV (don&#x27;t use water, it clumps)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels tight and a little weird when using but worth it!</li>
            <li>I will probably have to use this product a few more times to actually see distinct results because I am currently on antibiotics and using some other facial products.</li>
            <li>pulsating/tightening is really noticeable the longer the mask is on and starts to dry up.  </li>
            <li>Your face really does pulsate once it begins to dry</li>
            <li>My skin is noticably smoother, its helping to dry acne much faster than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I never thought of it, but it is reducing my scarring by at least 80% - and very, very quickly.</li>
            <li>I never thought of it, but it is reducing my scarring by at least 80% - and very, very quickly.</li>
            <li>I think I probably put too much on because as it started to dry, I looked like a golem that was falling apart.</li>
            <li>I have found cocunut oil has really helped me since my skin is dry from a laser procedure.</li>
            <li>When dry, I put my face under the surface of the water and rub gently with my hands and it comes off in the water.  </li>
            <li>This mask starts to dry fast</li>
            <li>My face is really itchy and I just can&#x27;t wait for it to dry</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin around my t-zone, and the rest of my face is fairly dry.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin glow but also makes it feel dry for a day no matter how much moisturizer I use.</li>
            <li>The idea of dry granules and adding liquid at each use sounded like a promising solution.  </li>
            <li>have oily skin so this really helped dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>This clay mask is the real deal, as the mask began to dry on my face, I could feel the tension and pulling.  </li>
            <li>I always mix this with apple cider vinegar when I use it, and you really will feel your skin pulsate as it starts to dry.</li>
            <li>Gently pat dry your face &amp; apply coconut oil &amp; massage</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting a whole lot from this, especially as I&#x27;ve tried what feels like everything for my acne prone skin for the last 15 years.</li>
            <li>I went through a period of acne when I first started using it, but it didn&#x27;t last long...</li>
            <li>My facial muscles felt very relaxed as well as if i did went to a spa and did a deep pore cleansing facial,so i gave another star for that.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>I used it last night and still this morning, my fast is red and burns when I wash it.</li>
            <li>I recently straighten my natural hair (naturally curly) and my hair was severely heat damaged .</li>
            <li>I only kept it on for ten minutes, but this stuff still did so much for me.</li>
            <li>My skin is red for about 30 minutes after, but not a big deal because it doesn&#x27;t hurt or look unusual.  </li>
            <li>Just now getting around to reviewing because I just recently started using it and the one I put based is no longer available so it would be a waste to leave a review on that</li>
            <li>You could definitely get this at your local whole foods store for around $6</li>
            <li>When I apply the clay straight to my face, it makes my face get red, especially as I wash it</li>
            <li>I am 20 years old and still have issues with my skin and am constantly looking for something to clear out and help my conplexion.</li>
            <li>it left my skin soft and clear.</li>
            <li>After I wash it off, my face is a bit red for a few minutes, but extremely smooth.</li>
            <li>Did the facial and definitely felt something, don&#x27;t really know if it works, I&#x27;m not one of those health nuts that will praise the stuff</li>
            <li>I am left with dewy, smooth, firm face.  </li>
            <li>I always remove it within 10 minutes - just 5 isn&#x27;t enough time for it to try much but anymore would leave me very red.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-reduce white heads with proper gentle exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although i don&#x27;t use it everyday like i should, i really enjoy the deep cleansing treatment of this product.  </li>
            <li>I suffered from a massive breakout and had lots of bumps, zits, and scars that left my face very blotchy and red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will take a few more tries to get used to it on my face.  </li>
            <li>So far all i can tell you is my skin is soft, and rather red.</li>
            <li>Bottom line is this mask actually works for pore cleansing and it is really the only product I&#x27;ve used that does.</li>
            <li>to know how much should I put on my face so that the mask won&#x27;t crack within the first few minutes?!</li>
            <li>I picked this up at my local Whole Foods after reading several reviews.</li>
            <li>After my skin feels so soft and not dry at all.</li>
            <li>(you only really need about 1.5 or 2 tbs max) of the powdered Aztec clay in a zip loc bag and then added equal parts Apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li>I just recently went out and purchased a pound from a local Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>But how much would you expect from such a low price clay?</li>
            <li>The Aztec Secret has thus far given me more noticeable results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you put it on thick, parts of it are easy to scrape/peel</li>
            <li>I am really glad that I read majority of the good reviews, I had terrible acne and blackhead</li>
            <li>It did feel like my face was totally drawn up when it was drying, kinda weird feeling but good, like it was tightening everything</li>
            <li>My hair is so thick and strong.</li>
            <li>I use it again to help drain out whatever is left (since it pretty much always opens up the pimple after taking the mask off)and then if it&#x27;s still a little puffy or I just want it to scab over and heal even faster, I&#x27;ll use the mixture one</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I rinsed it off, my face was much more tight, closed pores, and felt fresher!</li>
            <li>It can be very, very drying, especially if, like myself, you are also applying topical acne medications like clindamycin and retinoid cream at the same time.</li>
            <li>My skin was very soft and the pores seem smaller.</li>
            <li>Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, and Leven Rose Jojoba Oil, Organic 100% Pure Cold Pressed Unrefined Natural.  </li>
            <li>More is not necessarily better, remember, the clay removes EVERYTHING from your skin - the good and the bad.  </li>
            <li>Lets see how my skin reacts with general usage!</li>
            <li>everytime i broke out,after useing the clay the next day my skin was almost clear!</li>
            <li>Your pores are open and clear!</li>
            <li>My sister was going thru a major hormonal acne phase.</li>
            <li>I have to use it in conjunction with other things; first, I scrub my skin with an exfoliant.</li>
            <li>The blackheads have been loosened and suctioned up enough by the mask that the strips can completely finish the job!</li>
            <li>It deep cleans and makes my skin sooooo soft!</li>
            <li>but after I rinsed it off and all through the next day, my skin felt baby soft!  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m just an impatient person and that&#x27;s a long time for me to not be able to open my mouth or talk.</li>
            <li>Not sure what this stuff is actually doing to my skin, but using it once a week has definitely resulted in fewer zits and better skin tone and texture.  </li>
            <li>First I want to say that, I am not a \\&quot;paid\\&quot; reviewer, as I once also doubted it about the the other reviewers.</li>
            <li>However, the other reviews of this product&#x27;s effectiveness are stellar, and that&#x27;s what convinced me to buy.  </li>
            <li>Testing all kinds of products on my face is a major part of my work, and I&#x27;ve done some hair brained stuff to it.  </li>
            <li>since i&#x27;ve used it, i&#x27;ve seen major improvements in my skin</li>
            <li>Since it was my first time , I only left it only about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t fit my oily skin at all!!</li>
            <li>#34;can&#x27;t move your face at all without splitting it&amp;#34;) and then washing it off (which as other reviewers have noted,</li>
            <li>and I must say that this clay mask works like no other.</li>
            <li>and if you don&#x27;t see major improvements, email me or contact me somehow</li>
            <li>and if you don&#x27;t see major improvements, email me or contact me somehow</li>
            <li>I did not notice a difference after the first, second, third, fourth, or fifth use.</li>
            <li>I have major acne prone skin</li>
            <li>The 4th reason is pretty important to me &amp; those who suffer from something similar or maybe worse.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve only done this mud wash twice so far!  </li>

            <li>I seen a major difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I found the first time I made way too much and made it far too thick.</li>
            <li>I used it every other day at first, and after three uses (about a week,)</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and usually when I wake up in the morning my face is pretty oily, this morning, my face was no where near as oily as it normally is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a blush brush to apply the mixture, I didn&#x27;t want to get it all over my hands</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, was exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I mixed it with a generic brand of apple cider vinegar, and my face got really red and itchy after I rinsed the clay off.</li>
            <li>This product, on the other had, does exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li>First use made my skin extremely itchy.</li>
            <li>I noticed a major improvement in my skin&#x27;s clarity, suppleness and even a firmer tone.  </li>
            <li>The first time I left this on, I left it on for 10 minutes and it essentially burned my skin.</li>
            <li>: if you&#x27;re not careful, you can clog your sink with this!</li>
            <li>: if you&#x27;re not careful, you can clog your sink with this!</li>
            <li>I am a ceramics major, so I know how clay works.</li>
            <li>Left my face really soft!</li>
            <li>Ill try to be more presistant with it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time using this clay was a week ago &amp; the last two times was back to back</li>
            <li>My New Year&#x27;s resolution is to do this mask at least once a week to get the full benefits long-term.</li>
            <li>This product not only came right when I expected it</li>
            <li>I had spent equal parts of the  day on my feet and falling repeated on my right forearm and hip.  </li>
            <li>Once I rinse, I make a concoction of jojoba oil spiked with lavender essential oil to calm it down and this ritual has helped clear up and beautify my complexion.</li>
            <li>spots(the spots apply several times per day at first), let dry for 35 mins and rub of with dry washcloth, or soak of sore areas with wet cool wash cloth.</li>
            <li>skin type is pretty dry - if I don&#x27;t use enough moisturizer it gets oily in efforts to make up for the lack of moisture -</li>
            <li>He ended up wearing it the full 20 minutes and was only complaining of slight itching around his nose.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels really tight and fresh after I used it the 1st time.</li>
            <li>It feels like your skin is being pulled tight, and you cannot smile or move your face.</li>
            <li>As some other reviewers have noted, nothing drastic happened the first week, if anything I felt like I was breaking out more, but after the clay pulled everything out of my face, it calmed down, was smoother, and less oily.</li>
            <li>using [[ASIN:B001I7MVG0 Bragg Apple Cider Vinegar Organic Raw -- 32 fl oz]] (mixed up WAY too much, 1/2 cup of each, maybe even less, would have been MORE than sufficient).  </li>
            <li>No issues with it so far, except the mess (that&#x27;s expected, you&#x27;re basically playing with fine dirt).</li>
            <li>I first noticed this product because of the almost absurd number of great reviews and I was skeptical at first, but after trying it I feel like I might&#x27;ve just jumped on the bandwagon too 😊</li>
            <li>I then wet several soft paper towels with warm water and wiped it off slowly, throwing all of the chunks into the trash.</li>
            <li>vit E. Skin will be a little red ,100% clean.</li>
            <li>and it took my black heads right now also</li>
            <li>I mixed it with raw organic vinegar and it made my face feel so clean and soft.</li>
            <li>while it leaves my face glowing it has a very funky smell, also remember to moisturize after you put it on because it can dry out your skin!</li>
            <li>I have never had cystic acne, but I have always had many black heads and white heads, as well as closed comedones.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this felt any &#x27;tighter&#x27; or &amp;#34;pulsing&amp;#34; than any other I&#x27;ve used and involves more messy preparation.  </li>
            <li>it could be due to the loss of top dead skin</li>
            <li>It is a slightly messy product to use compared to a pre-made mask, but i will say it works better than any other pre-made mask iv used.</li>
            <li>According to some other reviews [ and believe me i read a novel&#x27;s worth before i broke out my ten bucks ], you aren&#x27;t supposed to mix with metal because it&#x27;ll react with the vinegar.</li>
            <li>I used it with few drops of cider vinegar and mix thoroughly and used as masque, better than other items you bought at stores which I tried before I switch to this.</li>
            <li>Dont use as much as the container says (it recommends 1/4 - 1/2 inch thick) and dont be freaked out when your face is super red after washing it off.</li>
            <li>Compared to the other clays I&#x27;ve tried this is the thickest when rinsing off and you must apply a thick layer for the clay to be effective.</li>
            <li>I tempted to buy this due to good reviews; however, my skin broken out after used this product twice.</li>
            <li>Then I get a big serving bowl and fill it will HOT water and use a face cloth to steam the mud loose to where it is easier to wipe off.  </li>
            <li>I waited the full 20 minutes and washed off with warm water and then very cold rinse.</li>
            <li>I mixed it with raw unfiltered ACV and it does bubble up and become smooth.</li>
            <li>It worth in this price, will have little oil spot came out.</li>
            <li>I use Bragg&#x27;s apple cider vinegar and I add more of the clay rather than the half to half ratio</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a month already and my skin has gotten better with less black heads and zits.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several different masks and face packs, including most recently the Shea Moisture African Black Soap cream mask.</li>
            <li>I found the less skin care products I sue, and the less ingredients they have the better my skin looks.</li>
            <li>I found the less skin care products I sue, and the less ingredients they have the better my skin looks.</li>
            <li>Make my face clean and stuff, but it&#x27;s does get kind of annoying when trying to take this stuff off your face, since you can&#x27;t just wash your face in the sink, because it will clog it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only bought 2 before this but will keep doing it because its amazing and very natural, especially when I use raw apple cider vinegar for half the liquid.</li>
            <li>I use two teaspoons of each clay powder and ACV, because I&#x27;ve found that the mask DOES work better if you put it on very thickly.</li>
            <li>My daily skin routine consists of first cleansing with Cetaphil Gentle Face Cleanser, to using Trader Joe&#x27;s Organic Raw Honey as a mask for about 10-15 minutes, and then mixing Apple Cider Vinegar along with the Aztec Clay powder to wear as a mask for about 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>used organic apple cider vinegar, and I&#x27;m not sure how much of a difference that makes, but I wanted to use pure ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I am a 33-year old Black female with problem skin, and this stuff right here....is a miracle worker.</li>
            <li>Comes in large tub and the powder you mix with water or vinegar will last a long time.</li>
            <li>You have to work so hard to get this on smoothly without putting clumps of clay on your face.</li>
            <li>I am currently deployed and my skin is super dry and was not soft.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and my pores are so tiny that I can barely see them!</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and my pores are so tiny that I can barely see them!</li>
            <li>so I followed the treatment with a full facial steam for 20 minutes and then applied a little chilled aloe vera gel before going to bed.</li>
            <li>Also, I had to pimples that were kind of sore and raw near my lip, and they have dried up and are no longer red.</li>
            <li>I am not sure what is it so special about this product.</li>
            <li>This is the only problem that I&#x27;m having right now, other than that.</li>
            <li>but overall the experience for a high end facial</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone and everyone, and my teenage nieces can&#x27;t wait for our next girls night to try it out!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even need to use the whole little dish, so I popped the lid on and it sealed the moisture very well for the next use!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little messy the first couple of times, but once you learn how to mix it, it&#x27;s not bad (the clumpiness is a pain though).</li>
            <li>I made way too much mask the first time, and it hardly made a dent in the tub of clay</li>
            <li>I have extreme problem areas with acne on my chin, and this product has dried them up right after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I smear it down just below my jaw line so it can get the top of my neck where I get little bumps sometimes.</li>
            <li>My  skin gets super red and tight afterward.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a powder that you have to mix with either RAW Apple Cider or Water (I&#x27;ve heard you can also use Cranberry juice if you have SUPER oily skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and other than the temporary redness afterwards, this is gentle enough for me!</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and then searched the internet for other reviews, everything looked positive.</li>
            <li>I am hopeful that continued use will reveal other positive changes to my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certain that this tub will last me a long time!</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t like the smell of vinegar in general anyways,</li>
            <li>The clay DID tighten and refine pores in general, however.  </li>
            <li>OILS - I use 2 drops of each oil and generally use 1-2 oils per mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a woman, or I guess for anyone in general having skin issues on the face can lower your self-esteem.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting regular facials to try and clear my skin but to no avail.</li>
            <li>Not only did this clear my skin</li>
            <li>Made my pores smaller but didn&#x27;t really clear up my blackheads.</li>
            <li>I finally saw a dermatologist that helped clear up about 75% of the acne I already had.</li>
            <li>It has cleared up those bumps and had left my skin clear and glowing.</li>
            <li>This clay will clear all your acne, blackheads, white heads, cystic acne, and tighten your pores.</li>
            <li>It definitely helped clear my clogged pores.  </li>
            <li>It definitely seemed to clear up my skin and tighten it.</li>
            <li>My pores are getting smaller &amp; my face is clear of any pimples.&lt;br</li>
            <li>; the next times I simply put on a layer that was not stingy but not thick</li>
            <li>This is a very generous amount for the price and will surely last a long time.</li>
            <li>100 Facials in 1 bottle (even though the description on the back says about 10-15), keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li>second time I used apple cider vinegar, hoping to clear my blackheads.</li>
            <li>I ordered this to help clear out my pores,  especially in my T-zone.</li>
            <li>It helped clear my skin up after only two masks.</li>
            <li>But by the second week of using this, my face began to clear up.</li>
            <li>After putting it on my blackheads a second time my nose was COMPLETELY clear-</li>
            <li>After putting it on my blackheads a second time my nose was COMPLETELY clear-</li>
            <li>I used this product last week and my face has been clear.</li>
            <li>i pulled through it though and its starting to clear out.</li>
            <li>It has always left my skin smooth and any breakouts disappeared usually within a day.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry about the smell, after you get past the initial gag reflex, it&#x27;s smooth sailin&#x27;.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re seeking clear skin, LOOK NO FURTHER.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s with average skin and never had THIS kind of acne before.</li>
            <li>for my mostly clear skin with some deep clogging on areas like nose and chin, it didn&#x27;t do anything whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Even if my skin would clear from one pimple, another one would spawn shortly afterwards.</li>
            <li>my skin feels so soft after using and my pores look smaller.</li>
            <li>After I gave birth to my first child, my skin erupted in horrible cystic acne that required months of oral and topical antibiotics to treat (I had flawless skin prior to pregnancy, even through my adolescence</li>
            <li>but so far I&#x27;ve only used it on my face.</li>
            <li>My 15 year old son suffered from acne the last 2 years.  </li>
            <li>If you make too much it will mildew so to prevent this put it in a bowl with a lid and store any unused wet product in your freezer.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and it did not leave me red at all!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a burning sensation at all, which I was worried about since I have such sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product since 2/15 (7 days) only skipping once so far</li>
            <li>Then I use a wet face towel to gently wipe along the hairline.</li>
            <li>My 15 year old son has teen acne and once I had him convinced he gave it a try</li>
            <li>I was so surprised to see my shipment left at my front door one day.</li>
            <li>As far as its effectiveness as a facial mask, it does its job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m in my mid twenties, been suffering mild/aggressive acne since my early teens.</li>
            <li>I have only tried the mask once so far.</li>
            <li>I barely have acne.</li>
            <li>and they have reduced in size to where you can barely see them.</li>
            <li>Completely got rid of blackheads and my skin is definitely softer and clearer.</li>
            <li>I bought it it to help get rid of blackheads, which it barely did.</li>
            <li>Then I got in the shower, wet my hair and started squooshing it in, section by section, from root to tip, until my whole head was done.</li>
            <li>next day, my skin was SO soft.</li>
            <li>next day, my skin was SO soft.</li>
            <li>I completely followed the directions (mix equal parts) and added 1/3 cup of the clay to 1/3 cup apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li>I could feel this pulsating action and the skin was noticeably different after once</li>
            <li>Nearly 12 hours later my skin is STILL squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve barely put a dent in it</li>
            <li>And this has kept it under control so far, and after about the third time using it, has brought out smoother skin that i have not felt in years.</li>
            <li>and there really isn&#x27;t any different results from my basic facial cleansers.</li>
            <li>that said, I&#x27;ve only used the product once so far (just got it tonight)</li>
            <li>My 9 year old only uses it on her chin, where she is prone to blackheads.  </li>
            <li>Works really well but be careful when you use it.</li>
            <li>Then 2 weeks later, my skin completely dries out and feels like sandpaper after I wash my face.</li>
            <li>My skin is feeling baby soft, but it is still red after 20 minutes of the mask being off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a brown skinned woman early forties who has found that from time to time I need a stronger facial cleaner and this product is it.</li>
            <li>You will still get the same cleaning effect, but your skin will look far nicer afterward.</li>
            <li>You will definitely not regret this modest purchase that will pay off so beautifully!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have barely put a dent into my supple.</li>
            <li>I use bare minerals makeup again and it helps a bit.</li>
            <li>recommend this product for everyone who would like a natural way of deep cleaning your skin.</li>
            <li>I completely forgot I ordered this and pulled it out last month</li>
            <li>Natural Anti-Wrinkle, Facial Lift Skin Care Formula - 1.5oz]]</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve barely put a dent in it so</li>
            <li>I actually bought this because of the reviews, and so far the product has done its work.</li>
            <li>but wow I can appreciate a deep cleaning on my face since I work in healthcare</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive but the only reaction I have</li>
            <li>Recently I have been researching DIY mud masks, and this product was mentioned frequently.</li>
            <li>Love this product and I recommend it, there is no reason for buying expensive creams to clear your skin, even my 18 year old daughter is using it twice  week</li>
            <li>sometimes the clay falls off before it dries completely (and you go through the product faster, which isn&#x27;t necessary).  </li>
            <li>It is all natural and it&#x27;s the cheapest thing you&#x27;ll find that actually does its job.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t believe this piece of crap got such great ratings unless the company has really changed</li>
            <li>Natural is the ONLY way to go in way of skin care, some people might disagree with my there, but</li>
            <li>Not only has this saved me lots of money, but I have almost completely rid myself of my skin irritations.</li>
            <li>and when I opened it I was not careful</li>
            <li>So as a 22 year old female college student, I break out here and there(usually stress or hormones).</li>
            <li>Really dries out your skin to the point where it drinks up all of your moisturizer, but that&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li>so busy that I forgot about the facial</li>
            <li>, it won&#x27;t rid of them completely since mine are very deep</li>
            <li>but like I said I could definitely feel a difference in how soft my skin was afterwards.</li>
            <li>Only used it once so far</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 21 year old male, college student.</li>
            <li>is completely healed by the next day.</li>
            <li>is completely healed by the next day.</li>
            <li>The only mask to use for sensitive, acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that it makes my inflamed acne disappear overnight, but it definitely makes my skin feel really soft.  </li>
            <li>Gently press the wet paper towel against your face with your hands to allow water to seep into the mask.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>Expected a ready to use product.</li>
            <li>I barely ever had acne.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this product once so far</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a 27 year old, female.</li>
            <li>My skin feels baby soft and it&#x27;s spa quality for a tiny fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, I would recommend you use water, because this will turn your face red.</li>
            <li>This did not irritate my sensitive skin - Very deep cleansing</li>
            <li>Apparently MY face can take the burn</li>
            <li>Makes your skin really soft and definitely clears up pores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been one to do facials since my skin is so sensitive, but I wanted a product that would give me the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well to start off I am a 24 year old female...</li>
            <li>I did this with 50/50 vinegar and water, and I cannot remember the last time that I had skin this incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li>I was thinking about going to a spa to have a facial to have them professionally removed.</li>
            <li>The clay will get stuck in your drains if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>Too frequent of use will hinder its healing effects, it doesn&#x27;t get proper time to do the healing.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I haven&#x27;t used it enough to be wow&#x27;d.</li>
            <li>Last night I had a breakout near my lip.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a chronic pimple picker, so I got up close and personal with a mirror and examined nearly every pore I could find.  </li>
            <li>Then I took it off with a wet rag and put on a gentle moisturizer</li>
            <li>I leave it on about ten minutes per the labels suggestion for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Because I feel like I could have got this much much sooner than the expected arrival</li>
            <li>In this case you will not waste product or end up making another batch because you didn&#x27;t make enough.  </li>
            <li>and it just doesn&#x27;t have the same WOW factor.</li>
            <li>I barely get oily skin throughout the day anymore.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this once and so far</li>
            <li>Tried this from a friends recommendation and felt my pores open up considerably.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smear it all over my face each time, just every third time so far.</li>
            <li>This is very upsetting for me, since I have spent a ton of money trying to get rid of acne, and just got close to succeeding when I decided to try this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 28 yr old female with oily breakout prone skin.</li>
            <li>I wish someone would have told me about this product a lot sooner in my journey to grow natural hair, because I truly feel I would be a lot further along than I am now.</li>
            <li>I actually put jojoba oil in it once a day (and wow my face brightens up)I get up</li>
            <li>As a facial mask, it&#x27;s quite refreshing and leaves you feeling transformed... at least for the short term.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only tried mixing it with water, not apple cider vinegar yet.</li>
            <li>it tightens your face to the point where you can barely speak.  </li>
            <li>However, be careful with too much use.  </li>
            <li>There were barely anymore bumps on my chin</li>

            <li>my teenage daughter developed some age-related acne, this product worked wonders for her.  </li>
            <li>It was recommended to use with apple cider vinegar, which I did, and not only did it smell out my entire house (and scare my 6yr old son), but it did nothing to clear up my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have only used it on my hair so far</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently mixing with ACV and lemon juice to fade an old tattoo.</li>
            <li>But makes it feel soft the following day.</li>
            <li>Have only used it once so far</li>
            <li>As an educated consumer, I am continually on a quest to find natural products/remedies for various things; especially when it comes to skin care as I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve used this item as both a facial mask and on an insect bite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>By this morning, you can barely even see it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed an improvement in my complexion within 24 hours and after three days of use the acne cysts were nearly invisible under makeup (which included a yellow blemish cover stick).</li>
            <li>SO FAR ONLY BOUGHT 1..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming the stresses of a transitioning adult figuring life out finally took a toll on my skin.  </li>
            <li>You can scratch your face if not careful.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only used this product twice</li>
            <li>I have only used it a couple times so far</li>
            <li>The first time, I don&#x27;t think I left it on long enough.</li>
            <li>it left my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this only once so far - on my face.</li>
            <li>This product unclogged pores that a professional facial could not.</li>
            <li>However, on my hair (4c natural) I would only recommend using this once a month.</li>
            <li>Also, I used regular old apple cider vinegar but will use organic in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it exfoliates as well as deep cleanses so your skin will be as soft as a baby&#x27;s when you use this</li>
            <li>The burn was similar to a sunburn, and took a couple of days to completely fade.</li>

            <li>B00VSF4T26 Skingenixx Complete Exfoliating Facial Cleanser!]]</li>
            <li>Only used once so far.  </li>
            <li>I am 21 years old, male.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 23 years old and my skin took a beating from teenage acne.</li>
            <li>Has overall helped to brighten my skin and help lighten some old acne scars</li>
            <li>Because of his sensitive skin we&#x27;ll only do this one a week.</li>
            <li>left it on for about 10 minutes, since I have sensitive skin, and washed it off in the shower.</li>
            <li>Very deep cleaning and loving the way my skin has been feeling lately and also how closed</li>
            <li>Left my face red, but the jar says that is normal.  </li>
            <li>But the next day, my face what back to normal (almost as if I hadn&#x27;t even used it).</li>
            <li>And yes, your face will get a bit red, but it lasts for about 10 min for me then back to normal.  </li>
            <li>I used this product maybe everyday for the first week and then every two or three days ever since then(it&#x27;s been almost 2 months so far</li>
            <li>ahead, use this ancient beauty secret and enjoy your glowing skin!</li>
            <li>I also found while applying, trying to add more to thin areas, it kinda removed what I had already put on, smeared it off to the point I could see my skin.  </li>
            <li>(didn&#x27;t make it better or worse).</li>
            <li>I discovered Aztec Secret 10 years ago and was glad to find I could order it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>A thin layer works just as well :)</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ll give it one more try &amp; see if it makes it worse or</li>
            <li>the top was broken so about 1/3 cup was in the b ox</li>
            <li>I applied a really thick layer the first time, and didn&#x27;t see much results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it isss extremely messy but its worth it.</li>
            <li>Do you know if you see worse results before it gets better?  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a cool product that I&#x27;ll probably be using for the next few years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not great, it&#x27;s not awful.</li>
            <li>By the time your week is up you notice your skin looking kind of sad</li>
            <li>Yes it is messy but for how well it works, it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I read that it gets worse before it gets better</li>
            <li>OK the worse is over after fanning my face for 30 minute</li>
            <li>Its better to apply it thinly</li>
            <li>If you make a thick layer it&#x27;ll start drying out fast at the edges first, which results in pulling on the skin on the edges.</li>
            <li>id say you should exfoliate after you use this stuff, and it will get worse before it gets better.</li>
            <li>just remember it&#x27;s gotta get worse before it gets better ...</li>
            <li>I have researched and found that these clays can make your skin worse before it gets better because it is drawing out toxins.  </li>
            <li>That was the most frustrating part for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of uncomfortable to have on for me.</li>
            <li>Can be somewhat messy, what what isn&#x27;t that&#x27;s worth doing these days?</li>
            <li>had some hormonal acne that was slowly going away with light glycolic acid peels, but I wanted faster results.</li>
            <li>I can feel it working its secret Magic on my skin.</li>
            <li>Its a bit messy but worth it.</li>
            <li>think take a small finger full and put it on my face and then move it around in a circular motion as this helps to break up the clumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i have more breakouts and my acne scars look much worse.</li>
            <li>Do little bits at a time to get the right consistency.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Around the edge of my face burns a little after I take the mask off but the coconut oil soothes it right out within a minute or so.</li>
            <li>(I get little bumps sometimes from the dry climate and my razor) and it made them completely smooth.</li>
            <li>It is not hard to mix, and isn&#x27;t as messy as it could be (sticks to stuff, but doesn&#x27;t really drip).  </li>
            <li>I had to buy little disposable bowls and spoons to mix this with as it comes in a powder form to be mixed with water and hardens quickly.</li>
            <li>I was a little alarmed to read on the label, not just once but twice, in bold uppercase red font, that you will FEEL YOUR FACE PULSATE</li>
            <li>I really think it comes down to your face and how sensitive your skin is.</li>
            <li>Cannot rinse this down the drain, as it is truly mud, but worth the extra work.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not willing to put in the time to mix carefully and clean up afterwards, stick with a pre-made mask in a tube.</li>
            <li>Exactly what the other reviews said!</li>
            <li>it does dry, tighten (and make it look like your pores are smaller until you shed that dry skin), and deep clean skin.</li>
            <li>it does dry, tighten (and make it look like your pores are smaller until you shed that dry skin), and deep clean skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like magic, it seems to suck the nasty bacteria right out of these huge, cystic zits I WAS getting.</li>
            <li>but it sucks the white heads right out of my face as unusual as that sounds.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much to make a mask so this jar will last a LONG time!</li>
            <li>Went in the doctors office and found out i had stage 4 terminal cancer and only 30 days left to live.  </li>
            <li>I have had a jar for years, as it takes very little and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>it certainly isn&#x27;t torture like other reviewers describe it..</li>
            <li>I have extremely oily skin and large pores on my face.</li>
            <li>I used half Braggs apple cider vinegar and half water, applying with a brush, and it left my face soft and I was able to extract some white heads and sebaceous filaments after removing it.</li>
            <li>, otherwise it won&#x27;t dry fast enough.)</li>
            <li>But in my opinion Nox is better and less messy.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t last the whole time till it gets dry</li>
            <li>it sucks them to the surface for easy removal gross</li>
            <li>and the next day, I had very irritated, itchy dry skin</li>
            <li>The hormonal kind that sucks your confidence into a black hole.</li>
            <li>You can make this up to the consistency you desire; I like it about the consistency of heavy cream, but if you like thinner or thicker, add more or less</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s less messy and smells better</li>
            <li>The smell is also super annoying because you are using vinegar on your face, but I didn&#x27;t buy this to smell nice.</li>
            <li>I mean, the price is really cheap, so why not?</li>
            <li>My skin is flawless and I haven&#x27;t used any of my other harsh chemical products, including expensive peter Thomas Roth acne face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It takes a few times to learn how to get the texture just right.</li>
            <li>I also recommend using this right before a shower, as it is a messy pain to rinse off.</li>
            <li>Several hours after taking the dried mask off, most of the pimples calm down and start receding a little.</li>
            <li>It makes a huge mess using this stuff no matter how careful you try to be</li>
            <li>but now I now I use it every 4 to 5 days and only for ten minutes and it began to clear off my acne instead of breaking out !</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t over dry my skin normally.</li>
            <li>til its all dry (normally around 15 minutes)</li>
            <li>til its all dry (normally around 15 minutes)</li>
            <li>Please be aware of slight bubbles when you add the apple cider vinegar to the clay.</li>
            <li>I had black heads on my nose and even after the first use it pulled all the dirt and grime out.  </li>
            <li>I normally leave it on for 10-15 minutes (until it&#x27;s mostly dry</li>
            <li>mix with straight Bragg&#x27;s ACV (with the mother!), and I prefer a slightly thinner consistency.  </li>
            <li>so tie your hair back but remember it washes off and does not typically leave any stains.</li>
            <li>About me:  Black female, mid 20&#x27;s, mild occurrence of pimples.  </li>
            <li>I could see exactly where the mask was due to the red lines.</li>
            <li>BUT.. THIS product in particular is for everyone and doesn&#x27;t present different, adverse effects on different skin types.</li>
            <li>i tried using it as a hair clarifying masks as many other naturals do, it worked well, but i&#x27;m too lazy to keep up with it</li>
            <li>the first time around, and I do different treatments with other things throughout the week.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a total mess, but worth it.</li>
            <li>As the package says, for the first 30 minutes or so after taking this extremely tightening mask off, our faces were red.</li>
            <li>this super fine powder w/o getting clumps in a bowl is really hard, like-REALLY, REALLY HARD.</li>
            <li>it will never dry!</li>
            <li>My skin was toned, no dry patches of scale skin, no horrid break outs!</li>
            <li>I honestly can say that this product works for me , I was a little skeptical at first though.</li>
            <li>and I only need a little bit for my entire face, like 1 tsp full</li>
            <li>My face always feels a bit tight and dry after use, but also clean and exfoliated.  </li>
            <li>Then wait for it to dry, remove with water and feel how tight and clean my skin looks after.</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t completely remove the gunk in your pores (especially in your nose), it&#x27;ll definitely lift it out partially, so just rub the skin gently after you use it</li>
            <li>So in essence, this is not some magical zit-b-gone product, but with a few uses, your face will naturally start to clear because it acts like a magnet and causes the gunk to surface slowly over time.  </li>
            <li>This facial clay does clear pores, but is hard to apply in just one even layer without ending up with a face full of chucks of mud.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this for people with normal skin who are looking for a limited ingredient</li>
            <li>Usually I can just get all the last bits of the mask out of the scoop with my finger, leaving the scoop almost totally clean, then just wipe the chopstick off on a body part to get all the excess off.</li>
            <li>Well, it made the bumps lay down for a few hours (which was exciting at first because I had no idea they&#x27;d pop back up) and it kinda \\&quot;hid\\</li>
            <li>(my face was too tight to crack a smile) because I had a picture of a vacuum sucking the air out of a space bag) when I looked in the mirror</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll clean my face and hardly works</li>
            <li>Everything that&#x27;s been said regarding the extreme suction, and pulsating face, etc, is absolutely correct.</li>
            <li>I also have hyperpigmentation issues and noticed that this clay doesn&#x27;t really help at all with any scarring but the other clays do.</li>
            <li>recipes are endless, but this is a miracle product, it really does wonders to the skin just after 1 application, try it out!&lt;br</li>
            <li>But as for the product, I like, I really hope it gets rid of my blackhead&#x27;s , the other pic is a close up of my nose.</li>
            <li>I have used other high end masks and this surpasses them all-Great buy!</li>
            <li>It was not as stingy as some of the other reviews said, but it had a very tightening effect.</li>
            <li>Other than that it doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot.</li>
            <li>One star off for how hard it is to clean up.</li>
            <li>Maybe after some prolonged use, I&#x27;ll see a long lasting effect on this front; but what it does do instantly is completely shrink your pores to the point of them being nearly non</li>
            <li>The first time around I used water and it was a lumpy mess.</li>
            <li>Read all the reviews and was so excited to try this on my skin which has been breaking out lately.</li>
            <li>However, if your acne is extreme, the real solution is the dermatologist.</li>
            <li>Like any other clay face mask really.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other stuff for the face before like Mint Julep but the mud really works.</li>
            <li>On my other daughter who doesn&#x27;t have much acne, it seemed to irritate her skin a bit.  </li>
            <li>Then I put it on with an old flat foundation brush.</li>
            <li>I like this stuff - Its very cooling as it dries, and tightens up as it dries almost at an alarming rate!  </li>
            <li>Leave it on long enough to feel your skin really tighten, pores look smaller after washing off.</li>
            <li>I was getting a lot of them like 6-7 very close to each other.</li>
            <li>I tried various acne medications with little success.  </li>
            <li>and I plan to use and purchase this mask for as long as I am alive!</li>
            <li>super inexpensive and will last forever considering you only need a little bit.</li>
            <li>The deep cleaning leaves my face glowing and smooth and I have hardly had any breakouts since I have started using this a month ago</li>
            <li>It gets extremely tight and can get somewhat hot.</li>
            <li>It gets extremely tight and can get somewhat hot.</li>
            <li>i feel so refreshed after using this product, leaves the skin so soft and smooth, and kind of red for a little bit, but not too bad with my skin.</li>
            <li>The mixture comes out nice and creamy using half vinegar and half water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to other reviews, before I ever opened the container</li>
            <li>The Healing Clay was better than all the other much more expensive anti-acne type products that I had wasted my money on before trying this.</li>
            <li>I have used it to dry up new baby&#x27;s umbilical cords.  </li>
            <li>I use it with apple cider vinegar (the smell is not great but the results are worth it!!).</li>
            <li>Makes a mess in the tub, but it&#x27;s fairly easy to rinse down the drain</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling so fresh and new, and my blemishes slowly started fading away.</li>
            <li>It does get very very tight as it dries, and its a fun at home spa treatment you can do by yourself, or with your friends.</li>
            <li>I thought it was too cheap to be good, but boy was I WRONG!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so shocked at how great this product is in just the short time that I had</li>
            <li>was surprised because I&#x27;m so used to masks stinging my face, but it was VERY soothing.. and as it dried I could feel the &amp;#34;pulsating&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This stuff really helped clear a few problem spot on my face.</li>
            <li>My blackheads have seriously diminished and my skin feels soft and clean, like I&#x27;ve never felt in my entire life.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have terrible acne, but hoped this could give me a great deep clean occasionally, so</li>
            <li>Pimples are less inflamed, less red, and it even seems that it helps with post blemish hyperpigmentation (those lovely spots that linger after a pimple- varying shades of brown, red, purple etc</li>
            <li>Not only did it clear my blackheads and tightened my pores in one week&#x27;s use, it also brightened my skin, and makes me look 10 years younger!</li>
            <li>Much easier, and as long as it&#x27;s covered in an air-tight container it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I am currently &amp;#34;Team Natural&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m always looking for &#x27;natural&#x27; products to add to my daily routine.  </li>
            <li>Use a soft paper tower or bunch of facial tissues to remove the mask and wash face after what&#x27;s left.</li>
            <li>As an African American with natural hair, I use this as a hair mask.</li>
            <li>What I did was soak a wash cloth and press it against my face until the mask was all wet again, then I used the same wash cloth to gently buff the clay off.</li>

            <li>and there, I really wanted something to shrink my giant, be careful not to fall into one of them, pores.</li>
            <li>Wholesome product that&#x27;s natural, and actually works as a once in a while, quality facial.</li>
            <li>Just enough for complete coverage and not enough for it to be caked on and dripping</li>
            <li>Just enough for complete coverage and not enough for it to be caked on and dripping</li>
            <li>but I used it on my hair once and it completely dried out my normally straight and silky hair and made them completely unmanageable.</li>
            <li>yep, all of that worked for a couple hours then back to the old giant pores.</li>
            <li>; I&#x27;m a 25 yr old female, been suffering from Type 2 - Moderate Acne ever since puberty</li>
            <li>After one use, my pores appeared smaller and left my skin soft, not dry feeling.  </li>
            <li>I am 27 years old and have been suffering from moderate to servere acne since a teen.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I was somehow allergic to a component or if my sometimes sensitive skin overreacted,  or if perhaps it dried my skin out too much.</li>
            <li>Since my adult acne has worsen in the last 5 months, this was my last effort before accutane.</li>
            <li>(I have African American natural hair)</li>
            <li>My boyfriend and I tried the mask, since my skin is so sensitive I mixed the clay with equal portions of aloe vera and water.</li>
            <li>What I really noticed was how firm and soft</li>
            <li>(Product reviewer: Female, 22 years old, long-term moderate</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it takes a decent amount of time to dry, but it works quite well on my oily skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once, but my pores are smaller and my skin feels soft.</li>
            <li>my pores are much smaller and i only used it one time so far.</li>
            <li>I use organic apple cider vinegar to mix for an extra kick and I use the mask every night, but if you have sensitive skin, start off using water to mix it and only using it twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I left it on for about 20 minutes and not only was my face extreme;y soft, but my pores were the smallest I&#x27;ve ever seen them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve definitely never gotten such an immediate smoothing and softening affect from a mask before, so I like it so far.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still not completely dry.</li>
            <li>This does not dry your skin out nor break out.</li>
            <li>In order to make this mask clay powder into true clay, I suggest starting with two to three tablespoons of water and adding a small amount of powder, and then mixing.  </li>
            <li>However, it says to apply 1/4-1/2 in layer, I find a thin coating is more than enough</li>
            <li>It actually made my acne scars worse and standout more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, do try it if you know your skin isn&#x27;t sensitive, and even if you hate it, you only spent 10 dollars at most :)</li>
            <li>Mixed it well in a glass bowl W/chopsticks and applied a smooth, thick layer to my face.</li>
            <li>stuff worked miracles for the first two weeks, the zits I would get on my forehead throughout the day were completely eliminated; and I have tried everything to get rid of them in the past, literally everything.</li>
            <li>I mixed this mask with warm water, I was unable to get a pudding like consistency</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I was going to need since my skin is not dry</li>
            <li>I am so in love with this Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay Deep Pore Cleansing Mask.  </li>
            <li>Even if it&#x27;s not dry yet, it&#x27;s still working.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to smile and/or laugh when your face is tight like an Aztec goddess.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t feel really hateful towards the product because before my purchase, I read both positive and negative reviews on Amazon and reread them before finally deciding to try the mask.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive, to the point where acne cleaners dry it out until it cracks and anything moisturizing makes me break out.</li>
            <li>Most of it will break up into small particles again and go down the drain,</li>
            <li>The fact it has such a rich history makes you feel a deep appreciation for the past and the knowledge they obtained.</li>
            <li>It also smells a little funny once you mix it with water.</li>
            <li>Moderate would be one or two major sections (my two cheeks).</li>
            <li>But for some reason I still would get major breakouts on my left cheek.</li>
            <li>In 2 weeks (daily for 20 min), this clay cleared MAJOR acne.</li>
            <li>Sorry Amazon I love your company and order stuff from you literally every other day,  but my first loyalty is to fellow consumers.  </li>
            <li>And if I do, it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m in major need of a deep cleansing!</li>
            <li>I mixed it with bragg&#x27;s applecider vinegar and about a 1/2 table spoon of olive oil, it took me about 15min to apply and I left on an additional 10min after that and after entire process of rinsing it out my hair, my curls where so soft and defined!</li>
            <li>so I was a little worried at first.</li>
            <li>Also, be prepared for your skin to break out a little bit when you first start using it.</li>
            <li>Its going to smell a little funny.</li>
            <li>I rinsed it off and my skin was slightly red but nothing major.</li>
            <li>You do break out a little at first</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t used this long enough to tell you if it&#x27;s gonna clear up acne, but it&#x27;s definitely kept new big breakouts from happening.</li>
            <li>kind of a mess to work with and seriously dries out your skin</li>
            <li>I have spent a ton of money on high end masks over the years.  </li>
            <li>Your face will get tomato red if you are pale but it is well worth</li>
            <li>I had a few large pimples that either shrunk or came to a head with continued use, it dried out my existing bumps, and has brought so many black heads to the surface so that they can be removed.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend putting large chunks for cakey pieces of the mask down the drain.</li>
            <li>* only put a small amount into ziplock bag, add water, and mix that way.. its easier, can be used later, and stays clean..</li>
            <li>Be careful not to leave it on too long, or it may dry out your skin and cause some mild irritation.</li>
            <li>You can make it as strong or weak as you like (by mixing it with water, apple cider vinegar, or a combination of both).</li>
            <li>I mixed a little apple cider vinegar as it instructs and created the paste and applied to my dry clean face.</li>
            <li>A few hours later, the pores relaxed a little bit, but still better than it was originally&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face has been looking a little tired and dragged since I have been full time working and full time schooling.</li>
            <li>It was a little messy to mix together, but once it was applied to my face, it felt good &amp; dried</li>
            <li>Looking like Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer for a half hour afterwards is a small price to pay. :)</li>
            <li>My skin tends to be rather dry in spots but overall, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s normal.  </li>
            <li>I found it really hard to get a smooth paste, I mixed and mixed, and still had clumps</li>
            <li>I could tell my face was a little dry, so I put on a mild face moisturizer...</li>
            <li>I could tell my face was a little dry, so I put on a mild face moisturizer...</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t do that, unless you just want to have a very large quantity of mud to keep in a sealed container for the next few months.  </li>
            <li>I am a 24 year old male who doesnt take the best or the worst care of his skin.</li>
            <li>I feel like it&#x27;s really working on my dark spots.</li>
            <li>my face hasn&#x27;t been this clear in a long time.</li>
            <li>I generally wake up 30 minutes later to my face pulsating and my skin being pulled tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I have very oily dark skin</li>
            <li>I have minor blackheads that I&#x27;ve wanted to clear up for a while.</li>
            <li>by far beats any other Clear n clear/ Neutrogena/</li>
            <li>So I have this problem with dark area on my neck, no matter how much I scrub</li>
            <li>I wish I could have found this product years ago instead of struggling with various other over the counter(some very pricey) products</li>
            <li>It somehow shrinks the acne bumps to a very manageable size and it will disappear within a couple days - this is a big improvement over other things I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>Other clay masks i have used before were riddled with perfumes and cost so much for a tiny amount.</li>
            <li>I am very fond of this product, and will definitely use it each week and in case of any other changes will update the review.</li>
            <li>As soon as I started using this religiously, my face cleared dramatically and I barely have any acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m barely on like my third week</li>
            <li>I mixed them in a ceramic bowl with a plastic spoon because apparently you shouldn&#x27;t use anything metal with this clay as it messes with the ions or something in the benzonite?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Apparently it is helpful as a deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I was in a panic as my face completely broke out five days before I saw my long distance boyfriend.  </li>
            <li>I only have a few pesky light pink scars on my cheek.</li>
            <li>It had no strange smells</li>
            <li>but apparently it works for my back acne.</li>
            <li>Had the jar for several months and barely put a dent in the usage.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s kinda a long process for as busy as I am.</li>
            <li>After using this for the first time I felt that it dried my face.</li>
            <li>Although it is pretty messy.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought this mask was too drying and too harsh and made me break out.</li>
            <li>It was messy at first</li>
            <li>First, its so messy.</li>
            <li>At first, my face broke out, but it cleared up in a few days.</li>
            <li>To see the result you need to be patient because the first time I used it all I saw was dried skin flaked up.  </li>
            <li>I used it on some fresh mosquito bites for about 20 mins and the redness and itching was gone, and the bite was nothing but a small dot.</li>
            <li>At first I used this 3x days in a row and it really dried up my skin.</li>
            <li>expect a miracle after the first use, it takes a few applications to start seeing results.</li>
            <li>Using hot water is a waste of your time, it will be clumpy.</li>
            <li>After using this a few times now, my overall skin tone has improved and my face feels more supple and firm.</li>
            <li>Scared myself the first time because the person in the mirror was green.</li>
            <li>So yes, you will break out for the first few days.</li>
            <li>I did notice a few blackheads that were &#x27;pulled&#x27; to the surface and at first I thought the clay had deposited them</li>
            <li>I noticed that within the first few weeks of using the clay, my skin tone started evening out</li>
            <li>I have a full face sunburn afterwards for at least an hour or two.</li>
            <li>used it about 3 x a week for the first few weeks</li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t be alarmed the first few times you use them.</li>
            <li>it dried out my face a bit the first couple of times I used it</li>
            <li>It is okay for a face mask, the first time I felt nothing but the uncomfortable tightening from the drying clay, second and third time I felt a little tingle, but I am not sure it made a huge difference if anything after the last time I used it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of difficult getting the right consistency and hard to get it even on the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was really shocked at how clean and light my skin felt.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was really shocked at how clean and light my skin felt.</li>
            <li>I have huge pores and tons of black heads, and I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable reduction in black heads on my nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li>Things like proactive and clean and clear just made it worse.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It sounds like a lot, but it has really cut down on my skin regimen and the cost.</li>
            <li>Really tones down a breakout.  </li>
            <li>First it started to tingle a little bit, then my entire T-zone was tingling</li>
            <li>The first time I use clay mixed with water and apply on my face and neck, you can feel a little bit burn on my face.</li>
            <li>I use Bragg vinegar and usually start with a 1:1 ratio and add a little bit more clay.</li>
            <li>I do think that for such a simple mud mask compared to the major brand GLO, this is a no brainer.</li>
            <li>I was a little freaked the first time I used this because my face was as red as a strawberry when I washed it off, but as promised, it went away within 30-45 min.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend people with delicate skin to put on the mask evenly when applying it to your whole face.</li>
            <li>For those saying they had a reaction, it IS very basic and can be harsh, so it&#x27;s probably worth testing on a small area first.</li>
            <li>Doing this, I gently massaged my face, and magically black heads and white heads that I had not previously seen (prior to putting the mask on) were starting to surface.  </li>
            <li>I think it is kind of hard to get all the lumps of the powder out when mixing the stuff though, but I mix it with water, so I&#x27;m not sure if that makes a difference.  </li>
            <li>I use it at least twice a day religiously and never use any other moisturizer any more.</li>
            <li>People pay big bucks for similar treatments in a spa and I am not aware of another product that gives you so much clay for this price.</li>
            <li>Really brings the blood flow  to your face and makes you glow for the next several hours (after the extreme redness wears off after 20mins).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it pretty much as needed, usually every other day.</li>
            <li>I use half the first night and the other half stays fresh in the zip lock.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;ve never really been one for new experiences.</li>
            <li>It does take a while to dry, and leaves you a little red after removal, so make sure you have some down time before applying.</li>
            <li>At first it wasn&#x27;t doing anything and after a minute when it started drying the pulsating feeling began ,when it dried my face was so tight I looked like I had too much filler injected</li>
            <li>I usually use it at night, right before bed, scoop out some and mix it with apple cider vinegar and apply to face.</li>
            <li>I was pretty badly bruised and she insisted that I try the magic clay.  </li>
            <li>My face feels ridiculous, and all the pores are clean.</li>
            <li>I am dry and clear.</li>
            <li>I have bought expensive sulfur masks in the past and this is a great alternative.</li>
            <li>I dont normally get a pulsing sensation, and maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong, but I enjoy it</li>
            <li>the record I have 40 year old combination skin, sometimes it seems oily and dry all at once.</li>
            <li>Has really helped the look and condition of my skin to be smoother and have less breakouts and blackheads.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t need a whole lot - and always err on the side of less.</li>
            <li>But didn&#x27;t do much for my pimples or black heads</li>
            <li>a miracle moisturizer for my sensitive, sometimes dry face.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>maybe I&#x27;ll try with water and see if that is less Intense.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really smell it when its a powder, but with water it smells like dirt (just slightly).</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really peel black heads off like a nose strip, but it brings forth all that gunk to the surface of your skin and as I washed my face</li>
            <li>And wait for it to dry completely.</li>
            <li>I had noticeable black heads before I started using this product and now my skin is much clearer.</li>
            <li>Use it once a week because it can dry your skin if you have sensitive skin like me</li>
            <li>I let it dry completely then washed it off in the shower.</li>
            <li>It does dry your skin considerably</li>
            <li>( I let it dry completely before rinsing)&lt;br</li>
            <li>(mask fully dry) and immediately had glowing skin - and I&#x27;m 51 years old.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this if you have sensitive skin or dry skin.</li>
            <li>I brought it for my naturally curly and dry hair.</li>
            <li>I still think I need to use a pore strip to really pull out the black heads</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend that people with dry or sensitive skin use ACV with this mask.</li>
            <li>seems to help me long enough for me to have clear skin again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this about 10 times since purchasing, I&#x27;ve definitely seen an improvement in my skin pigmentation and my skin is generally softer overall.</li>
            <li>I layered it on thickly (likely too thickly), then worried since it dried like veritable concrete that it might not come off, but it did, quite easily.  </li>
            <li>I layered it on thickly (likely too thickly), then worried since it dried like veritable concrete that it might not come off, but it did, quite easily.  </li>
            <li>Once it was creamy again, I continued to wipe it off with paper towels and finally with a washcloth when there was barely any left..</li>
            <li>Regular, practically religious, soft washing and daily application of Benzoil Peroxide has been the only, proven, and doctor-endorsed method of keeping my skin regular.</li>
            <li>Apparently if you simply use water, the pH remains the same.</li>
            <li>my skin is not sensitive) and left it feeling soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am a 27 year old African American woman who has had and still has trouble with acne and enlarged pores and this stuff really gets in and gives you a deep cleaning!</li>
            <li>When i put it on thin it was easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>I would say after your first few times, maybe once every 2.5 weeks will be enough.</li>
            <li>I would say after your first few times, maybe once every 2.5 weeks will be enough.</li>
            <li>Gets pretty messy, especially when washing it off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest something gentler if you have sensitive skin, or even normal skin, because it just seemed too harsh.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time and it does make your skin very red and causes some burning after you take off the mask, but that goes away after a few hours.</li>
            <li>and it comes off easily when placed on thin</li>
            <li>The first time I mixed it with Green Tea, but it was SO lumpy.</li>
            <li>Thin layer, leave on your face 20-30 minutes max, and hop in the shower to rinse off because it does not wipe away easily like prepackaged masks from the drugstore.</li>
            <li>It took some time to see a difference, but the difference is definitely worth it over the small differences that daily face scrubs do.</li>
            <li>The first time using this product was a bit of a learning experience for me, and messy, but the second time is a charm!</li>
            <li>Just got this in the mail a few days ago and used it for the first time last night.</li>
            <li>The first few times I mixed it with water and had a lot of clumps in it.</li>
            <li>For a beginner which I am, I didn&#x27;t like it because I felt like it was too strong for me, and it felt a bit irritating like my face was on fire and around my hair edges were a bit itchy.</li>
            <li>It is rather thick and quick drying.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t bother with a super thick layer.</li>
            <li>I have cystic pimples, black head, LARGE pores and tiny hormonal pimples.</li>
            <li>however I always suffered of large pores and black dots on my face especially on my nose and forhead.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried at first because my back was red (as stated in the product).  </li>
            <li>A very natural and inexpensive product, just be careful not to clog up your drains when washing it off.</li>
            <li>It really does get deep down in your pores.</li>
            <li>You really can feel the mask PULSATING against your skin, drawing out whatever lurks deep down in there.</li>
            <li>I actually buy it at the Whole Foods down the street</li>
            <li>Really gets down into those pores for a deep cleaning.</li>
            <li>The mask really gets deep down into the pores.</li>
            <li>It is easy to make a big mess if you&#x27;re not careful, and I caution against dry clay going down your sink drain-</li>
            <li>but my skin glows after I am done and my black heads are nearly gone!!!</li>
            <li>After some tries, I figured out that it&#x27;s best to put on a THIN layer rather than a thick layer because the mask will take too long to dry.</li>
            <li>This clay doesn&#x27;t have any positive beneficial values to my skin after a few use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I would say that the whole experience with waiting for the mask to dry was a bit scary weird (more due to first experience) but not bad as after washing my face</li>
            <li>I was happy and disappointed at the same time when I found this product offered at my local health food store for $6.99, but that may not be the case for everyone.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel  any burning sensation as I normally do with with other mud masks.</li>
            <li>I make sure to put extra water in the container to keep it from drying out in the cabinet, and it seems to be doing well (for the past few months)</li>
            <li>far as complaints about clogging your drains, I probably don&#x27;t use it enough for that to happen, but to take the side of caution I always wash it off slowly with hot water and follow it with a dash a drain cleaner in the sink/shower.</li>
            <li>First off, I personally find the suggestion that you apply it in a layer 1/4 to 1/2 inch think to be FAR too thick.</li>
            <li>Over the span of a year or 2, I spent hundreds of dollars on different products (and I tried each for a few months to give it a true trial)...</li>
            <li>Overall I would say that the whole experience with waiting for the mask to dry was a bit scary weird (more due to first experience) but not bad as after washing my face</li>
            <li>so I applied the product right away when I received it which was around june 8, and I have been knowing some results since I been using it on my face has been clearing out no more of those red dots it cleared out on my face....</li>
            <li>It got a little tight after 20 minutes, but your skin feels so so smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>If you use it again the next day or day after it will help dry them out and keep the skin clear.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, acne-prone skin that is just starting to age, and is dry almost all the time.  </li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t want clay to dry all the way on your face...as it gets harder to remove.  </li>
            <li>After using this concoction, I have noticed smaller pores, moisturized (neither oily nor dry) skin, and it is quite soft.</li>
            <li>Your face feels really dry afterwards and gets really red, but will wear off after 5 to 10 minutes and then feel really soft.</li>
            <li>I mixed it with the recommended all natural apple cider vinegar, applied it, and let it on until dry.</li>
            <li>Prior to using this product, my face had some extremely dry patches (could have been burnt), but after the clay, my face feels even and soft all the way around.</li>
            <li>It also works well on dry skin to smooth out some unevenness and get all that junk out of your pores, but I would recommend using a thick moisturizer afterwards in that case.</li>
            <li>and it does make your skin feel very restricted and tight</li>
            <li>I mix/store this in a 2 oz hinged plastic jar, so when I make too much its still sealed air tight.</li>
            <li>Yes, its creates a bit of itching, and pulsating since it really pulls the skin tight, when drying.</li>
            <li>Cleans pores really well and skin feels tight and rejuvenated afterwards.</li>
            <li>My skin wasn&#x27;t red afterward (some other users reported this) but my skin is SO SOFT!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I wrote the review a little over a month ago, and if you read my entire review and understood the whole acne minor/moderate/sever stage level thing, let me just proudly say that I am now a Moderate Level 1 and haven&#x27;t had any severe or crazy breakouts at all!</li>

            <li>/&gt;Thirdly, the clay will get very hard, but once you wash it off, it does leave your face really smooth.</li>
            <li>it was very cheap purchase, won&#x27;t feel sorry throwing it out</li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time last night, and I got all those same things... the pulsating, the cold-hot feel... then, it felt like it was totally stretching my skin as it dried.</li>
            <li>I tried 3 days after an application and my face felt almost raw and hot.</li>
            <li>the first time I used it I used 2 tbsp clay and 2 tbsp raw acv</li>
            <li>My acne isn&#x27;t completely gone, and I&#x27;m still getting a few new ones, but compared to before they&#x27;re smaller and easier to hide.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t get any major breakouts but any small (or large) pimple</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t get any major breakouts but any small (or large) pimple</li>
            <li>It gets VERY tight, but does wonders for your skin if you use it on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li>&amp; I only used a little on areas where I have large pores (cheeks, forehead) &amp; where I had a pimple (under my neck &amp; by my ear)</li>
            <li>My skin is tight and clear!!!  </li>
            <li>The only downside to this is that it makes an absolute mess when you&#x27;re removing it.</li>
            <li>less mess to clean up in the end.  </li>
            <li>being so dry is completely healed, AFTER TWO BACK TO BACK USES!</li>
            <li>The apple cider vinegar will burn slightly and leaves the skin red for at least 30 - 45 minutes however the apple cider vinegar seems to work better.</li>
            <li>A thin layer works just fine.</li>
            <li>It also works well on dry skin to smooth out some unevenness and get all that junk out of your pores, but I would recommend using a thick moisturizer afterwards in that case.ow key</li>
            <li>I found a review that said to only put a thin layer on your face and let it completely dry and that you would be able to SEE the blackheads that were pulled out of your skin in the mask.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a very long way so store in a cool dry place.</li>
            <li>If you are somebody who is applying this clay purely for the removal of dead skin, then be my guest and mix ACV with it.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of large pores, whiteheads, blackheads, and a few pimples-</li>
            <li>I have very dry sensitive skin and every now</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product mixed with raw apple cider vinegar it made my face break out</li>
            <li>It gets a little intense while I wear it.</li>
            <li>There was a little tightening but not as intense as I thought it would be, almost unnoticable tightening.</li>
            <li>Leave skin really soft,a little redness..</li>
            <li>and I like how you can make as little or as much as you want.</li>
            <li>/&gt;[I don&#x27;t really measure, I kinda just add a little of everything]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although it stings for a few seconds while drying, it left my skin feeling so soft and clear!</li>
            <li>I really like how little ingredients are in it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little too much clay for me,</li>
            <li>and that was a little too much,</li>
            <li>I would recommend this mask to anyone who has some minor skin issues, as I don&#x27;t know how it would work on major skin problems.  </li>
            <li>It could be due to the altitude where I live.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this with other new products I&#x27;m trying for my combination skin.</li>
            <li>w/ low porosity, slightly thin, and fine strands (</li>
            <li>It is kind of hard to wash off your face because it does get really hard</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little hard to remove but overall pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>junk?&lt;br /&gt;-I mixed 6 tablespoons of clay with equal parts of raw apple cider vinegar, it made too much!  </li>
            <li>When I was a teenager starting to develop oily skin and large pores on my nose an esthetician working a beauty counter at a mega store in Mexico introduced me to a green clay mask that worked wonders on my skin.</li>
            <li>It works really well but can cause your face to look a little red after.</li>
            <li>You do NOT need as much as it says on the back, a little does the trick.</li>
            <li>it hard to take off, but its worth it.</li>
            <li>talkng will be hard and when you look at youself in the mirror, you might try to laugh but your face will feel frozen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t have to go out anywhere for at least 45 min though because you will be red for a little while after use.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think it would be enough but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I first closed the sink drain, put my large zip loc bag over my sink drain and then using wet wipes I added small amounts of water to it and then scrapped off the clay onto the sink.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like it does much to my skin other than dry it out</li>
            <li>I can really say what it does other than dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>I try using this once a week, but it is kind of annoying to clean up because I don&#x27;t let it go down the drain for clogging purposes...</li>
            <li>There are some active compounds in it and it can be strong so don&#x27;t apply it to very delicate or sensitive skin before testing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it took a little longer to “cool down”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it took a little longer to “cool down”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mix equal parts of clay &amp; raw apple cider vinegar (it gives off a fizzy &amp; slightly bubbly sound &amp; reaction).&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn me or anything(though it did burn one of my friends with bad acne, but I think that was a good sign.)</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my skin when using this product, good or bad.</li>
            <li>Some good, some bad.</li>
            <li>The smell isn’t good or bad.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years and its absolutely amazing for people who have blackheads and dirty pores.</li>
            <li>which is both good and bad.</li>
            <li>His thing lasts since u are recommended not to do it too often because it removes good and bad dirt and oil.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of the good and bad reviews but ultimately decided to get it because, for the price, I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>Bentonite is a miracle in itself, the yerba prima liquid bentonite is a great tasteless detox for those who have issues with heavy metals, toxins, excess sodium and stuff like that.</li>
            <li>I even made my boyfriend who suffers from acne try this product and his face looked more radiant and clear after just one use.</li>
            <li>My skin is still moisturized the whole day, and the cold weather used to cause lines to come back no matter what anti-aging product I used, but the bel essence keeps me as line free in the winter as I am in the summer.  </li>
            <li>your skin will absorb it and it will be silly smooth without clogging because jojoba is the closest to natural sebum in the skin</li>
            <li>My mother suffers from many allergies, and her skin is sensitive to everything (it seems).  </li>

            <li> And my face felt awesome.</li>
            <li> For those of you who have never had a drying clay mask this is probably the best thing since sliced bread.</li>

            <li> I used it for about 15 minutes and my face was so tightened and my face was feeling great!</li>
            <li> I recommend using apple cider vinegar because they mix the best and works great!</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wait to see how great my face looks in a month of use!</li>
            <li> If you use it with apple cider vinegar, it kicks it up a notch (doesn&#x27;t smell great) but gets the job done!</li>
            <li> The best product for you face!</li>
            <li> A very very happy customer.</li>

            <li> I am blown away with how great this mask works.</li>

            <li> I figured with great reviews i would try this...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be like me and let one fly by and go over the limit it says on the container because it will hurt to express emotion.</li>
            <li> Lol...</li>
            <li> the shipping and everything was great.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just the mask itself that isn&#x27;t all that great.</li>

            <li> Great price</li>
            <li> This clay mask has been great for me.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell that pleasant.</li>
            <li> beauty-wise.&lt;br /&gt;It makes your face pulsate and tingle in a quite pleasant way which I like to imagine</li>
            <li> I mix it with apple cider vinegar--it doesn&#x27;t smell or look pleasant, but works.  </li>
            <li> im so excited guys!!!</li>
            <li> Worked great mixing it with apple cider , very satisfied with results</li>
            <li> would like to thank Amazon for a wide range of awesome products with excellent online service and excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> I recommend this wonderful product for true results!</li>
            <li> My face felt so clean!!!  </li>
            <li> and when you wash it off you won&#x27;t believe how clean your skin looks and feels!!!</li>
            <li> Great for many usage too!</li>
            <li> It works best with apple cider vinegar, but using with water it works fine to just the results might not be as good.</li>
            <li> I made sure to wipe everything away very good when washing it off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it in places that i don&#x27;t have to, it&#x27;s very strong!</li>
            <li> Honestly this is probably top 3 best beauty products I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I wonder if there something to the thickness level that is causing bright redness for some people?</li>
            <li> This is great clay and many of the attractive masks I see in the store have cheaper ingredients.</li>
            <li> &#x27;S THE BEST PART:  If you have lines and wrinkles already, within a couple of weeks of using the two products you will see a HUGE difference.  </li>
            <li> This one is the most effective and of best value in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My face has never EVER looked so bright.</li>
            <li> This is honestly the best product I have ever tried and trust me, I have tried many.</li>
            <li> The tingling feeling is amazing and I am so happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> this once a week and follow with a good, non-chemical moisturizer and your skin will feel like a baby&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> 1 Tablespoon of each is really good for applying it to your face.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this because I heard it was good, but I had no idea</li>
            <li> The product arrived in time, it was in good conditions.</li>
            <li> Good luck</li>
            <li> I loved it..</li>
            <li> The producer may buy some good reviews from co,.</li>
            <li> good</li>
            <li> good luck</li>
            <li> you want to make a good clay mask, get about 1/16th of a cup (and I recommend a glass mixing bowl) and then get your apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly though i did not feel any pulsation</li>
            <li> but this product is so good</li>
            <li> good with apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li> Good Luck to all</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT..</li>
            <li> I recommend using this as just an all around good face mask.</li>
            <li> but i still want my skin looking good,</li>
            <li> The cashier even looked at the product before the scan and said i heard this stuff is good...</li>
            <li> All the tightening and clay cleasing felt good</li>
            <li> here&#x27;s the good part.</li>
            <li> As a clay face masked it worked good</li>
            <li> and I LOVED THE FEELING.</li>
            <li> This is a good product</li>
            <li> Good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> Honey is good for healing, just like the clay.</li>
            <li> Honey is good for healing, just like the clay.</li>
            <li> Not a miracle, but good for cleaning out pores and drying out blemishes.</li>
            <li> have been applying the mask,  once in three days and after three applications , I do see a good difference.</li>
            <li> Good thing</li>
            <li> and i was good to go.</li>
            <li> i think this clay helps with that which is good for me</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also says that the clay is good for acne</li>
            <li> I really loved my experience with the clay.</li>
            <li> and when I took it off my face felt soo good</li>
            <li> On day 2 after using the clay, my face started to peel and I wish that&#x27;s a good sign.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin looks soooo good-</li>
            <li> I also tried it without applying any serum or cream afterwards and the results were just as good.</li>
            <li> I also tried it without applying any serum or cream afterwards and the results were just as good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(looking for a good product to tighten the pores afterward</li>
            <li> so I have consistently good skin.</li>
            <li> I loved this on my face and even had my sister use it...</li>
            <li> My measuring skills have never been good.</li>
            <li> That being said, even though I did screw it up I really loved how rosy my face was and how good it felt.</li>
            <li> Afterwards a good face cream is essential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use it on my face as a mask and makes it feel really good.</li>
            <li> However, the product is good</li>
            <li> that day - it all looked good.</li>
            <li> It tingles and afterward your feet feel so good.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I use it together, I think this product is good for all skin types.</li>
            <li> It is just a good skin exfoliator, blackhead still there.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t know if it is good for your plumbing.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price &amp;</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s good stuff</li>
            <li> good value.</li>
            <li> Although, the apple cider vinegar doesn&#x27;t smell to good the smell will eventually go away.</li>
            <li> ITS IS NUMBER ONE IN SKIN ANTI AGING FOR GOOD REASIN.</li>
            <li> A light dose is best, I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job of cleaning pores, smoothing skin and the apple cider vinegar is good for my oily T zone.</li>
            <li> Follow with a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> That or use in combination with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> just because it has lots of badtass good ratings already, why should i drop it</li>
            <li> the tingling sensation feel good, relaxing to me.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve had my fair share of school projects</li>
            <li> Nice stuff, works great for blackheads but doesn&#x27;t do away with them 100%, I&#x27;d say maybe 70% of blackheads gone</li>
            <li> After using the clay, I moisturize with rosehip, jojoba  or good quality olive oil.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this product.</li>
            <li> but it seems like a good product.</li>
            <li> The tub says its good for 4 masks</li>
            <li> Its good for acne and bug bites sooo</li>
            <li> I wanted to use this for a couple weeks before I gave a good review on it.</li>
            <li> and it literally feels like your face is being tightened into a corset ( this is a good thing).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for reducing redness and swelling.</li>
            <li> This improved my skin and good for days where you feel like you need a spa day.</li>
            <li> YOU FOLLOW UP WITH A GOOD MOISTURIZER</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> I even bought the good apple vinegar for it, and it didn&#x27;t make any difference.</li>
            <li> I use a good vinegar with \\&quot;the mother\\&quot; and  bought the  Rosallini Packed 4</li>
            <li> good</li>
            <li> Feels good.</li>
            <li> Looks Good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good cleanser.</li>
            <li> My face felt like it was pulsing, in a good way.  </li>
            <li> I mix this with apple cider vinegar like the instructions say and it makes my skin feel good.</li>
            <li> It feels good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The good news:</li>
            <li> and I still use it now to maintain optimum skin clarity.  </li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel good after using it</li>
            <li> With water it was still fairly clumpy and I haven&#x27;t yet tried it with apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> But, it is a good mask</li>
            <li> years of searching for a good product  </li>
            <li> I used a good quality moisturizer after.  </li>
            <li> its good for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Good step to add in your skincare routine.</li>
            <li> No fuss multipurpos good face mask.</li>
            <li> I feel good knowing that there aren&#x27;t a ton of ingredients in this, and mixing with ACV</li>
            <li> which is what makes the product so good</li>
            <li> I loved it and it was delivered in a timely fashion</li>
            <li> A good moisturizer is needed afterwards.</li>
            <li> Loved it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I have really good skin.</li>
            <li> Thus getting a good cleaning has always been a problem.  </li>
            <li> Good luck to you all and</li>
            <li> Good luck</li>
            <li> Good luck to you all and</li>
            <li> Good luck</li>
            <li> its not some miracle but its a good mask.</li>
            <li> Results not as good as others reported.  </li>
            <li> so i feel good in recommneding this to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere for a good face mask and nothing</li>
            <li> So I will try on my hair and see if it works just as good as it works on the face.</li>
            <li> Purchased this based on the good reviews here about how it helps with acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;10) Just take a paper towel and give a sink a good wipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though I&#x27;m absolutely delighted with the lifting, energizing, and skin rejuvenating effects of the mask, I must say that I didn&#x27;t see any sign of it dissolving or DRAWING gunk out of pores</li>
            <li> My skin looks so good</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect miracles with this, but I think it does some good for my skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product , make your face smooth</li>
            <li> BTW, the directions say to use 1/4 - 1/2 inch on your face, making 1 pound good for 15 treatments.</li>
            <li> Just put on an even coverage, 1 pound will probably do a good 40 treatments.</li>
            <li> Good stuff works well</li>
            <li> It is really a good product to use.</li>
            <li> Acquire a fan with a good amount of power.</li>
            <li> As recommended, use a good moisturizer after the pore cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But Bragg&#x27;s Vinegar is also good for your skin, so it&#x27;s a go</li>
            <li> A good time to mention</li>
            <li> This works good</li>
            <li> Works good.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s good for your skin.</li>
            <li> it should just make your skin glow and look good.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> and i absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> But in a GOOD way.</li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t complain, so I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> this is a good product for cleansing, masks, and baths.</li>
            <li> She loved it because it drew out impurities and seemed to exfoliate.  </li>
            <li> GOOD.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin, did not cause any redness or irritation.</li>
            <li> I loved this produced</li>
            <li> Makes a good mask when used with water.  </li>
            <li> After one use everyone was raving about how good my skin looked.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say use this at night before you go to bed because it won&#x27;t do any good-</li>
            <li> so a scar treatment or good exfoliator is a good idea also if you have issues with that.t</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say use this at night before you go to bed because it won&#x27;t do any good-</li>
            <li> so a scar treatment or good exfoliator is a good idea also if you have issues with that.</li>
            <li> It is a good product and is sold at a good price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That being said I still find use for a good clay mask.</li>
            <li> Really loved it.</li>
            <li> and also good for men.  </li>
            <li> your face looks gorgeous</li>
            <li> / powder as a gift to friends and family, who loved it too.</li>
            <li> It does make your face pulsate a bit, but it feels good.</li>
            <li> This is a good price for this stuff.</li>
            <li> This product really is good.</li>
            <li> Both things are good for cleansing.</li>
            <li> This cleansing mask works so good</li>
            <li> I loved how it felt.</li>
            <li> My skin does not feel good while it&#x27;s on or after.  </li>
            <li> Apply moisturizer liberally after a good cleaning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m practicing on making the perfect smooth concoction.</li>
            <li> you shave really good</li>
            <li> 50 -carmel complexion and have taken really good care of my skin,</li>
            <li> and I guess good genes are a factor too.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it, but I think it is good</li>
            <li> This is good stuff.</li>
            <li> i just use it today and I feel so good</li>
            <li> It does feel good and works well.</li>
            <li> good product speaks for itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I see a lot of good reviews on here</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> Also good for sinus infections.</li>
            <li> Since Apple Cider Vinegar is acid (pH around 4), it balances out and is good for the skin.</li>
            <li> This is the most incredible stuff.  </li>
            <li> This was surprising to me at 24</li>
            <li> and it felt good as it was drying.  </li>
            <li> aren&#x27;t good for you if you do your research.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, works great to cleanse skin!  </li>
            <li> Really good for oily, acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> so good.</li>
            <li> good face mask.</li>
            <li> Its a good product, would buy again.</li>
            <li> It felt wierd and good</li>
            <li> I loved using it and would suggest it to anyone who hasnt ever done face masks before.</li>
            <li> I use this once a week because I feel like it does a good job</li>
            <li> I bought it over a year ago and tried it for myself and loved it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to rinse this off in the shower I recommend putting some paper towels over the drain to collect the mud because this can&#x27;t be good for the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried it and loved it.</li>
            <li> a so called \\&quot;good day\\&quot; my skin would be sore and ravaged with acne.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a good product.  </li>
            <li> Good facepack for all skin types</li>
            <li> Which is good in my opinion because of the amount of clay that is suggested you put on.</li>
            <li> I tried because of good reviews &amp; price.</li>
            <li> but I get a good result with water as well.</li>
            <li> I used apple cider vinegar to mix with it, I used that on my face pryer because I heard its good for your skin.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin so smooth and feels great!</li>
            <li> Its a good Product .</li>
            <li> Loved that it came with a sealed label.  </li>
            <li> Makes quite a bit...a good bargain&lt;</li>
            <li> It feels so good to have no pimples on my face.</li>
            <li> It feels so good to have no pimples on my face.</li>
            <li> Leaves face with good complexion.</li>
            <li> i am baffled by the number of good reviews this product has.</li>
            <li> /&gt;would not recommend, it&#x27;s way too drying, and not in a good way.</li>
            <li> I use it every night and mix it with apple cider vinegar, which I find is the best way to get a smooth mix, and leave it for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> You know those Axe commercials where chicks won&#x27;t leave that one guy alone cuz he smells just so darn good?</li>
            <li> This product has changed my skin forever.&lt;br /&gt;You will need a good moisturizer, as this will suck all of the crud out of your pores but you can expect to sacrifice some moisture in the process.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and that is good advice.</li>
            <li> However, apple cider vinegar doesn&#x27;t smell that good -_-</li>
            <li> Definitely a good idea to mix it up using ACV, then add a bit of water for it not to be lumpy.</li>
            <li> The mask is really good.</li>
            <li> That was a good combo.</li>
            <li> I do use a good moisturizer after use of the mask to help my skin from drying out.</li>
            <li> but I guess its still good.</li>
            <li> Thank  you  very much,  i loved</li>
            <li> Seemed like a good idea.</li>
            <li> its really good.......</li>
            <li> After you use this, you will need a good moisturizer, it cleans out your pours and dries your face a bit.</li>
            <li> Good, but not a miracle product.</li>
            <li> Do not buy if you know what&#x27;s good for you.</li>
            <li> Every time I have loved it.  </li>
            <li> Also word to the wise,..</li>
            <li> , I think this stuff works fairly well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good stuff</li>
            <li> but my skin felt good.</li>
            <li> HOW GOOD THIS IS....</li>
            <li> and I could literally feel my skin getting a good cleaning while it was drying.</li>
            <li> so I bought this after seeing a gazillion good reviews.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the good reviews.</li>
            <li> it cleans good when one needs it</li>
            <li> its so good for you.</li>
            <li> i bought this because i was looking for a good mask to unclog my pores.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It made my face clearer, but I guess it was a temporal bleach effect (which doesn&#x27;t feel good at all for your skin)&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel like a mask of good quality</li>
            <li> my wife ordered this and loved it...</li>
            <li> You can try it, I wanted to because of all the good reviews but trust me here</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good substantial size.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does a good job cleaning up your face.</li>
            <li> It is a good product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup so having my pores look good is a necessity.</li>
            <li> but now my skin has never looked this good and will not go without again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fairly inexpensive, and somewhat &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; way to deal with problem skin.</li>
            <li> Skin looks and feels good.</li>

            <li> It works good.</li>
            <li> I think 20 minutes is a good maximum.  </li>

            <li> I had good hopes with this product.</li>
            <li> Use it with a good quality apple cider and you can feel its power.</li>
            <li> Here is a review to balance out the overly inflated good reviews here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fair to say that this stuff does do what it says it clears yur pores...</li>

            <li> Works really good</li>

            <li> Good thing</li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> My acne-prone skin hasn&#x27;t felt this good since before puberty.</li>
            <li> That lasted for a good two hours.</li>
            <li> I got some good skincare products from amazon, and this indian healing clay</li>
            <li> it works good on me~ although it cost time to stir, I still apply it three times a week~</li>
            <li> One of the best pore cleansing mask, it is very powerful and you can feel your face pulsate and your skin tighten.</li>
            <li> and I have never been dissappointed with a positive rating UNTIL NOW!!!!!  </li>
            <li> but it sure does feel good!</li>
            <li> Be sure to use a good moisturizer afterwards and follow the instructions!</li>

            <li> my opinion, what I read about this product, before ordering it, is true to its promises!!!</li>

            <li> The product is awesome and leaves my skin clean, the redness goes away after 20 minutes</li>
            <li> Perfect scrub for that baby&#x27;s bottom smoothing and to clean up hands and feet.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m finding I get exceptional results when I combine the Indian Clay with Refresh Phytoceramides.</li>

            <li> Very satisfied customer</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m more than happy to share that this product delivers on promise.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe how good my skin looks after using this amazing product.  </li>
            <li> clay began to release from my skin and it was very refreshing</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the hype of this product, it had so many great reviews</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy :) .</li>
            <li> Great that it worked for most people.</li>
            <li> It feels very refreshing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also rated 0 by the Environmental Working Group (zero is the best score they give, and beauty products rarely earn it.)  </li>
            <li> and I have been trying to find more natural-based products to use that had great reviews.</li>
            <li> So many uses, great product</li>
            <li> but i would recommend it mostly for people with oily to combination skin because it has a great drying effect.</li>
            <li> Great product and has so many uses I am just learning about all the benefits of clay but would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very refreshing and tightening&lt;</li>
            <li> very pleased with product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> It was a happy accident that this works better than anything else she tried.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with this transaction</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many cleansing products claiming to do all great things to your skin.</li>
            <li> Most of all I&#x27;m happy with how I look and feel.</li>
            <li> Great quality - will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> Brought all my clogged pores out and made my skin look nice and bright and not oily.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I saw all the great reviews, but I have to add one more thing about this product.  </li>
            <li> I do notice I have a bright, nice glow after using.</li>
            <li> I love this product, its great on my skin.</li>
            <li> But it is better as I feel a sense of joy</li>
            <li> Others have extolled it virtues so I won&#x27;t go into detail here, but it is a universally great choice for many skin types.  </li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I use this once a week and get great looking healthy skin!RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> ; I&#x27;m confident and happy to add this to my routine.</li>
            <li> found that it&#x27;s best to whip fresh batches a day before using</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pulsating lay great :)</li>
            <li> It keeps your skin looking fresh and flawless.</li>
            <li> love this stuff, and great deal...</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this, and I&#x27;ve been very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the results it&#x27;s provided me.</li>
            <li> love this great stuff for ur face</li>
            <li> I saw that it had a lot of great reviews and thought most of them were probably BS</li>
            <li> With so many great reviews on this product, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for most because i don&#x27;t have a acne problem, I just want to maintain great skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this mask mostly cuz of the great reviews &amp;when it came I couldnt wait to try it.</li>
            <li> but I am very pleased</li>
            <li> This is an okay one not the great one.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Very Satisfied.</li>
            <li> I thought for sure the reviews on this product had to be skewed, but honestly, it&#x27;s as great as it&#x27;s made out to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes my skin very smooth and supple!</li>
            <li> I use this once a week and it keeps my skin very healthy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very refreshing</li>
            <li> Though the smell with the apple cider can be overwhelming it feels great on my face.</li>
            <li> After that, my skin does feel great, and maybe looks slightly better</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m just using it to tighten and tone, I follow up with a good slather of rose hip oil (all of these can be purchased here on Amazon).</li>
            <li> i wouldn&#x27;t swear by it or anything, but it&#x27;s a nice face mask, feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li> good product, so very happy , thanks , and good deliver , OMG ....</li>
            <li> good product, so very happy , thanks , and good deliver</li>
            <li> However, it does feel nice, and is good for a spa day with the girls (or guys, as the case may be) every now and then.  </li>
            <li> I try once, its nice with good results</li>
            <li> i mix my pearl powder in it and it feels nice good product</li>

            <li> great for removing dirt , leaves face feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> Very good product to clean out the pores.  </li>
            <li> the mixture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The contracting feel of the clay drying is surprising at first, but is actually very pleasant.</li>
            <li> After using this...I can honestly say that I have never been more happy with a product.</li>
            <li> , my boy friend and I got a great laugh and pictures (LOL) to show off before and after.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a miracle product but it does great for tightening things and acne scarring, and the best part is it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> Glad there is actually a good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> This is just too good for its price and very easy to use too.</li>

            <li> I Love the way it made my skin feel!</li>
            <li> I have used this a dozen or so times since I&#x27;ve bought it (mixing with apple cider vinegar), and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I love the way my face feels after using this!</li>
            <li> But I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> My husband and I love it!</li>
            <li> That made a pretty perfect amount to use on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> To me, it&#x27;s not some magical awesome mask that&#x27;s gonna solve all your skin issues - it&#x27;s just a mask to clean your skin.</li>
            <li> Good luck!t into your face to loosen the mask, it comes off easily!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described - great quality - perfect for the job and really easy to use&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can easily see the great improvement on her skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, it does have a strong odor</li>
            <li> Your skin will absorb anything you use very quickly, so I recommend a great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Be warned though: It&#x27;s recommended that you use apple cider vinegar to mix with the powder so if you have an aversion to strong smells, this might not be great for you...</li>
            <li> With the unfiltered organic apple cider vinegar it&#x27;s not the most pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> I follow this mask up with coconut oil all over and it is a great way to easily pamper myself.</li>
            <li> all those together and apply to your face and wash it off after 20-25 minutes or keep it on until you feel comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;You can adjust the quantities as you wish coz ratios that work perfectly for one skin might not be same for others.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy beautiful glowing skin.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Folks: to make easy on / off here&#x27;s a suggestion that works great and a method esthetecians use:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>

            <li> product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> it makes your skin more bright and humid~</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re done with the mask, dab your face with warm water before removing it from your skin (this will make it easier for you to take it</li>
            <li> Add water or organic apple cider and it gives you a nice cleansing mask.</li>
            <li> I applied rose oil on my face when I was done.</li>
            <li> but my hair is loving all this time with the conditioner in.  </li>
            <li> I think it depends of each one, for me it wasn&#x27;t effective at all.</li>
            <li> It just kind of sets me in stone.</li>
            <li> I recommend taking a rag and soaking it with warm water and dabbing it generously on the clay so that it softens somewhat.</li>
            <li> im loving the four day use results and can&#x27;t wait to see how effective it&#x27;ll be after 1 month of use..</li>
            <li> but the pimples just smiled and kept swelling.</li>
            <li> It dragged my face and I kind of looked like a gangster Robert Deniro  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice rubbing your face with dirt.</li>
            <li> + mixer handy to make the mask in.</li>
            <li> Love the tingling/tightening...makes me feel like it&#x27;s doing something good</li>
            <li> I would say it lasted about 2-3 hours, honestly.  </li>
            <li> I would say it lasted about 2-3 hours, honestly.  </li>
            <li> I took a towel and ran warm water on it and just placed this on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mixing it ourselves has been nice because I like it a bit thicker than my daughter.</li>
            <li> I think it makes your face feel nice.</li>
            <li> it won&#x27;t smell nice.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter taught me how to make my own face powder with this.  </li>
            <li> My wife bought it and she really liked.</li>
            <li> It kind of stings my skin,</li>
            <li> I do think that the apple cider vinegar(I use the unfiltered kind with the \\&quot;mother\\&quot; in it)vastly increases the healing power.</li>
            <li> It felt good, refreshing.</li>
            <li> But I have used this twice now (and you don&#x27;t need more than one spoonful) and it makes my skin feel so good afterwards.  </li>
            <li> After about 20 minutes, I removed the mask with warm water.  </li>
            <li> Take a bowl and fill it with warm water.</li>
            <li> thank you  very much,order it ,got it very happy</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it had good reviews</li>
            <li> so you need to take a warm shower to get it off or press a warm washcloth on your face to loosen the clay and then wipe it</li>
            <li> and then I wash it with warm water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;1tsp Indian healing clay + 1/4 tsp Vinegar + 1/2 tsp rose</li>
            <li> + 1/2 rose water - Pore cleaning&lt;br /&gt;1/2 tsp Indian healing clay + 1/2 tsp lemon juice -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have something that doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of ingredients that don&#x27;t seem to help anyway.</li>
            <li> Honestly it lasts longer that way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So I got a wash cloth with warm water.</li>
            <li> I was the weirdo in line at CVS stroking their own face.</li>
            <li> I was the weirdo in line at CVS stroking their own face.</li>
            <li> I apply the clay mixture to my face and neck, i also add two slices of cucumber over my eyes and just relax for 20 minutes then rinse with warm water.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend described the brightness of our skin afterwards as &amp;#34;from night to day.&amp;#34; He really liked the tingly/tight feeling too.</li>
            <li> I liked this product a lot.</li>
            <li> Apply moisturizer (any kind) I am using coconut oil for my oily skin.</li>
            <li> but it sure feels good.</li>
            <li> I had no redness or any kind of reaction</li>
            <li> I used it at my own risk and so should you.</li>
            <li> After rinsing this off my face with warm water, I washed with my L&#x27;Oreal RevitaLift Radiant Smoothing cleanser and then applied my AcneFree 3-in-1 Night Repair Foam and my Neutrogena Firming Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen so many good ratings about this item, so I made the order.  </li>
            <li> Everyone should own this stuff.</li>
            <li> I tried mixing my clay powder with just some warm water in a bowl with a spoon.</li>
            <li> I just use 1 time a week for 10 minutes and it works nicely...</li>
            <li> we both really liked it.</li>
            <li> we both really liked how it made our skin look...</li>
            <li> Use warm water to remove-</li>
            <li> i honestly think this product needs to be a staple in every girls \\&quot;bag of stuff\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why others liked it.</li>
            <li> After thoroughly removing this from my face with warm cloth then a toner all my products absorb quite nicely.</li>
            <li> I put a nice layer on.</li>
            <li> The absolute best clay mask I have ever tried!</li>
            <li> It feel good after use it in my first time make my skin beautiful and shine</li>
            <li> Rub in well and let it set for five minutes then remove with a warm, damp face cloth.</li>
            <li> This product and water is plenty on its own.  </li>
            <li> The excess keeps nicely in the fridge.</li>
            <li> Excellent, overnight resolution of any smaller inflammations and great for blackheads too.  </li>
            <li> Warm water on a towel to take the mask off helps a lot too.</li>
            <li> I also use a thicker mask and again, I felt a noticeable tingle and tightening, but not the kind of tightening you get from drug store masks, where it tightens because it&#x27;s drying you out.  </li>
            <li> and I can honestly say I have seen an improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I washed it off with a warm towel</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> /&gt;The absolute best way to mix this is by adding apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for great products I never see in stores!!</li>
            <li> ; It honestly did nothing at all for/against my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> no harm done.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it will work wonders for others, but it honestly did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having said that, I use the clay as a weekly treatment and even though the directions instruct mixing with water or apple cider vinegar, I prefer to use Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li> I love it - works really good</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It makes my face look nice every time i use it</li>
            <li> Love this mask make my face feel really good</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice but not gonna lie</li>
            <li> So make sure every time you use it, you replace the good to build your skin up.  </li>
            <li> I found that the absolute best results were to use the clay before you shower at night, then after you get out of the shower, when your skin is warm, use the cream.  </li>
            <li> It gets absorbed so much better and the results are the best.  </li>
            <li> I made my own foundation powder with it, and now my daughter it using the clay itself for a clay mask to treat acne, and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Let the mixture sit as a mask on my face for about 15 minutes and then washed the mixture off with warm water and a washcloth.</li>
            <li> but I liked it</li>
            <li> I have tried it with water and with warm milk with equally nice results.</li>
            <li> Really nice face mask, although I thought it was a mixture already made up, it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This brand is the more popular one, good cost for the amount and effective.</li>
            <li> To prevent clogging my drains, I take a bowl of warm water and dip a towel into it for removal.  </li>
            <li> I would gladly buy this again, or gift it to a friend or loved one.</li>
            <li> part of why it is effective is because of its aluminum</li>
            <li> to each their own.</li>
            <li> Had I known this product was so effective on sunburn</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s really finicky about her make-up and is always searching for the best setting powder.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s kind of tingling and feels like its working.</li>
            <li> Warm water and a wash cloth will do the trick.</li>
            <li> I saw this on youtube heard so many good things about it.</li>
            <li> I leave on for about 20-25 minutes and rinse off with warm water.</li>
            <li> I tried it 3 times and after removing the mask each time I would use a cotton pad to swipe on some Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of a process</li>
            <li> I dilute mine with a bit of warm water, I found it to burn my face.  </li>
            <li> I keep plastic forks handy to minimize lumps.</li>
            <li> I use a washcloth soaked in warm water to start loosening it</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m loving the results I get.</li>
            <li> so this is a nice change of pace.</li>
            <li> I grew up using the Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque and loved it until I discovered this magical stuff.  </li>
            <li> I am sure some of the stuff it remove from the skin are good things.</li>
            <li> When I read the reviews for this products, I was honestly convinced by the fellow who wrote his review as an honest advertisement.</li>
            <li> I told her to take a tablespoon of the Aztec Clay and mix it with water, juice or whatever she liked and drink it before it congealed.  </li>
            <li> Then wash it off with warm water.</li>
            <li> I started off with warm water as instructed</li>
            <li> After hearing so many good things about this mask, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Still no improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Giving it 3 stars because it still feels nice</li>
            <li> Which is kind of what it&#x27;s supposed to do at the beginning.</li>
            <li> Kind of a pain to do and requires some work,</li>
            <li> Wife liked it.</li>
            <li> When I started to use this mask once a week on the weekends I saw that they didn&#x27;t come out on their own, so I had to use a tool to extract it</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great prices!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much of the clay for your face so definitely an awesome value.</li>
            <li> already so I liked the idea that I could mix it with this mask.</li>
            <li> I have to say it&#x27;s taken me a few uses to perfect the amount of vinegar to clay ratio, so you would have to try what&#x27;s best for you.</li>
            <li> This is not a mask you use to relax, this is the kind of mask that means business.</li>
            <li> I dab my face with a warm washcloth, filling a basin with water, and try to get the majority of it off there</li>
            <li> It really is the best way to mix it...</li>
            <li> your smoother, tighter, pore-less skin!a zip-lock type bag and THANKS to that awesome tip</li>
            <li> It really is the best way to mix it...</li>
            <li> I liked it .</li>
            <li> Packaged good will order more</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t get a nice layer on.</li>
            <li> I use this with warm water to remove.</li>
            <li> You can make your own recipes, do what you want.</li>
            <li> I also use rose water afterwards</li>
            <li> Washing it off is kind of a pain though.</li>
            <li> use a face towel with warm water.</li>
            <li> I mostly use Paula&#x27;s Choice products and try to practice good skin care rules (like Np smoking,</li>
            <li> I waited 25 minutes and rinsed it off with warm water.</li>
            <li> I honestly didnt think it would be so effective since I have used every treatment under the sun</li>
            <li> But more water was actually good.</li>
            <li> good product love it.</li>
            <li> It is especially useful for people who struggle with acne.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t find it anything spectacular.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;LAVENDER - Soothing and softening, lavender is not just good for your skin, but a couple of drops will also mask the overwhelming scents of apple cider vinegar, tea tree and/or neem</li>
            <li> I use this to make my own glamglow mask dupe.</li>
            <li> I like that because I can create my own consistency.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this product while looking for petal rose witch hazel and cannot believe I haven&#x27;t heard about it before.</li>
            <li> , honestly I don&#x27;t see no difference in my skin</li>
            <li> When I saw this product and its great reviews, I figured, &amp;#34;why not try it?&amp;#34; After only one use, I&#x27;m really impressed.</li>
            <li> Or better yet, invest in a good micro-dermabrasion brush</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s nice as well.</li>
            <li> Loved it more with the vinegar.  </li>
            <li> But honestly I think it works well on any skin type.</li>
            <li> i just use warm water and a face cloth...</li>
            <li> The biggest draw for me though is honestly just the value.</li>
            <li> thayer&#x27;s witch hazel rose</li>
            <li> have nice skin (from what I’m told) but</li>
            <li> I can tell this product will be good to make my face look :)</li>
            <li> Also recommend getting a lotion that has nice herbs in it</li>
            <li> Kind of iffy if you ask me.</li>
            <li> I liked it.</li>
            <li> I liked it.</li>
            <li> It was wonderful, just tablespoon was all you needed for your whole face.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to use nice skin lotion and serum after this.</li>
            <li> If you want to be more precise and match the ideal pH of the skin, you could always use pH strips to test your mixture.</li>
            <li> I hop in the shower and let the warm water take the mask off for me.</li>
            <li> nice product</li>
            <li> Use this to make my own tooth powder.</li>
            <li> so I am going to devise my own treatments.</li>
            <li> but I think all kinds of clay mask can have this kind of effect.</li>
            <li> I think this clay powder makes a nice face mask couple times a week when you want to pamper yourself.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice mask,</li>
            <li> ACV is SO good for your skin and it just helps heal it so much better than water.</li>
            <li> I was kind of scared to try vinegar again</li>
            <li> In the mornings, I rinse with warm water, then use witch hazel as a toner.</li>
            <li> so I was kind of concerned about getting this as a starter</li>
            <li> I would tried to savor it because i don&#x27;t have much money to buy another one but who knows :D</li>
            <li> and it foamed and made a nice foamy paste to paint on with a brush.</li>
            <li> It might come in handy then.</li>
            <li> But because I find that using ginger on my face as asks is just as effective .</li>
            <li> To avoid some of this irritation, when you go to take the mask off, try using a warm washcloth and pressing it to your face to soften the clay.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;this is my honest experience with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> kind of a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I honestly am so grateful I found this when I did…</li>
            <li> would give it 5 stars, but i&#x27;d like to wait and see if it continues to work effectively.</li>
            <li> i have sugested to all my firemds to own n</li>
            <li> It kind of clumps to the face.  </li>
            <li> The mask did itch while it was on and was a bit of a challenge to get on without a brush of some kind.</li>
            <li> I use it to make my own toothpaste, face powder and as a face mask.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done a bunch of research on good &#x27;ol google which helped me to understand it better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done a bunch of research on good &#x27;ol google which helped me to understand it better.</li>
            <li> It seems to work quite well, and i&#x27;m entertained with my own antics.</li>
            <li> I do recommend as others that you wipe off the clay with warm water instead of wash off in sink.  </li>
            <li> I did feel a nice pulsing and didnt mind the redness since it went away after i applied lotion.</li>
            <li> Washed it off with warm water</li>
            <li> I have tried every prescription, and over the counter product there is, and I can honestly say that nothing has truly ever worked for me.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> Has a nice tingly feeling.</li>
            <li> after rinsing with warm washcloths or jumping in the shower your skin should be all prepped to do some extractions.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;3)1 teaspoon of apple cider (acv)&lt;br /&gt;4)3 teaspoons of warm water</li>
            <li> (so make sure you have a good moisturizer once you wash it off).</li>
            <li> I have know idea how it could have gotten so many good reviews.</li>
            <li> Just use warm water and maybe a wash cloth.</li>
            <li> &amp; also my face doesn&#x27;t warm up or pulsate from it like everyone else</li>
            <li> I am told I have nice skin already</li>
            <li> Rinse with warm water and remove with washcloth.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s kind of a hustle having to prepare it</li>
            <li> the result is Good and Amazing:)</li>
            <li> With warm water and paper towels it did come off in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use the clarisonic brush and warm water since it works well.</li>
            <li> You can honestly feel your face pulsing as it hardens.</li>
            <li> Nice clay mask for bi weekly treatment.</li>
            <li> I am a beautician and I have seen and used plenty of products on all skin types, including my own.</li>
            <li> Mix feelings; nice texture</li>
            <li> ...make sure you use plenty of good moisturizer after you remove the mask.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I haven&#x27;t thought of just mixing my own clay masks at home before.</li>
            <li> I liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> My skin looks really, really nice.</li>
            <li> A good manual for the specifics of using this clay would have been more beneficial, as in measurements for a face mask and some tips for blending the clay with water.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m honestly amazed.  </li>
            <li> Also use this moisturizer, Its Popular in my country of Peru, Called &amp;#34;Portugal Concha De Nacar&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Breakout, pore size, and redness have been losing their fight on my face and I am so thrilled.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this kind of reaction to any mud masks before.    </li>
            <li> have found the mask to be extremely effective in cleaning my pores.</li>
            <li> I am loving it.</li>
            <li> and I just haven&#x27;t had the good results that so many people have had.  </li>
            <li> Made my skin feel nice.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for something that would be effective in that area.  </li>
            <li> Loving this clay mask.  </li>
            <li> Kind of nice and relaxing.</li>
            <li> have kind of a ball point nose.</li>
            <li> Great product and very economical on the pockets.</li>

            <li> I love love love this mask!!</li>
            <li> Its cheap and very effective clarifying mask.</li>
            <li> but it does a great job and your face feels so nice and clean after.</li>
            <li> The mask is great, but the logistics of mixing and clean up is kind of a pain in the arse.&lt;br /&gt;Meh.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m honestly really happy and excited about this masque.</li>
            <li> It is very affordable and very effective!</li>
            <li> My original choice will remain my go-to product as I am happy with it,</li>
            <li> the first couple times I used it I think it did make my skin break out more, but I think it was just the &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34; because now my skin is the best it&#x27;s ever been!</li>
            <li> Try my regimen and see for yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excuse me while I go out and enjoy this beautiful day and not let acne ruin my life :)</li>
            <li> Try my regimen and see for yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excuse me while I go out and enjoy this beautiful day and not let acne ruin my life :)</li>
            <li> She has not complained so if mama&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> But it give a great clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just the perfect solution for my particular type of skin</li>
            <li> Great product, it leaves your skin feeling soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li> It is easy to rinse off and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> As an esthetician with more than 20 years experience, I can tell you that this is an exceptional mask.  </li>
            <li> Nothing Exceptional or magical  ..</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, however it is very strong.</li>
            <li> Taking it off with warm water was very easy...</li>
            <li> I found that while pimples weren&#x27;t exactly popping out of my face, the mask did do a very good job of purifying my skin OVER TIME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this and the price is excellent.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I had high expectations for this product after seeing the excellent reviews.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly quite impressed at this product drawing out all the impurities and it most certainly feels like it does that.</li>
            <li> Works great and arrived right on time!</li>
            <li> I used this product 5 out of 7 days my first week and it brought out an incredible amount of gunk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased and would recommend it :).</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m so incredibly relieved I was willing to give this mask a shot.  </li>
            <li> cheap and effective!  </li>
            <li> Excellent product, super fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li> and my pores were clean!!</li>
            <li> I always feel flawless after using this mask, it will leave your skin looking brand new.</li>
            <li> After about 10 minutes, rinsed with warm water and 99% of all impurities were gone, my face felt smooth and bright.</li>
            <li> Great stuff... leaves my incomparably skin smooth for days, and helps prevent breakouts!</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and I have an amazing glow :D</li>
            <li> Also, while this clay is awesome, you still need to figure out the root cause of your acne and get on a healthy skin care and diet routine to really combat any skin issues.</li>
            <li> skin isn&#x27;t perfect, but it is a whole lot better.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on easily, it doesn&#x27;t feel good</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply and felt good after putting on.  </li>
            <li> My skin looked so smooth, revitalized, fresh and happy!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think peeling it off is a good or healthy idea as I would think it more damaging that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting more based on so many good reviews...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but for me the apple cider vinegar was too strong had to use aloe Vera juice</li>
            <li> You can easily remove a good chunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also works great for the quick redness/acne overnight spot treatment when you see one popping up.</li>
            <li> It works super great.  </li>
            <li> Probably the thing I&#x27;m most impressed with, though, is that it does not seem to be drying out my very prone-to-dryness skin.</li>
            <li> I have a brown tanned face, I tan very easily</li>
            <li> my face dries out very easily</li>
            <li> While using the apple cider vinegar it was very easy to mix.</li>
            <li> Very easy to mix.  </li>
            <li> To me the mask washed off very easily..</li>
            <li> It comes off very easily then.</li>
            <li> This is a very strong powder not a cream.</li>
            <li> Very strong.</li>
            <li> Very easy to burn your face.</li>
            <li> The clay mixes very easily with the vinegar</li>
            <li> Very strong pulling sensation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used anything like it, it&#x27;s very strong.</li>
            <li> and it was very easy to apply and to wipe off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Application was very easy to both my face and my hair.</li>
            <li> so I hyper pigment very easily.  </li>
            <li> Its very easy to use.and</li>
            <li> But the more iv used it the better results I see!</li>
            <li> It has many, many uses for it: including body wraps!</li>
            <li> Yesterday was the first time using this and loved it!</li>
            <li> Pretty good mask!</li>
            <li> Just in the very first application, it&#x27;s wiped out a ton (but not all) of my blackheads, tightened my pores, and given my skin a great tone.</li>
            <li> i have used it three times and each time my skin has gotten better and better!</li>
            <li> Use your favorite, most nourishing skin cream afterwards, and your skin will soak it up!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li> Pretty good!</li>
            <li> i think this is my first good review in 5 years!</li>
            <li> I know that a mask is not going to do miracles like they all advertise but for a good, pampering self-induced spa night, this is a fine choice.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so smooth and feels so clean!!!</li>
            <li> And super cheap uet extremely effective !!</li>
            <li> Geez was I one happy camper after I used this for the first time!  </li>
            <li> Geez was I one happy camper after I used this for the first time!  </li>
            <li> Great item, exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> LOL  jokes on her because after a month of using this once a week my face is so clean and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> So happy love it on my face and hair feels so clean after using the.</li>
            <li> For sure it was just going to take a regimen to clean out those pores (yes clay does swell greatly in water, and when it dries, it can pull in moisture, oils, organics from its surroundings.</li>
            <li> But it is very good for your skin, so I breathed through my mouth the whole time.  </li>
            <li> very good product just as described, thanks</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re very fair skinned be ready for that, but no need for alarm.</li>
            <li> the powder is fine and can fly all over), for an excellent drawing facial mask, I have applied to my body in the shower as a &#x27;mud bath&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This natural calcium bentonite clay is especially great for oily skin.</li>
            <li> So far the best benefit this clay has given</li>
            <li> It is by far the best clay mask I have ever used.</li>
            <li> :) Even my hubs used it with me and liked it.</li>
            <li> if the results prove to be more than a non harmful mask-- just not as effective as they claim.</li>
            <li> it seems to calm the inflammation, diminishes the look of the pores, and feels great.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a great product and worth giving it a shot.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, there is so many diy mask you can make with this miracle product</li>
            <li> Suitable for problematic skin and also maintaining a beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> So a believe and a non believe is sold on this amazing pore shrinking, CHEAP product!CHEAP product!</li>
            <li> I researched a lot of products and saw this and thought, it&#x27;s cheap and has a lot of good reviews, why not try it?</li>
            <li> this by far is the best treatment for it.</li>
            <li> I suggest using it twice a week for near flawless skin!</li>
            <li> i splashed warm water and with my fingers adn adding more water it washed off..</li>
            <li> This makes your face feel nice and smooth!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> After rinsing it off most of the products I apply kind of burn.</li>
            <li> Fun to do and works great.</li>
            <li> And this by far is the best face mask!</li>
            <li> But its fun to use lol.</li>
            <li> For the price- this is the best thing I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> a guaranteed customer from now own, infact I might go ahead and stock up:)</li>
            <li> Wow - this stuff is great!  </li>
            <li> okay liked this product but didn&#x27;t know I had to mix it myself.</li>
            <li> Amazing Product :) Helped My Skin After One Use.</li>
            <li> Wow, so impressed.</li>
            <li> I immediately realized I would need a lot more water to loosen up the clay, so I did end up hanging my head over the tub rinsing with warm water and my hands.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like a fairy waved her wand and made all my blemishes go away, but my face is smooth, and the bumpy clogged pores I had everywhere have shrunk a good deal.</li>
            <li> By far the best acne product I have tried.</li>
            <li> it shrinks my pores and gives my skin a nice healthy glow.</li>
            <li> because it is the best all natural anti-aging cream I have found, it&#x27;s oil based, so it gives your skin what it needs and doesn&#x27;t encourage over production of oil.  </li>
            <li> When your skin is warm from the shower, it absorbs the anti-aging cream even better.  </li>
            <li> I have tried hundreds of masque&#x27;s for my skin and this is by far the best one I have ever used!</li>
            <li> This is awesome i have clear skin now</li>
            <li> Give your face atleast 5 days before using this again, it works more effectively.</li>
            <li> so your face doesn&#x27;t feel dry.&lt;br /&gt;This is a really great product and definitely worth the try.</li>
            <li> A good daily cleanser (acne.org has a great one), a good exfoliator in between mud applications (anything with a variety of skin acids like glycolic, lactic, citric, malic, etc - pH of 4.5-5), mud once or twice a week, and oil/moisturizer every day is working wonders for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love aveeno night cream, the soy is amazing for it.</li>
            <li> WOW I am so impressed.</li>
            <li> I feel refreshed and cleansed on an indescrible level, but best of all its 100% natural.</li>
            <li> So far this stuff is great!</li>
            <li> I had a nice healthy glow after using it that I didn&#x27;t get from the clay mask.  </li>
            <li> I liked this clay, it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> If you purchase, try it with apple cider vinegar, in my experience it seems to be more effective with ACV (with Mother) than with water.</li>
            <li> I have tried most of the popular acne kits/products.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the price for one pound, I&#x27;d honestly pay more for this stuff.</li>
            <li> It takes away all of the excess oil and dries out all the acne, leaving my skin wonderful feeling and clear.  </li>
            <li> i wish my face was bright and smooth</li>
            <li> as far as masks go, the best one i have ever used.</li>
            <li> By far thee best mask I have ever used.</li>
            <li> know since it&#x27;s cheap &amp; there are a lot of good reviews</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my skin feel wonderful and helps clear out my pores.  </li>
            <li> It COMPLETELY removed all the stubborn blackheads from the creases of my nose, and that is a wonderful feeling.</li>
            <li> Natural is allways the best way, you can literally feel this mask sucking the dirt out of your pores</li>
            <li> just try it once yet, it feels smooth after i wash it away from my face, hope it as good as it writes</li>
            <li> This is by far the best mask I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely much more effective with Apple Cider Vinegar</li>
            <li> I would recommend using it with the Apple Cider Vinegar (I find it more effective).</li>
            <li> I am introducing it to more people and they are loving it as well.</li>
            <li> It works great and is powerful.</li>
            <li> By far the best mask I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I mix it with apple cider vinegar and it makes my face feel so rejuvenated, this is by far the best face mask I have ever used</li>
            <li> in all this is a great purchase and totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> Is it more effective if I use Apple cider vinegar instead?</li>
            <li> This is by far the best clay mask I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin its taken me years to perfect my cleaning regimen</li>
            <li> It works great, clears my pores and my face feels fresh.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS AMAZING</li>
            <li> Like smooth whipped cream, not lumpy like the first time :D</li>
            <li> It also helped my curls to look great right after.</li>
            <li> right after there skin looked great and the day after was glowing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the miricle solution, but is a very fine clay.</li>
            <li> it could easily create a clog!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a powder, is very fine and can get everywhere</li>
            <li> Sometimes I will use microdermabrasion afterwards (very fine grit) and a Tepezcohuite cream from ASDM Beverly Hills to moisturize.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy peasy!</li>
            <li> but this is a very finely ground powder.  </li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s a very fine powder</li>
            <li> Thank you for the very quick shipping and competitive rate!</li>
            <li> This is a jar of clay dust, very fine.</li>
            <li> Making homemade masks is so easy!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> as others have mentioned its definitely strong but it does the job!</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>
            <li> I love love love it!  </li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>
            <li> It cleansed our pores wonderfully, removed blackheads, and I could not stop touching my skin, it was so soft!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would strongly recommend as a mask for anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li> good things take time, and this is worth the wait!</li>
            <li> And make sure to have a very good moisturizer after because it really dries up your skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even get anything out of it with the tool; so I am assuming my nose is &#x27;squeaky clean&#x27; !! :)</li>
            <li> Kind of excited!</li>
            <li> AND for ANY new buyers that want more information of my experience, I would be MORE than happy to help!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been perfect ever since applying this always right after a nice pore opening hot shower.</li>
            <li> Such a great value for a great product</li>
            <li> Its a great detoxing, tightening great facial mask.</li>
            <li> I have used many products but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Great value- just add water and apple cider vinegar for a great facial mask</li>
            <li> Face feels so clean so good.</li>
            <li> I would pay 10 times more for this great product, but thankfully it is super cheap!</li>
            <li> Far be it from me to not try the latest and greatest skin-oriented snake oil</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing (and yucky at the same time), but its the best way to get your pores flushed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing (and yucky at the same time), but its the best way to get your pores flushed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After two uses of this clay, my pores have shrunk significantly and my pimple rose to the top and came out!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure more results will come :) but make sure to moisturizer after you use it!</li>
            <li> Once washed off your face is thrilled to be clean!  </li>
            <li> this is my first time using this product and it feels like it is doing something great</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t try to scrub it off, just wash it off nice and easy.</li>
            <li> I used a warm water wash cloth to rinse off the mask, and it came off easily.</li>
            <li> cleans pores super good</li>
            <li> really great, i agree with all the positive feedback.</li>
            <li> great product, I purchased it because of overwhelmingly positive reviews.</li>
            <li> After years of looking for a good mask I cant believe how cheap and easy this is.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend using apple cider vinegar to create the mixture instead of water, as it is more effective.</li>
            <li> My face felt very smooth and my pores look better already.</li>
            <li> The clay goes on very smoothly and is refreshing on the face.</li>

            <li> She has very fair, sensitive skin, as do I.  </li>
            <li> I have very fair, sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It was very good for my natural hair.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I have used better masks but this mask does a great job with reducing large pores.</li>
            <li> It actually mixed very nicely into a creamy texture, and felt pleasant when I put it on my skin.  </li>
            <li> The container was huge!</li>
            <li> I could already feel a huge difference!</li>
            <li> and i already see a huge difference !</li>
            <li> it made my pores huge!</li>
            <li> and they are still huge!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend using ACV to mix instead of water - it mixes MUCH better and ACV also has acne fighting properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really draws out the oils and dirt from your pores :) great mask for acne prone skin ..</li>
            <li> Recommend it ! :)</li>
            <li> and that is way more</li>
            <li> I also started putting it on the top of my hands and fingers.</li>
            <li> but this is something that I can relate to people the most.</li>
            <li> There are so many products that don&#x27;t help for people with combination skin</li>
            <li> :)e done-</li>
            <li> but this is something that I can relate to people the most.</li>
            <li> There are so many products that don&#x27;t help for people with combination skin</li>
            <li> I have to say i am so glad i did.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d love to see how that works.</li>
            <li> and you will love the improvement of your skin</li>
            <li> Make sure to use a plastic spoon and bowl to mix, not metal.</li>
            <li> Still love it.</li>
            <li> Nothing worked better for my skin, really!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m hoping that this will really be as magical as many of the reviews claim.  </li>
            <li> I have not used many face products and have abused my face by not giving it the care it needed.</li>
            <li> and I did not expect it to do wonders either, but it did do something that made me fall in love with this product.</li>
            <li> Will update my review if it does anything to the &amp;#34;experience and wisdom&amp;#34; signs on my forehead :)</li>
            <li> For me, it didn&#x27;t exfoliate my skin any better than just scrubbing my face with a washcloth.</li>
            <li> i bought it to my mom and she really love it</li>
            <li> about 12 minutes in I did feel the \\&quot;pulsating\\&quot; sensation others have mentioned, mostly around my nose and temples.  </li>
            <li> and I sure don&#x27;t want to rip it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> Make sure you wash your face before using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad i did.  </li>
            <li> So glad I stayed up that one night and made this purchase.</li>
            <li> My mother was very happy with it because it was actually recommended by her dermatologist.</li>
            <li> This stuff is ok.</li>
            <li> A Baking soda mask worked better for my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> but I have been able to diminish the scares that I have acquired over the years.</li>
            <li> I make sure that when I mix it with Bragg&#x27;s Organic Apple Cider that the texture is silky and whipped.</li>
            <li> so I am sure you could also use strips on your chin and forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so pleased</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> I like it better than most face masks.</li>
            <li> I think it does better.</li>
            <li> I purchased the big jar and i am happy to say i will not regret it!</li>
            <li> it makes you skin so nice and smooth</li>
            <li> For me, mixing with water worked better than mixing with apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> Also, be sure to mix well.</li>
            <li> The pimples look way better after the mask treatment.</li>
            <li> It also seems to tighten the skin more, the more you put on.</li>
            <li> Plus, if you like to FEEL something to know its working, you will love this mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also seems to tighten the skin more, the more you put on.</li>
            <li> Overall I think this is the best mud mask out there.</li>
            <li> Plus, if you like to FEEL something to know its working, you will love this mask.  </li>
            <li> Maybe more practice.  </li>
            <li> fell in love with it-</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels as it dries and know that I&#x27;m not putting chemicals on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
            <li> It will crackle and fizz - congrats, the magic is working.</li>

            <li> this product coz most of the reviews have said that.</li>
            <li> love how it feels and makes your skin feel afterwards</li>
            <li> Mix it with apple cider vinegar and it works like magic :)</li>
            <li> My face was smooth, cleared up ALL zits within days, and is so amazing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this product and my mom too haha</li>
            <li> I must say this is the best facial I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, I can&#x27;t imagine too many working as well as this product.  </li>
            <li> I will make her a batch with the vinegar to see if she likes that one better.</li>
            <li> So cheap but so amazing.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this holy grail of skin care.</li>
            <li> I wish I was pore to use it more often</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Hope to see more improvement in skin texture as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to moisturize afterwards.</li>
            <li> (make sure it&#x27;s organic) and a brush.</li>

            <li> cause I felt soo much better.</li>
            <li> My skin appears to be more radiant.  </li>

            <li> Love it as a treatment I use it 2-3 times a week</li>
            <li> Will update with more reviews</li>
            <li> This clay has literally changed my skin for the better.</li>
            <li> You can feel the mask tightening better than any mask i&#x27;ve worn before.</li>
            <li> the amount that you get for the price too, it&#x27;s definitely the best deal.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really AWESOME and will be purchasing on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I am so pleased with my skin.  </li>
            <li> It is so cheap too!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used much better masks that I didn&#x27;t have to spend any time mixing up</li>
            <li> I tried so many things, but nothing was helping.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Love it give it a try for the price</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2 months or more...</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve tried more products than I could ever count.</li>
            <li> Really, I am SO pleased.</li>
            <li> Really, I am SO pleased.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Although I didn&#x27;t purchase from Amazon, I recently purchased this at The Vitamin Shoppe, and I must say, after 2 uses, I am impressed with the &#x27;after&#x27; results.  </li>
            <li> Who wouldn&#x27;t love that??</li>
            <li> I was just better off not using it.</li>
            <li> I was just better off not using it.</li>
            <li> and I gave it so many chances</li>
            <li> Love love love this product.</li>
            <li> PUTTING IT ON: make sure to thoroughly cleanse your face.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s not coming off, that just means you need more</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s not coming off, that just means you need more</li>
            <li> I have tried so many things(OTC and prescription)</li>
            <li> I have to say that I&#x27;ve used many masks and cleaners for my face.</li>
            <li> Ok product  the mixture is lumpy when mixing with water</li>
            <li> Good &amp; economical mask.</li>
            <li> Okay,</li>
            <li> I love this clay.  </li>
            <li> You can use it many times before you even start to make a dent in the powder.</li>
            <li> Make sure to crack most of it off over a trashcan because it can clog your pipes and drains since it is clay.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> (frankly I don&#x27;t see the point of using it with water since you don&#x27;t get the satisfying pulsing effect).</li>
            <li> This product seems like it&#x27;s more for skin improvement than acne.</li>
            <li> then this will not be the magic end</li>
            <li> This is the best facial mask I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of beauty items.</li>
            <li> cleaner skin than when I go to my lovely West Hollywood spa.</li>
            <li> After taking birth control, my acne got better and stayed like that for a year.</li>
            <li> I tried so many things.</li>
            <li> But I can say for sure this helped me out.</li>
            <li> Now my acne is so much better form using it twice a week.</li>
            <li> my skin has never felt so smooth!</li>
            <li> so if you think you can handle the vinigar then you may have even better results than this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hearing rave reviews about this product and that fact that it&#x27;s multipurpose makes it even better.  </li>
            <li> Use Apple Cider vinegar if your skin can tolerate it for better results.</li>
            <li> Great Product, fast delivery</li>
            <li> I use the Garnier Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel-Cream.</li>
            <li> I use the Garnier Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel-Cream.</li>
            <li> I love this for DYI face masks.  </li>
            <li> So this is one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> Its just OK in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My skin does look better but it did not reduce the pores as well as I would have like.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this clay.</li>
            <li> so I was more motivated to buy</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Bentonite Indian Healing Clay.</li>
            <li> must say this is fabulous!</li>
            <li> Save 70$ or more n</li>
            <li> bought 2 more for gifts.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> I am sure it probably said that in the product description, but I missed it.  </li>
            <li> I am ok with that though.  </li>
            <li> It is more like cottage cheese.  </li>
            <li> It is just ok.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> but I used it many times within a month</li>
            <li> and it never got better.</li>
            <li> So Apple cider vinegar or lemon juice is best , since both are equally acidic.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff....</li>
            <li> Love this clay will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Then I put a plastic cap on for about 20 minutes, THOROUGHLY rinsed it all out and then conditioned hair and scalp with TRESemme Naturals Nourishing Moisturizing Conditioner (my favorite).</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It cleaned my pores and my skin hasn&#x27;t looked better.</li>
            <li> I love the pulsating, tight,tingling feeling</li>
            <li> Love this for skin and hair</li>
            <li> im sure its doing the cleaning...</li>
            <li> my whole life??&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin look and feel great.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
            <li> so that’s what I used to paint the mixture on more evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so that’s what I used to paint the mixture on more evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used it for a week, every day (a lot of people said you should use it every day for a while and then magic happens.  </li>
            <li> and I love this.  </li>
            <li> Okay.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s OK, you know its working.</li>
            <li> more mud for your cleansing pleasure.</li>
            <li> I cried because I thought it would never get better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this clay.</li>
            <li> sure you mix with apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> I still have a lot more product to go</li>
            <li> skin likes to stay more acidic</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop touching it.</li>
            <li> Used on all my family members and my dad fell in love. .</li>
            <li> I absolutely love giving myself this mask because it squeezes and pops pimples (if any) for me.</li>
            <li> I sure looked like an iguana.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> and I will be buying more of it soon.</li>
            <li> Now, I got what I paid for and I am about to pay more since I&#x27;m meeting a skin specialist tomorrow.</li>
            <li> Bentonite Clay is perfectly safe for your drains, even if you have a septic system.</li>
            <li> and found that it is even safe for septic systems.</li>
            <li> I make sure to moisturize immediately after, then wait an hour to do</li>
            <li> and my oh my it was the BEST facial ever</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had many.</li>
            <li> allows more flushing of the drain.&lt;br /&gt;Tip</li>
            <li> I love having time to make masks.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products over the years and nothing has worked.</li>
            <li> but I know I&#x27;ll be using it twice a week because I love the way it feels.&lt;br /&gt;Update: August 8th&lt;</li>
            <li> So glad I listened to the reviews on this.  </li>
            <li> so glad now that I did.  </li>
            <li> I love how it tingles</li>
            <li> I leave it about 20 mins, as I can&#x27;t take more than that.</li>
            <li> Adjust with more clay or water as needed until you get your desired consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> The method someone suggested of mixing it in a ziplock baggy worked ok.</li>
            <li> My husband is very impressed because he had a very deep acne spot that has been hanging around for about 2 weeks going on 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Hope to see more with repeated use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month or more.</li>
            <li> Better than glam glow</li>
            <li> and I think this is best for internal use.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> There are tons of uses for this product, and I plan on trying them all. :)</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve always suffered from Acne and understand it takes more than once or twice to use a product to know if it will work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to save money and go more organic or &amp;#34;from the earth&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how to remove it without getting in in the drain</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll look through more posts and see what others are doing.</li>

            <li> My pores have also become more noticeable.</li>
            <li> and I love the results.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> so i wiped most of it off and then rinsed off.  </li>

            <li> Such a great product!</li>
            <li> The combination of completely cleaning your skin with this clay and then a great anti-aging cream is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this clay and the combination of the products</li>
            <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have some more tips.  </li>
            <li> I recommend using this once a week, twice a week at most.  </li>
            <li> If you have oily skin, it can cause your skin to produce more oil (because you are drying out your skin when you use it).</li>
            <li> Since I break out in the summer a bit, I use it twice a week, and it has helped more than anything else to keep my breakouts to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I break out in the summer a bit, I use it twice a week, and it has helped more than anything else to keep my breakouts to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really gives a great cleaning of the pores too.  </li>
            <li> Take your time and you will be pleased.</li>
            <li> I continued and eventually healthy glowing skin appeared.</li>
            <li> When you use apple cider vinegar is works 10 times better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have found such a good find</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get the magic effects I saw in the reviews, hoverer does not seem like it&#x27;s doing anything for me.</li>
            <li> My teenage girls use it and they have some of the best skin ever.</li>
            <li> I use it with apple cider vinegar and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I will add more to the review once I use it.</li>
            <li> I use it maybe a couple times a week at most.</li>
            <li> I will just make sure to moisturize... :)</li>

            <li> I brag to everyone about it and have gotten many people to buy this product.</li>

            <li> Hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> Woah, this stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li> and it probably wouldn&#x27;t be healthy to do it so often.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I love it</li>
            <li> i tried all the famous brands and nothing did anything for it.</li>
            <li> After 1 application, I can actually see beautiful muscular features!  </li>
            <li> I put 1 tablespoon of the clay in a ziploc bag and add one tablespoon plus a smidge more of ACV (apple cider vinegar) and mix/</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have many problems with acne anymore</li>
            <li> for selling such excellent products</li>
            <li> It was ok.</li>
            <li> Overall an awesome mask.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> And its better than any salon I&#x27;ve ever walked into.</li>
            <li> , I get more mud on my feet from gardening.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff...</li>
            <li> Therefore, having a disposable bowl and mixing utensil work better for me.</li>
            <li> But I love this clay.</li>
            <li> (Shea has more staying power and argan oil makes my eye makeup come off).</li>

            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love the effects the clay mask has on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Really love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I was sceptic about buying this product because most reviews described it as feeling &amp;#34;really clean&amp;#34; but I love this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been more than 24 hours</li>
            <li> The rest of my face is more elastic.</li>
            <li> I work in construction, and am out in the florid sun most of the day</li>
            <li> i could feel my skin was so much more smoother.</li>
            <li> I love the feel it gives when it&#x27;s in the process of drying</li>
            <li> But now I am prettier than most of em.</li>
            <li> better then Proactiv Mask.</li>
            <li> This mask is ok.</li>
            <li> Nothing magical.</li>
            <li> but I feel it is making a difference for the better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it does what it says it does, but I sure do love it.</li>
            <li> and I love to play spa from time to time</li>
            <li> My face feels and looks so much better after using it</li>
            <li> I really love this clay.</li>
            <li> Added fifth star upon editing :)</li>
            <li> After seeing so many stars and reviews for this product I had to order it and see for myself.  </li>
            <li> I love this clay mask.</li>
            <li> There are much better products on the market.</li>
            <li> I love using this mask.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use for many more years .</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this once a week now for a month and my skin is looking better.  </li>
            <li> and I love the product as well of course.</li>
            <li> The healing clay has worked well :) I&#x27;ve taken to using it once a week</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> so you may notice more breakouts to help speed this process, use it 2 days on and 1 day off until the purge is over.</li>
            <li> Thank you i&#x27;ll surely buy from you again..</li>
            <li> Will recommend for sure.  </li>
            <li> Really like this, it worked great to add in homemade shaving soap or as a face mask.</li>
            <li> Made a huge difference on my skin, really liked it.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite mask.</li>
            <li> My mom and cousin also love this product.</li>
            <li> And for most it does.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how many hours</li>
            <li> Best put, preventing breakouts is the ultimate goal.</li>
            <li> its a lot more of a hassle</li>
            <li> I have dyshidrotic eczema all over my hands but using this with apple cider vinegar rebalances the ph level of my skin giving it healthy vibrancy and speeds healing.</li>
            <li> I heard from many people that this can help with both.</li>
            <li> but I wish it did blackheads better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;:-)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a wonderful staple to my overall beauty regiment.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> i recommend making sure that you use more than what the directions tell you.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many high-end products to minimize my pore like Murad, philosophy etc, but none have worked wonders like this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I was not in a hurry to go anywhere because it took 30 to 40 mins.</li>
            <li> Enter the magic clay.</li>
            <li> I came up with a formula and method I use myself, but I&#x27;m sure everyone does it differently.&lt;br</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE...</li>
            <li> but I did place product in elegant glass bottles.</li>
            <li> I am glad I tried it...</li>
            <li> Love this stuff -</li>
            <li> MAGIC HAPPENS</li>
            <li> I love this mask.  </li>
            <li> Watched many youtube video instructions on how to use and it works well.</li>
            <li> I love how my skin feels after</li>
            <li> I think this product peeled the top layer of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Since there are so many reviews on the product itself, I thought I share one way to remove the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read many reviews and bought this on the basis of skin clarifying, pore shrinkage, etc.  </li>
            <li> , NONE have evinced the effects this one did, FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> I am madly in love with this mask.</li>
            <li> Each time I use it, me and my boyfriend immediately notice that my acne scars are more faded.</li>
            <li> Now I use it once a week to make sure nothing more happens.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it..</li>
            <li> this works much better with apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li> I love this powdered mask.....</li>
            <li> i love clay, i use clay</li>
            <li> it works for both cleansing and whitening my skin, which i just love and every woman should have some clay in her beauty drawer.</li>
            <li> I started a healthier lifestyle which gave me better results.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use plastic utensils to mix.</li>
            <li> but once you get used to it you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> The best thing about the product is actually wearing it, because it feels like your face is being sucked...</li>

            <li> I love using this stuff.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying it</li>
            <li> I recommend using with organic apple cider vinegar instead of water for better results.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> most def me buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> The tingling sensations are enjoyable, as well as the pulsating you will feel.</li>
            <li> Need I say more than what my title states.</li>
            <li> I really love how this product makes my skin feel after I have used it.</li>

            <li> My face looks and feel fantastic after using it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure my review will be buried under the masses of rave reviews, but I do have some helpful tips if any of you get a chance to see this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> BEST TIP - if you have any left over protein powder plastic scoops (c&#x27;mon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just choose to believe them over researching it more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just choose to believe them over researching it more.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin more on oily side esp my t zone.</li>
            <li> I was a tad iffy about ordering this, but I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love it, and I&#x27;m looking forward to using it again, and again, and again.</li>
            <li> It feel great, and really soothing.</li>

            <li> and you are safe.</li>

            <li> OK no pain</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I will give it one more chance, but it&#x27;s not looking like a miracle product.</li>
            <li> I mix it with vinegar and water both-work better than those otc masks that come in a tube</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure though that the breeze of the fan helped distract me from most of those sensations.</li>
            <li> Be sure to moisturize afterwards,</li>
            <li> It works better than any of the $100.+ products I have tried.</li>

            <li> It pull sin moisture from healthy cells.</li>
            <li> It really does a great job of cleaning.</li>

            <li> I just happened to be searching for an at home treatment mask and found this based on the top reviews....</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect because I read both 4/5 stars as well as 1/2 stars...</li>
            <li> Of course, as with many products on Amazon, I decided to take a chance.</li>
            <li> My hair &amp; scalp absolutely love this clay.  </li>
            <li> and it worked noticeably more (much more humming on the skin.)  </li>
            <li> this is for you, be sure to moisturize after</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s even better than the pore strips.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I come across a magical product for my scars and acne.</li>
            <li> This product sucked, made more pimples come out.</li>

            <li> I read most of the reviews</li>

            <li> I love the end results.</li>
            <li> My skins looks much better, clearer, and tighter.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>

            <li> I love</li>
            <li> I love this.  </li>
            <li> Love the way it makes me skin feel.</li>
            <li> but your face will feel so much better.</li>
            <li> If you add more layering on any spot with blackheads and peel it off, it removes them all.</li>
            <li> Such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I use it before bed and make sure to moisturize with a face lotion afterwards.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been more than a year</li>
            <li> Great item, very cleansing.</li>
            <li> I saw  improvements in the appearance of my skin, but waited a while longer before posting a review to make sure I am satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> more acne</li>
            <li> more will I have to pick pimples (AWESOME)&lt;br /&gt;Scars are disappearing (AMAZING!)&lt;br /&gt;My</li>

            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> people are just more vigilant about using it</li>
            <li> so it seems to work better...</li>
            <li> and I hope I haven&#x27;t screwed myself into having a zit filled picture with my students!</li>
            <li> I have also noticed my skin is much more smoother.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I love this mask.</li>

            <li> I love this stuff!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this mask.</li>
            <li> Used as a avail mask it does leave your face very red immediately after but goes away, so best to use in the evening</li>
            <li> I like the results even better than the Proactiv mask, which was my go-to mask before this.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make it go away, but makes it look better for a day</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews and I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the next best thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this product--used it before years ago.  </li>
            <li> I have the largest pores anyone could have and many blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li> I join the rest of the hundreds out there that love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, and love it.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;pulsating\\&quot; effect more than my body can,</li>
            <li> No dealing with getting it out from under your nails or drying your cuticles. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> No dealing with getting it out from under your nails or drying your cuticles. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I like this stuff, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really that great.</li>
            <li> since I just think it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> I love this stuff...</li>
            <li> and I love how I can feel it working...</li>
            <li> but I am pleasantly satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Love this mask.  </li>
            <li> I regret that I didn&#x27;t spend more for a better product.</li>
            <li> I accidentally ordered two jars.&lt;br /&gt;Toothpaste does a better job of cleaning pores.</li>
            <li> my face feels and looks better</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this mask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve mixed it with water and apple cider vinegar, I have to say the best mixture is with the vinegar.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> decided i&#x27;d try out a blackhead pore strip and this time the strip was filled with blackheads!</li>
            <li> Love this mask.</li>
            <li> I now have a prescription for acne that has gotten rid of most of it, but if I break out, this is still my go to product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen some mud masks try and sell for WAY more than this too</li>
            <li> Love it it reminds me of the glam glow mask but a lot cheaper</li>
            <li> i have three jars that&#x27;s how much I love it</li>
            <li> I love this clay.</li>
            <li> Ok I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Even better when you mix with some apple cider vinegar.  </li>
            <li> I love the way this cleans and tightens my skin.  </li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I want to love this.</li>
            <li> so I use the mask twice a week at most.</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin it will work okay for you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously magical, I love it.</li>
            <li> I am able to keep on for 15mins</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll cause more breakouts.</li>
            <li> I used Neutrogena Acne Lotion which is okay for a day or so-</li>
            <li> a cleanser works much better for before-bed routines.</li>
            <li> This is more of a morning or emergency treatment thing when you need immediate or drastic results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This is a great clay mask that works really well.</li>
            <li> The best way to describe the \\&quot;pulsating\\&quot; is like your pores are suffocated of oxygen and you can feel a \\&quot;heart beat\\&quot; pulse over your entire face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mask.</li>
            <li> yup, sure did.</li>
            <li> and I saw way more</li>
            <li> Watch this video where she talks about clay masks, I love her</li>
            <li> Best facial ever!!</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> so I am pleased with the amount.</li>
            <li> I am definitely glad I bought this and plan on using it once a week.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> but i heard many times about this mask, so i decided to buy it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t leave on for more than the time it says.</li>
            <li> ACV alone has many benefits for the skin.  </li>
            <li> , then you&#x27;ll need this more.</li>
            <li> I read that it was better to use apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li> It is a fantastic mask!  </li>
            <li> I make sure that I use lots of water to rinse out the bowl and to rinse my face when finished.</li>
            <li> This has been one of the best facial healing cleansers ever made.</li>
            <li> Cleared up my skin and made it feel tighter:).</li>
            <li> This is a phenomenal product.</li>
            <li> my friend love it</li>
            <li> this stuff is greater</li>
            <li> But my face does feel really smooth after I take it off!</li>
            <li> The smell is okay.</li>
            <li> It does not smell like you are in a field of flowers or surrounded by mangoes like most beauty products do, but I am okay with that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love witch hazel.</li>
            <li> If that doesn’t work, I will gladly reorder this</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so SMOOTH!</li>
            <li> I also love all the benefits it has.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure by now we all know the lovely product that is coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Even longer if you take better care of them.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of varieties of different ingredients added to the sponges, so I am sure you can find one that works best for your skin.</li>

            <li> I love it..</li>
            <li> I love when it tightens  on your face.</li>
            <li> Magical.</li>
            <li> If you know what you&#x27;re doing, it&#x27;s ok, I guess.</li>
            <li> My skin feels great and you really do see a difference</li>
            <li> Be sure to put a paper towel over your sink so the clay doesn&#x27;t clog your sink.</li>
            <li> BEST FACIAL MASK EVER:</li>
            <li> Glad that i purchased.</li>

            <li> I love this mask.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for anything - cleaner skin, a refreshing feeling, clearing up of pores, etc.</li>

            <li> Way better than any prescription I&#x27;ve ever been prescribed.</li>
            <li> Bentonite clay plus apple cider vinegar equals the best facial you have ever!!  </li>
            <li> i love this face mask.</li>
            <li> I tried it once and fell in love</li>
            <li> /&gt;It will also bring up dirt under skin that u didn&#x27;t know was there, thus creating more pimples in the beginning phase of use.</li>
            <li> Am looking forward to using more frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> but I also am pleased with the Amazonian clay mask, and will update this review of the results continue to impress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and they have all fallen in love with it as well.  </li>

            <li> skin look more healthy</li>

            <li> I love this stuff, it keeps my face from being so oily(which</li>
            <li> The texture of my skin appeared more even and my pores even looked</li>
            <li> I tried this because someone said it was better than glam</li>
            <li> I will order more just incase they run out, increase price or discontinue.</li>
            <li> Skin is looking OK..</li>
            <li> It feels like all the blood is rushed to the skin and is refreshed and healthy</li>
            <li> There are much better products out there.  </li>
            <li> Since I have an entire container of this product, I may try it again, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed nor</li>
            <li> I woke up the next morning and my skin looked great!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with my skin...</li>

            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it more than once or twice a week.</li>

            <li> /&gt;It can be a bit drying, so make sure you moisture after.</li>

            <li> I really, really enjoyed this face mask.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Will be buying more for presents to family and friends</li>

            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> I love how immediate the results are with this product.</li>
            <li> it was much more noticeable that my pores were smaller.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> now 3 weeks later it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> go youtube and search for this product, there are many videos shown how to do the mask.  </li>
            <li> You can even add a drop of tea tree oil (if it doesn&#x27;t irritate you) for more anti-bacterial effect.</li>
            <li> anyways im sure its nothing to worry about.</li>
            <li> then i apply my favorite cream or honey...</li>
            <li> but after using this item, i feel better.</li>
            <li> This stuff works some magic on your skin.</li>
            <li> And prevents more acne.</li>
            <li> so I rinse into a wash bucket, but I&#x27;ve read if you&#x27;re just doing it once a week it should be ok.</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t find it to be any better for producing &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> So glad I got it.</li>
            <li> I love the way it tightens and makes my face pulsate.</li>
            <li> too many friends to count have commented as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After most of it has come off my face</li>
            <li> skin looks radiant and healthy,</li>
            <li> what more could a girl ask for?</li>
            <li> Best facial mask I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> The next 1-2 days after using it is when I saw the best results</li>
            <li> and my skin is defiantly more evenly toned.</li>
            <li> and I never had more then like 5 zits at once.</li>
            <li> thats okay.  </li>
            <li> gives me more blackheads....</li>
            <li> but this is much better than nothing at all.</li>
            <li> She still prefers glam glow, but I prefer this because you get  SO MUCH MORE.</li>
            <li> Most of the reviews here address talk about the clay&#x27;s effectiveness for facials; I have never used it for that purpose but know it instead as a healing</li>
            <li> have since used this many times to help relieve pain associated with bumps and bruises and would recommend this stuff to anyone.</li>
            <li> So many mask don&#x27;t seem to do anything while drying, but this isn&#x27;t one of those.  </li>
            <li> I picked up mine at WFM but am glad to see it on here.</li>
            <li> It does froth, but it makes a nice smooth mask.</li>
            <li> Its so cheap, too!</li>
            <li> Its so cheap, too!</li>
            <li> and I have tried many skin products over the years...</li>
            <li> It works even better the longer you use it, so be patient.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I feel like I am breaking out more since using this product.  </li>
            <li> I am hoping that with more use over time this product will do what it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> love this stuff.</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m glad it worked for them</li>
            <li> Be sure you mix the clay with apple cider vinegar instead of water to prevent clumping.  </li>
            <li> You will feel your skin responds to them better.</li>
            <li> There are SO many grammatical errors in the discription</li>
            <li> Worked much better.</li>
            <li> I love how this makes my face and hair feel.</li>
            <li> I always make sure I have time for my face to &amp;#34;calm down&amp;#34; before going out and follow with an all-natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> better to use closer to bedtime..</li>
            <li> just mix up 1 part clay powder, 1 part ACV, and add water as needed to reach the desired consistency (make sure to not use anything metal as it will react with the chemical properties of the clay</li>
            <li> Mixed with vinegar, it is the best face mask I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> mostly dries (</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning a girl&#x27;s night in spa night with my lady friends soon :)</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE this.</li>
            <li> , it does not mix that we&#x27;ll with water,  but mixes better with apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> I have never used a deep cleanser that makes my skin feel this incredible!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m cheap!)</li>
            <li> I give four stars because I need to use more.</li>
            <li> This clay is literally magic in a jar.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I love this mask.</li>
            <li> Then after most of it&#x27;s off I take my shower.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this mask.</li>
            <li> Love it for acne control.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> but its making me break out more then ever.</li>
            <li> Make up stays better.  </li>
            <li> I guess I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect</li>
            <li> ok :) It also mixes better than water does with the clay.</li>
            <li> The ACV makes it into a better mask in my opinion.</li>
            <li> and it becomes more bearable.</li>
            <li> So spend the $9, &amp; give it a try! :-)</li>
            <li> Love this clay.</li>
            <li> more time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> more time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I thought adding vinegar to the mix might make my skin drier and irritate it more.</li>
            <li> it says you can use it more a week if yoy have problrms.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve waited like a month to see improvement and each day I would wake with more break outs.</li>
            <li> I love how I feel after I remove it from my face</li>
            <li> Rinsing off was the most challenging</li>
            <li> I am sure there are more uses for it as well.</li>
            <li> I hope as I continue using it I will see better results.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> OK experience, but</li>
            <li> Remember that you are supposed to use this with ACV not water, ACV is great for your skin so the combination of these two really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I love this product...</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE....</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased this product because it is heaven sent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do water because I feel it provides me with more results if I do it with Apple Vinegar Cider.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clearer and more radiant for sure.</li>
            <li> Oh well, I have more than I need for a while.</li>
            <li> I LOVE MY JAR OF DIRT</li>
            <li> Do not be deceived by its price because the product is better than that.</li>
            <li> I even tried it on my boyfriend and his skin got better.</li>
            <li> and I figured it made more sense to buy something with the $7.00 that otherwise would have gone to non-free shipping.</li>
            <li> I feel my skin pulsate and all of the gunk that&#x27;s been deep within my pores comes to surface, (remove in any method you find best)</li>
            <li> Plus for the most part is helps to control acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> It has a tightening effect for sure.</li>
            <li> Love this product, arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I love this clay mask.</li>
            <li> I love love this clay.</li>
            <li> My mom loves it as well:)</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been many years since I have written a review here</li>
            <li> and I always get compliments when I go out after using it :)</li>
            <li> it works wonders on problem skin :)</li>
            <li> My skin was smoother &amp; looked more radiant.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> My acne is going away :)</li>
            <li> (I use a designated makeup fan brush) let semi-dry then add one more layer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite the bumpy start, I love this clay for my masks.</li>
            <li> If you didn&#x27;t have luck with this clay, I would suggest changing the liquid you used to mix it. :)</li>
            <li> Overall I am very impressed.</li>
            <li> Mixing with apple cider as suggested is like a science experiment, making it more &amp;#34;guy-friendly&amp;#34; to my husband.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this mask</li>
            <li> I love this mask.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than the many creams and cleaners my dermatologist gave me.  </li>
            <li> This is simply the best there is.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product, and I thought, well, sure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up purchasing something from The Body Shop, which worked a bit better (for me).</li>
            <li> Be sure not to put it too close to your eyes.  </li>
            <li> bottom line i love this.</li>
            <li> and i do see a difference in using it 1 time.. :)</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> Make sure you have apple cider vinegar as the instructions tell you to mix it with it.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with product</li>
            <li> Just make sure to have apple cider vinegar on hand to mix.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this mask.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> This product is outstanding.</li>
            <li> A ok</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s better to do this when you&#x27;re planning to stay in for the night.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this clay for myself as well as my parents whom both love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product, have used it for years &amp; will continue.  </li>
            <li> My skin has never been better and my wrinkles have magically decreased&lt;br</li>
            <li> And you can use rosewater that you can purchase on Amazon, and I&#x27;ve heard that it works even better with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> love this alternative to shampoo. :-)</li>
            <li> so I safely popped them as well.</li>
            <li> so I could examine my skin better.</li>
            <li> so I could examine my skin better.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> Will recommend this for sure.</li>
            <li> Best facial product i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Much better for my house drain to rinse</li>
            <li> I had no problem mixing it but ended up needing more Apple Cider Vinegar than the recommended ratio of 1:1.</li>
            <li> I also was able to peel off some areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ok Im not gonna lie to you guys/</li>
            <li> then safe bet to say that proactiv  does not work for you...</li>
            <li> I clumps up a lot with water, the vinegar works better with it.</li>
            <li> but there are MUCH better clay masks out there for purchase that are easier &amp; more convenient to apply and won&#x27;t strip all the moisture from your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> glad I got this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I use bentonite clay for so many things, from aiding in digestion, to pore cleansing masks, and bath soaks, tooth powder, etc.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve found that applying the mud with a paintbrush to my face and neck makes the thickness more uniform all over</li>
            <li> and I can already see a healthy difference in my skin (face).</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions that many people have posted, did my research</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to extract them with a tool.  </li>
            <li> my pores are too sexy.</li>
            <li> So many babies.</li>
            <li> me and my wife do mud mask Mondays and this makes our skin feel soo much better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used a product that did more for my skin than this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> figure out how more people don&#x27;t know about this stuff, and why something so HOLY GRAIL caliber is so darn</li>
            <li> , when I am in the mood for a more cooling type of mask, I add 1 or 2 drops of tea tree oil to my mixture.  </li>
            <li> Also, when I am in the mood for a more cooling type of mask, I add 1 or 2 drops of tea tree oil to my mixture.  </li>
            <li> I am now more confident than ever.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love it..</li>
            <li> I can say with certainty that this healing clay has helped improve my skin more than anything else that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Mix with vinegar, love the feeling and skin feels refreshed.</li>
            <li> If your acne is an issue, you would be much better off consulting your family doctor or dermatologist.</li>
            <li> This product was for my wife and she&#x27;s enjoying it.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I love how my skin feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> I love this clay.</li>
            <li> and I apply a thicker layer to areas where I break out most or where my pores are the largest.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I cannot begin to express how satisfied I am with this product.</li>
            <li> I think most people use it about once a week</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a product that works better than this.</li>
            <li> and I often have to wait a week or more for the acne to go away.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love to drink a lot of water, but I am determined to make my skin look</li>
            <li> Well this is a no brainer - eat healthy most of the time.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this product, and I will continue to buy it in the future!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this😁</li>
            <li> Although it works great, this mask is way too much work.</li>

            <li> I do not even need to do so, but I have read many people do so.</li>
            <li> :)ask on until it dries...not the label that says 15-20 mins...usually takes me about 45 to an hour.</li>

            <li> this stuff is magic.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> You get a tingly sensation and then your face hardens so make sure you are not skyping or anything.</li>
            <li> I use this weekly and love it.</li>
            <li> I love this Aztec clay removes all impurities from my skin feel movements in my face when I lay it relaxes me</li>
            <li> Works really great with vinegar, not so much water.</li>
            <li> It is simply the best...</li>
            <li> i have naturally good skin and rarely ever break out</li>
            <li> I just always look for anything better</li>
            <li> I love it once again.</li>
            <li> and it was magical.</li>
            <li> Love this mask.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> However, I think it does make it a bit better.</li>
            <li> I will try to remember to leave the update after using it for more months in case someone is reading my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I know for sure it does work</li>
            <li> Now I know for sure it does work</li>
            <li> Make sure you mix with apple cider vinegar, not water.  </li>
            <li> Love this face mask.  </li>
            <li> I have never had a cheap mask to do that, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I prefer vinegar because I feel it works better this way.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to follow up with an oil to help replace the oils that are lost after using this product.</li>
            <li> Most people who get stung here in Panama suffer for days.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> IT SAID IT WOULD TRIED IT AND LOVE THE RESULTS</li>
            <li> Best facial ever.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> I use this about once a week and after using it my skin feels and looks so much better.</li>
            <li> but I will update when I use it more than once.</li>
            <li> The smell is not \\&quot;spa\\&quot; like as it&#x27;s more of a dirt smell, but not over the top or anything.</li>
            <li> I found this mask in an organic, all-natural grocery co-op and thought it was my magic.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use vinegar, I just used water, but I will try vinegar and see if it is better.</li>
            <li> Thank you!! :-)</li>
            <li> and I am SO pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> The mask is very penetrating and has helped me greatly with cystic acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so pleased that I kept it because it has been a life saver.</li>
            <li> It is a bit drying, so be sure to be generous with the moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> and it makes that mask feel that much better.</li>
            <li> Mostly by helping my acne (which consist mostly of blackheads) to surface quicker and extracting them out easier.</li>
            <li> With that said, there&#x27;s then something about this clay mask that has surely made a difference even though I seem to be doing everything else that would help prevent my acne.</li>
            <li> I think this product works for the most part.</li>
            <li> Not an overnight miracle, but I feel confident my skin will improve over time with usage.</li>
            <li> ; too :-)</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> my skin feels better and cleaner after using it.</li>
            <li> Ehh, this product is okay.</li>
            <li> I love the way it draws out all the impurities from your face.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product.</li>

            <li> I love it..</li>
            <li> Great product and really fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I love this mask.</li>
            <li> Everyone in my family is now in love with this stuff and always want me to mix some up for them when they come over.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love how I feel after I wash it off</li>
            <li> /&gt;After removing the clay I noticed my skin was smooth, and the white/black heads around my nose were gone!</li>
            <li> I need to work on making it better, yet it&#x27;s more convenient to buy masks that are already premixed.</li>
            <li> Of course those may include more chemicals and ingredients, so</li>
            <li> Make sure you use it with vineager.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I mix it with either water, apple cider vinegar, or my favorite tea tree oil</li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> Dr. Bronners castile soap has been better to remove pimples on my face.</li>
            <li> This product is the best facial I ever used!!!!!  </li>
            <li> , it is an awesome product and it will last you forever.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this clay.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face mask.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Many acne products and face masks can cause Seb Derm flare ups.</li>
            <li> However, in the morning my skin feels and looks so much better.</li>
            <li> my complexion does look better after i use this.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a product that was non-toxic and would be more of an all-in-one face mask.  </li>
            <li> the better the results.  </li>
            <li> do have a couple tips though that make this product more</li>
            <li> I get better results when I do.&lt;br /&gt;4)  </li>
            <li> It really does do a great job of clearing up my face when I use it like I&#x27;m supposed to.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re mostly benign meaning they don&#x27;t form cystic zits</li>
            <li> The minute you take the mask off your skin already feels 10x better.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell for sure, but every time I use this product I seem to breakout more.</li>
            <li> I love face masks</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thickness and also being able to mix it with ACV</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I would definately recommend this to anyone looking for that &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; face mask. :)</li>
            <li> I even got some compliments :)</li>
            <li> Best mixed with apple cider vinegar from the health store</li>
            <li> Even better...</li>
            <li> Please make sure you dont rinse off this make in your bathroom sink as it comes off on clumps</li>
            <li> When it talks about feeling your skin pulse believe it, mine sure did.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> The vinegar has to be a kind with the &amp;#34;mother&amp;#34; in it, like Bragg&#x27;s, and not the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> More rashes now</li>
            <li> I have even taken it to a couple of my friends and they are in love with it too.</li>
            <li> but it seems that an acne sufferer can be susceptible to the many internet lores</li>
            <li> but for a month or more?</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried soooo many.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I do make sure I tone my face afterward to remove any bacteria because I broke out in acne once because I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> have been using it for many years, and love it..</li>
            <li> (I feel my face is just too oily to not wash with some form of soap), then I use the Thayers as a toner - focusing more on my problem areas and pimples.  </li>
            <li> Works better with acv, I felt a pulsation</li>
            <li> I was able to go a couple weeks with no breakout.</li>
            <li> If you want to know more</li>
            <li> just Google the caveman method, although I didn&#x27;t go without putting water on my face because I want to be able to splash my face before I go to bed or after I wake up, like my boyfriend does</li>
            <li> Mostly in my t-zone area.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great cuality.</li>
            <li> I love this product...</li>
            <li> So i made the purchase and I am so glad i did, Yes it does work....</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> and you will see astonishing results.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> I plan to buy more from amazon when I finish this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but after awhile my face starts to get more oily and my face is already oily</li>
            <li> Maybe after a couple more times the peeling will stop.</li>
            <li> I get better results from a healthy diet and apricot scrub.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Love love love.</li>
            <li> I love the pulsing and tugging it</li>
            <li> I baught this with intentions of getting rid of acne scars, which I don&#x27;t have many, and blackheads on the nose area.</li>
            <li> I should probably use it more</li>
            <li> Even if you&#x27;re not suffering from acne, this mask has many benefits</li>
            <li> I have tried so many non-prescription and prescription medications-</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It works way better when you use it with apple cider vinegar than water.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I use it about once a week and always make sure I use a (heavier) moisturizer afterward.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend mixing with the apple cider vinegar as it has a better consistency and easier to put on your face.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> Make sure to use a plastic bowl and spoon to stir the mixture.</li>
            <li> I tried my best to stir the mixture as well as possible, but it would still be a bit clumpy when I applied it to my face.</li>
            <li> it feels great and really tightens your pores.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly on my hair with a mixture of acv.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  </li>
            <li> I know it works for most people</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> but I use pronexin now which worked a lot better for me</li>

            <li> Connect the product was on time and deal with the seller very sophisticated product is worth the experience</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I used this mask in conjunction with Braggs ACV and I loved the way my skin felt after I used it for the first time.</li>
            <li> and i can say it does do a good job after your first use, if you are using it for acne, you might get breakouts but after that (using 2 times a week)</li>
            <li> My boyfriend even noticed how good my skin looked after I tried this for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works pretty good.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good</li>
            <li> It was really good in the first use.</li>
            <li> best of all a lil goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and it seems to be a pretty good value.  </li>
            <li> but when I do use it WHOA my face feels amazing so tight and perfect.</li>
            <li> Great, clean skin is what I was looking for when I first bought the product</li>
            <li> Well, it turned out just fine, better than, MORE THAN....</li>
            <li> I am so impressed to actually find a beauty product that you can see a noticeable improvement so quickly!</li>
            <li> Aztec the best brand for pure, reasonable priced, calcium betonite clay..</li>
            <li> It makes my face super soft and beautiful after rinses it off in warm water.</li>
            <li> Which is an extra bit of work to use the product but that&#x27;s ok because the results are very nice, my face honestly feels revitalized.</li>
            <li> My skin actually looks better after one mask, which was very surprising.</li>
            <li> I am extremely excited about trying this again and adding it to my skin care regimen!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really excited!</li>
            <li> will continue to buy this product, worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> When I got this is in the mail, I was ridiculously excited!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to see the end results!</li>
            <li> After a hours they were significantly flatter!</li>
            <li> Since using this mask those have diminished significantly!</li>
            <li> Really excited to use this again!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try!!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li> Great for the New England change of seasons and blah skin from changing temperatures.</li>
            <li> My skin is the consistently best that it has been in a very long time, probably since using hormonal birth control (which I discontinued years ago).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to say this is a GREAT positive update.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to say this is a GREAT positive update.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say It a huge difference but the best clay masque I&#x27;ve found and especially for the price</li>
            <li> Also, this is a HUGE tub for such a great price!  </li>
            <li> This is so great for detox, I&#x27;m always left feeling amazing.</li>
            <li> The mask can leave your skin feeling a tad bit dry depending on how often you use it - great for oily skin!</li>
            <li> to the surface so it can be removed more easily.</li>
            <li> This has worked better than any product I&#x27;ve used and for easy removal</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best removed in the shower because it forms a formidable substance once dry.  </li>
            <li> I mix it with a bit of warm water and it will turn super clumpy.</li>
            <li> and when I washed it off it seemed like the forming pimples had been brought more to the surface and were easily pop-able.</li>
            <li> I use this with Bragg ACV as a mask to dry up cystic and it WORKS GREAT!!!!</li>
            <li> When it starts to dry, you can feel your skin tightening, its awesome!!!</li>
            <li> And as I said, it absorbs very quickly which I love.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful for those with acne-prone skin, dry skin and conditions like eczema.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Two years with a tub of it and still going strong :)</li>
            <li> The product came quickly and packaging was nice.</li>
            <li> and I have yet to be able to make it 100% smooth like most clay masks, which is why I gave it a 4.</li>
            <li> Shall return with fair assessment: I do believe it is the answers to my prayers in maintaining good facial contours.</li>
            <li> :) Even with my sensitive skin, this works great.</li>
            <li> so i made sure the majority went to my nose since it was the most important area to attack.</li>
            <li> I use this with Apple Cider Vinegar to make a wonderful facial mask once weekly to keep my skin free of blackheads.</li>
            <li> THANKS to that awesome tip-it made the process much easier.</li>
            <li> Work great to clear pores and leave skin healthy.</li>
            <li> It is very drying after even for more, which is good for my oily skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product and the price is more than reasonable.</li>
            <li> it was too good to be true, though it&#x27;s not bad product.</li>
            <li> This is very strong clay and will clean all your pores.</li>
            <li> , my skin feels so great afterward and my pores are so clear!</li>
            <li> Then spread on your freshly cleansed face and watch the magic happen!  </li>
            <li> leaves my face red for the first 30 minutes or so after removing it, but I can honestly say this is the best mask I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> Good mask, dries right up and leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product at an excellent price, but it is mud, so don&#x27;t wash it down your drain unless you want to be replacing your plumbing later</li>
            <li> Very good stuff, makes my face soft , clean, even color.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling clean!</li>
            <li> leaves my skin feel clean!</li>
            <li> My pores are so clean I can&#x27;t even see them anymore!</li>
            <li> But my face is so clean and refreshed!</li>
            <li> and my scalp feels extremely clean!</li>
            <li> My face feels so clean and silky after use!</li>
            <li> I am a bit redfaced after I wash it off, but after that subsides, I am SO SHINY clean!</li>
            <li> But am more fine with just water.&lt;br /&gt;8.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be fine</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think my face has ever in 62 years been so clean !</li>
            <li> I saw in comments that many of us are having problem in making fine paste out of it.</li>
            <li> do it better and beyond what other products will, but for the price, its excellent.</li>
            <li> i need to find something that will finish the job and get everything soft smooth and bright!</li>
            <li> I love love love this, I am 22 and have mild acne problems, I use this for about 45 minutes a couple times a week</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a refreshing gel and makes a wonderful paste with these other two products.  </li>
            <li> but I chose to mix it with pure lemon juice since is just as good.</li>
            <li> For best results, use raw unpastuerized apple cider vinegar (Bragg&#x27;s is a popular brand).</li>
            <li> Worked amazing on my pored, started seeing a difference after the first mask!</li>
            <li> I do still have a fair amount of acne - mainly whiteheads - but it is much, much better than before.  </li>
            <li> very good for deep pore cleansing.</li>
            <li> It was very good especially for those who have oily skin.</li>
            <li> This clay mask works very good for face deep cleanings.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed at this stuff!This product is high quality and good values!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing and worth</li>
            <li> so I get huge cystic acne and nothing has been able to cure it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had the type of acne where you don&#x27;t get many but the ones you do get are HUGE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Bentonite Clay, and this one is okay.</li>
            <li> My acne was moderate/severe and when I paired this mask with monthly facials, I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference (even without the facials, I&#x27;m sure this product would still do wonders).</li>
            <li> This is important because exfoliation can irritate the skin when doing it more than once.</li>

            <li> In my opinion, this is a cumulative effect and you must \\&quot;customize\\&quot; and be patient--the Most important ingredient.</li>
            <li> Great Natural Healing</li>
            <li> Great product for your natural hair.</li>
            <li> I think I will apply this every week to keep my skin blackhead free :)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so happy so far.</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t stop touching my face - it is so incredibly smooth and luscious feeling.</li>

            <li> I love this, it leave my face so smooth.</li>
            <li> I use it to make a mud wash/cleanse for my scalp (or shampoo, since that&#x27;s what most people feel comfortable calling it).  </li>
            <li> have never been so happy in a longest while with my skin, because i&#x27;m always self conscious about my skin</li>
            <li> In my opinion its best to just add water and do not mix it just let it sit for a sec and then apply to face.</li>

            <li> My skin has never been more smooth in my life.</li>

            <li> And I can already tell it helps make my skin more smooth.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, use some quality skin balancing oil like Jurlique brand to rehydrate skin after use.</li>
            <li> Unlike many people on here, I did not receive this for free in exchange for a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> glowing, smooth and just really healthy looking.</li>

            <li> and it has started becoming &#x27;flaky&#x27; in some spots along my forehead.  </li>
            <li> i could find more cheap alternatives like this one</li>
            <li> product may be great for some people, it just does not work for everyone (clearly).</li>

            <li> I am fairly picky about what I put on my skin as it&#x27;s gotten to where I just try to not do anything to aggravate it, hahaha.</li>

            <li> This clay - let me just call it &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; since that&#x27;s what it looks like, makes the skin looks nice and fresh after you leave it on for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying takes time to learn</li>
            <li> honestly, I notice no difference except a fresh feeling and for that day my nose is not as oily</li>

            <li> Follow up with your regular routine, and you are good to go!</li>
            <li> My skin was red for a good 30/40 mins after, so do this on a night you don&#x27;t have any plans!</li>
            <li> The most exciting part: the pulsing!</li>
            <li> The most exciting part: the pulsing!</li>
            <li> Other than that, its wonderful.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this product and excited to tell my friends about it.</li>
            <li> Rinsing it off is somewhat of a pain since it can clog drains, but other than that it works perfectly!</li>
            <li> This mask feels so cool!</li>
            <li> This is awesome, beats any other mask I&#x27;ve ever tried....</li>
            <li> Works as it says everything it says is true!</li>
            <li> That is when I went into full battle mode!  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, I do think that using the ACV is best rather than water.  </li>
            <li> I call this stuff my magic face fixer, so worth the money!</li>
            <li> First around my mouth and nose, (now that has mostly healed) but it has moved to my cheeks close to my eyes!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving 2 stars because it does not pulsate and because it needs better directions that are straightforward instead of using the space on the bottle for a bunch of nonsensical hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, it is infact true!</li>
            <li> other than that its excellent</li>

            <li> Other than that its awesome...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to see what more applications will do their skin.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s true, this stuff does reduce the size of your pores!...</li>
            <li> I would like companies to be aware when they sell their products to either use easily removable labels or to place them in a spot on the package that does not sit on top of the instructions!</li>
            <li> It really cools the skin and according to age old wisdom and is best applied in summer months as it can be too drying for winter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it goes on easy and dries like a .....desert.</li>
            <li> I prefer using Multani Mittee, which is another type of clay but goes on easily.</li>
            <li> I used this mask.. and can feel it works very quick..</li>
            <li> Let me start off by telling you that the shipping was very quick, I got it by the time they told me I would.</li>

            <li> and then it comes off easily..</li>
            <li> Mixing is easy with ACV.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a couple times now, and just love the feeling when you remove the mask, you feel so clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply though after you mix it all together.</li>
            <li> I took it off while in the shower, easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> It cleared any blemishes up very quick.</li>
            <li> removing the mask, it came off easily and all the blackheads and whiteheads were brought to the surface..</li>
            <li> Holy cow, this clay mask is incredible!</li>
            <li> strong, odorless face mask was so easy to use and gave me the results that I wanted.</li>
            <li> It washes away easily.</li>
            <li> easy to mix and use</li>
            <li> This Indian Clay doesn&#x27;t smell and its easy to apply and take it off.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, noticeably brighter skin.</li>
            <li> My Wife is making some homemade toothpaste and this is a core ingredient - she is happy with the quality and as a bonus, is pleased she can make a face mask with the remaining clay left over!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and while wearing it you can feel the pulsating of the mask working on your skin.</li>
            <li> That easy.</li>

            <li> But its worth it because it makes my skin smooth and leaves a nice glow to it.</li>
            <li> it is really strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong.</li>
            <li> I have 51 years and have had no serious issues with my face but thought it would be good to add it this clay to my regimen.</li>
            <li> : I would strongly recommend apple cider vinegar for oily skin; unless you do not like the smell of vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;2-</li>
            <li> I used just water as vinegar is too strong for me.</li>
            <li> I strongly encourage you all to try it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> strongly recommend</li>
            <li> I tried it w/water since ACV would be a bit too strong for me.</li>
            <li> It was toooo strong for me.</li>
            <li> This is strong</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li> With apple cider, the smell is really strong.</li>
            <li> so I apply vitamin E of a strong moisturizer immediately after removing.</li>
            <li> Taking the product off is best done slowly and with warm water as when it dries it hrts if you tru scrubbing or peeling it off.</li>
            <li> After 10 mins my skin tightened and started to pulsate strongly.</li>
            <li> At first the cool clay felt good.  </li>
            <li> Great, cheap facial that makes skin very smooth and cleans our your pours.</li>
            <li> I have prescription acne medication/face wash, and it works okay, but isn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
            <li> I heard this stuff is magical, and how right that was!</li>
            <li> The best time to use it is right after a shower, when your pores are steamed open.</li>
            <li> Came so quickly, packaged good and safe.i got  Exactly what I ordered and use</li>
            <li> My skin felt great after the redness left, and very clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> First of all I never write reviews so this product must be amazing.</li>
            <li> Please be sure to conduct your own research before use and be sure that it&#x27;s all natural bentonite clay.</li>
            <li> By far, this about the best facial mask I have used because it does an incredibly nice job of cleansing and tightening the pores.</li>
            <li> Ehh doesn&#x27;t do much for pores, it is very refreshing tho.</li>
            <li> Just used it for my first time and my skin feels amazing, my pores are virtually gone.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, you can really feel it pulsating!</li>
            <li> It was very refreshing thanks to the tea tree oil scent.</li>
            <li> So, I watched a youtube video of a young African-American lady using this product in her hair, as well as her face and throat, and she looked AMAZING afterwards (including her hair)!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> This awesome clay is also relatively cheap (compared to all the other acne medicines I&#x27;ve tried.)</li>
            <li> I used it only once and used a mix of both water and vinegar worked beautifully.</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin feeling nice and smooth and super clean.</li>
            <li> otherwise, the quality and effectiveness is average at best.</li>
            <li> It was actually kind of funny.</li>
            <li> then you need, so If you mix it in a bag you can save it in a cool place and use it afterwards, even a week and more</li>
            <li> I mix it with apple cider vinegar as my face is not sensitive and incredibly oily.</li>
            <li> My skin felt dewy and soft and had this gorgeous warm golden glow like I used to have before puberty.</li>
            <li> Pretty effective.</li>
            <li> I use it for spot treament more than a full face mask.</li>
            <li> So far we are loving this stuff!</li>
            <li> but when I used the apple cider vinegar it fizzed and mixed beautifully.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it, my face feeling much softer, brighter</li>
            <li> I do have some acne (my skin breaks out more in the summer), but it&#x27;s not a bad condition and the vinegar irritates my skin.  </li>
            <li> The results are immediate and GREAT: face is tighter, pores are emptied and clean, and my skin feels soft.</li>
            <li> It is hands down one of the best beauty products I&#x27;ve ever come across.</li>
            <li> (Someone else recommended putting a paper towel down in the basin of your sink while you rinse to catch the mask as it comes off, awesome idea!)&lt;br /&gt;*You</li>
            <li> Yes, my skin is soft after rinsing off, and yes, my pores are clean and smaller.&lt;br /&gt;It feels great on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I love this face mask, It has cleared my pores and my face looks smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best product I have ever used for acne.</li>
            <li> The down side to this product though is that I think it works best if you don&#x27;t wear makeup.</li>
            <li> It is hands down the best product I&#x27;ve EVER purchased for my face.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t smell very good and made my skin dry.</li>
            <li> I just used this clay for the first time and had very high expectations based on all of the great reviews.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a new clay mask and bought this one based on all of the good reviews.</li>
            <li> I mix this with water and works just fine</li>
            <li> use apple cider vinegar instead of water though because water has a higher ph level and will damage your skin more and cause more of the &amp;#34;redness&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smooth and spreads easily.</li>
            <li> The paste came out smooth and easy to apply and layer to a desired thickness.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap, and it&#x27;s easy.  </li>
            <li> though she says her face feels fine..</li>
            <li> The delivery was fine.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s totally fine ..</li>
            <li> The bonus is that after a couple of months, the fine lines on my face - eyes, forehead, lips are GONE.  </li>
            <li> Between the mask and the Bel Essence, all those fine lines on my face - GONE.  </li>
            <li> Mixing it was fine.</li>
            <li> I used the mask for the first time last night, and I&#x27;m still amazed at how great my face feels!</li>
            <li> which is fine</li>
            <li> /&gt;i used it with apple cider vinegar because it seems to work the best for acnee and black heads.</li>
            <li> Once a month would probably be fine.</li>
            <li> It seems to work on acne fine, but that might be all in my head.</li>
            <li> Seems fine</li>
            <li> I think it works fine on the face.</li>
            <li> It arrive very quickly and was packaged securely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m natural this is great for hair as well as a full body mask.</li>
            <li> so it worked just fine.</li>
            <li> clay mask is fine.  </li>
            <li> Read the fine print...and use as directed..</li>
            <li> I have medium-sensitive skin and it works fine for me.  </li>
            <li> It works great and shipping was pretty fast.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m fine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine and neutral tasting.</li>
            <li> I was amaze at the before and after pictures of myself and for the first time my skin is nice and  smooth.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> What i love the most is that it does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> Apple cider vinegar is also good for acne and dark spots, so it&#x27;s a good combination to try out if you have acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> With the apple cider vinegar, there it is effortless to get the clay and vinegar to mix into a smooth velvety paste that goes on easily.</li>
            <li> Came in just fine.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m fine with this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that I would use this more than once or twice a week since it seems pretty potent</li>
            <li> but I find that if I use a plastic fork to mix and a plastic spoon to spread it works fine.</li>
            <li> it felt fine</li>
            <li> You see results quickly!</li>
            <li> Always follow up with a cleanser after taking it off, and be sure to use a mild astringent after that.  </li>
            <li> super inexpensive way to make a miracle happen in your life!</li>
            <li> I had a MilD staph infection on my face and this got rid  of it with one mask application!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super cheap!</li>
            <li> It works quickly in about 5 minutes and makes your skin glow!</li>
            <li> Tried it with Apple Cider Vinegar and it was super drying!</li>
            <li> Basically blackheads show up quickly and prominently on my nose.  </li>
            <li> leaves your skin looking very healthy and extremely fresh too will be using this a lot more from now on.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it for people with large pores.</li>
            <li> I mix mine with a little apple cider vinegar, I believe this is the best way because it makes it easy to mix and the ASV did assist with the clearing of my skin.</li>
            <li> I noticed it is perfect for shrinking pores and just really drawing out impurities in the skin(even boils and stings), like other reviewers have mentioned(rather creatively(-:).  </li>
            <li> My whole family has been using for years and is an awesome facial mask at such a good price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 37 and very fair, combo skin with occasional mild breakouts.</li>
            <li> Thanks again Amazon for making healthy living easy and affordable!</li>
            <li> just wanted something to keep my face looking good and young!</li>
            <li> My skin felt so much cleaner and looked so much better after just one use!</li>
            <li> And really, I think this might still work better!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not expensive and definitely does a great job of clearing skin and gives a nice glow.</li>
            <li> It has really helped with my acne scars and that is the biggest reason I love this mask!</li>
            <li> Warm water and gently rubbing, sometimes with a washcloth, takes the mask off relatively easy</li>
            <li> Super comfortable and enjoyable DIY face mask.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, feels good on the face and leaves your skin soft and glow.</li>
            <li> Came quick and was glad to find this so cheap.</li>
            <li> so I luckily had one plastic spoon (you can&#x27;t use metal) and used a plastic bowl with a good sealing lid because I made too much.</li>
            <li> This is one Deep Pore Cleansing mask that lives up to ALL of the positive reviews and is impressive.</li>
            <li> It comes in powder form, which is good because you will be able to mix a fresh new batch of clay every time you want to use a mask.</li>
            <li> I use facials all the time and this is by far the best working one and made with all natural product!</li>
            <li> Just used this for the first time and so far so good!  </li>
            <li> if you feel your face dry after the clay, be sure to use a good cream to hydrate the skin and don&#x27;t use the clay more than 1 time a week if dryness occur.</li>
            <li> in all, I would not recommend this product; I honestly had VERY realistic expectations going into this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is just pure amazing.</li>
            <li> It does help to minimize the appearance of large pores and gives a nice refined texture to my skin.  </li>
            <li> This feels good going on and feels good when it dries and makes my face tight.</li>
            <li> Love the tingle you get that says it is really working!!</li>
            <li> results from the very first use!</li>
            <li> I love this product so much!!</li>
            <li> I used the vinegar and it was ok the first three times, then it was too drying!</li>
            <li> But overall, very pleased!</li>
            <li> Tried it and felt the difference in how my face felt on a very first time!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much!!</li>
            <li> I love the product and I will most likely buy more as soon as I am done with this batch!</li>
            <li> I love this product really tightens my skin!!</li>
            <li> Water and a little lemon juice works best for me.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend using the Apple cider vinegar, the smell isn&#x27;t strong once mixed,you&#x27;ll see better results!</li>
            <li> very good product, works as expected</li>
            <li> (I keep a plastic bag or bowl under my face when I&#x27;m rinsing it off) and making a certain amount and storing it in a plastic bag to take out from later is a great idea!</li>
            <li> Very good for taking those top layers of dead cells off once a month or so.</li>
            <li> Best face mask under $60 hands down!</li>
            <li> The item was exactly as described, it arrived very quickly and was packaged very securely.</li>
            <li> got huge hives about 1 or 2 across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> my face is baby smooth...</li>
            <li> I just stand the smell of it after mixing with  Bragg&#x27;s apple cider vinegar because I know the results will be more than worth it.</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth and rejuvenated after.</li>

            <li> Stir the mixture well to a smooth paste.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> It is time-consuming (another reviewer said to place the water and powder in a plastic baggie and knead it until smooth...</li>
            <li> I enjoy putting this on my face and scaring my roommates.</li>
            <li> I think this product will last way longer than the 18 months on the use by date &amp; a great value.</li>
            <li> , what doesn&#x27;t I lightly scrape off with the handle of one of my paint brush tools that comes with the 4-In-1 tool set.</li>
            <li> you have to try this mask is cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also fantastic as a spot treatment.  </li>
            <li> and i like how smooth it is after i use it</li>
            <li> Being the picker that I am, I coaxed the heads out and lightly swabbed with some alcohol on those places.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have Braggs on hand, and whenever I mix it with water it just clumps, but the Redmond Clay was so silky smooth, so</li>

            <li> I use it occasionally and have noticed a great improvement on my skin.</li>
            <li> but the end results are more than worth it.</li>
            <li> and I had problems getting it as smooth as the directions said it should be..</li>
            <li> if you use this product 15-20 minutes before your shower there is virtually no clean-up, However; after receiving the product and excitement gets the best of you to the point of timidity running to put it on, the wash off process will leave your powder room, green all over.</li>
            <li> The only thing i experienced with miracle clay is the sensation from tighens face while staying on..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe all hype with reduce pore sizes and completely free to acne, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> )n will ensure you get a smooth texture!!&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> I use part water, part apple cider vinegar (organic, which is cheap) and</li>
            <li> Ok - I rarely ever write a review</li>
            <li> I never found a cheap, affordable mask that worked so well.</li>
            <li> Great investment for a personal spa day.</li>
            <li> Very much enjoy this clay.  </li>
            <li> I put about a tablespoon of it into a plastic baggie, add water, and squish the bag until the mud is a smooth consistency.</li>
            <li> but it is slightly messy so best to use on the shower not the sink.</li>
            <li> My skin is incredibly smooth after using.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product to me and after some research and reading all the great reviews, I recently purchased and gave it a go.</li>
            <li> My complexion was also really smooth after I washed the mask off.</li>
            <li> I saw it on pinterest and it was so cheap</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anticipating for anyone to tell me how to get rid of the cracked clay and make it smooth instead on my face.</li>
            <li> The next morning, my face looks great.</li>
            <li> I mix it with Bragg Apple Cider Vinegar to create a smooth mixture.</li>
            <li> Made my skin look and feel fantastic.</li>
            <li> This will leave you skin feeling sooo smooth...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth a try. :)</li>
            <li> I  am so happy I discovered this facial!</li>
            <li> This is a great mask for deep pore cleansing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really just a nice clay mask.</li>
            <li> It is a bit messy to mix, and I found the Ziploc bag method to be the best as it allows you to mash the mixture to avoid chunks.</li>
            <li> It washes off easily though, and you can see how clean your face looks once you rinse it</li>
            <li> This stuff just seems cheap, I bought it to help pull out acne pimples</li>
            <li> I used an unused makeup face brush and it went smoothly after.</li>

            <li> /&gt;About my skin and tips: I have extremely fair, sensitive, combination skin.</li>
            <li> I liked how it tightened up my skin while it was drying and was expecting great results, but have not seen them after a few times of use.</li>
            <li> but my skin felt soft and looked good.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you use a really good facial moisturizer..</li>

            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far, so good and would recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this item after seeing so many good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this mask takes a big amount of time to prepare and apply.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good I&#x27;ve use this product for a week and it truly gets rid of pimples.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s a bit messy, I honestly could see great results/improvements in my skin after just 2-3 uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, this deep cleanse is enjoyable weekly.  </li>
            <li> Very great mask, last very long.clears</li>
            <li> problem is that I have extremely fair, and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Its ok, very drying, make sure to put a moisturizer or oil on after.  </li>
            <li> I love this and it cleared my acne up so good can&#x27;t get enough of this mask!</li>
            <li> This will last a while, great amount of product with a nice price point and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews about this product and so many people touted this as an absolute miracle product.</li>
            <li> So far so good tho.</li>
            <li> Like most good things this will take a bit of time on your part to work properly.</li>
            <li> Need to be careful mixing it up, but once you get it right, it is perfect!  </li>
            <li> works soooo well on blemishes leaves pores very clean and skin feels very refreshed after using!!</li>
            <li> Also the way it feels when it starts to dry is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> I do however suggest this product because it is pretty damn good for the price, and who doesn&#x27;t love a good tight face mask</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a nice treatment indeed, it makes me feel very clean, I mixed it with vinegar and got even better results.</li>
            <li> Just plain out Awesome.</li>
            <li> It is really challenging to get it to the right consistency.</li>
            <li> Just make sure not to use it right before going somewhere.</li>
            <li> **make sure you&#x27;re using it with the recommended Apple Cider Vinegar to get the right effects.</li>
            <li> it is a very good product, but I have had other clay masks that make my face pulsate and tightens my pores.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing; all the positive reviews on here are definitely true.  </li>
            <li> I sure would welcome any tips other commenters have on how to avoid clumps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, we are happy with our purchase and are excited to try it again.</li>
            <li> With that being said, it cleans out pores beautifully and does not over dry my skin.</li>

            <li> To take it off I get a bucket of warm water and a clean wash cloth and gently wipe the mask off of my face with the damp wash cloth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been able to control my acne with a good basic cleanser (no harsh stuff) and a mild face scrub 3 times a week (skinceticals has a good one but its pricey) .</li>

            <li> We&#x27;ve tried several products....including the highly publicized &amp;#34;P&amp;#34;, but this has proven to work the best.</li>
            <li> After I washed it off, I applied Thayer&#x27;s rose witch hazel as a toner and Trader Joe&#x27;s antioxidant oil-free moisturizer and my skin felt amazingly soft and clean!</li>

            <li> With this price, and it give me smooth and clean skin, I would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> but my skin feels clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel smooth and clean</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin smooth and squeaky clean</li>
            <li> I have never felt my face so clean and smooth without having to exfoliate and with a scrub or brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does everything it promises... smooth clean skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I experienced no drying, my skin is usually pretty sensitive</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> It just pulls all the impurities out of my face, leaving it smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> It made my face feel smooth and clean and that is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> When I use this mask my face feels so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> and once I washed it off, my skin felt incredibly smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this about once a week, it always makes my face feel really clean</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s up to you to change up the ingredients for your own particular needs.</li>
            <li> and that was pretty awesome, but I had a lot of closed comedones (acne that isn&#x27;t inflamed, but is just a bump under the skin.</li>
            <li> Mixing it was super easy- for a lack of apple cider vinegar in my dorm</li>
            <li> This product is super strong</li>
            <li> First, let me just say I have dreamed and prayed, literally dreamed of the day I can write a success story of my own in regards to acne.</li>
            <li> this takes way too much time and effort to mix to a good consistently.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a quick process and the heat of the water helps easily dissolve the mask, as well as the friction from the wash cloth.</li>
            <li> I would receive a container full of fine dust.</li>
            <li> Also, it is super easy to learn to use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to mix and hardens quickly.</li>
            <li> I find that mixing the clay to ACV at a 1 to 1.5 ratio (I use about a teaspoon of clay to 1.5 teaspoons ACV) and applying a much thinner layer than the product label suggests still provides REMARKABLE results while stretching the product much farther.  </li>
            <li> A teaspoon of powder (not packed in) and a teaspoon of water was the perfect amount for a nice super thin layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time I did the mask, I didnt notice very much of a difference, except that my skin was bright bright red for an hour.</li>
            <li> Have fun..try new things.. you will love it!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that if you take the same washcloth you used to prep your face before the mask and run it under warm water, then press it into your face to loosen the mask, it comes off easily!</li>
            <li> My pores have not decreased but I&#x27;m still very happy; I love the tight pulling while the mask is on too.  </li>
            <li> This is amazing highly recommend and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Of course I still have the spots, as we all know those take a while to go away, but my makeup can hide those better, and the rosewater is very gentle, too.</li>
            <li> I love this very much.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look fresh, clean and well taken care of!</li>
            <li> It may burn at first, but once it&#x27;s washed off your face is very smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> this is has calm my acne like nothing else before, i have super sensitive skin but its clearing up compare to how it was, i love this !!</li>
            <li> and it mixed beautifully and was just the right amount for the face.</li>
            <li> Be prepared with moist towels handy for clean-up, watch out for your plumbing, and have something to store leftovers because You&#x27;ll never make exactly the right amount.</li>
            <li> I am loving the results so far!!  </li>
            <li> I am loving the results so far!!  </li>
            <li> After I washed it off, my clean felt so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> It dissolved more easily that way and the whole process took about five minutes.</li>
            <li> It dissolved more easily that way and the whole process took about five minutes.</li>
            <li> and I have yet to find a good (and easy) solution, save from hosing myself off in the back yard</li>
            <li> This clay mask is really nice for my body, but it is way to strong to use on the sensitive skin on my face.</li>
            <li> Made my skin nice and soft and was easy to use.</li>
            <li> The redness goes away quickly and you are left with great skin.</li>
            <li> This product does not seem pulsate or pull as strongly as the mask I made from the NOW brand bentonite (sodium type), nor did it draw as much blood to the surface of my skin, which is what causes the redness and/or burning sensation, but it does seem to help heal better.</li>
            <li> But make sure to use moisturizer after because it does dry out your face (which is good for acne)</li>
            <li> , it isn&#x27;t a magic cure-all and certainly doesn&#x27;t repair me 100%, but a 40-50% improvement is fine for me).  </li>
            <li> Next time I used ACV and the results were amazing!</li>
            <li> After the first use I noticed a huge difference!</li>
            <li> so so worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I let the hot water run in my sink to make sure my sink doesn&#x27;t clog.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with it so far.  </li>
            <li> totally worth the hype!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for the keratosis pilaris that I have on my arms and legs</li>
            <li> Love this product so much!</li>
            <li> I use this product for the first time and I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I tried this as soon as I got it because I was excited to see if it worked as well as the reviews said it did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure the hype is just because you mix it yourself and see it bubble up -- it&#x27;s a gimmick.</li>
            <li> first picture is when I first started breaking out, and then the process of how the clay was working its magic :)</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;pulsing&amp;#34; you experience while it&#x27;s on is quite fun!</li>
            <li> But oh my is it worth it!</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product! : )</li>
            <li> 2 tsp Rose water - Normal days&lt;br /&gt;1tsp Indian healing clay</li>
            <li> I wanted to test the mask out to make sure it did not irritate my skin, so the first time I used it</li>
            <li> I have pretty okay skin</li>
            <li> After reading reviews and watching youtube videos on this i was so excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> When i took it off once again it didnt look like it had dont anything significant to my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is snake oil.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definatley worth it!</li>
            <li> Pretty sure im a lifer</li>
            <li> Way worth the $11!</li>
            <li> Rinse and smile!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the most attractive mask that I&#x27;ve used, but is that really that big of a deal?</li>
            <li> This mask is SO POWERFUL!</li>
            <li> I hope you love it as much as I do!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the greatest, and its a nice big jar so it&#x27;ll last me a good long time.</li>
            <li> This product is worth all the hype!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a month in I love it when I first used it</li>
            <li> and I use it on my body at first, and more often, now I use it once a week.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this.</li>
            <li> I was excited for this to come in the mail</li>
            <li> I think by July as I mentioned, I should be significantly clearer..</li>
            <li> I think by July as I mentioned, I should be significantly clearer..</li>
            <li> Also, once totally made my UPS guy&#x27;s day by being caught wearing it while having to sign for a package :-P</li>
            <li> I used a teaspoon full and mix with water until it can smooth over my skin.</li>
            <li> It was pretty ok.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I received my order in the mail and could wait to use it.</li>
            <li> Also, I originally used water as I didn&#x27;t have organic apple cider.  </li>
            <li> I used apple cider vinegar and it seemed to come out more consistent than when I attempted to use water.</li>
            <li> not expensive and my favorite.</li>
            <li> So after dinner I put the mask on my WHOLE face, and wow, it does hurt, but its more of a good hurt, and it does stink.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this clay, and i have to say I am 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> this is the first reveiw I&#x27;ve ever written, I just cant keep how much I love this product to myself.</li>
            <li> Just search for &#x27;activated charcoal capsule&#x27; if you aren&#x27;t familiar with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oatmeal  </li>
            <li> Just search for &#x27;activated charcoal capsule&#x27; if you aren&#x27;t familiar with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oatmeal  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews, I was extremely excited to try this out.</li>
            <li> My guess is that if you&#x27;re consistent with usage you&#x27;ll get better results.</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;ll be able see how it feels first before you put it on any delacate areas.  </li>
            <li> Pretty sure it&#x27;s just a lot of hype.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m golden now!</li>
            <li> but I figured it was worth the 9 bucks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive and definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> Excited to try it.  </li>
            <li> The results are worth it!</li>
            <li> I use this product one time and as soon as I washed it off the pores on my nose shrunk significantly.</li>
            <li> This does not remove all blackheads in one go (so don&#x27;t get TOO excited), but I imagine if you do it every week</li>
            <li> First, the amount of clay for the price is outstanding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure you could mold a pottery bowl out of this stuff if you wanted.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it consistently to know if it has many benefits yet.</li>
            <li> I just got home and was so excited to find the package.</li>
            <li> ive seen a significant difference in my appearance.</li>
            <li> The apple vinegar produces the most results and using hot water leaves the mud in clumps so unless u want muddy lookin&#x27;</li>
            <li> I originally got this to combat my clogged pores.</li>
            <li> I get a better result when I dilute the ACV with distilled water FIRST, then add the diluted ACV to the clay (instead of adding water and ACV to the clay as two separate</li>
            <li> This product was fun to try and will buy again!</li>
            <li> You can read more about it on their website if you&#x27;re interested</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and works great on oily acnetic skin</li>
            <li> I am astounded by the results, what a success!</li>
            <li> but I am pretty sure they were pulled.</li>
            <li> I did have a lot more breakouts at first, BUT these are the pimples that were already below the surface and are just being pulled out.</li>
            <li> and I notice a significant difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product and will purchase another jar after my first one is done.</li>
            <li> This cleared up what I originally went to the dermatologist with by about 75%.</li>
            <li> Yes, time consuming but so worth it!</li>
            <li> This mask has changed my life significantly.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised when it arrived as powder but am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> so I find it important to make sure my face is thoroughly cleansed and with the most natural, home remedy-like products)</li>
            <li> and so worth it!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had an issue after the first couple of times and now I am glad I stuck with it.</li>
            <li> The first two times it was ok.</li>
            <li> Did not see any significant improvement.</li>
            <li> It is a bit of a hassle getting it off but is well worth it!</li>
            <li> Now that I know, I&#x27;m excited to get into the habit of using it.</li>
            <li> and i am very pleased with the results thus far.</li>
            <li> but the results are worth it!</li>
            <li> I woke up this morning and was so excited.</li>
            <li> Okay I was looking for this exact type of mud mask.  </li>
            <li> I love this, first time using it</li>
            <li> Maybe that means I really needed it! :)</li>
            <li> This is very good treatment to, especially if you have large pores or pimples.</li>
            <li> I gave some to my very critical mother and she loved it too (which is a huge compliment because she complains about absolutely everything!!!)  </li>
            <li> I mean, if ACV is as great for skin as many people claim, why hasn&#x27;t there been more companies to include it in their formulas?</li>
            <li> When ingested, it has great benefits for skin, but doesn&#x27;t do anything for the surface of the skin but smell funky and do a little bit more exfoliating.</li>
            <li> It takes a little to get off like most masks but your skin looks great afterwards.</li>
            <li> Pretty good at absorbing my super oily skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful, organic product from a wonderful little company I&#x27;ve fallen in love with, and it&#x27;s great following each of the above drying treatments, especially after Aztec Healing.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks fantastic, no clogged pores and my skin is healthier, more vibrant and glowing!</li>
            <li> I will give it 2 stars because it did bring some of the blackheads to the surface, but apart from that, the jar now has a nice new home in my trash compactor.</li>
            <li> First time I used it my skin felt great and got rid of blackheads and other blemishes right away, I love it!</li>

            <li> But the pores are naturally the way my genes intended, my skin is still putting out the oil my genes tell it to, and i&#x27;m looking a bit more wrinkly because of that top layer of skin cells, now dying from getting the moisture sucked out of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m struck by the many positive reviews here.  </li>
            <li> Although there are many positive reviews about this one</li>
            <li> I find them to definitely be a positive addition to my skincare routine and will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I find them to definitely be a positive addition to my skincare routine and will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Im positive after maybe 2 more</li>
            <li> and i have used a lot of masks and this one is amazing and not one has ever come close to leaving my face as soft as this one has!</li>
            <li> my face feels absolutely amazing and extremely soft afterwards!</li>
            <li> Wow Love It!</li>
            <li> So far I totally love it!</li>
            <li> I used this clay to do my own DIY of the glam glow face mask which has worked wonders so far!</li>
            <li> So far I love this product!</li>
            <li> The friendly cool girl recommended this product for my skin.</li>
            <li> So far, I love it!  </li>
            <li> The mask gets rid of the old skin beautifully, and the Bel Essence builds up the new.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good product made my skin feel brand new.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many mud masques before with mixed success, and I honestly did not expect such great results so quickly.</li>
            <li> If you mix it with water, it washes off a little easier just because it never formed a very good mask/paste</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells strong and strange but the results are good.</li>
            <li> It was pretty hilarious how quickly my face turned to stone...</li>
            <li> Very nice product I had to buy a few more jars.  </li>
            <li> When I put on my regular night moisturizer ([[ASIN:B000WNLFBI Egyptian Magic All Purpose Skin Cream Facial Treatment, 4 Ounce]], somewhat pricey, but effective and multi-tasking), and my face just feels so good</li>
            <li> Just be sure to allow an hour or two between using it and leaving the house if you have fair skin like me, because for awhile after rinsing it off, you will look like you&#x27;re wearing a bright pink mask with white eye holes.</li>
            <li> It cleans pores very well and seems to tone your skin, leaving it very smooth.</li>
            <li> Easy to mix, doesn&#x27;t clump if you start it off correctly and with the right amount.</li>
            <li> this replaced my Origins Charcoal mask (super expensive and NOT as effective as this wonderful product).</li>
            <li> This magical powder pulls your face so tight, but the results are amazing!  </li>
            <li> Make sure you know how to use it and be smart about your expectations.</li>
            <li> Make sure you know how to use it and be smart about your expectations.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t buy again, just didn&#x27;t do anything special.</li>
            <li> , I made a special point of looking at those).  </li>
            <li> Years ago my grandmother had some special \\&quot;drawing salve\\&quot; that pulled out gunk, even dissolved blackheads, they don&#x27;t seem to sell it anymore.  </li>
            <li> I was told by my dermatologist that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to shrink my large pores.</li>
            <li> I love that they package it as pure powder</li>
            <li> This product will most certainly be a mainstay in my collection of toiletries.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what got me thinking that maybe it&#x27;s doing something special.</li>
            <li> I broke out two days before a special event.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about it</li>
            <li> no need to use special equipment for mixing.</li>
            <li> Face right!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right!</li>
            <li> You can see stuff coming right out of your pores!</li>
            <li> RIGHT NOW!</li>
            <li> you will see the difference right away!</li>
            <li> Very nice but make my skin dry</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and everyday I wake up to better and better skin!</li>
            <li> I got over excited at the wonderful benefits that I saw in my first few times using this product.</li>
            <li> I got over excited at the wonderful benefits that I saw in my first few times using this product.</li>
            <li> Its also very pure and easy to use.</li>
            <li> nice texture and feels clean and soft after.</li>
            <li> My skin is super super smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> and it really keeps my skin feeling clean and smooth!  </li>
            <li> I noticed my skin clearing up after using this, and it&#x27;s always good when I need a deep clean.</li>
            <li> If it weren&#x27;t for the number of positive reviews,  I would never even consider buying this...who proof reads this stuff!!?</li>
            <li> Not too messy, I mix it with distilled water, Braggs acv and aloe vera or sometimes some vit e oil and its a very good mask for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I am so excited about this stuff, it is a MUST buy for anyone who has oily skin or large pores!!</li>
            <li> Speaking as a first aid instructor, wounds should be kept clean, so wash your hands!  </li>
            <li> Im super excited.</li>
            <li> I was super excited about this product and all</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s  hard for me to get good products!!!</li>
            <li> i was super excited to use this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s oil free, soap free, and very gentle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s oil free, soap free, and very gentle.</li>
            <li> but wow this is amazing.</li>
            <li> As a teenager (almost in their 20&#x27;s) who has tried as what seems like forever to get clear skin, this is amazing.</li>
            <li> so when it did come off, my face was BRIGHT red.</li>
            <li> I took it off and my face was bright red!  </li>
            <li> My fave is bright red for a while after I wash it off.</li>
            <li> lol so be careful.</li>
            <li> My daughters face turn bright red</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very low-toxin, for those interested in controlling the amount of hazardous chemicals you&#x27;re rubbing into your face each day (</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very low-toxin, for those interested in controlling the amount of hazardous chemicals you&#x27;re rubbing into your face each day (</li>
            <li> My face is now clear to a routine of amazing products.</li>
            <li> It also leaves my face bright red for an hour or two after washing it off.</li>
            <li> because it is the best all natural anti-aging cream I have found, and it replenishes your skin with vitamins, fatty acids, and omega 3s that your skin needs to be healthy.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work QUITE as well as I expected, but still a great product.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I just mixed it with some apple cider vinegar like it tells you too, and it worked great.  </li>
            <li> I am now 21 years old and I cannot believe how amazing this product has worked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing and leaves my hair and skin feeling super soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Bright cherry red.</li>
            <li> Pretty good so far.</li>
            <li> great for t zone and spot treatment for acne, not whole face or neck</li>
            <li> A way to detox and a great first aid item(beauty and medical)</li>
            <li> This was my first ever mask like this, so I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but I was thrilled.</li>
            <li> For those seeking a truly natural product that produces amazing results, go no further.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Beware though, it will leave your face bright red for about thirty minutes</li>
            <li> My face is always bright red for about a hour after I use this mask.</li>
            <li> I have to say that it is the best I have ever used by far and lasts a long time</li>
            <li> skin does tingle and tighten (used with apple cider vinegar) and the turns bright red for like 20 mins</li>
            <li> Worked as described but when I washed it off my face was a bright red and was burning.</li>
            <li> As long as you give yourself time and don&#x27;t mind some cleanup, then you&#x27;re still in luck BECAUSE this stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I like it and happy that I finally found something that works and is not expensive.</li>
            <li> The price is amazing too,wish I find it early.</li>
            <li> it works amazing and makes me skin and face amazingly soft and cleanses the pores.</li>
            <li> will update my review in a couple hours after the bright, burning red skin goes away...</li>
            <li> I first used this over a decade ago and it really is quite amazing.</li>
            <li> Still takes some getting used to but overall a good working mask</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need more than 2 Tablespoons for the whole face.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put any oils or extra stuff that people say it&#x27;s good when it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> but my face appreciated the mask, my skin was noticeably better.</li>
            <li> Overall I think it was a really good product.</li>
            <li> Really good as a facial.  </li>
            <li> I have my cheeks full of acne</li>
            <li> I use about two table spoons of the clay, a quarter size of coconut charcoal, a quarter size amount of coconut oil, and finally I add some of Braggs Organic apple cider vinegar until I get a good consistency.</li>
            <li> and it felt super clean.</li>
            <li> Feels good, just really messy and would prefer more detailed directions</li>
            <li> good for making pores smaller.</li>
            <li> It is not painful, just unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you apply generously as recommended, you get the full benefit.</li>
            <li> If you apply generously as recommended, you get the full benefit.</li>
            <li> to add to his regime since it&#x27;s gotten such good reviews for treating acne, as well.</li>
            <li> I love it so much.</li>
            <li> Such a good price.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m using it for acne or enlarged pores, I follow up with a dab of good quality coconut oil and a drop of tea tree essential oil.</li>
            <li> Love this product it really works just mix with acv and put it on the face i would do it before I showerd and then just take it off in the shower</li>
            <li> grandson has fair complexion and he left on about 10 min.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be able to say much during this time.  </li>
            <li> I am 31 years old and now since i have used this product I can say I have not had any pimples I also use  Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera ~</li>
            <li> and then I need a good deep cleansing.</li>
            <li> I left it on for about fifteen minutes and loved the pulsing feeling.</li>
            <li> I attributed it to purging effects, or perhaps clay that I did not wipe off good enough.</li>
            <li> Within two uses (three days) they&#x27;d developed into full-fledged whiteheads.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and you&#x27;ve tried every product from here to Timbuktu, this should be one of the most economic treatments you&#x27;ve encountered.</li>
            <li> The skin in-between blemishes is much cleaner and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> The skin in-between blemishes is much cleaner and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> It is as good as getting a facial done at home.</li>
            <li> I braided it that night for stretch, and the next day my hair was just gorgeous.</li>
            <li> 1) I put it on more evenly (thanks to the brush) and I felt the pulsing, which to me, signified that it was working the way it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> 1) I put it on more evenly (thanks to the brush) and I felt the pulsing, which to me, signified that it was working the way it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> After i rinse my face with the warm water my face felt so soft and that earned a star.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I ended up covering my full face, neck, shoulders, and chest and then hopping in the shower to rinse it off.</li>
            <li> I can see a real difference without anything on my face :)</li>
            <li> And it really doesn&#x27;t have a smell to it, so that makes it even better</li>
            <li> it works as good as the ones I pay for in facial salons.  </li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> Didnt really work any better then</li>
            <li> It sucks all the dirt out of your skin and makes it look awesome!</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, my daughter has a friend who is a make-up artist and, through her, has tried several &amp;#34;Hollywood&amp;#34; super-expensive products and says this mask makes her skin look and feel just as good.</li>
            <li> I like that this is an effective, natural way to take care of my skin.  </li>
            <li> they are still full.</li>
            <li> but since I have sensitive skin, it kind of stung too</li>
            <li> Loving this product so far.</li>
            <li> and my skin is nice and clear.</li>
            <li> It does such a good job for facials.  </li>
            <li> I also adore the idea of an effective, natural product.</li>
            <li> Container was full, get some tips on how to mix well</li>
            <li> After suffering with severe cystic acne for 5 years and trying absolutely everything (from Proactiv, to urine therapy, to rx&#x27;s + more) I started using this mask every morning for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I use about a teaspoon full for my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it (this from a sweet tooth.)&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> Excellent.reveiws where true to product</li>
            <li> Being athletes, we are prone to have more problems with clogged pores and get what you call &amp;#34;athletes face&amp;#34; and this has really helped keep the problems at bay.</li>
            <li> I will note that the directions says to put a layer on 1/4 of an inch thick for best results</li>
            <li> i love the intense tightening when the mask dries...</li>
            <li> Any real benefits you&#x27;re getting from this are probably the placebo effect working its magic.  </li>
            <li> My coworkers love it so much they ask me to buy them some.</li>
            <li> Immediately after, I applied a facial moisturizer and my skin has never looked so good.  </li>
            <li> so I washed it off immediately with cool water rather than keeping it on any longer.</li>
            <li> The rest of my face feels soft and nice.  </li>
            <li> It is a really cool experience too.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it really helps repair your skin overnight and you will see/feel a difference the morning after.</li>
            <li> and It&#x27;s got a cool hippy looking container</li>
            <li> And on top of all that, it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much of anything for my skin.</li>
            <li> I applied a full mask for 20 min before bed.</li>
            <li> Gives a fresh and smooth feel after use.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> but it was cool to see.</li>
            <li> , I use it for mosquito bites too because I swear im allergic to them, or they love me too much..</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time today, I LOVE it and will definitely buy more once I run out :)</li>
            <li> I like to use this once a week to clean my face and pull out toxins for quick removal.  </li>
            <li> It smooths and firms better than my fancy clay mask I paid 3x as much for.</li>
            <li> (I put make up on top of it, so don&#x27;t want to use too much)</li>
            <li> is I take a full sheet of paper towel, like Bounty (you need a durable brand) and place it in the sink so that as I rinse, all the chunks of mask collect in the paper towel</li>
            <li> you are okay with absorbing aluminum into your system, by all means, use this product.  </li>
            <li> Over the years, I have weeded out almost all of chemical products to replace them with things that are all natural, and that I can make on my own.</li>
            <li> next goal is to find a good food grade clay, to take to detox the inside of the body.</li>
            <li> next goal is to find a good food grade clay, to take to detox the inside of the body.</li>
            <li> so I added more water but that didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li> , I have very oily skin on most of my face</li>
            <li> My face didn&#x27;t pulse so much as felt like clay was shrinking on top of it.</li>
            <li> Nice baby soft complexion</li>
            <li> I think this is such a good value for your money.</li>
            <li> and I literally feel it cleaning my pores - but to the point where I can&#x27;t really have it on for more than 5 minutes because I start to feel this itchy sensation.</li>
            <li> One full tub has lasted me 4 months</li>
            <li> I mever thought this facial mask is really good for my sensitive/dry skin</li>
            <li> So if this bothers you, look into a good mixing agent such as ACV (apple cider vinegar).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an all natural kind of person.</li>
            <li> and that did some good stuff, but again nothing that could really vastly make an improvement.</li>
            <li> Then after the mask, I cool my skin with 100% witch hazel (no alcohol).</li>
            <li> but sometimes this crappy acne hides that true beauty.</li>
            <li> Then after the mask, I cool my skin with 100% witch hazel (no alcohol).</li>
            <li> but sometimes this crappy acne hides that true beauty.</li>
            <li> Gives a cool tingly sensation when applied.</li>
            <li> i honestly dont use it that often and the reason why is because its a complete pain to take off.</li>
            <li> At least THIS one leaves me with great results!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t recommend this product because it doesn&#x27;t pick of most dirt and blemish</li>
            <li> Love it so much..</li>
            <li> I have good skin, but occasional break outs.  </li>
            <li> I am really loving this so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it four times, but my skin has never felt and looked this good.</li>
            <li> When you apply the mask, put the fan on full blast, and it will hasten the process so you can get on with your life</li>
            <li> This is a good home made mask that actually works.</li>
            <li> Whole foods, water, and healthy living will increase the beauty of one&#x27;s skin.&lt;br /&gt;I would encourage anyone to try this product.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t wait to see how much my skin improves with more uses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve explained how I use this clay, let me explain why I love it so much.  </li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t be to surprised it doesn&#x27;t have a nice smell.</li>
            <li> but it is so cool.</li>
            <li> I had been reading reviews with people raving how good this product was for acne and finally decided to purchase.  </li>
            <li> I followed with a cool rinse.  </li>
            <li> And I think that would be good enough for me.</li>
            <li> I recommend applying after a good 10 minute facial steam.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit...intense...but def not painful or anything.</li>
            <li> Economical and fabulous.</li>
            <li> I have very problematic skin and this stuff calms it like magic.</li>
            <li> It really pulsates your skin as it says but its not a terrible feeling to me.</li>
            <li> so far nice product.  </li>
            <li> I put it on some bug bites and the cool temperature of my Apple Cider Vinegar</li>
            <li> but you will never know the true feeling  until you try it.</li>
            <li> I also love the seller, the mask got here so stinking fast</li>
            <li> I also suggest doing the mask for a full 30 minutes to get the true effects of it.</li>
            <li> Honey is also full of antioxidants which are beneficial to your skin.</li>
            <li> Honey is also full of antioxidants which are beneficial to your skin.</li>
            <li> I intend to do this 1x per week, my skin really looks and feels both smooth and glowing!</li>
            <li> Overall a good product</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve liked it so far</li>
            <li> I love it, it really cleans your pores and your skin feels softer.</li>
            <li> (well so it felt), hemp oil has helped me the absolute most.</li>
            <li> You really do feel movement and the clay working its magic.</li>
            <li> Worked a whole lot better once I started using it with apple cider vinegar instead of water.</li>
            <li> Although I just used it once so far, I really liked the result.</li>
            <li> This really dries out my skin, but I guess that&#x27;s what most masks do.</li>
            <li> full of Aztec Clay &amp; add 2-3 tbsp of Bragg Organic Apple Cider Vinegar (also purchased from Amazon), mix together well</li>
            <li> effective and natural.</li>
            <li> Once you get this stuff mixed up it works good.  </li>
            <li> I learned a cool rehydration method for this and the Redmond Clay though.</li>
            <li> Ordered the 2lb one now,  love it so much</li>
            <li> So far... Loving it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve got a lot of cool stuff, and hey, it might be a couple dollars cheaper</li>
            <li> I use it as a full face mask as suggested and also to spot treat my blemishes.</li>
            <li> For the price (a whopping $9 &amp; free shipping), it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> I love that it pulls so much dirt.</li>
            <li> good deep cleanser for skin</li>
            <li> so you can put the good moisture back in.</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> I used maybe two spoons of clay and just poured a guesstimate amount of AVC and the consistency was good enough for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend using it with a good quality apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff and it really works</li>
            <li> I mix it with apple cider vinegar, and it gives a really cool tightening sensation on your face.</li>
            <li> and when you take the mask off your face is red for a good 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it in a bath and for mosquito bites and have had only good experiences with it in those situations as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to say that this stuff genuinely works and is totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> Love that while it&#x27;s drying, it really tightens up literally pulling your face up like a facelift.</li>
            <li> It was true.</li>
            <li> It adds a cool, tingly, freshening sensation while I&#x27;m waiting for the mask to dry.e ingredients).</li>
            <li> It feels lovely going on, but after 10-15 minutes I&#x27;m ready to take it off.</li>
            <li> Albeit my skin isn&#x27;t perfect, it&#x27;s better than it&#x27;s been for a LONG LONG time.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love it</li>
            <li> The only good thing was that it got rid of the blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li> Do NOT use it frequently with one drain, switch drains up or rinse it out in a bowl with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I work in an environment full of dust and grime and when I use this mask, it cleans my face to a T.</li>
            <li> Plus, the &amp;#34;pulsations&amp;#34; are more intense with the vinegar when compared to water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> PIMPLES.MY ENGLISH IS NOT THAT GOOD</li>
            <li> I read a bunch of reviews and they all said how you won&#x27;t be able to move your face because it&#x27;s so intense.</li>
            <li> I love it, it really helps my skin.</li>
            <li> I put a spoon full in an applicator bottle and fill the bottle up with water.</li>
            <li> does a really good deep cleanse.</li>
            <li> and my face feels super clean and refreshed when done.</li>
            <li> It does pulse a bit and that is cool, but not until the clay dries.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t notice pore shrinkage and honestly way too busy in my schedule to find time to do this often.</li>
            <li> It feels good to finally find a product that works and one</li>
            <li> This will last me a good while.</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel super clean.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive/dry mostly but it also has a tendency to pimple.</li>
            <li> I should really give it more time before I rate.  </li>
            <li> Skin looks nice and clear.</li>
            <li> So far i&#x27;m loving the results.</li>
            <li> Okay people you really are buying dirt from Amazon with this product.</li>
            <li> It is a good facial clay.</li>
            <li> Okay so I cant really say it works...</li>
            <li> But I do love how it really tightens your face....</li>
            <li> Feels cool when I use it though</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, and a lot of people have gotten results so it may be worth a try</li>
            <li> I really like this mask and it can be used way more than the package says, so you get a lot for what you pay.  </li>
            <li> In fact, in India some even use it for shampooing the hair, so it&#x27;s definitely not bad for hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You get a lot for a good price, so I think this will probably last me 6 months to a full year.  </li>
            <li> You get a lot for a good price, so I think this will probably last me 6 months to a full year.  </li>
            <li> No bad smell and</li>
            <li> I guess, if you want to try it, its not a bad idea.</li>
            <li> So far it seems pretty good.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really help for on-spot pimple treatment as others have noticed; for me, it seems to aggravate the pimple more, but I will say it does bring it to a full head</li>
            <li> not a bad product, just wasn&#x27;t for me</li>
            <li> I read some reviews and was pretty surprised by all the good things people had to say.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> All in all, I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to add something new and effective to their skincare routine!</li>
            <li> so of you want to wind down with a favorite book, put your muddy mask on and you won&#x27;t be bothered for a good hour or two.</li>
            <li> Face feels nice and clean and pores do seem cleaner and nice and  tight afterward</li>
            <li> I just wouldn&#x27;t use this first thing in the morning if you have to be somewhere right after. :)</li>
            <li> It is amazing and makes my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing and it makes your face super soft before this product acne was a problem for me.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to overlook more natural and &amp;#34;basic&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping love this stuff</li>
            <li> Feels pretty cool!</li>
            <li> Right after wiping it off your skin feels incredibly smooth too.</li>
            <li> The mixing is a little trying, but once you get it right it works!!!!!</li>
            <li> I think this huge jar will last 6 months or more!</li>
            <li> First let me say that the item arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li> because I imagine it would clog up bathroom drains pretty easily.</li>
            <li> Seller was easy to work with and provided fast delivery!</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t get deep into pores to clean out junk, but it does a much better job than most cleansers.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t get deep into pores to clean out junk, but it does a much better job than most cleansers.</li>
            <li> I found this clay to be mild, cool, and soothing.</li>
            <li> This seems to clean really well and has marginally helped with my adult cystic acne, but oh good hell, does it ever ITCH.</li>
            <li> If you mix with water, it&#x27;ll be lumpy but no less effective.</li>
            <li> The first listed review that has that wonderful tip about mixing and applying this mask is definitely the best way to do it because this stuff can be a mess and it can be hard to get a good consistent texture just mixing with a spoon or something…I always get clumps.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It mixes much more smoothly and completely with the ACV!  </li>
            <li> You could probably use pure aloe (it&#x27;s pretty cheap at Trader Joe&#x27;s or use a plant if you have one) and it would make your skin feel better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Based on my experience I think this would also be great for severe acne and would only caution someone with very, very sensitive skin to not use it as it is strong.</li>
            <li> I try to remove it by rubbing it off with wet hands making it a very effective exfoliate.</li>
            <li> My favorite face mask and so much cheaper than many high end brands</li>
            <li> My skin tone is even, and even better, the fine lines around my eyes, mouth and on my forehead are completely gone.  </li>
            <li> My skin tone is even, and even better, the fine lines around my eyes, mouth and on my forehead are completely gone.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- wash face gently with sulfur soap (I think my face likes to be very clean, but</li>
            <li> how much you mix up - it&#x27;s very easy to make way too much!</li>
            <li> When I wash it all out, my curls are extremely defined and my hair feels great.</li>
            <li> Also great on mosquito and other vampire-like bugs bites.</li>
            <li> Other than that, great product.</li>
            <li> Its natural tho and very safe even for the most sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Try not to smile or laugh because this stuff will crack!</li>
            <li> Other than that, great product.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the tingling that the other reviewers have gotten, but I&#x27;m amazed how great my skin look since I started using this once a week.  </li>
            <li> After reading other reviews I thought this product would be great, not the case.</li>
            <li> Felt great on my face, plus it says you can use it for other parts of your body so I&#x27;ll have to try that out.  </li>
            <li> great stuff, just as mentioned in all the other reviews.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My pores look so much better, my skin doesn&#x27;t look as dull, and my breakouts have been greatly reduced after maybe 3 masks in 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Would suggest to my friends and will certainly buy again!!</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t be beat, and mixes incredibly well in raw apple cider.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a new, more natural beauty routine and after doing some research, I purchased this product along with Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera, Viva Labs</li>
            <li> The first 10 minutes are fine.</li>
            <li> My skin seriously looks the best it has in years!</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty fine.</li>
            <li> and I must say its intimidating at first because you have to measure things but its fine.</li>
            <li> I use this clay on my hair and it leaves it feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel clean and fresh</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Seriously you can have gorgeous skin for $8!!</li>
            <li> A pain to clean up but so worth it.</li>
            <li> feels fresh and clean</li>
            <li> This product is great at reducing my active acne.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It had tightened my skin tremendously.</li>
            <li> If you use it on your entire face too often, it will cause your skin to over compensate for the loss of healthy moisture and oil, which will bring more unwanted oil production and breakout.</li>
            <li> skin feels cleaner afterwards, more plump (probably from the pulsing), and most of my sebaceous filaments are gone (until the next morning).</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and mild acne.</li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t feel it burn while I had it on my face, I did notice my face felt like I had a mild sunburn once I washed it off.  </li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t feel it burn while I had it on my face, I did notice my face felt like I had a mild sunburn once I washed it off.  </li>
            <li> Nothing on earth works that quickly</li>
            <li> and I still have mild acne around my mouth/chin and blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li> more than confident when I mix the clay properly next time, I will have unimaginable results.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This is seriously an awesome product, but should only be part of your bags of tricks for overall skincare.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely one of the best facial masks that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Luckily I used it at night and by morning it was gone.</li>
            <li> I wanted this to work, I have mildly combo skin and used &#x27;&#x27;clay like&#x27;&#x27; mask before.</li>
            <li> I panicked when I first washed my face, because it seemed to me that I had more acne, but I realized, that this stuff brings out whatever is lying under the first layer of the skin to the visible layer of the skin.</li>
            <li> but they go away quickly</li>
            <li> I bought 2 pounds of it and it came rather quickly.</li>
            <li> The second time I used it, I applied the mask more liberally and got even better results.</li>
            <li> will however tell you why I will be a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> a jar and quick...</li>
            <li> It is as advertise and came quickly.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick too.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, works awesome on my troubled skin</li>
            <li> My skin is prone to breakout and this stuff does not break out my skin and clears up breakouts quickly.</li>
            <li> in all, this mask is super</li>
            <li> in all, this mask is super</li>
            <li> This product probably seems super overhyped</li>
            <li> Skin Care Lotion - Ozonated Olive Oil Super Oxygen (4oz)]]</li>
            <li> Apple cider vinegar gets it to a nice smooth consistency that pulsates on the skin and dries relatively even.  </li>
            <li> When I add water to mix, this brand quickly forms surprisingly-solid clumps that do not break up and mix into paste.  </li>
            <li> This cleared up the blackheads in my nose really quickly</li>
            <li> lovely sensation, decently priced too.</li>
            <li> Quickly dropped to once a week because the effects of both the clay and the moisturizer lasted.  </li>
            <li> I really feel like I experienced a facial.</li>
            <li> SUPER quick delivery.</li>
            <li> My skin did feel tighter and pores did appear smaller, but this is something that you&#x27;d really need to do weekly to get great results.  </li>
            <li> She used it 2 or 3 times a week and her skin cleared up quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those customers who once they find a product they like, they remain loyal to it forever.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel super tingly</li>
            <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t find the work of this product to be as worthy of the praises people speak of.</li>
            <li> product arrived quickly once again.</li>
            <li> Works great for my skin, fast and simple to use.</li>
            <li> I have been making homemade lotions and scrubs, and figured I should mix up some of those ingredients to make a super mask.  </li>
            <li> I have super oily skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s skin is different and will react differently to different products, good luck!!</li>
            <li> I have fairly mild acne.</li>
            <li> I have combo skin and usually mild acne.</li>
            <li> and you feel a mild pulling sensation).</li>
            <li> I suffer from mild acne</li>
            <li> It tingles when you first apply it and dries quickly in about 15 minutes!</li>
            <li> and when i applied it to my face, it made my face super itchy</li>
            <li> Shipping was really quick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a great price, and it really does work well.</li>
            <li> make sure you use vinegar (i used white vinegar, not organic apple cider), makes the mask smoother and works 1000% times better</li>
            <li> Cheap, natural and works like magic.</li>
            <li> Mostly though what don&#x27;t care for about most commercial toothpastes is penchant for making things anti-plaque.</li>
            <li> While it may, or may not have been popular with the Aztecs, I find it helpful for a home spa day or after a camping trip,  Of course, anyone with serious, or ongoing skin problems should consult with a physician, but for me, this is a pleasant and helpful product to keep on hand.</li>
            <li> So, I quickly rinsed it off my face and phoned my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> (quickly too!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super drying.</li>
            <li> Super</li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> If it does so, i will gladly come back and give it the rating it deserves :)</li>
            <li> Throwing everything away makes clean-up quick.</li>
            <li> I did a wrap over most of my body and still had enough mixture for 1-2 more wraps.</li>
            <li> I have never used anything that has worked so quickly.</li>
            <li> and this has helped tremendously in just one use.</li>
            <li> but then they quickly went away</li>
            <li> my skin immediately felt softer and after a couple of days my mild acne was gone</li>
            <li> but if you get blackheads and mild acne every now</li>
            <li> so this didn&#x27;t do anything for my pimples (witch are relatively mild)</li>
            <li> Mixed it with apple cider vinegar and water and this is a perfect pack for oily skin.the only hassle</li>
            <li> I have experienced with how much to use and I find that 1tsp clay with 1tsp and a couple extra drops water works well for</li>
            <li> (I had one that made me look like Quasimodo, which was quickly healed by this stuff).</li>
            <li> It went away quickly.</li>
            <li> When I wake up and before bed, I wash my face with Aquaphor Baby Gentle Wash &amp; Tear Free Shampoo, Fragrance Free Mild Cleanser</li>
            <li> Love this product:) would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also amazed at how quickly it shrunk the pores on my face.</li>
            <li> I got this stuff and have been using it for a week and already see and feel a tremendous difference.</li>
            <li> I felt good about myself and my nice delicate skin.</li>
            <li> ENJOY NEW AND RENEWED SKIN NOW!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;To get the perfect consistency, I mix this in a 2-oz Tupperware container with water: the first day, it&#x27;ll probably be a bit chunky and hard to spread; however, by day two or three, it&#x27;s the perfect thick cream consistency.</li>
            <li> Next day I felt that my face was very fresh and had some kind of glow.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more from all the high reviews.</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t I know about this magical clay in high school??</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t recommend this combination of products highly enough.r, it absorbs the anti-aging cream even better.  </li>
            <li> I love this and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love it and would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Love the natural aspect of it!!</li>
            <li> love how soft it makes my skin!!</li>
            <li> Love this makes my skin so soft and no break out!!</li>
            <li> Other than that this stuff is MAGIC!!</li>
            <li> Aztec Secret Indian Clay gets 5/5 because it works great and is a wonderful natural way to clean skin of oil and clear the pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mixes well, goes on easy, no crazy smell and does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> My only word of caution is to be GENTLE taking it off and make sure you use lots of water because it can easily pull of your top layer of skin and cause redness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was quick and efficient.&lt;br /&gt;Works great on facial scarring and clearing the pores, I will definitely be buying more soon.</li>
            <li> and right after I washed it, it was clean.</li>

            <li> As funny as it sounds, I think positive thinking has also helped, and if not, it has led me to some of the most helpful skin products I&#x27;ve yet discover.</li>
            <li> My face was soft, smooth, and feels very clean, and it helps my acne and oily skin stay under control.</li>
            <li> However, after the first use, my mother and I both saw huge improvements in our skin.</li>
            <li> Started noticing her skin more drier than normal.</li>
            <li> Best clay mask ever, I can feel the &amp;#34;pulsating&amp;#34; action on my face stronger than any other clay mask I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros- removes blackheads, leaves skin feeling baby-soft and fresh, makes skin feel super clean and fresh</li>
            <li> The first couple times I used it, my skin felt sooooo smooth but after awhile, I stopped feeling the effects and it didn&#x27;t do anything for my acne</li>
            <li> first of all, CHEAP.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so smooth after using it consistently.</li>
            <li> I am overall very pleased with this mask.</li>
            <li> I have used other face masks but this works the best so far.</li>
            <li> My curls had a lovely defined but looser pattern that I don&#x27;t normally get.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t even need very much!</li>
            <li> I still have a pretty filled container.</li>
            <li> Then you feel very gentle pulses!  </li>
            <li> After applying the first time my skin felt really smooth.</li>
            <li> , luckily it&#x27;s pretty cheap though so</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t spend the time to write reviews but this product is so brilliant</li>
            <li> I just used it for my first time, and my skin is baby bottom smooth.</li>
            <li> Avoid doing it warm, the results are far better when its chilled.&lt;br /&gt;3) Get a bucket, and a old wash cloth.</li>
            <li> Overall very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s normal, healthy, glowing self.</li>
            <li> This is normal, just know that the mask has worked its magic.</li>
            <li> Some people said to use a foundation brush, I just made sure the blush brush was one that was a bit courser than a normal one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and the very first time is used it (with apple cider vinegar)</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling very smooth and cleansed!</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in a long time.</li>
            <li> , this seems to be a good combo for skin starting to age noticeably, at a far more affordable price point than m</li>
            <li> It works and it feels good on the face but don&#x27;t leave it on for too long.</li>
            <li> This clay feels so good on your face, as long as you use ACV with it.</li>
            <li> I use a Konjac Sponge for a more natural version of a loofah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so far really loving this routine.</li>
            <li> i  use a non alcoholic witch hazel (the real kind) after rubbing the mask off.  </li>
            <li> I always make my facial mask with organic raw apple cider vinegar with &#x27;mother&#x27;; it mixes beautifully and results in a nice, smooth application.</li>
            <li> Hands down this is the best mud mask that I have purchased thus far!</li>
            <li> So far, I love it, and I feel like my teeth are just as clean as the fluoride stuff.</li>
            <li> If this is too strong, it may be a good idea to dilute it slightly with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It washes off easily enough with warm water and a clean washcloth.</li>
            <li> im actually removing all the gunk and keeping my skin nice and clean.</li>
            <li> usually apply it with regular apple cider vinegar (because the other kind is honestly a bit more than I am willing to spend) one to three times per week and have had excellent results.</li>
            <li> I had great results from Origins high priced charcoal clay mask and figured if I added the charcoal to the Aztec Clay the outcome would be the same.</li>
            <li> work for a plastic surgeon, and this mask is better than most things we sell as far as a safe, all around facial treatment that has no downtime and can be used by any skin type, while allowing the ability to customize the intensity and effects by adding a diluted apple vinegar solution vs water, or  lighter vs heavier layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Feel free to ask me any questions, everyone is different and this so far has been the most affordable effective product i have ever tried.</li>
            <li> This is literally the best face mask I have ever tried, and I&#x27;ve tried everything from high dollar chemical peels to organic Dead Sea minerals.</li>
            <li> I feel very clean, my skin is fresh and the next day my complection is so much better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhoo, I find the plastic scoop method works the best, and leaves minimal clean up, as opposed to using a kitchen bowl and spoon which tend to leave quite a bit more mess.</li>
            <li> It will keep your skin looking healthy without giving you new pimples.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Okay people - I always do my research before buying a new product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pain to always have to mix up a new batch every time, and most of the time</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rosehip Oil is my new love when it comes to beauty products.</li>
            <li> &quot; I can tell you this is my new favorite and a must have --</li>
            <li> Love it can live with out it</li>
            <li> I have used it in a bath previously with great results.</li>
            <li> Whether oily or dry, your pores will be cleaned out and tightened and your skin will be bright and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You end up with a comfortable smooth, clean, clear complexion.</li>
            <li> its also great in bring black heads to the surface.</li>
            <li> After you take it off your face will be bright red and hot</li>
            <li> We look odd while we are wearing it, but our skin looks great when we are not.</li>
            <li> The apple cider vinegar that I used worked really well and made it easy to mix.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m redoing most of this review just because its gotten too long for most people to want to read.</li>
            <li> however, it might be too much for my easily irritated skin to handle.</li>
            <li> I like to use it just for the blackheads on my nose because it&#x27;s so strong that it really pulls everything out in one go.</li>
            <li> After 20 minutes, I use warm water to clear up, the skin feels soft, smooth and bright; my pores are smaller</li>
            <li> It is somewhat challenging to estimate how much you will need, and I ended up mixing too much my first time.</li>
            <li> Leave on until it is good and dry.  </li>
            <li> Today I washed with Cetophil, followed it with 100% natural witchhazel toner (Dickinson&#x27;s), applied the mask for 12 minutes, and finished with Sweet Blessed Bee Magic skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t clean my skin, it doesn&#x27;t clear my pores, to be totally honest it doesn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
            <li> Great as a full face mask or just use it on your trouble areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every night mixing it with apple cider vinegar and letting a good layer dry on my face for 30 minutes to an hour.</li>
            <li> If you do leave it on for more than the recommended time (30min I think) be prepared for a reddened face, but if it&#x27;s a cheap and deep clean</li>
            <li> This is the first mask I&#x27;ve bought that I actually feel like DOES SOMETHING, besides just feeling good.  </li>
            <li> After your acne is clear you can do this facial once to twice a week and continuously have beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> More importantly it helps clean the deep blackheads and acne areas!</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, please use a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I first bought this at whole foods about a year ago and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and easy to  use just once a week is recommended.</li>
            <li> Cool product, really nice facial.</li>
            <li> My face didn&#x27;t dry out which was surprising.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m left with glowing, taut and clear beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff as after I use it, my pores are smaller and face feels clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Really really good it pulls you pimples out and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin 😊</li>
            <li> Not gonna lie, it did leave my face quite dry after i used it, but it&#x27;s nothing that a good moisterizer can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall we love this product &amp; will continue to purchase this reasonably priced (so affordable) miracle in a tub!oduct &amp; will continue to purchase this reasonably priced (so affordable) miracle in a tub!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive combination skin, and I just LOVE what this does for my skin.</li>
            <li> So - you have to figure out the best plan of action in getting it off of you without putting it down the sink.</li>
            <li> I just used this for the first time today and my skin feels tighter and my pesky blackheads are gone!</li>
            <li> &amp; it was exactly as described!</li>
            <li> When I first started using it people kept asking me if i was preggo, because my face was glowing!</li>
            <li> I almost felt that I could do a wash and go for the first time in my life!</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time today since I was too excited to wait.</li>
            <li> first try, left my skin red but the results were really great! ....</li>
            <li> Buy online from iherb.com, use code KOY923 at checkout for $5.00 off your first purchase!</li>
            <li> this first time around !</li>
            <li> I just used this for the first time, it works wonders!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love so far!</li>
            <li> It really really works wonders!!</li>
            <li> I use this mixed with ACV, then an enzyme mask, followed up with a hydrating mask and my skin has never been better!</li>
            <li> I am so thankful I found this mask and would absolutely recommend this!!</li>
            <li> First application and voila!</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s pretty worth it!</li>
            <li> This is my first review because it deserves one!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product and i&#x27;m hooked!  </li>
            <li> it really does make your face pulsate when it dries!!</li>
            <li> It really makes a difference on my skin!!</li>
            <li> Get it there if it&#x27;s near you! :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be warned: You will break out at first in the beginning!</li>
            <li> Felt like a baby&#x27;s bottom for real!!</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping much at this time, after 2 uses!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I mixed this product with apple cider video and really enjoyed the results!</li>
            <li> It works great if you don&#x27;t mind the mess.</li>
            <li> Ive been using it for only 2 weeks and not one pimple has grown and most of my acne scars have disappeared!</li>
            <li> I have done a number of masks but this is the first one where I felt the change in skin as soon as I put it on!</li>
            <li> I saw some results after the first use!</li>
            <li> Definitely one of my favorite face masks!</li>
            <li> I used to be the kind of person to be so inpatient with new products and wanted fast result</li>
            <li> right after my first try my face was as smooth as of a baby.</li>
            <li> My skin is cleaner, dry and free of oil, smoother, tighter, and feels amazing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes in a nice wide mouth tub with a screw lid, easy for scooping out</li>
            <li> It is a helpful resource for anyone wanting easy, credible tips on natural beauty alternatives.</li>
            <li> I also think it&#x27;s great for oily skin because it will dry up your face but not so much and not cause a breakout.</li>
            <li> This takes care of the acne, seems to even out both the oily and the dry skin, and BEST OF ALL, lessens the Rosacea redness and veiny look the next day.  </li>
            <li> mask would be AWESOME for people with OILY AND NOT SUPER SENSITIVE</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t magically cured my mild adult acne as some said but does help my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is much more matte now and feels super soft.</li>
            <li> Soo tight lol</li>
            <li> My skin felt very smooth and soft</li>
            <li> But this mask can really help and I&#x27;m so glad it makes my skin feel baby soft and has caused many pimples to disappear after the first application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But this mask can really help and I&#x27;m so glad it makes my skin feel baby soft and has caused many pimples to disappear after the first application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a clean ceramic soap dish and hot water.  </li>
            <li> Just mix with water, use plastic gloves to apply to face, and allow to sit for 20 minutes, and use a hot wash cloth to clean it off.</li>
            <li> It is a pain to make it a consistent paste, and it is a pain to clean the sink and counter afterwards.</li>
            <li> I find it easier to mix &amp; apply with a clean make-up brush (foundation brush to be exact)</li>
            <li> My face was pretty clean</li>
            <li> All i wanted was a brighter look and maybe a bit of shine since my face was already pretty clean.</li>
            <li> It does leave your face feeling pretty clean.</li>
            <li> over the years this is my second jar which comes in plastic and is durable,this is a good face toner it you mix with water its a sacred mud thing if you try it its a jar of all you need for a healthy complextion water is needed 2 mix and until smooth apply and let get totally dry on face that is all 2 it</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling very smooth and soft but the lessening of breakouts make it well worth buying.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to use with apple cider vinegar (the high quality kind) to make a make a paste.</li>
            <li> This product is great, it help stop the little breakouts I would have from time to time.</li>
            <li> You most certainly need to be gentle with it.</li>
            <li> I have a tendency to get the quarter/silver dollar size hard, incredibly itchy bites.</li>
            <li> My face felt a little warm, but I&#x27;m sure I can attribute that to the blood vessels and circulation being enhanced or</li>
            <li> My face felt a little warm, but I&#x27;m sure I can attribute that to the blood vessels and circulation being enhanced or</li>
            <li> Use a large bowl filled with warm water and a wash cloth and dump it outside after you have removed this from your face.</li>
            <li> It is super soft and feels very clean.</li>
            <li> very good four stars because it&#x27;s only external....</li>
            <li> I used it back to back and got very good results the 1st time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m super excited about this product and definitely recommend it :)</li>
            <li> Overall this is an amazing product</li>
            <li> I followed with a gentle witch hazel toner and some oil free spf lotion.</li>
            <li> it can help calm hives from the itching and burning too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is an amazing facial you mix with vinegar.</li>
            <li> I never would have thought a simple clay mask would be so amazing.</li>
            <li> it dries out acne within 24hrs and leave skin very cleansed and smooth.</li>
            <li> I use Witch Hazel (organic, fragrance free) and there have been no skin reactions to so much being done at once.  </li>
            <li> I used Apple Cider vinegar and made a very watery paste, which I applied with a make-up/shaving brush -- Fantastic results.</li>
            <li> really cleans face and leaves it feeling amazingly smooth.  </li>
            <li> it would be an truly amazing product you actually feel it working.</li>
            <li> I applied it to my bug bites (green fly) which</li>
            <li> Once you get it off your face feels so clean and your skin is super smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Such an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I am using this for amazing facial masks</li>
            <li> I only purchased it because of the amazing reviews it had and the price.</li>
            <li> It gives amazing results and even made by pores smaller!!!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this is natural and it really makes  your skin feel so smooth once you&#x27;ve washed it off.</li>
            <li> I was only using this clay for my face (which works amazingly for acne btw)</li>
            <li> I am so happy eiith this product and wish i can use it everyday.</li>
            <li> we used what still an amazing deep cleaning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten all my aunts to use it and some of them , well into their 50s, have gotten amazing results after using it multiple times.</li>
            <li> After such amazing results I wanted to immediately do it again</li>
            <li> and when I looked up at my makeup free face, I immediately noticed how much smoother my skin looked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mask for several months now and have had amazing</li>
            <li> This stuff was intense and made my face feel baby smooth.</li>
            <li> My nose has been a huge problem my whole life, and i have tried everything.</li>
            <li> It was amazing and gross</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m going to give it a 2 stars because I immediately found something else that I liked a lot better and probably won&#x27;t bother using anymore of the clay mask and felt I sort of wasted my money on it.</li>
            <li> it was very deep cleaning and amazing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not clumpy if you add enough acv, real smooth creamy texture.</li>
            <li> I use it weekly as part of my facial routine and my skin always feels amazing after.</li>
            <li> WORLD&#x27;S MOST POWERFUL FACIAL is accurate.</li>
            <li> Again, there are plenty of websites out there that preach the amazing reasons to use this essential oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but my overall complexion is amazing,</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great mask without all the harsh chemical you should give this a try</li>
            <li> I hope by using this mask often (everyday) for a week I will see great improvement in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I have larger pores and this mask is amazing.</li>
            <li> Second application, my face looked amazing.</li>
            <li> I used regular acv and it still worked amazingly well.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, especially mixed with apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> i actually use this stuff every week on fridays and my skin is so amazing</li>
            <li> and I look like a different, fresh faced, amazing woman.</li>
            <li> Such a bargain and an amazing product.</li>
            <li> You should use the apple cider as recommended instead of water since it would make the paste to put on your face much smoother and clump free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s greatly improved my uneven skin tone and makes my skin look brighter and tighter after use.</li>
            <li> I will only use with apple cider vinegar but amazing.</li>
            <li> In the beginning I thought it was a great product, leaving my skin smooth &amp; drying (nothing that moisturizer/oil can&#x27;t fixed) but recently after applying it all over my face it was very itchy.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using it, my skin looks and feels amazing, and it actually does make your skin tingle while it&#x27;s drying.</li>
            <li> my face IS BRIGHT RED AND BURNING WHERE THE MASK WAS APPLIED AND GENTLY</li>
            <li> My makeup went on so much more smoothly the following morning</li>
            <li> It minimizes my pores and makes my face look fresh.</li>
            <li> This is truly the worlds best kept secret.</li>
            <li> and I recommend it to anyone wanting to change up their beauty regimen with something more natural and not chemically.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a last ditch effort to save myself a trip to the dermatologist and I am beyond thrilled.</li>
            <li> well worth it</li>
            <li> I did actually feel my skin pulsating and there is a nice cooling effect also</li>
            <li> This mask is powerful and literally pulls EVERYTHING (water, dirt, oil, etc) out.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like a big jar of dirt that you have to mix on your own.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it does help to clear my pores.</li>
            <li> I wash it off in a seperate bin of warm waterd drain it outside!</li>
            <li> The nice thing is that the gritty texture acts as a exfoliating scrub as you are removing it.</li>

            <li> I mix this with equal parts apple cider vinegar and use it as a face mask - works great, my skin glows and is really soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> and I did feel my face actually pulsate, and the feeling of my face afterward is nice as well.</li>

            <li> I recommend this for anyone who especially has acne, or any kind of skin problem</li>
            <li> But I feel that its worth the trouble to get the great results.</li>
            <li> and now I rarely get zits ..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money--</li>
            <li> Better than Queen Helene&#x27;s Mint Julep mask and Lush&#x27;s Mask in Magnaminty.</li>
            <li> Trust me, it&#x27;s SO worth</li>
            <li> Trust me, it&#x27;s SO worth it.</li>
            <li> it is definitely worth a try, though.</li>
            <li> I felt the pulsating which was pretty cool.</li>
            <li> is directly after cleansing, I mix this 1:1 with distilled water and add a teaspoon of my favorite toner.</li>
            <li> So I decided to turn to a more natural alternative.</li>
            <li> but i figured it was worth a shot.</li>

            <li> okay using this mixture with was some tiny cheap brush</li>
            <li> I mixed the clay with the apple cider vinegar, but I have a friend who tried it with just water and liked it as well.</li>
            <li> thing worth noting:</li>
            <li> I mix up my own personalized clay mixture with the following ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Jump into warm shower (during shower, I wash my face last).</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd week of using this product and honestly, I cannot say it does miracles</li>
            <li> I put a warm washcloth over my face for a couple minutes to open up my pores and then applied the paste.</li>
            <li> Hello economical product</li>
            <li> The good thing about this sandwich bag method is that if you have any extra (and I always make too much)</li>
            <li> if you can with stand it then its all worth it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Months later update (6/11/11)&lt;br /&gt;I kept using this because I liked how it pulled out all the oil</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good mask for oily skin, but be careful it can clog your pipe drains like cement.</li>
            <li> The quantity you receive for the price is worth it, I recommend this stuff to my friends.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it does wonders for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I love mud masks, I make natural masks myself and was unsure about this one, but MAN did it exceed my expectations.</li>
            <li> My skin actually felt really nice after.  </li>
            <li> naturally if you want more then just follow through (eg 2 teaspoons one teaspoon of h20 or</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and my color looks so much better.</li>
            <li> and it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite thing I have bought off amazon.</li>
            <li> But if you use it more frequently like 2x a weeks you should use a moisturizing face mask as well.</li>
            <li> This clay is fun to mix up, like playing in mud.  </li>
            <li> Useful</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li> This product is 6$ and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The feeling of tightness/pulling results in a really effective deep cleaning of the skin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth the effort.</li>
            <li> My face almost always reacts to face washes, so that&#x27;s kind of a regular happening.</li>
            <li> It was worth</li>
            <li> All worth a try...</li>
            <li> This product was worth taking the time to write a review..</li>
            <li> I did that the first time and did not get the full effect of the mask.</li>
            <li> Used a big bowl with warm water and a wash cloth to take off.</li>
            <li> Honestly, about a tablespoon is enough for your face</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to mix up and use</li>
            <li> but I guess it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> and I rarely breakout.</li>
            <li> This is so worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many mud masks over the years &amp; having my face pulse is pretty normal to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is a fun product to use.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll edit when it&#x27;s off to let you know how it goes, but i&#x27;m enjoying it tentatively thus far.</li>
            <li> It works well giving my face a fresh glow and seem to have reduced the pores on my nose.  </li>
            <li> It is worth every penny and you can use it everywhere on the body even on scratches- dries up in a jiffy.</li>
            <li> However it is powerful.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and looks so much better.</li>
            <li> and it seems to be fun.</li>
            <li> I rarely break out anymore</li>
            <li> It was well worth the smoother skin and reduced acne.  </li>
            <li> It was well worth the smoother skin and reduced acne.  </li>
            <li> i LOVE using any type of natural clay in my skincare regimen.</li>
            <li> but this so far is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Kinda fun to mix it yourself</li>
            <li> After I rinse off the mask with a warm, damp washcloth and moisturize, my skin literally feels like butter, my pores are visibilly reduced, and my overall tone is improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your hair will look and feel soft, shiny, healthy and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> With most face masks I can&#x27;t see any noticeable difference between the before/after, but within a day of using this my skin is soft and acne/redness is under control.</li>
            <li> After applying try not to smile or laugh...</li>
            <li> ehhh actually do smile and laugh</li>
            <li> Like many others said, this thing does pull away oil and make your skin feel soft.  </li>
            <li> I used warm water but still got a lot of tiny clumps.  </li>
            <li> I have used it twice so far and love the results.  </li>
            <li> : Mix this with natural yoghurt to create a better paste.</li>
            <li> I say it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I say it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the $10.</li>
            <li> I gave it 5 stars because it is totally worth it for the price and benefits.</li>
            <li> After every masque session, I use Thayer&#x27;s all natural Witch Hazel Rose toner (you can also find this at Whole Foods) and it soothes, cleanses, and closes up those opened pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> More product used the thicker and stronger the throbbing action is&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> Make sure to mix with apple cider vinegar for best effect (stinks, but whatever!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> I have been making my own facial masks for years, using ingredients that we all probably have located in our kitchens.</li>
            <li> I then removed the mask 20 minutes later in the shower with warm water and my hands.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that you feel instant results of freshness and smoothness on your face.</li>
            <li> but the results are worth it.  </li>
            <li> Fun tip:  </li>
            <li> I tried this as a face mask and liked it overall.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth trying.  </li>
            <li> I feel like it gives your face a fresh start.</li>
            <li> I used this one time so far, and I love it.</li>
            <li> this would be worth a try.</li>
            <li> Although I liked the way my face felt during and after wearing the mask, the next morning I&#x27;d wake up to 3-4 pimples on my forehead</li>
            <li> Those three ingredients are found in most acne treatment creams and face washes, so I had to steer clear of those.</li>
            <li> laugh lines.</li>
            <li> Who knew this stuff could be so useful?</li>
            <li> No artificial anything.</li>
            <li> Your skin feels fresh and glowing when you rinse off.</li>
            <li> For some, it may be useful.</li>
            <li> I can already tell this product is paving the way for success after 8 years, and hopefully with use of this I will be at ease.</li>

            <li> I rarely have a breakout.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff, its as good as anything else you could use, you can mix it with different things depending on your needs.</li>
            <li> but by the time i wash it off my skin is so fresh.</li>
            <li> If u know ur skin very well u should be able to know when it starts to feel congested as if it has to much build up and junk in it.</li>
            <li> My skin has NEVER been more clear.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, this stuff is pretty sweet.</li>
            <li> When mixed thoroughly it has a kind of \\&quot;whipped\\&quot; consistency.  </li>
            <li> That would be worth it.</li>
            <li> That would be worth it. ...</li>
            <li> Mixing it with vinegar makes it twice as powerful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit of work, but it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> and I am able to keep it on until it completely dries with no issues (using apple cider vinegar).</li>
            <li> So if you decide the risk is worth</li>
            <li> but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> For the price I got a lot for my money&#x27;s worth and will use it all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product twice but am thrilled by the results.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth reading still, for those who&#x27;d like to know.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The next morning, I saw many pimples that have come to light...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a lot of product, so it&#x27;s really worth the price too.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it makes your face soft.</li>
            <li> , I must say a best kept secret until I stumbled upon it here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Soft, almost pore free skin!</li>
            <li> Thus far I&#x27;m glad I made the decision.  </li>
            <li> After that it wasn&#x27;t worth the cleanup, the product had lost its allure for me.</li>
            <li> I love you so much, it is helped improve the texture of mine and my husband skin so much.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I apply lush cosmetics catastrophe cosmetic on top of the redness.</li>
            <li> Removing it is a chore in itself, but the results are well worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that a nice, even layer enough to cover your skin is all that&#x27;s needed.</li>
            <li> I guess if I liked the product enough, I would feel like</li>
            <li> Wow, it is definitely the strongest mask I have ever experienced.  </li>
            <li> Skin feels nice after I did the mask, and the pores on my nose do look smaller.</li>
            <li> but after this, worth it.</li>
            <li> ; this may be dirt, but dirt worth every penny.</li>
            <li> My skin is very oily, especially in the summer, and this stuff does a great job of balancing my skin out and clearing up acne fast.  </li>
            <li> I can nearly promise that you&#x27;ll be happy with the results.the face than on the body; I&#x27;ve yet to try it on my facial</li>
            <li> Make-up is easier to apply and makes my face look fresh and renewed.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve also developed more acne.  </li>
            <li> It is all worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is worth it.</li>
            <li> And to be perfectly honest, the only reason I am using a separate moisturizer for daytime and nighttime is</li>
            <li> The next day my makeup went on my face so smoothly and my pores were looking much better.</li>
            <li> Its definitely worth it though.</li>
            <li> This product definitely tightens the skin and leaves it feeling nice and cleansed.  </li>
            <li> I am trying to use more natural products and stay away from chemical-based items, for that reason this product appealed to me.  </li>
            <li> it!This stuff is pretty sweet.</li>
            <li> Definitely have a nice face cream on hand after washing this stuff off.</li>
            <li> So far, I love hemp oil--</li>
            <li> But its totally worth it and goes away...</li>
            <li> I also apply aloe vera (fresh) on scars and redness to speed up the healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I saw some reviews on this stuff and thought that it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> Then i mixed it with apple cider vinegar, much more smooth consistency</li>
            <li> Many people as well as myself recommend that you use an old make up brush or shaving brush to mix and apply the mask.</li>
            <li> This is very much worth</li>
            <li> This is very much worth</li>
            <li> and afterwards my face feels fresh</li>
            <li> (even with the cons it is worth it to me)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had this product for over a year and it is truly powerful.</li>
            <li> I then rinse my face with warm water just to remove any residue that was left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that if it works it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This product is no frills, but is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> After mixing this with apple cider and vinegar, my face feel soft and supple like a baby&#x27;s bottom :) .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pain to take off but worth the results.</li>
            <li> I mix it with apple cider vinegar and leave it on for 10 mins since my skin is more sensitive.</li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t smile hehe</li>
            <li> but once I baught it it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> Hyper pigmentation always looks so much better - sometimes the marks are completely gone.</li>
            <li> Hyper pigmentation always looks so much better - sometimes the marks are completely gone.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> This stuff is worth the hype &amp; the five-star rating.</li>
            <li> I left it for about 15 minutes and rinsed it out with warm water.</li>
            <li> Love this for managing my adult acne, along with apple cider  vinegar.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> then it said it would which was really exciting.</li>
            <li> oh well, it&#x27;d be a fun thing to do.</li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than expected and sealed perfectly.</li>
            <li> With over 70 minerals, what more can you ask for in an all natural product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m someone who has used so many different products because it has always been important for me to take care of my skin.  </li>
            <li> For a price you can&#x27;t beat and frequent use its grand for us oil producing madhouses.</li>
            <li> When the mask dries though you can&#x27;t smile or else it hurts a lot.</li>
            <li> I just eyeball enough of the clay to put on my face and add warm water to it as needed when I mix it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better pore cleansers, but this one is supposedly natural.</li>
            <li> Then I saw the price and was even more surprised..</li>
            <li> I left it on for twenty minutes then rinsed with WARM water, and I&#x27;ve got to tell you while I was rinsing it off</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok so far, I&#x27;ve use it on face and it feel refreshed afterward.</li>
            <li> : Simple, natural clay mask, great for weekly or twice weekly use.</li>
            <li> stuff is totally worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But, I don&#x27;t think it was worth it...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne on and off for the better part of my young life.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth a try.  </li>
            <li> If anything, it only exacerbated my acne, which honestly wasn&#x27;t even that severe to begin with.</li>
            <li> I use it with Apple Cider Vinegar, and I love how it &amp;#34;foams&amp;#34; up and feels so soft going on to my face.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the product thus far.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really not that good.</li>
            <li> I love how  soft my face feels.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews</li>
            <li> Its worth it</li>
            <li> the mixture isn&#x27;t lumpy, but I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li> product is worth it and has been the strongest acne solution I&#x27;ve ever use and trust me</li>
            <li> I love this clay and you get such a generous amount for such a good price.</li>
            <li> but hey, it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> Completely amazed at how well this pile of dirt works :)</li>
            <li> Well worth the effort.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cute the acne completely cuz they are teenagers after all.</li>
            <li> The last 2 times I have done it on my own</li>
            <li> Make sure you apply it with your hands for a thicker application, and when you&#x27;re ready to take it off, wet a washcloth in warm water, put it up to your face in sections and it just wipes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Love it so far.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still totally worth it.</li>
            <li> It actually was nice on my skin</li>
            <li> I can honestly state that my skin has improved and is actually glowing.</li>
            <li> Baiden mitten in the shower to exfoliate, clay mask, a nice facial oil or lotion to finish up.</li>
            <li> It may stink but it&#x27;s totally worth it for the results.</li>
            <li> All organic which makes it useful to anyone.</li>
            <li> Honestly the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the Apple Cider Vinegar smell...</li>
            <li> The great thing is that after using the mask it unclogs pores without the pain and swelling that happens from unclogging pores with a professional facial.</li>
            <li> This is mother natures best kept beauty secret.</li>
            <li> Just make sure that you do not allow this powder to come into contact with any metal as it will decrease its natural healing properties.</li>
            <li> My mom actually ended up purchasing her own tub to take home after her visit.</li>
            <li> If you invite your girlfriends over for a fun spa night to use this mud, they will kill you.</li>
            <li> If you invite your girlfriends over for a fun spa night to use this mud, they will kill you.</li>
            <li> I expected good things</li>
            <li> Many masques I have used for sensitive skin have done nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> It tightens my pores and leaves my face fresh.</li>
            <li> but it is soooooo worth it.  </li>
            <li> Bought this with some Bragg&#x27;s Apple Cider Vinegar, and it was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth a try</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail today, I am a 34 yr old mother of 3 and have suffered with acne/blackheads most of my life.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend using it on your hair, since it will take out all your hair&#x27;s natural oil and will leave your hair oiler since your hair is trying to restore all the lost oil by producing more oil.</li>
            <li> cause i love natural beauty products and face masques.</li>
            <li> Powerful stuff,</li>
            <li> My skin is really sensitive to most products.</li>
            <li> but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> If you have not tried Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque, its worth a shot.</li>
            <li> The Aztec Secret is AMAZING!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this face mask, it helps to keep my acne at bay while helping to keep my pores clear.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend the Origin Charcoal Mask over this product, it&#x27;s definitely worth your money.</li>
            <li> but it would be worth it if I saw results</li>
            <li> This is a fun product.  </li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s all natural too.</li>
            <li> Def worth the hype.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to mix up, all goopy and muddy.</li>
            <li> After the mask completely dries rinse it off gently with warm water.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have it on right now (for the first time) and it does pulsate and burn!</li>
            <li> The skin is so clean, smooth and tight afterwards, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how effective it is against acne, but my skin feel clean, smooth and tight after doing the mask for 20 mins.  </li>
            <li> Normally, using any kind of product that many days would wreak havoc on my skin, break me out, and dry the eff out of my face.  </li>
            <li> I leave my mask on for 20-30 minutes to make sure it&#x27;s completely dry (you won&#x27;t be able to move your face easily, haha!)</li>
            <li> My skin became much less combination and much more normal, it&#x27;s good, man.</li>
            <li> I started using this clay as a mask because reviews were very positive about how it helps with acne problems.</li>
            <li> When I feel like I need to, I like to use a nose strip right after, just to get what&#x27;s left over, and my nose has never ever been clearer, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Using something natural on your face makes more since than putting chemicals on it, right??</li>
            <li> Very affordable and very worth it.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel nice and tight and clean!</li>
            <li> So, if you don&#x27;t mind paying $120 to a dermatologist to calm and soothe your skin and keep yourself from looking like a zombie with skin falling off your face, then go right ahead.  </li>
            <li> Once the mask is rinsed off, my skin is slightly red, but feels very clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Microdermabrasion does the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it kind of feels the same as an acid peel, I&#x27;d definitely have a good soothing moisturizer with high SPF on hand - like 50 or 55 - before going outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I chose this mask due to the reviews and low price, felt it the best pick.  </li>
            <li> It surely works for many other people.</li>
            <li> I did many of the other reviews before trying it out to make sure I was using it correctly.  </li>
            <li> We use this for saddle sores (cycling) and various other skin eruptions and it works greatly!!  </li>
            <li> However, if mixed with other ingredients it is a wonderful detox tool.  </li>
            <li> Nevertheless, the effects are not as stunning as said by some people, yes, it would clean your skin nicely, but do not expect it to change your complexion dramatically, at least it was not the case for me.</li>
            <li> My fiance and I used it and it was fun putting it on each other and the both of us loved how it felt,once we took it off.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t even really get &amp;#34;strays&amp;#34; anymore; my face has never looked so clear and felt so clean :)</li>
            <li> Super Fast Shipping Speed!</li>
            <li> I used super hot water on the rag and wrung it out and laid it on my face to soften the mask (like they do at the spa), then rubbed the mask off keeping the chunks inside the rag and using the bowl to dump the clumps into.</li>
            <li> creative, it&#x27;s a pure product and high quality.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be hard to rinse off, but it wasn&#x27;t ( rinsed off very easily with warm water).  </li>
            <li> I could feel tightening and sucking, it feels kind of nice, fresh, relaxing, cooling, I was happy already, I did get frustrated at removal, I think that final battle to reclaim your face may be the cause for the irritation which in my case was very mild.</li>
            <li> Use a good hot-as-you-can-stand-it wet, rough washcloth to repeatedly wipe it off, then wash your face in warm water, finish in cool water.  </li>
            <li> omg love this in connection with this raw honey, vitamin c serum and rose water toner</li>
            <li> My face really feels fresh and clean of all impurities.</li>
            <li> I love this mask , saves my skin every time I need a deep clean.</li>
            <li> once off my skin felt clean and free of any grime or old makeup.</li>
            <li> I left it on for about 20 - 25 minutes (durring which time you cannot speak as the mask is SUPER tight) and when I rinsed it off my face felt incredible!  </li>
            <li> I find it makes my skin very clean and surprisingly soft.</li>
            <li> It is a very strong and powerful clay and I can feel it penetrating deep into my pores.</li>
            <li> still have blackheads and breakouts, but this clay has significantly improved the size and amount of the blackheads on my nose and keeps my skin from being oily- in spite of living in a very humid place.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> This is what I did, I used this straight for about 4 days, I mixed it with the apple cider vinegar, and also, I diluted a tablespoon of the apple cider vinegar  in water and drank it (no silly, without the clay) as it is good for you, don&#x27;t worry about the taste...</li>
            <li> More importantly, the small bumps I&#x27;ve had on my forehead that I&#x27;ve never been able to get rid of?</li>
            <li> as shampoo for problem scalp -- see other good reviews on this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It hasen&#x27;t really made a significant a change in my skin</li>
            <li> , it seems to do some good, but nothing like the other reviewers claimed.  </li>
            <li> That said this is a good powder for other stuff.</li>
            <li> Really clears the pores, and is fun!</li>
            <li> I read a whole lot of reviews regarding this mask and was really excited to use it.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve just finished my very first application process and so far not bad!</li>
            <li> not seeing the results in other reviews, but good.</li>
            <li> but I make sure to keep it really moisturized with a high spf sunblock.</li>
            <li> Because of the really high reviews and people writing success stories, I was filled with hope.</li>
            <li> Upon reading the numerous amounts of good reviews on this product, I had high expectations.</li>
            <li> I have this mask on right now as I&#x27;m typing this review.  </li>
            <li> I always put a nose strip on right after I wash this off.</li>
            <li> She uses it once a week right now.  </li>
            <li> I got it right away</li>
            <li> but to me something doesn&#x27;t seem right.</li>
            <li> and it comes RIGHT OFF.</li>
            <li> and it comes RIGHT OFF.</li>
            <li> so I bought it right away.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it right away.</li>
            <li> Add some water and clay into the tupperware until you get the right mixture, then stir with a plastic spoon until all the lumps are gone.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just itchy right away</li>
            <li> I did have a bit of peeling around the mouth area, but I exfoliated this morning and it came right off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wearing it right now (face &amp; neck)...</li>
            <li> This clay worked right after I used it.</li>
            <li> I put the mask on right away and afterwards</li>
            <li> I recieved it in the mail today as and of course tried it right away.  </li>
            <li> read the label &amp; it will get you going in the right direction.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;m taking some acne medication</li>
            <li> Now, I don&#x27;t want to go into a pep talk lecture here, so let me get right to it, but I just want you all to know that 1)</li>
            <li> I mix it with Braggs Apple Cider vinegar until I have just the right consistency and leave it on for about 15-30 minutes and as soon as you rinse you notice and feel a difference.</li>
            <li> you get it in order to kinda turn your face around to the right direction.</li>
            <li> I went to the dermatologist right around the time that I bought this.  </li>
            <li> But go with what feels right for</li>
            <li> If you just jump right in and smear the cloth over your face you&#x27;re going to scream like Macaulay in Home</li>
            <li> But fear not, this stuff wipes right off anything.</li>
            <li> But fear not, this stuff wipes right off anything.</li>
            <li> it PULSATE to the point of tuck and pull the skin right off of my face while having a mask of burning needles jabbing at it all at once.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps this is a misuse of the the review feature, but right now (9/12/2013)</li>
            <li> It was all right, but after using it my skin was still clogged up.</li>
            <li> Right afer</li>
            <li> I can just mix the right amount I need just for that moment.</li>
            <li> Just try it and you will notice the benefits right away.</li>
            <li> Use a moisturizer right after use, because it does draw everything out of pores.</li>
            <li> You can see the difference right away.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see results right away but after trying it</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t put it on right before going out.</li>
            <li> so i rinsed it off right away.</li>
            <li> Well, it didn&#x27;t happen right away.  </li>
            <li> I like to moisture right away.</li>
            <li> so maybe I didn&#x27;t apply it right</li>
            <li> Still need to get the mixing done right to avoid clumps though.</li>
            <li> I prefer doing this right before a shower because it&#x27;s easier to wash off in the shower (comes off in chunks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:</li>
            <li> and I just washed it off right away in the shower</li>
            <li> I have some of this mask on my chin right now</li>
            <li> But I do this right before bed and go to sleep.</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li> and I have it on right now.</li>
            <li> The mask is also drying so use moisturizer right after.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm, right from day#1.</li>
            <li> If using water this will not have the right consistency .</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think I used right.</li>
            <li> This right here will change your life.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the right product for me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it right before going out.  </li>
            <li> I got this 2 days ago and tried it right away at night.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The price was right</li>
            <li> I use a spoon to scoop some out and then mix it with organic apple cider vinegar until I get the right consistency.</li>
            <li> RIGHT</li>
            <li> u just popped and it will heal right up.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t feel anything happening right off the bat.</li>
            <li> right.</li>
            <li> This stuff cleared me right up.</li>
            <li> I was a bit miffed at the person who shipped it, since they put their product sticker right over the instructions for use.</li>
            <li> Make it – clumps up, you have to stir it forever to make it right consistency.</li>
            <li> It happened right after I changed my shampoo.</li>
            <li> Right now.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I never had the right technique, or my instinctual nature to squirt something out of a tube</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t recommend to do a mask right before going out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit of a hassle to make the mask right.</li>
            <li> My friend is a make-up artist and recommended me this product, so I jumped right into it.</li>
            <li> it came right on time.</li>
            <li> I uses it right away</li>
            <li> , when you put it on right , you do feel a tingle</li>
            <li> the price is right.</li>
            <li> Right now I am about to start my cycle</li>
            <li> right before I get my period</li>
            <li> Apply to your desired area right away.</li>
            <li> Put the product in the baggie agger water mix it up with the baggie over your hand inside out and rubbed the mask on your face after you covered your face turned the baggie right side out and put it in the trash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just tricky to get the right consistency.  </li>
            <li> so I purchased it right away....</li>
            <li> I also noticed that for me the areas around my mouth and nose are a little more sensitive, so practice makes perfect in determining how much to use and where your sensitive spots are.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have said to use an oil free moisturizer after, I&#x27;m not sure why it has to be oil free, but I listened to them and have been very happy with the results.eave</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have said to use an oil free moisturizer after, I&#x27;m not sure why it has to be oil free, but I listened to them and have been very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Quick, easy, and no mess.</li>
            <li> Great with raw Apple cinder vinegar.</li>
            <li> Okay, let&#x27;s get down to it: There are hundreds of rave reviews on this product, and like many other people reading through these, I thought it was too good to be true.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow - I don&#x27;t normally write reviews for things that often, but this stuff is honestly amazing.</li>
            <li> its pretty messy too but works great</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product -- the first time I used the mask I mixed with water</li>
            <li> My skin was tightening that I can barely move my facial muscles lol.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin, and I was fine.</li>
            <li> It really gives me a clean feeling after use.</li>
            <li> Was recommended this by a friend and feel that it really does clean out my pores.</li>
            <li> This really does clean your skin and pores well.</li>
            <li> I washed it off with warm water, patting first to soften the clay back up.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time last night and my face felt nice afterwards</li>
            <li> This makes a quick, effective facial and is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This mask really makes your face feel clean.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay, this is one of the best masks I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> and you apply it out of the package, but this Aztec clay is far more intense!</li>
            <li> really pulls out all the oil and dirt from your skin, leaving it squeaky clean; and also helps a lot with breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I have recently started to mix my clay with hot distilled water and apply the mask while it is still warm</li>
            <li> Mix with apple cider vinegar for an intense clean, or just water for something lighter....</li>
            <li> We have used this for spa, and first aide I love this product - and it is natural.</li>
            <li> What a great job it does for so little money!</li>
            <li> my skin has never felt this amazing and if you&#x27;ve gone through life wishing for beautiful skin you will understand why such a strong reaction to such a little thing.</li>
            <li> If you want to keep your plumbing clear and save on paper towels, put a medium to large bowl (like a large salad bowl) in your sink and fill it with warm water.</li>
            <li> Just as it says in the description, it is a very strong facial mask.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to be over zealous and end up with a lot left over.</li>
            <li> Just tried the clay mask for the first time and i really like it!!</li>
            <li> I cant wait to see what several more times of using this will do!:) Definitely buying again.</li>
            <li> so you can stir out the clumps and make a smooth paste the day of use.&lt;br /&gt;**A high quality paper towel over the drain to avoid clogging.&lt;br /&gt;***Add</li>
            <li> and when I did my face (pregnant and couldnt stomach the vinegar smell on myself), I used moroccan rose water the first time and pure aloe vera the second.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in a huge container and will last probably a full year!</li>
            <li> Anyway, I love this package, it just looks cool in a natural and classic sense.</li>
            <li> Once I rinsed out the mask, my curly, dry, chemically processed hair was softer, more manageable and cleaner than ever!  </li>
            <li> Afterward my skin feels dry, but I love that feeling because it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve never felt before!  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft, clean, and supple!</li>
            <li> new favorite is the Real Chemistry 3 Minute Peel.  </li>
            <li> I also use this on my face as I have very large pores.  </li>
            <li> I have very large pores and this shrinks them  every time.</li>
            <li> Great Company, hands down!!</li>
            <li> Leaves your face slightly damp and your pores open as an excellent prep for the mask.</li>
            <li> Since then I have repeated this procedure every 3 or 4 days and the results just keep getting better and better and my skin seems to be producing less oil.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with vinegar and the mixture was silky smooth and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently purchased super adorable backless shirts and tanks as a celebratory notion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works very well and is super fun to use.</li>
            <li> A gem, I still require a facial by a professional but this does a very good job at cleaning out the old layers of skin on my face.</li>
            <li> After you get the right consistency down, you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> (raw)and  it came across as a little on the runny side, but honestly after reapplying to my face, it applied fine.</li>
            <li> The single most important thing to do after using this clay is to moisturize.</li>
            <li> I was seriously surprised at how nice my skin looked, fresh and clear.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, I am blessed with good skin that makes me look like late 20s, but regardless I know that I am very close to showing signs of aging :).</li>
            <li> I usually get facials at the spa, but this is a great product for use between visits.  </li>
            <li> You really can feel your face pulsating, but it&#x27;s not painful.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in the top of it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, it is very useful and works wonders.&lt;br</li>
            <li> idk if that&#x27;s true but I will say it worked really well</li>
            <li> Went through all the reviews and found them very help full.</li>
            <li> It is very drying by design, so I recommend following it up with your favorite LIGHT nighttime moisturizer and going night-night.  </li>
            <li> On rare occasions, I hit Severe level 1 with a deep cyst or two, but haven&#x27;t experienced that recently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too fond on using commercial product on my face and like to keep it as natural as possible, so this has been perfect!</li>
            <li> i love clay in general.</li>
            <li> It is worth it for anyone willing to try it.</li>
            <li> I love this product and even though I have only tried it once, it was by far shown me more results in 1 day than any face wash or acne medicine I&#x27;ve ever used in weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s true, this stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li> It can be messy to take off but it makes my skin feel amazing!</li>
            <li> This product did not work as well for me as it apparently has for so many.</li>
            <li> If the pimple is small, then when the mask comes off it might not be noticeable at all, which is great.</li>
            <li> This is another gift I purchased for my sister, I myself have used it with great success, the only thing is it must be mixed with apple cider vinegar!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re interested.</li>
            <li> Get some, get messy, and get the most smooth, supple, blemish free skin you&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> I never get full rating but really this thing works</li>
            <li> If you want to prevent clogged drains (cus let&#x27;s face it, we are paying for mud), get a big bowl with warm water, wash most of it off, throw that water outside, and then finish washing the rest of your face in the sink.</li>
            <li> After I got out and put some face moisturizer on, my face felt SUPER clean and soft!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long to make, I mix mine with just warm water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie, it is pretty intense, but all worth it!</li>
            <li> but my skin was so soft and clean and it sucked the oil right out of my skin!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re like me and have super large pores that would like them to disappear before you leave the house, but don&#x27;t have the time for a full mask routine added to getting yourself ready for the world, then try this:</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re like me and have super large pores that would like them to disappear before you leave the house, but don&#x27;t have the time for a full mask routine added to getting yourself ready for the world, then try this:</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of practice to get the right amount and make the clay paste just right, but the results on the skin are really visible!</li>
            <li> I use this about every week to really get into my pores and clean them out and let me just say that this really works!</li>
            <li> It began to flake off after about 15 minutes and since it&#x27;s clay, I didn&#x27;t think it was a good idea to wash it down the drains</li>
            <li> It was a fine pore-cleansing mask that was light on the face, but I didn&#x27;t feel like it had rid me of zits or extra deep-cleaned anything.  </li>
            <li> This is such a fine powder, it goes on so smooth.  </li>
            <li> I wore an old tank top and hosed off 90% of the clay in the yard and used a large face cloth to help with removal .</li>
            <li> Apple cider vinegar makes the clay smooth and easy to apply (although it smells pretty gross).</li>
            <li> me begin by warning others that before you open the can that it is a VERY FINE POWDER.</li>
            <li> Irritated my skin a little bit but overall it&#x27;s an awesome product!</li>
            <li> I have realized that if you make the consistency a little bit thicker it does work better then if it is on the more liquidy side.</li>
            <li> My skin looked a little clearer after the first (successful) application.</li>
            <li> the way I been using it is I take 1 tablespoon and add about 1 tablespoon of  apple cider vinegar, and start mixing it, then I apply it around my face, if the mixing is still more watery add a little bit more of the clay and mix again...</li>
            <li> Great product, very messy, gets everywhere</li>
            <li> I did another mask the following night, but didn&#x27;t leave it on as long, and my skin is just getting better and better!  </li>
            <li> I havent used it a whole lot but its great because it doesn&#x27;t expire as fast as the other pre-made face masks do.</li>
            <li> Only used twice so far, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> However, I could see improved results right from the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> After using it for the first time, I can already see the difference, my skin is incredibly smooth and feels nice and tight.</li>
            <li> it just came right out and healed within a day, which is pretty freaking amaizng.</li>
            <li> If your smart then you research your skin/beauty products before purchasing them, look no furthur!</li>
            <li> The nicest thing is the large amount of clay you get for the price!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product and it&#x27;s fun to use with friends!</li>
            <li> I have good skin that occasionally gets congested and a bit bumpy, but isn&#x27;t overly sensitive or acne prone.  </li>
            <li> the container claims,  i do use the mask at night though just to allow me skin time to freak out before seeing anyone outside of my house, just in case but so far so good.</li>
            <li> It works great although I haven&#x27;t used it with vinegar, I used it with water and the consistency wasn&#x27;t thin and smooth but my face felt like it was being cleansed and getting tighter by the minute.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for a good, deep clean.</li>
            <li> It is natural and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> For now, just using it as a mask is giving me more than my money&#x27;s worth back in results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This clay is great if you need a deep cleansing mask that you only need to use once or twice a month.  </li>
            <li> This clay is great if you need a deep cleansing mask that you only need to use once or twice a month.  </li>
            <li> Kind of made my face itch in some places, super, super messy during removal</li>
            <li> Works great but made my skin super dry so intensive moisturizing is necessary.</li>
            <li> Price, natural, and easy to follow directions.</li>
            <li> The toner that I find most beneficial for my skin type is the Paula&#x27;s Choice Purely Natural Gentle Toner.</li>
            <li> Im not going to exaggerate this review and call it a black hole in your face, but it does a good job.</li>
            <li> Once it is completely dry and you feel like your lips and eyes are about to burst, go wash it off with warm water.</li>
            <li> I went to take the mask off and realized “um wow okay this stuff is really, really, really hardened on there”</li>
            <li> It feels good to the face when it&#x27;s starting to dry, and rinsing off was relatively easy...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even gotten my skin totally smooth and blemish free, but of course those pesky hormonal blemishes come back.</li>
            <li> Larger pores that I tend to have around my nose were also a great deal smaller.</li>
            <li> The blackheads came back quickly, so will need to use this more often, but was amazed that it pulled them all out the first try (after a hot shower).  </li>
            <li> It really does help maintain healthy clear looking skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m somewhere between mild and severe acne, and this mask really calms my skin.</li>
            <li> It does pull your face skin back, and being all natural, it is a good alternative to some chemical masks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find more natural, organic solutions since reading [[ASIN:1456613588 Age-Proof: Beauty Alternatives You Need to Know]], which I also highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for deep cleansing your pores especially used with Braggs Apple Cider Vinegar .</li>
            <li> I really liked this clay for a facial masks, It really did make a difference.</li>
            <li> sure to follow the instructions, don&#x27;t put too much product on your face and rinse off completely and thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and didn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive skin(my eczema).  </li>
            <li> once it;s finished my skin is super soft and it feels really clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few weeks before my wedding because my skin was just getting more and more out of control, and I felt like it made a difference.</li>
            <li> and I was able to get a nice, thick layer on.</li>
            <li> I think most of that pulsating action happens at the end when the mask is really drying up.&lt;br /&gt;After 20 minutes, my mask was still moist when I cleaned it off.</li>
            <li> Product is easy to mix, makes skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> , I am happy to report that the healing clay has FINALLY cleared my back!</li>
            <li> I would strongly suggest this product for those who want to remain naturally young looking.</li>
            <li> Overall a great simple product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is nice and light, its a sizable amount, and the clay has purported detoxifying properties (pulls heavy metals and pollutants).</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for my teen with acne issues, but it is something we have to do on a regular basis</li>
            <li> Never in my life have I experienced such a mind blowing mask, the effects are instant!</li>
            <li> Came super fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling acne for a few years now and this mask makes your skin nice and soft and smooth, and makes it look more evenly toned and what not afterwards; but this did absolutely nothing regarding my acne.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and really tightens to the point where it hurts to talk</li>
            <li> This indeed is the world&#x27;s most powerful facial.</li>
            <li> No wonder this is known as the world&#x27;s most powerful facial.</li>
            <li> Would you really wanna put chemicals on your face when you can use a natural clay that does an even better job?</li>
            <li> I had only bought it because it was 10 bucks lol who would of thought it actually improves acne</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re OK with a few more ingredients in your products</li>
            <li> I realized it was not red, no red bumps like some had experienced,</li>
            <li> This product was easy to use, and made my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t lie about world&#x27;s most powerful facial, I have acne problems and</li>
            <li> Also the delivery was quick and fast.</li>
            <li> The only reason for 4 stars is the price on Amazon--I happened to stop by a natural good store nearby 2 days ago and found it for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> Works quite well and leaves the skin feeling super clean and soft</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair clean and super soft.</li>
            <li> The first day was AMAZING, my curls were poppin, and they were stretched too.</li>
            <li> I live this!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great mask when I can get the consistency right, which isn&#x27;t hard.  </li>
            <li> and once you remove it with your face scrub or however, what is left is a very fresh and smooth feeling face.</li>
            <li> and when I wash it off my face feels nice, tight, and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge advocate of natural things!</li>
            <li> I think if you have oily skin this would be perfect, but for normal to sensitive skin might be too harsh and drying.</li>
            <li> Makes her skin smooth and soft with no flakies!</li>
            <li> When I was ready to remove the product I put a very hot cloth over my face to soften up the clay.</li>
            <li> Thanks very much!</li>
            <li> mixed with water for my first try and as others have posted it is messy, using a plastic sandwich bag to mix and apply is a very good idea!</li>
            <li> I went with a more whipped texture, like thick cool whip. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an unusual, though not unpleasant, feeling.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using a lint-free wash rag and warm water to remove the clay at the sink (or in the shower) as it feels much better than a normal rough washcloth.</li>
            <li> I like to use this prior to the weekend&#x27;s activities, or right before I go to an audition or shoot, to take years off and give my skin a healthy, glowing look.  </li>
            <li> Plain vinegar is more acidic, so yo would end up with a slightly more acidic mixture.</li>
            <li> This was good the first time I used because I used for less then 10 min.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an important step to keep your skin looking clean and fresh especially if you have big pores that collect a lot of gunk no matter how many times you wash your face, you need a deeper cleanse every once in a while.</li>
            <li> Eventually a nice, cool wash cloth takes it off really well and your face is tight and feels super clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin looked bright and tight.</li>
            <li> With regular use, fine lines and wrinkles...gone!  </li>
            <li> I do not recommend for older skin, but if you do moisturize, moisturize, moisturize!!</li>
            <li> Received this clay very fast from the seller.</li>
            <li> use it once every two weeks or so, just because it is very very strong.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I do not break out very much.</li>
            <li> but the didnt but my skn was very smooth and my pors appeared smaller.im going to use it again tomorrow and see at happens.ill write an updated one later.</li>
            <li> Like the fact that it is very fast on delivery.  </li>
            <li> Very, VERY lumpy when you mix it.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin very smooth instantly after using it.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> so this product is very reasonable...</li>
            <li> This mask is very very powerful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face was very smooth after only one use.</li>
            <li> The packaging was pretty funny to me, with claims about feeling your face move, the most powerful facial on earth, etc.</li>
            <li> very effective but be careful if your skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> My face was very smooth after only one use.</li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use very much.</li>
            <li> This is very intense stuff.</li>
            <li> and it was fine with my sensitive</li>
            <li> Not exactly the awesome product I expected.</li>
            <li> The powder is fine textured and has a soft mint-green/gray color.</li>
            <li> perhaps it&#x27;s good for skin, but it&#x27;s too hard to clean the clay on face</li>
            <li> after some use you can expect great results with clearer skin and nice even tone and even a few less wrinkles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 45 year old female, and for the first time in years, I can easily walk out the door without any makeup on, feeling totally confident.  </li>
            <li> the positive reviews are right.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with raw apple cider vinegar and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I mixed with raw cider vinegar and the consistency was perfect, no lumps.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it was a good product it can be a little bit of a pain to use compared to face masks already in a tube.</li>
            <li> It stings a little when you know it&#x27;s working, but it stings soo good.</li>
            <li> Wicked excited about my new skin journey.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin smooth and clean, I even notice my pores look smaller.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling clean and smooth and definitely treats acne.</li>
            <li> I leaves my skin feeling fresh, young, and clean.</li>
            <li> Way more effective that you think it will be, but a serious pain in the butt to mix up.</li>
            <li> make sure it&#x27;s one that you never really want to use again but that it&#x27;s clean, and add the powder in and some water.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face once a week for 20 mimutes and my skin feels fresh, young and clean.</li>
            <li> It pulls all the toxins out of your face leaving it fresh, clean and clear after a mask.</li>
            <li> Modern, clean, fast, and OMG</li>
            <li> Let it dry completely and jump in the shower and my skin is soooo smooth and soft after and my pores and blackheads are more and more diminished each time I use it.</li>
            <li> Make sure to super moisturize after as this can make your skin dry.</li>
            <li> I need to use more frequently to leave a decent review but kinda tricky when mixing it since comes in a powder form.  </li>
            <li> Your face will feel super dry afterwards so make sure to moisturize your face afterwards.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted - arrived very fast.  </li>
            <li> the hot water running for a little while for good measure.  </li>
            <li> It has to be great or it wouldn&#x27;t have such a large following.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re anything like me you will search high and low on reviews reading all about a product before you purchase it, let me just tell you, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> My pores are small and I&#x27;m 44 years old and my skin looks very good.</li>
            <li> I can say with absolute certainty that I&#x27;ll be back for more as soon as I am done with the first bottle !</li>
            <li> I love the smell, it is in a cute little bottle, and my skin feels ready to tackle the day after using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure most people who have acne, whether major or minor, can sympathize with the frustrations that come with it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and could keep it on my face for up to 30mins, really helped clean my face, helped with pulling up blackheads and dirt!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a more natural face mask that is not expensive, and detoxifying.</li>
            <li> I love how tight and strong it felt.</li>
            <li> well, after reading the amazing reviews of pulsating face , i quite got curious about</li>
            <li> Not to mention - this stuff really makes a difference!</li>
            <li> this mask is very cleansing!</li>
            <li> One warning however, it does tingle, pull, and then got pretty itchy.</li>
            <li> Also, I accidentally used metal the first time... woops.</li>
            <li> never felt that before pretty interesing.</li>
            <li> I really like what this does to my face!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this mask, it was unlike any mask I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Then I went back and added a thicker layer, just to make sure that the mixture got into my pores.  </li>
            <li> I already did my first treatment</li>
            <li> and I felt exactly what was posted;</li>
            <li> This is not my first time purchasing this product.  </li>
            <li> First time from this seller.  </li>
            <li> My scarring and hyperpigmentation have remained but I&#x27;m pretty sure that both will take time to improve and the scarring is likely permanent</li>
            <li> And you will wake up with more acne and redness in the next morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this as I use it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I ran hot water into the bowl and on the spoon for a while so it wouldn&#x27;t stick.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stress enough how much I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be the first to admit that the name doesn&#x27;t do the product justice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it some more time since I only use it once a week maybe twice.</li>
            <li> Now she only has scars but it better than having a faced that is inflamed with cystic acne.</li>
            <li> I have mostly oily skin, especially around my nose</li>
            <li> I use a warm wet washcloth to wash it off.</li>
            <li> also use ponds daily to make sure to keep moisturized.</li>
            <li> As a young adult and with my hormones constantly changing, I&#x27;ve experienced some breakouts which in turn have affected my self esteem and made me picky about the environments I go into.</li>
            <li> , I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I noticed that on the first two weeks using the mask, my skin was a bit aggravated.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am exremely pleased by this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this!</li>
            <li> who would have thought, something that works for such a cheap price!</li>
            <li> we tried it with the water first, when i receive the apple cider vinegar i will have to update this about the experience if its that drastic.</li>
            <li> the funny thing is my acne discoloration has even looked like it&#x27;s decreasing</li>
            <li> You will absolutely get one!</li>
            <li> out\\&quot; exactly, although they are dryer than before the mask.</li>
            <li> No one wants to have to break out the powder, vinegar, bowl, spatula and spend time mixing every time you want a mask!</li>
            <li> I just used a warm wet towel to soften the hardened clay and it came off</li>
            <li> This is exactly what&#x27;s written on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Mix with a wooden spoon, and immediately, you&#x27;ll see the magic working.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i decied to follow some of the reviews and took a bowl with some hot water and a cloth and cleansed everthing taking care not to over scrub it.</li>
            <li> At first i got scared</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this!</li>
            <li> :) But overall, I&#x27;m in love with this product and will definitely buy again when I run out!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re drains, had to higher a plumber</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference from the first use.  </li>
            <li> Worked the first time I used it</li>
            <li> Used this product for the first time this weekend</li>
            <li> it suggests to do and it worked really well!</li>
            <li> At the same time, I haven&#x27;t tried many mask type products.  </li>
            <li> I applied it twice a week for the first 2-3 weeks then went to weekly use and it cleared up my face and keeps it that way.  </li>
            <li> I made a batch with water first.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> This is my first review - I never write reviews</li>
            <li> you can feel that it works even for using it the first time.</li>
            <li> method that I use is first putting tea tree oil on my face, you can buy 100% oils.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product (with the Bragg Apple Cider Vinegar, I don&#x27;t know what the results are with water)!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff but man does it feel GROSS when it dries!</li>
            <li> I chose to use the apple cider vinegar because so many people stated that when they mixed it with water, it clumped up and wouldn&#x27;t mix well.  </li>
            <li> This product has never failed me.</li>
            <li> I steamed my face for 15 minutes, extracted as many blackheads as possible with a comedone extractor tool</li>
            <li> sure you either rinse your face outside or cover your drain with a towel or washcloth...</li>
            <li> when it&#x27;s all off make sure ur not doing anything for the next 30ish min cause your face will be like a tomato.</li>
            <li> I love this clay facial mask!!</li>
            <li> He really enjoyed this and his skin didn&#x27;t get red at all</li>
            <li> I was a skeptic at first</li>
            <li> I probably should have mixed it more thoroughly because it had clumps in it.</li>
            <li> Next time will wait 15 or 20 minutes instead and see if it works more.</li>
            <li> My face was red for about 10 minutes afterwards as most said it would be.</li>
            <li> I made sure to put lip balm on my lips and pull my hair back.  </li>
            <li> The first time out there was no discernable difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance.  </li>
            <li> drink it really fast!</li>
            <li> My goodness did my face heal fast!</li>
            <li> : I rarely review things, and I never upload photos, but I really want to show you how my face was and</li>
            <li> it only leaves your face oily, muddy and your pores more clogged than when it went on.</li>
            <li> My face didn&#x27;t turn red when I took the mask off by my face was smooth and glowing!  </li>
            <li> I really like this mask!</li>
            <li> Funny thing, as it was drying</li>
            <li> First time I used it I broke out on my forehead.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a noticeable freshness and smoothness after just the first use.</li>
            <li> Once the pimples have developed fully, I would recommend using a comedone extractor (can also be found on amazon--I got mine for $0.79 and free shipping) to extract them, and then swiping over with a toner of your choice (that&#x27;s when you use salicylic acid or BP--in the toner.)</li>
            <li> I spread it on my face with my fingers and then use an old paddle foundation brush to smooth it out and attempt to even out the coverage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that it works a lot better if you run a washcloth under hot water, wring it out, and press it to your face to open your pores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an OK mask, but definitely not a holy-grail product.</li>
            <li> The shipping and delivery was fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who is willing to take the time to mix &amp; apply it.</li>
            <li> Benzoyl peroxide, AHA, crappy products advertised by pretty teenagers who&#x27;ve been layered by makeup and Photoshop.</li>
            <li> Although I didnt have any apple cider vinegar, I figured id try it with water first.  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my first experience.</li>
            <li> exactly...</li>
            <li> BUT, this mask was actually pretty gentle!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my first time using it</li>
            <li> First, it does not dissolve well in water.</li>
            <li> I personally get the most out of my clay treatment</li>
            <li> first jar</li>
            <li> My acne is more moderate, but leaves scars.</li>
            <li> I got this for myself as a deep cleansing mask and love it for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> first time trying this I got some friends together.</li>
            <li> I havae used this for a facial mask for many years.  </li>
            <li> if you have larger pores or clogged pores you will be able to see the stuff that came out and is know on the mask when you peel it off.</li>
            <li> I first tried it with water</li>
            <li> First off, you WILL need vinegar to get this clay dissolved.</li>
            <li> Let me first start off by telling you my skin type.</li>
            <li> Next was the preparation, I have read plenty of reviews and many people said that it was time consuming.</li>
            <li> Get this stuff, it&#x27;s pretty badass.ppy with a product.</li>
            <li> Get this stuff, it&#x27;s pretty badass.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to treat my acne and this worked first use.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive but more on the normal side.</li>
            <li> The first night I used the clay (mixing it with Bragg brand apple cider vinegar)</li>
            <li> Now my son wants me to put it on his face too!.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does help!</li>
            <li> but it just isn&#x27;t exactly what I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li> This mask worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> and it was a med coating not too light and not heavy...</li>
            <li> Just tell me how much to use!</li>
            <li> I think I made it too liquid-y on the first go-round.</li>
            <li> This was my first try at a mask  </li>
            <li> It’s intense for a first-timer!</li>
            <li> Haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it again the next night because I was eager to try again and play around with it some more.</li>
            <li> Haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it again the next night because I was eager to try again and play around with it some more.</li>
            <li> I really can’t wait to see what using this stuff for 3 weeks will do!</li>
            <li> I just used a warm, wet washcloth for the removal.  </li>
            <li> Next time I will keep it on for 30min to see if I get even better results.</li>
            <li> The real deal !</li>
            <li> I also used a skin strip on my nose after using the mask and I was able to get out more blackheads than usual with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE TRY WASHING MY HAIR IN HOT AND ROOM TEMPERATURE WATER</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> The first two uses</li>
            <li> Really recommend!</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can really feel the pulsate!</li>
            <li> Very generous amount for the money will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> This product turned out to be my favorite facial mask at all times.</li>
            <li> Having been concerned when my product first came, I researched this.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;m not seeing any results</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it did much at first</li>
            <li> This really does make your face tingle!</li>
            <li> and it did!&lt;br /&gt;I made sure I used equal parts clay powder and apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> I could really feel this stuff getting into my pores!</li>
            <li> When I first found out about this product, I did a mask twice in one week during the summer time and my oily summer face started</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product first since I didn&#x27;t have the time or money to spend at a spa.  </li>
            <li> It has never failed.</li>
            <li> I even tried boiling the water first to see if that helped</li>
            <li> I came across this and was immediately interested.</li>
            <li> I will definitely make the most out of this purchase.</li>
            <li> Since this is the first time I was using a pack on my face</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin baby soft and extremely smooth.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t feel much, so was surprised to see such good results.  </li>
            <li> I, sadly am not one of them.</li>
            <li> When I first started using it after a while my face started to react.</li>
            <li> Made that mistake the first time,  </li>
            <li> But it scared me the first time i used it.  </li>
            <li> Just like most deep pore cleansers I use..</li>
            <li> Now, I have skipped my $50 facial appointment this week because this product works so much better.  </li>
            <li> I noticed the areas where I applied thinner mask, were the most red.</li>
            <li> I rinsed in the sink once everything was off to make sure no residue was left (another step people miss, causing breakouts).</li>
            <li> I rinsed in the sink once everything was off to make sure no residue was left (another step people miss, causing breakouts).</li>
            <li> but I get blackheads on my nose and forehead, and when I do get zits they last awhile and are in pretty prominent areas.</li>
            <li> I woke up the next morning and my face had more bumps then what I started with.</li>
            <li> I have even mixed it with milk as I feel it is has more benefit than water does for my skin</li>
            <li> I got this for both daughter &amp; daughter-in-law - they used it and compared it to much higher priced face masks.  </li>
            <li> if doesn&#x27;t give exact measurements for mixing.</li>
            <li> Applied first application, did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> First use:</li>
            <li> For all first time users.</li>
            <li> my first time hence the 3 stars.</li>
            <li> By week 3-4 you should really notice a difference!  </li>
            <li> then the softest and smoothest skin possible, love it.......</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> I am going to do this again today, and see if more white heads will come out to the surface of the skin.</li>
            <li> The raving reviews are what caused me to buy this product in the first place.</li>
            <li> I have struggled pretty much all my life with blackheads on my t-zone and chin and this clay mask has reduced it on my cheeks and nose!</li>
            <li> It worked even better, the tiny break out blemishes I sometimes get minimized.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I definitely feel that my pores are cleaner and my face can breathe better.</li>
            <li> and they are a lot better than big ones.</li>
            <li> &quot; the acne in the first place.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t work wonders on the first try.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I steam my skin first</li>
            <li> I was only able to leave it for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Your skin really does pulsate!</li>
            <li> My skin is glowing and feels better then it has after any facial!!</li>
            <li> I love this clay I use it for facial and my feet,  this clay make my feet like I have baby feet again.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> Further experimentation with the addition of honey, olive oil, lemon juice and/or tea tree oil made it even better.</li>
            <li> At first it didn&#x27;t feel curly ( while washing )</li>
            <li> This is such a refreshing clay.</li>
            <li> , the first 5 mins after I get it off I feel that my face is irritated.</li>
            <li> I decided I would try a face mask that will help bring my face back to life and this one for sure</li>
            <li> My face was soft, smooth, and looking basically</li>
            <li> Not only did it tighten my skin, but rid many, almost all of my blackheads.</li>
            <li> Spritz your face with a gentle toner to replace your acid mantle, it will calm and quench your skin.  </li>
            <li> It did make my face hot after 10 minutes but that part didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> It may take me a year to use this whole container!  </li>
            <li> I like to wash my face first and then apply before I take a shower</li>
            <li> I used water the first time and it didn&#x27;t work as well as it did with the ACV.</li>
            <li> I had acne problem and tried many different products but none seem to work cuz the acne doesn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> after trying this indian clay, the red bumps seem to get much better</li>
            <li> I bought this based on stellar reviews and it worked pretty well for a while.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Got rid of all the blackheads on my nose on first use.</li>
            <li> I just tried this mask for the first time.</li>
            <li> smaller!I will cleanse first then use a toner</li>
            <li> First time user....</li>
            <li> Great  product long lasting</li>
            <li> First of all it doesn&#x27;t have a smell.</li>
            <li> Really improved skin w/ repeated use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything known to man on my face to rid the pimples and nothing has worked consistently.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and decided to use it for the first time this weekend.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give exact answers solely because I just started using it, but by reading the reviews I believe it is what people say it is.</li>
            <li> It is tingly but not uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I told my husband about it and somehow convinced him into doing the first application with me.</li>
            <li> but it also looks pretty clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just added it to the clay exactly as in the directions.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It dries your skin out so have moisturizer ready!</li>
            <li> First off, this is going to take some time.</li>
            <li> better than anything topical you can try.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it will do, though.</li>
            <li> I also used it as a facial and was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Then I take a paper towel &amp; run it under hot water (I like my water hot) &amp; then just rub it off my face.</li>
            <li> I tried that at first</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with adult acne and this product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> When I use it consistently I have noticed a change in the appearance of my pores.</li>
            <li> Very spa-like!</li>
            <li> First, I use water, not vinegar.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using both products for quite some time now, and my skin glows, is soft, line free (thank you Bel Essence), and the clay also helps to minimize pores so my skin is smoother looking.  </li>

            <li> It brought all of my impurities out to the top of my skin (which I am still treating with Epiduo, which I received after the clay from the dr) and left the rest of my face feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> It did leave my cheekbones a bit red, but I&#x27;m sure that was my fault for applying it on a non-acne area.</li>
            <li> Get into a hot shower and let the water an steam soften it up..</li>
            <li> but this stuff really deserves all the 5 star ratings!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been interested in trying [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I just used this for the first time tonight, but I can already see a noticeable difference in the reduction of my pores and smoothness of my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When most of the clay was off, then I reverted back to the washcloth method.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this mask for the past 3 days in a row and it has incredibly helped clear up my face.  </li>
            <li> The mask feels good for the first few minutes, the problem arises as soon as it starts hardening.</li>
            <li> I used this product with vinegar and water, but works better with water only.</li>
            <li> It seems to help give me back my \\&quot;youthful glow\\&quot; and I use it whenever I want my face to look more refreshed (keep in mind though</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m sure that was my imagination), as the days went on (we only plan on using it once a week)</li>
            <li> But besides that it works really well!</li>
            <li> I have used Proactiv, Acne Free, Natures Miracle wash and natural pills, Neutrogena and anything else</li>
            <li> I used this mask and started noticing results within the first 2 uses.  </li>
            <li> I shower at night and don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, so for the first couple weeks I used the mask on nights I didn&#x27;t wash my hair.</li>
            <li> but I really felt the need to do one for this!</li>
            <li> I use this twice a week, wash daily with an acne wash, tone with a rose water witch-hazel toner daily and moisturize with an oil free</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time today.</li>
            <li> oops, too much water!</li>
            <li> Oops, too much powder!  </li>
            <li> Pulls at your skin, but helps my skin to look so much clearer!</li>
            <li> You can mix essential oils, rose water, and activated charcoal with the Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay to make a great anti-acne mask.</li>
            <li> just make sure everything is well mixed otherwise you&#x27;ll have watery parts and clumpy parts.</li>
            <li> The proof is evident after the 1st use.</li>
            <li> I used this first on my son, who is acne prone, and then on my self.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with pretty severe acne since being a teenager.</li>
            <li> so you definitely get more bang for your buck with this product.</li>
            <li> when i first received the product, i used it once a day for a week.</li>
            <li> after the first week, i used it once a week.&lt;br /&gt;it has been about a month or two since my purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;the product doesn&#x27;t make my face &amp;#34;pulsate&amp;#34; and it doesn&#x27;t make my face red after removal, as many others have mentioned it doing.</li>
            <li> I lOve this facial clay!</li>
            <li> we first started this routine, we did it twice a week.  </li>
            <li> Amazing stuff, Because of health reason I take testosterone everyday, the result of this gave me a chest full of acne and shoulders sore with acne.</li>
            <li> MY SKIN WAS LEFT WITH A GLOW, AND MY ACNE IS A BIT VISIBLE , WHICH I LOVE.</li>
            <li> THANKS !</li>
            <li> it is much better than your regular vinegar (you could still use any brand vinegar</li>
            <li> The blades bent on my on the first time I tried an onion.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was having an allergic reaction the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> It tightened, cleaned, smoothed, and purified my face so much my face was glowing!</li>
            <li> Seemed okay until I opened it to use a second time and it was MOLDY.</li>
            <li> It was pretty amazing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;ll be pleased with results, especially with consistent use.  </li>
            <li> when i first got it i used it every 2 days for 6 days until my acnee was gone.</li>
            <li> when using it on him it worked in first try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely tempted to use it more than the two times a week it recommends because it feels that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should start by saying I am a pretty even-skinned person to begin with.</li>
            <li> I am an avid mask user, tried all kinds.</li>
            <li> My first use was a clay treatment for my transitioning hair.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been consistent as I should be.</li>
            <li> First off, I haven&#x27;t given myself a mask treatment since I was a teenager</li>
            <li> You can not go wrong with a wonderful price like this one!</li>
            <li> I see a lot of hyperbolic claims about this stuff&#x27;s miraculous properties, with none explaining exactly how rubbing glop on your face is supposed to kill the bacteria that causes cystic acne or whatever.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li> It had made my acne go away for the most part, make my scars fade, and makes my loves appear a lot smaller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped me tremendously with my oil production which was the main reason why o&lt;br</li>
            <li> the jar is still full, including what I wasted on making deodorant (though my mom still loves and uses that deodorant and even bought some of her own just for that).</li>
            <li> cause I never tried anything like it before and the first week or two</li>
            <li> i was told the first week</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it stands for.  </li>
            <li> Really, really liking this product!  </li>
            <li> I risked it and gave it a try wondering if it would cause more breakouts, but it has only improved my skin and become part of my regimen.</li>
            <li> The overall results are a lot more pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I searched acne on amazon and this came out first.</li>
            <li> It really does pulse!</li>
            <li> This will make more than enough clay mixture for your face.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference the first time i used it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say it&#x27;s great for cleaning pores</li>
            <li> It pulls out my blackheads and my face is soft and smooth after.</li>
            <li> used with apple cider vinegar in a baggie and it was pretty clumpy but it was my first time mixing it.</li>
            <li> Mixing can be tricky, I measure out the powder first and set it aside.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to everyone!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it to use apple cider vinegar as well as water, because the vinegar really amps up the effectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li> Ok, so back to sephora.</li>
            <li> I tried more stuff like Dennis Gross peel pads and Peter Thomas Roth pads.</li>
            <li> Let me just warn you, the first week you will breakout.</li>
            <li> Let me just warn you, the first week you will breakout.</li>
            <li> I read that you have to use this a couple times the first month</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This clay is working pretty well.</li>
            <li> Really leaves skin feeling cleansed and refreshed!</li>
            <li> It &#x27;sucked&#x27; out so many toxins, I looked years younger.</li>
            <li> Use it as hot as you can stand.  </li>
            <li> but u can feel it working and tell a difference after first use</li>
            <li> But even if not, who cares, this is the first product I&#x27;ve found that does that.  </li>
            <li> I use it with a combination of water and organic cider vinegar (it makes a cool fuzzy sound when mixed).</li>
            <li> Pretty neat concept.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it regularly now for lack of time, but when I start getting breakouts again, I&#x27;ll use it for about a week and it works like magic.</li>
            <li> I am someone with pretty yucky skin.  </li>
            <li> sometimes i even leave it for more that 20 mins and it doesnt leave my face red at all.</li>
            <li> I will most definitely use more in the future.</li>
            <li> I use organic apple cider with it, and although at first the vinger smell is a lil,</li>
            <li> My face was oh so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a whole lot of product for your face!  </li>
            <li> I first tried with water it did not came out well</li>
            <li> I just used this product for the first time</li>
            <li> This works exactly as they say.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty neat</li>
            <li> When I first received this product, I used it 4 days in a row.</li>
            <li> So I put on several more coat of vitamin C serum</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first product I&#x27;ve tried in ages that actually gets makes the SFs (sebaceous filaments) on my nose look better.</li>
            <li> I love this facial clay.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would repurchase, as I have already ordered more after the second use.</li>
            <li> I wish I had ran into this product earlier, I love it.  </li>
            <li> I think you have to use more than once a week to see big results.</li>
            <li> But from my experience, this clay does exactly what it&#x27;s described to do.</li>
            <li> Still, the benzoil-peroxide routine not only works (if you stick to it) it works for most people according to doctors.</li>
            <li> (the act of it drying is what cleans but also kills those top skins cells with dryness and makes people believe its actually shrinking pores).</li>
            <li> (the act of it drying is what cleans but also kills those top skins cells with dryness and makes people believe its actually shrinking pores).</li>
            <li> I first tried it on my arms and chest to test it.</li>
            <li> The first 3 reasons are superficial, meaning they can be felt &amp; seen by others than just myself:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t psoriasis, but it was pretty close.  </li>
            <li> I noticed it on the first try,  but now after a month or so of using it twice weekly,  friends have noticed it as well.</li>
            <li> my skin feels great after using this product but&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure this really cleanses my pore or not.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;m using it</li>
            <li> This time, I used regular vinegar and it was a million times better.</li>
            <li> The first couple times I used it</li>
            <li> Then I take a wash cloth into the shower with me to wash it off, works better than simply rinsing over the sink.</li>
            <li> what can I say I love how it pulls my pores and the very next day</li>
            <li> From the first day I applied it</li>
            <li> The first week I used this, my skin went through a purge.</li>
            <li> exactly in the borders of the mask.</li>
            <li> Dramatically improved my acne, made my skin feel silkier, and I saw results after the first use.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft and break out free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many different ones and heard about this one one reddit /skincareaddiction</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had it for 3-4 months and used it twice the first month.</li>
            <li> this really cleans your skin!</li>
            <li> I tried that the first time and it fell off in pieces.  </li>
            <li> Gentle, but does contain bentonite as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Get hot wash cloth and wipe off.  </li>
            <li> I read a lot of the reviews along with the description of the product and was specifically interested in what it could do about that.</li>
            <li> I first got it, I tried it out on my face, neck and chest.</li>
            <li> you get so much for your money!</li>
            <li> and thats what this product does when you use it consistently.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, I used 1.5 teaspoons and slathered it all over my face</li>
            <li> I just know my face is clearer in a week and feels overall better.</li>
            <li> It did remove most of my scars but every time I use it, I only leave it on my skin for a while.</li>
            <li> The first time my face had some redness-</li>
            <li> Used it 3 times in the first week.</li>
            <li> my face has improved drastically and I can just imagine how it will look like in 2 months ;)</li>
            <li> my face has improved drastically and I can just imagine how it will look like in 2 months ;)</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li> It will shrink your pores permanently if you use it consistently.  </li>
            <li> key to healthy skin is consistency in your regime.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels really smooth and soft after using.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get a real sense of how well this works before writing a review: the wait was well worth</li>
            <li> The first time this happened to me</li>
            <li> The first time this happened to me</li>
            <li> You can literally see and feel results within the first couple uses.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and it&#x27;s quite fun to see how my face changes (esp eyes and lips) as this dries hahaha</li>
            <li> First of all I have been using this product for about two years</li>
            <li> And this was the first product to come up.</li>
            <li> Within two days of the first use I noticed my skin clearing up.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of most of the Burts Bees products</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend and it&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
            <li> My skin does get red if i keep teh mask on for more than 20 min, but it cleans so well.</li>
            <li> A better way to benefit from its properties is to take a a capsule, break it open and add 1/2 to 1 capsule of charcoal into the mask.  </li>

            <li> bentonite is what this is made of, harmful in the powder from especially and when adding liquid even more harmful.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t feel your face pulsate at first, but as it dries, it gets stronger.</li>
            <li> I can even say that this is my favorite deep pore cleasing mask.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am willing to give it a try one more time and will update my review if I see different results.</li>
            <li> Hopefully I have better luck next time.</li>
            <li> My skin was smoother softer and almost completely acne free.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, this is the top rated Amazon facial cleanser for a reason ... try it.</li>
            <li> I mix it with coffee &amp; milk when out of apple cider, store in a ziplock in the flidge and heat up under hot water before applying.</li>
            <li> The bowl catches the debris and you can just toss the used water outside. :)</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I know some people expect immediate results, but it&#x27;s best not have these expectations, as it&#x27;s unrealistic.</li>
            <li> Within the first application I noticed that it either pulled the pus out of the cysts or brought them to the surface.</li>
            <li> works better when mixed with ACV(apple cider vingear)</li>
            <li> Some people love it, I don&#x27;t necessarily like it but</li>
            <li> at least I know that when my face starts to do that, something great has happened.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will be buying more of this product in the future.</li>
            <li> will update &#x27;cause it was my first time using, so</li>
            <li> Once it dries I put a hot towel over my face for a minute to soften the mask and it comes off easier.</li>
            <li> We both left it on for 30 minutes without any notable effects afterward.</li>
            <li> The pimples I had been depressed over were much smaller and some were completely smooth!  </li>
            <li> and I am sure it will last me a while.</li>
            <li> I could still feel the pulling and it felt hot even after cleaning it off.</li>
            <li> Buy it and have it shipped expedited to you because this stuff with change your life ;)</li>
            <li> Love this item for regular masking!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not something I use every night just because it&#x27;s pretty time-consuming but when I have the time and when I feel my skin needs it</li>
            <li> The first time I used it was before I went to sleep.</li>
            <li> This really does work!</li>
            <li> After my first use, I noticed the effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I think it&#x27;s safe to use daily if you&#x27;d like to.</li>
            <li> Though the instructions recommend equal parts ACV to clay, i prefere to add some more moisture to make it easier to spread.</li>
            <li> and I actually feel more awaken almost like i drank a cup of coffee.</li>
            <li> I did my first mask today.  </li>
            <li> The funny part about this mask to me is the drying process.  </li>
            <li> Created a DIY mask recipe from Pinterest with one application I’ve had at least five strangers tell me how great my skin looks ands</li>
            <li> this stuff litterally pulled the stuff out of my pores the first time i used it.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well without drying my skin out</li>
            <li> Sealed only by a sticker on the top.</li>
            <li> Just used this for the first time tonight.  </li>
            <li> Then I would take a washcloth with water as hot as I could stand and lay it over my face in the tub to soften the clay up before I scrubbed it off.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;pulsating\\&quot; is a definite hyperbole, as is most advertising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> first use</li>
            <li> Make sure you have enough water to powder ratio.&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li> So if you do try it on your forehead first.</li>
            <li> So I think I actually like the Redmond Clay better, but I ran out of my tube of it, and had this still kicking around.</li>
            <li> It definitely works better when you use the apple cider vinegar, it&#x27;s WAY smoother that way.</li>
            <li> First time I used it with just water it my hand</li>
            <li> The only advice that i have is to mix it with apple cider vinergar instead of water because the mixture would have a better consistency thus easier to put it on your face.</li>
            <li> It really does tingle!</li>
            <li> And my face fells so much smoother and refreshed afterwards!</li>
            <li> therefore it tricks your face into believing it has enough oil and won&#x27;t keep overproducing and ending up with more acne .</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> It has minimized the appearance of pores from the first use.</li>
            <li> And only for $5, so I&#x27;m kinda glad I didn&#x27;t get it here</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li> rinse with a warm wet washcloth at the kitchen sink (with a garbage disposal</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference with in the first use.</li>
            <li> I used retin A for many years without a problem, but when I switched medical plans to an HMO the dermatologist didn&#x27;t want to prescribe retin A for me.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>

            <li> Been using it for a month now and my face feels smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Really a must face product!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found it, and I can&#x27;t wait to go back to my esthetician and show her my results.</li>
            <li> That is If i even need her to do a facial! :).</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found it, and I can&#x27;t wait to go back to my esthetician and show her my results.</li>
            <li> That is If i even need her to do a facial! :)</li>
            <li> I used water with it the first time I used it</li>
            <li> First application, didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li> I am aware that this isn&#x27;t the products fault</li>
            <li> I tell you, it&#x27;s clearing them up so much!</li>
            <li> I saw the difference immediately after removing it, I had a lot of white heads and most of them where gone.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time and and it itches and burns while its on my face.</li>
            <li> all at the same time :) I had a 20 minute timer and kept it on for the fully 20 and rinsed off.</li>
            <li> It has only given me more acne.</li>
            <li> Love this deep cleanser.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it on my face</li>
            <li> tiny bit goes a long way, so it is also a great bargain.  </li>
            <li> Tried two more times and ended up with the same results.</li>
            <li> you wont get any more breakouts if you use this regularly (for me 1-2 times a week does the trick)&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> You could use a cleanser before applying the mask to get impurities off your face first if you choose.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I have a coupon code for this site if you want order the first time:</li>
            <li> After the first use, I noticed a difference in the pores &amp; texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li> It worked really well!</li>
            <li> Your face will be a nice shade of red everywhere that the mask was applied, but don&#x27;t worry, that&#x27;s normal and it fades.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t do it before a first date</li>
            <li> Even w/ my first time using it.</li>
            <li> Next time I will let sit longer for better results.</li>
            <li> Bentonite clay works better on clearing my skin than any facial ever had.</li>
            <li> definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Its not uncomfortable though so don&#x27;t be scared.</li>
            <li> After the first time using it, i was sold.  </li>
            <li> First I tried the plastic baggy, and putting some clay in</li>
            <li> You can pay a lot of money for a facial or do one yourself with this clay, and have fantastic results!</li>
            <li> Have only used it a couple times but love the results on my face</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and made my face feel so soft after applying.</li>
            <li> I managed to freak out my husband :)) It only burns your skin a bit after you remove it</li>
            <li> and it really keeps the pimples away!</li>
            <li> But my face was extremely soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Although my skin feels soft and smooth after using it, I have not noticed any improvements with regard to my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The next day I woke up and my cystic acne felt so much better.</li>
            <li> - so don&#x27;t watch anything funny while you have this on.</li>
            <li> Once the mask is removed, my face feels so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> so do say, more like mearly red dots on my face  like if it was turning into a pimple</li>
            <li> I just used this clay for the first time</li>
            <li> I saw a difference in my skin after the first use.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t be alarmed when using for the first time.</li>
            <li> not uncomfortably so...</li>
            <li> Many uses and will last forever</li>
            <li> Even after the first use of this clay, my skin is visibly smoother, clearer, and glowing.</li>
            <li> At this point I can only blink :)</li>
            <li> At first I used it with the vinegar</li>
            <li> Maybe you just have to be consistent with it for a couple months??</li>
            <li> The next morning I woke up and my skin was more evenly toned, supple and</li>
            <li> Also, it is real mud, and will clog up your drain!</li>
            <li> Personally feel more when I mix it with water</li>
            <li> It sees t work much better when mixed with the apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s just the first</li>
            <li> it shut an mixed it around with my hands, then I apllied it to my face just wiping the Baggie on my face without touching the clay.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Enjoy your dirt ;)</li>
            <li> and my skin is near blemish free.</li>
            <li> The container last a long time, great deal for your money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Affordable&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin smooth and soft</li>
            <li> But it works very well!</li>
            <li> Pretty neat.</li>
            <li> After that, my skin was so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Feels like a real mask!</li>
            <li> I noticed my acne lessening after the first use.</li>
            <li> There is so much product in this jar!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is by far the cheapest and most effective skin treatment I have ever used (and I have tried quite a few).</li>
            <li> Well, sure enough, after letting it sit on the bite for about 15-20 minutes, I washed it off and noticed an immediate difference.</li>
            <li> a layer to cover the face is more than enough.</li>
            <li> What more could you ask for in a facial mask?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time and I was amazed at how well it clarified my hair.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it when he&#x27;d had it awhile</li>
            <li> First of all, the blackheads on my nose and between my brows are gone.</li>
            <li> It mixed well with the apple cider vinegar and made more than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> I just received mine today and the product looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> My face is really clearing up!</li>
            <li> The longer you leave it on, the drier it gets and the more red</li>
            <li> I will be ordering this again;)</li>
            <li> but my pores were the same but one thing for sure</li>
            <li> She kept this product on hand because it was able to actually draw the stinger out of the skin.</li>
            <li> It worked way better than pore strips and definitely helped a ton with my acne.</li>
            <li> my pores have substantially shrunk and my makeup applications look even better than before and last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> Its not expensive</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several months and am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I will totally get some more - have shared it with my grown kids too</li>
            <li> you can feel a difference from the first use.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly what it said it would be.  </li>
            <li> First time I used this boy was</li>
            <li> ...use exactly as directed.  </li>
            <li> Only part I dislike is not being able to just rinse my face off in the sink.</li>
            <li> I have given this away to so many people and constantly have people borrowing it.</li>
            <li> It works so much better than regular powder and heals irritations incredibly fast!</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> First application of this clay was horrendous.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what happened, I mixed it with water and wiped it on</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this stuff and wish i wouldve found it sooner, i personally use it once a week.</li>
            <li> after the first use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on and off (mostly off) for the last 12 years.</li>
            <li> I tried plastic silverware at first, then a plastic baggy, but still have tons of chunks and they fall off all over.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it...</li>
            <li> but I just need to be consistent with it by applying it 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> This stuff is deffinately intense!</li>
            <li> But I do also want to note that I take daily vitamins, birth control, maintain a healthy diet, and workout (but even before using this clay mask I&#x27;ve maintained this lifestyle).</li>
            <li> it works for you as much as it has helped me!</li>
            <li> First time &amp;#34;Clay-er&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Having used many, MANY, masks in the past, I wasn&#x27;t expecting immediate results.</li>
            <li> I love doing my facial masks with this clay!</li>
            <li> My husband came home and the first words was what did u do to your face?</li>
            <li> Overall, it cant get any better for the price.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used 4 times, the first 3 times made me break out (the purge), and the 4th time my skin is GLOWING.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna have to buy a larger one because I am gonna share with my two sisters and mom :)</li>
            <li> The reviews I read some were concerned about plugging drain pipe from mask,  no worries there just run hot water when you are out of shower.</li>
            <li> i have put the mask first day, noticed a change.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says on the container.</li>
            <li> because you really get your moneys worth, I feel it working on my face, its smoother now</li>
            <li> but once I rinsed it off my face felt smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> The product is inexspensive and the reviews are stellar.</li>
            <li> I used Aztec for the first time over the weekend and it felt like a spa day for my hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and the next day my face looked remarkably better already, used it twice</li>
            <li> When II first used it I didnt have any</li>
            <li> after first application could see a difference.</li>
            <li> My skin has smoothened out and simply looks better in tone and hydration.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s only slightly better than my proactiv face mask.</li>
            <li> This clay mask is quite funny to use.</li>
            <li> I also exfoliated my face first before using this mask.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, this is a cheap &amp; natural mask that seems to help.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the actual feeling of the tingle as it cleaned my pores and the feeling of it hardening on my face.</li>
            <li> I did break out after the first couple of uses...</li>
            <li> however, be aware when opening that it may go everywhere</li>
            <li> do want to say that I find the more regular I use the product,</li>
            <li> I used to think the longer I left the product on, the better.  </li>
            <li> Love this I see a big improvement on my face</li>
            <li> Thanks in advance!</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> skin feels soft and smooth after.</li>
            <li> I will say this tightened just a bit more though and made my caramel colored skin red for about 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the first time and air got inside the container.  </li>
            <li> but this product has definitely made my face look better.</li>
            <li> the first couple times  </li>
            <li> first then i apply the mask.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, my acne prone skin is clear and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Really cleans out your pores!</li>
            <li> Skin feels smooth and soft after.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> This stuff makes me feel pretty.</li>
            <li> And yes you will break out after the first use, it is drawing everything up and out.</li>
            <li> So far I have been acne free for one month and that has not happened in over 3 years.  </li>
            <li> so I got my biotin first and started to get acne</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t have exact measurements of water)</li>
            <li> I do not care for this clay, I have a better one I ordered around the same time.</li>
            <li> most acne is internal it could be hormonal, bacterial, digestive system out of whack, liver being overworked ect.</li>
            <li> and I have faith that it will only get better.</li>
            <li> And it does exactly that.</li>
            <li> I have use all manner of expensive skin care, and the quality of this product is great!</li>
            <li> its better than a facial!!</li>
            <li> pro&lt;br /&gt;-works great&lt;br /&gt;-product not expensive</li>
            <li> This is my first review after using amazon for years.</li>
            <li> I read several reviews before purchasing this and listened to many recommendations.</li>
            <li> First whoever said use of baggie to mix and apply this was a genius.</li>
            <li> Soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I combined the clay with organic apple cider vinegar, and found that it was a bit too strong-smelling for me.</li>
            <li> but maybe I have to use it more regularly.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this facial.</li>
            <li> The boyfriend uses it too to get rid of blackheads, and his skin is soft and smooth after he uses it.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li> Need more actually...</li>
            <li> Just did my first treatment--really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> But when I first tried it on my sister</li>
            <li> This stuff really does do the job in cleaning your pores!</li>
            <li> From youtube and pint rest tutorials I was able to use this product with multiple uses.</li>
            <li> I use it about 3x/week and it has really made a difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> I saw results after my first use.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have severe acne in the first place,</li>
            <li> This is my first time i am using any clay packs and also my first time that I am tempted to put on my face pack every 4-5 days...</li>
            <li> I come back to the clay and add some more water and make a paste out of it.</li>
            <li> The first day it almost immediately reduced the redness on my face, bumps and pimples.</li>
            <li> Now, Tuesday the 13th, 8 days after using it, My face has gotten a lot better.</li>
            <li> would Recommend at first, to leave it for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Be aware thus stuff will peel your face off.        </li>
            <li> My skin actually has a healthy look now.</li>
            <li> I tried to mix it with water first</li>
            <li> Just used this for the first time.</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> i felt a difference in my skin after the first use.</li>
            <li> i have moderate acne, sometimes cystic, with lets say, alot but not TERRIBLE acne marks</li>
            <li> and the one pounder is More then enough for one person.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and works like it says!</li>
            <li> this is the first product I&#x27;ve found to trully unclog pores.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve written althought</li>
            <li> Once I took it off (I used warm wet paper towels) and put on moisturizer</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected, durable packaging, safety seal (nice bonus).</li>
            <li> : I love this product enough to write a review about it--</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li> me first explain to you how I use this product:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> Today I first tried this clay.</li>
            <li> so I was interested to see results with this product.</li>
            <li> I just received my mask today and tried it for the first time.</li>
            <li> (nothing moisturizer can&#x27;t help), but it&#x27;s also insanely soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> At first, I freaked out.</li>
            <li> seems good for a monthly treatment but a weekly treatment would be too harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> A good brush or exfoliating sponge will remove ALL dead skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years on my face, neck &amp; hands &amp; I&#x27;ve always loved the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usin Olay hidratating cream also, because it&#x27;s always good to use everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking of buying this as a Christmas gift for a few people who appreciate good skin care products.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been applying this everyday and used witch hazel after which is good for oily skin..</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been applying this everyday and used witch hazel after which is good for oily skin..</li>
            <li> The mask dried, and I could feel it pulling at my face which is a good sign.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping with a few more uses it will leave my skin nice a clear.</li>
            <li> I nice muddy consistency that is fun to spread everywhere and watch turn into a dark earthy color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I nice muddy consistency that is fun to spread everywhere and watch turn into a dark earthy color.    </li>
            <li> Good product but too messy to use often.</li>
            <li> So the few blackheads were a good sign.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I have never had clear skin, not terribly bad, but never COMPLETELY clear.&lt;br</li>
            <li> got the recipe from an online blog for making healthy toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t have chemicals and such, so we&#x27;re using it now and so far so good, although can&#x27;t comment as to the long term benefit yet.</li>
            <li> I dumped equal parts into the little chopper/mixer and it made a nice smooth cream that was easy to change in thickness by adding fluid.&lt;br /&gt;--Use</li>
            <li> I used warm water and swished my hand in the sink to make sure it was all more or less dissolved, then ran the tap a little longer to ensure no clay chunks were latching themselves in my s-pipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and this stuff helps clean out the pores and leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I remove the mask is by wetting a wash cloth with very warm water, and gently pressing it against a large area of skin for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> and my skin feels clean and very soft</li>
            <li> This stuff is great hands down!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and my skin feels soft, tight, and gives me a healthy glow</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my skin so clean and soft!</li>
            <li> I still have not had the other major changes in my skins that others have experienced.</li>
            <li> He is extremely happy with how his skin is looking and is far less self-conscious about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> next day my skin felt really clean and my pores looked clean.  </li>
            <li> next day my skin felt really clean and my pores looked clean.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, once the time is up, and the mask is basically half-completely dry, I gently wash off with warm water.</li>
            <li> The only reason I purchase this product is to qualify for FREE Super Saver Shipping.</li>
            <li> My acne scars are getting less visible, my acne is diminishing, my face looks brighter, softer, clearer, and most importantly, healthier.</li>
            <li> plus I like to co wash instead of constant shampooing so this product was great in cleansing all the build up without striping my hair and making if feel dry.</li>
            <li> This is great not only fora news prone skin, but also dry skin.</li>
            <li> Skins feels super smooth and pores look much smaller immediately.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel great also helps clear my pores I have been getting less breakouts.</li>
            <li> I might should worry about the clay clogging the pipes, but I really just use a super warm washcloth to remove the mask and let it drain down the sink.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly blotting with oil absorbing sheets (my life savers!!!!)</li>
            <li> After one use of this, I was like wow!!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very excited to see how my face will look with future uses.</li>
            <li> This is a great clay mask, but due to my busy life, I don&#x27;t have much time to make it.</li>
            <li> Fortunately it didn&#x27;t burn (I was worried because I have VERY sensitive skin), but it didn&#x27;t do much else either.</li>
            <li> Since it kind of feels the same as an acid peel, I&#x27;d definitely have a good soothing moisturizer with high SPF on hand - like 50 or 55 - before going outside.   </li>
            <li> Educate yourself about this product (or rather bentonite clay, you can get it much cheaper than this) and then decide if it&#x27;s right for you and your situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The whole point is to purify your face right?</li>
            <li> But my face feels lighter and looks much brighter right after.</li>
            <li> and I will have to be ready to jump in the shower right away</li>
            <li> It stays good as long as it&#x27;s in a air safe tight container.</li>
            <li> It is a simple raw powdered bentonite clay which is readily available all over the world and used in many many cosmetics that you probably have in your bathroom right now.  </li>
            <li> This is such an amazing and natural product!</li>
            <li> It really does deep cleansing and leaves your skin smooth and squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> This way you can make it into more of a smooth paste then a chunky mess.</li>
            <li> skin feels as if I just had a salon facial- soft, clean, healthy.  </li>
            <li> This product is not for someone who wants a quick and easy facial.</li>
            <li> I have used tons of facial masks and this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this clay mask twice so far and my skin has never been more clear!</li>
            <li> It cleared up significantly and he hasnt even had the desire to have his back scratched a full week after I applied it.</li>
            <li> At first I kind of felt my face pulsing but nothing extreme.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to clear severe acne or anything, but it&#x27;s a decent facial mask for a good price.  </li>
            <li> I have used this at least a dozen times now and LOVE it!!  </li>
            <li> I also use the oil cleansing method, which I like a lot, but its nice to have a few different natural things around to keep you skin in good shape.</li>
            <li> i highly suggest it to anyone who has acne or gets the occasional bug bite and just wants to treat themselves to a nice spa treatment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good preventative treatment in the long term, because it doesn&#x27;t let the toxins in your skin develop long enough to turn into full-fledged pimples.</li>
            <li> I was lucky to never have acne as a teenager, unfortunately right now at 22, I am suffering from adult acne.</li>
            <li> But i would say it&#x27;s worth a shot at trying because the price is pretty decent.</li>
            <li> I tried mixing it with apple cider vinegar first then water; none of the mixtures gave me positive results.</li>
            <li> I saw many people say that it clogged their drains, and I found a way to get the mask off of your face easily while not clogging your drains or making a mess!</li>
            <li> I bought this clay due to all the amazing reviews, hoping that it would help me with my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Our faces were a bit pink for a little while after, but the result was great!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased it to combat adult acne, but I have not seen difference when using this product.  </li>
            <li> It really made my face glow after my first application, but the following days i broke out - which was okay because i heard this can happen.</li>
            <li> no more acne, my chest and back are healing up good and without being attacked by more acne.</li>
            <li> Its far too powerful!</li>
            <li> Its far too powerful!</li>
            <li> The original recipe also called for baking soda, which I eventually became sensitive to.</li>
            <li> I had no bad reactions afterward, but the intense itching sensation really didn&#x27;t make it feel very therapeutic.</li>
            <li> many problems happened for (ppl who left it long time/ used it many times per week)</li>
            <li> I have heard that eating or drinking clay , not this one specifically , one that is safe for internal use, also helps to detoxify the organs and help clear skin from breakouts, how true is that?</li>
            <li> Its kind of miraculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to keep using this mask and have begun using it on other parts of my body that also have acne.</li>
            <li> Its kind of miraculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to keep using this mask and have begun using it on other parts of my body that also have acne.</li>
            <li> It was just as effective on my acne spots as any other mask I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t feel a difference from this product to any other clay mask I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin with minor breakouts (mostly my forehead &amp; chin area) &amp; eczema on the top of my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved the difference that I saw in my face right after using this but after a few hours the fresh, clear complexion seemed to vanish.  </li>
            <li> Some good recipes also use a bit of raw honey.</li>
            <li> I definitely was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li> Moisturize now.&lt;br /&gt;One note: the first time; I applied way too much and did not get the consistency right while mixing it thus really crippling its potency.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After removing his skin was bright red for several hours.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend Clean &amp; Clear 3 step cleanser over this any day.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin red and irritated after use, but amazing way to clear your face out.</li>
            <li> and it definately brings circulation to your face, so don&#x27;t be surprised if your face is bright pink when you remove it.  </li>
            <li> i personally have a vary pail complexion so it leaves my skin bright red.</li>
            <li> As soon as I began washing the mask off my skin was burning and I was left with a bright red, blistered face.</li>
            <li> So happy I gave this stuff a chance, I seriously don&#x27;t know what I would do without it now.</li>
            <li> Moral of the story: use this stuff sparingly and carefully, and it works great.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference, and it makes my face feel clean and clear.</li>
            <li> It did turn my face bright red for a while, definitely don&#x27;t use it if you have to go anywhere soon.</li>
            <li> , feels great and isn&#x27;t harsh on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> After applying you may feel clear and clean .</li>
            <li> it leaves my face clean and clear.</li>
            <li> My skin felt tighter and more clean and the pores appeared less visible.</li>
            <li> Also I didn&#x27;t apply essential oil for him because again, his face gave off a bright red rash appearance.</li>
            <li> Then I grabbed my super soft microfiber towel and wet that with warm water to wipe off the remnants.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a natural cleanser, and is also used to clean marble of all impurities as marble is a porous stone.</li>
            <li> and it always clears my face up and leaves it feeling so soft and clean.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel really soft and clean.  </li>

            <li> Your&lt;br /&gt;face feels soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> As for my pores it does clean it well but doesn&#x27;t make my blackheads completely disappear (wasn&#x27;t expecting it to).</li>
            <li> My skin felt clean, soft and brighter.</li>
            <li> I havent seen result yet but so far I like how it makes my skin clean.</li>
            <li> it does clean them out completely in the moment, and I have never had that before.</li>

            <li> and I feel it leaves it soft &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> So far, this stuff works and leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I had realistic expectations buying this product based off all the success stories on the reviews here.  </li>
            <li> My face was clean and felt soft.</li>
            <li> Skin feels truly clean and soft after.  </li>
            <li> My face looked and felt so clean, soft, and my skin felt like I had a tightening done</li>
            <li> Love it ,really helps calm breakouts and dry out pimples.</li>
            <li> I have faith that you will achieve your goal of having clear and soft skin. :)</li>
            <li> I used a warm, sopping wet, washcloth to gently coax it off at the kitchen sink.  </li>
            <li> I mix this with warm water until nearly smooth and apply in a thick layer.</li>
            <li> It felt good until I took it off; my face was red and swolen, its been sitting in the back of my cabinet ever since....</li>
            <li> This clay doesn&#x27;t kill the bacteria in your acne so much as it brings it to the surface--a process that is actually a lot better for your skin than killing the pimples with salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> This mask stopped the progression of more acne, took the damage that was already done, and slowly but surely subdued it.</li>
            <li> This mask stopped the progression of more acne, took the damage that was already done, and slowly but surely subdued it.</li>
            <li> I echo what others have said as well - the whipped consistency is really the key to getting the most out of the mask.</li>
            <li> I love my brushes too much) and the only brush I felt</li>
            <li> I love my brushes too much) and the only brush I felt</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so having to rub it off with warm water is counterproductive to actually working.</li>
            <li> I put on a good moisturizer (another key component) and will report further findings in about 6 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I put on a good moisturizer (another key component) and will report further findings in about 6 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> You get an instant glow, and your face is super clean.</li>
            <li> price is reasonable, especially considering that I will be able to get 15 masks or so out of the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great quality and price and lasts a long, long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not being sure of how much I needed to make, I mixed 1 Tbsp + 1 tsp each of the clay and Vitaminshoppe brand unfiltered apple cider vinegar.  </li>
            <li> I have recommended it to several friends and can not say enough good this about this product.</li>
            <li> I really did not think I this product would work for me, but for the bargain price of 10 or 11 dollars, it really was worth a shot.  </li>
            <li> by the 3rd week I really feel like it&#x27;s refreshing my skin.</li>
            <li> Anyway, after a close inspection of my skin following the removal of the clay, I saw many pusses that have come very closely to the surface.  </li>
            <li> The tingling was expected, but still peculiar.&lt;br /&gt;After 15 minutes, I rinsed gently with warm water...</li>
            <li> A friend of mine who is a holistic health and wellness professional told me about this product when I asked her to recommend a natural mask without too many chemicals.</li>
            <li> I mixed it up with apple cider vinegar just like the directions said, and left it on for a good 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I only write reviews if I really love a product or really dislike it.</li>
            <li> So this is quite unusual for me, I would love if people reading this have had any similar situations, if so please comment on this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 1/2 T of both this and Bragg;s mixed more than covered my whole face.</li>
            <li> I use witch hazel as a toner then use mu tria blue light (pricey but worth it) and moisturize with argan oil.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really used this product enough to be madly in love with it..</li>
            <li> it is more soft and clear of blemishes.</li>
            <li> It is a good overall deep cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very cautious about what to put on my face since many products have only irritated it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> Okay, I finally used the whole 1lb jar.(I</li>
            <li> I love that this product is completely, 100% natural clay.</li>
            <li> I get hormonal cystic acne breakouts when I&#x27;m really stressed on top of my regular period</li>
            <li> so I put it on his back and when we wash off we&#x27;re all nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I fill a large bowl with hot water and use a wash cloth.</li>
            <li> Just tried it yesterday for the first time and it certainly lives up to its reviews.  </li>
            <li> The tub is pretty large</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and I used to have problems with some mild to sometimes severe acne.</li>
            <li> My younger sister and I tried this healing clay out as a facial and honestly, it really isn&#x27;t anything special or amazing by any means.</li>
            <li> I have not been using the product long enough to rave over it, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> very gently wash mask off, don&#x27;t scrub, this step is a process in its self, be gentle with washing mask off as skin has been cleaned by the mask, don&#x27;t need to agitate skin.</li>
            <li> Also, if you understand that &amp;#34;clay&amp;#34; is texturally consistent with &amp;#34;mud,&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t see how you could be surprised at it being &amp;#34;messy.&amp;#34; Use an old soft toothbrush to apply if you don&#x27;t have those nice brushes.</li>
            <li> it is very easy to remove but for someone lazy like me, it can be a pain (but still worth the effort!)</li>
            <li> I tried both water did nothing to my skin and was hard to mix together but the apple cider didn&#x27;t AMAZING!</li>
            <li> The next day she did, and she told me that her black heads all just came the very top and where so easily extracted.</li>
            <li> Then you can apply the mud to your face with the back of the spoon - this way your hands stay clean - and just rinse the spoon off when you&#x27;re done!</li>
            <li> but if you are looking for something to get your face deep clean give this a try!</li>
            <li> I like it less than the mint julep masks, but if you&#x27;re looking for more pulsating masks, use this!</li>
            <li> After I washed it off, I can see reduced of black heads and my skin was so smooth!!</li>
            <li> I keep in the bathroom just for masks and stuff; a plastic spoon to scoop the clay powder (I break the handle so it&#x27;s short enough to keep inside the jar), a plastic fork for mixing (find heavier duty forks), lastly, ELF $1 foundation brush (its complete plastic bristles makes it a good clay applying tool, easy to clean up too!)&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I felt the pulsating and my skin looked smooth with smaller pores right after both treatments I did.</li>
            <li> Every time I&#x27;ve done it, I&#x27;ve made too much or it wasn&#x27;t done the right way (too watery or the clay clumps too much).</li>
            <li> My skins feels so soft and has cleared right up!</li>
            <li> Mix with a little water, make a paste...apply to clean skin and enjoy the super cleansing clay.</li>
            <li> Actually it washed out relatively easy and feels pretty silky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 43 year old woman who has been pretty lucky in the skin department.</li>
            <li> So take it easy and start small, you can always make more.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll notice outbreaks at first because it&#x27;s purifying your skin, but your skin will clear up quickly.</li>
            <li> all these positive reviews?</li>
            <li> have nothing but positive things to say about this product.  </li>
            <li> When I saw all of the positive reviews for this mask, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I agree with all the positive review of this clay.  </li>
            <li> , I made a mask and washed with it and each usage showed positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews of this product before deciding to purchase and they were positive, but when I used it, it didn&#x27;t seem to have any noticeable changes after using for two weeks</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was optimistic at all the positive results.</li>
            <li> I used REN Hydra-Calm Global Protection Day Cream, which usually calms my skin right away, and it kind of felt like when you put aloe on a burn, so it felt better immediately.  </li>
            <li> I used REN Hydra-Calm Global Protection Day Cream, which usually calms my skin right away, and it kind of felt like when you put aloe on a burn, so it felt better immediately.  </li>
            <li> I have a pretty clean, chemical free lifestyle, but this mask was still able to reach down deep and draw out impurities.</li>
            <li> I have combination/oily AND delicate skin, and I always use so many products that have chemicals and harm my skin; and many of those chemical products made my skin dry which caused my skin to be MORE oily.</li>
            <li> I leave the hot water running for a little while for good measure.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, once the clay mix is completely dry in the bowl I used to whip it up, it&#x27;s easy to wipe the excess into the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Overall I think it&#x27;s amazing and definitely worth the buy, especially since it&#x27;s so cheap and works better than most of the expensive skin care products I have purchased over the years.</li>
            <li> Pores are pretty much gone.</li>
            <li> I used water the first 5 times, and no matter how much you stir, the clay will stay chunky.</li>
            <li> and I made too much the first time</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> If there are related products (a facial mask), would love to buy but haven&#x27;t seen anything available.</li>
            <li> It dries pretty fast.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;just have a pack on hand for quickies but can pretty much eliminate the need for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All help is much appricated ;-)</li>
            <li> bought this due to the extensive great reviews.</li>
            <li> I used too much of both components when I first tried mixing.</li>
            <li> Even with the tingling, this is actually pretty gentle for a mud mask.  </li>
            <li> I felt very itchy when it first started drying on my face.</li>
            <li> For the first month it didn&#x27;t really do a whole lot</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I went pretty much by the reviews as I stumbled on it during a search for something else</li>
            <li> It is very drying, so I like to first wash/dry my face and apply a layer of Extra-virgin Coconut oil for 15 minutes before applying the mask</li>
            <li> and since it was my first time, it wasn&#x27;t very even</li>
            <li> You get used to it though, just be ready when you first try</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid as much for ONE clay mask as this whole jar contains!</li>
            <li> Any acne sufferer has tried hundreds of different products, read thousands of Google searches/reviews/blogs, and experienced an endless amount of frustration, pain, and confusion.</li>
            <li> I have seen such a great improvement in some of the acne and other skin problems we all experience.</li>
            <li> I have tried pretty much every thing else, from fruit extracts, to toners, creams, diet, etc.</li>
            <li> It pulls in pretty much everything it</li>
            <li> I use it 3-4 times a week &amp; my blackheads are continuing to decrease and my pores are becoming smaller.</li>
            <li> At the end of the 30 minutes, you are ready to have the stuff off of your face, but it&#x27;s not extremely uncomfortable, either.</li>
            <li> but I have found it goes away pretty fast.  </li>
            <li> i seem to be the only one who&#x27;s experienced this according to all the other reviews.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how much I can contribute to this product, but it really seems to do what it says it will!</li>
            <li> The first two times I tried this product I put way too much of it on my face (the instructions tell you to put a 1/2 inch on your face??)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not surprised as most products do not do as theyre supposed to.</li>
            <li> It is a pretty intense product.</li>
            <li> The clay cost 5.99 and you pretty much pay 0.99 cent and shipping fees.</li>
            <li> OK, so I have had acne for a long time but</li>
            <li> It is intense and pretty inexpensive which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I really feel like my pores were minimized when I used it the first time..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Alright, that pretty much sums it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Alright, that pretty much sums it</li>
            <li> and I must say it really does work at first</li>
            <li> It also loves to clog my drains, and if I remove it with a towel, the towel is pretty much ruined, unless I rinse it off, but then it clogs the drain.</li>
            <li> This product has really improved the quality of my skin, the first week I got it</li>
            <li> I used too much the first time.</li>
            <li> Sure it would make it go away as long as I&#x27;m on it</li>
            <li> I was very scared at first</li>
            <li> My usual opaque and sallow skin looked and FELT fresh and healthy, and I didn&#x27;t even bother to use foundation makeup for work!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to minimize pores and came across this product, I really didn&#x27;t think much of it at first until I read some reviews and went on U tube.</li>
            <li> It works pretty much how everyone else on here describes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dude; been using this stuff pretty much once every two weeks.</li>
            <li> Also, I use it with hot water and use a sandwich bag to apply it on my face because it is much easier.</li>
            <li> yet it&#x27;s simply because it is evacuating pimples which were becoming at any rate.</li>
            <li> I made a mistake the first time I used it by putting too much on my face.</li>
            <li> i love it and it lasts a long time... will order again when i use all mine up.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable how good this stuff works</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t see much results, after the first couple uses my skin was still very oily, and bumpy.</li>
            <li> I looked into reviews about all natural acne products, and this was was mentioned due to its good pore cleaning ability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i use it once not bad so far</li>
            <li> Use just 1/4 spoon of the power is good enough for my whole face, this product is gonna last forever, and works forever.</li>
            <li> TI does not do as good of a job as a cleanser with AHA  (alpha-hydroxy acid), which can dissolve the gunk in your pores, and is usually prescribed/recommended by a doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> TI does not do as good of a job as a cleanser with AHA  (alpha-hydroxy acid), which can dissolve the gunk in your pores, and is usually prescribed/recommended by a doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After i remove, i use Thayer&#x27;s rose witch hazel toner &amp; follow with Neutrogena&#x27;s fight &amp; fade gel for my dark spots.</li>
            <li> but also pretty cool if you need to get rid of those little bastards fast and furious :)</li>
            <li> After using this I still see a lot of my pores around my nose and that is the main area I want clear and smooth on and around the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really makes my face feel soft &amp; clean.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about four days now, and seriously my skin looks better and better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love that it can get quite messy when you clean up your face.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my face feels once I clean the dried mask off.</li>
            <li> Make sure the bowl is big enough to fit your whole face in and submerge with water.</li>
            <li> first of all, i&#x27;ve seen people blaming real customers for being payed to write the reviews, well, i&#x27;m a real customer and this was my first time buying this because i was absolutely lost.</li>
            <li> I use it for external and internal it works great with my skin as well as detoxing my body from heavy metals, i put one teaspoon in a glass of water and mix it up, i do this every morning before meals and it had helped me wonders with stomach problems as well, make sure you it doesnt come in contact with metal it will decrease its power.</li>
            <li> I searched high and low and stumbled into this magic clay.</li>
            <li> I only purchased it because it had so many high ratings ...</li>
            <li> After going to many dermatologists and trying tons of different things (both over the counter and prescription) I went on acutane for a year in High School.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend it and if you have other people in your household that want to use it, trust me, this one jar is more than enoughfor everyone!</li>
            <li> It seems fine for very sensitive skin, however I would still only use it every 5-7 days, with the apple cider vinegar, and apply moisturizer quickly after washing.  </li>
            <li> Really does deep clean your pores!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product really done much for my face other than make it feel nice.</li>
            <li> Your skin will feel tighter, smoother and look fresh and new.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING for clearing up my skin and making my black heads disappear.</li>
            <li> Worked amazingly the first few times.</li>
            <li> Not noticing a huge difference in my pores/blackheads/breakouts, but I&#x27;ve only used it twice since receiving it about a week ago ;)</li>
            <li> Huge container for a small price, what&#x27;s not to love</li>
            <li> For the low price, the amount you receive and results I can easily see this being a staple in my beauty regime.</li>
            <li> Make sure to use a moisturizer because it can make your face quite dry.</li>
            <li> The only thing I miss about mint julep is the easy to dispense squeeze bottle.</li>
            <li> It will take more than 10-15 minutes to dry, but whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will take more than 10-15 minutes to dry, but whatever.   </li>
            <li> Super surprised, will buy again.</li>
            <li> I had this whole army of pimples attacking my face and they were defeating me big time because I was becoming depressed</li>
            <li> Make sure after you use it you apply a moisturizer because it can really dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> Simple to put together, and goes on easily.</li>
            <li> I like that there is no fragrance, and that it is so simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Then I read the back of the jar in more detail and found that this is normal.  </li>
            <li> my forehead is always bumpy and gross, but after using this it&#x27;s soft, smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling super soft and we have both noticed that it has reduced the amount of clogged pores we have.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and your face does actually pulsate.  </li>
            <li> I have mild adult acne breakouts from time to time and I was having one yesterday.</li>
            <li> My suggestion either hop in the shower or re-wet the entire mask to come off easy or it will hurt your face.</li>
            <li> I also love that my face isn&#x27;t dry after I use it -</li>
            <li> Makes your skin super soft after 1 use.  </li>
            <li> After washing it off, my skin felt super soft.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin super soft when I take it off.</li>
            <li> You need to rehydrate your skin after use, and since you have completely cleaned your face, it will absorb any product quickly.  </li>
            <li> The healing process took a while, but I was able to speed it up with my dry bush.</li>
            <li> The healing process took a while, but I was able to speed it up with my dry bush.</li>
            <li> At any rate, this is a fantastic product; and cheaper from Amazon than it was at my local Whole Foods!</li>
            <li> It warns on the side that you will feel your skin pulsing while wearing the mask and although I have SUPER sensitive skin, I did not feel this.</li>
            <li> I can almost guarantee your face will be a glowing canvas if you let this dry for about 30 minutes or more.</li>
            <li> Can just as easily be used with water with the same effect.</li>
            <li> but it leaves my face super soft and dewy.</li>
            <li> My pits have never been more dry...</li>
            <li> My sister has had ulcerative colitis for a long time, and she gets diarrhea that lasts for as much as 10 days or more whenever she has a flare-up.  </li>
            <li> It was simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Makes my face super soft</li>
            <li> Your skin will be really dry afterwards so make sure you have a moisturizer at hand even if you have oily</li>
            <li> Your skin will be really dry afterwards so make sure you have a moisturizer at hand even if you have oily</li>
            <li> I love that you can use vinegar to mix in if your skin is oily, or water if it&#x27;s dry.  </li>
            <li> cuz my skin is super sensitive</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased that I did because this is exactly like the green clay mask I used so many years ago and just from two uses it cleared up the skin problems I&#x27;ve been fighting with for these past 15 years.</li>
            <li> Be sure to get a moisturizer because after cleaning your face it will be dry.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin &amp;</li>
            <li> What I really love, is it that it didnt dry my face out like alot of cleansers and masks I have tried.  </li>
            <li> has helped my face clear up greatly, plus no more peeling skin.&lt;br /&gt;hope</li>
            <li> my daughters were very against this at first but really like how this cleans their faces.</li>
            <li> Takes a while to dry say more than 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Deep cleaning, easy to use.  </li>
            <li> recommend using before you shower to make the cleanup as easy as possible without having to scrub your skin to get this product off.</li>
            <li> I plan on using it once a week to clear up my mild acne and acne scars.</li>
            <li> Soaking your face with it first, and breaking the mask up around your face really helps, because otherwise it really hurts.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have any redness afterwards - and I have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> There is redness after removing the mask, but it goes away quickly and completely.</li>
            <li> The oily tzone is at bay, and my dry flakey chin is getting better with each use.</li>
            <li> The oily tzone is at bay, and my dry flakey chin is getting better with each use.</li>
            <li> Washed off easy enough.  </li>
            <li> it was easy enough.</li>
            <li> This product temporarily tightened my pores and made my skin soft, but it isn&#x27;t super miraculous like I was lead to believe by all the rave reviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix it with either water or apple vinegar and mix/mash it in a ziploc bag for easy disposal and storage for any left over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne my whole life pretty much</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s only easy to remove in the shower, which means you will end up clogging the pipes eventually.</li>
            <li> I bought this with hopes that it would help with my &amp;#34; mild adult acne&amp;#34; that I&#x27;ve dealt with for over 10 years now.</li>
            <li> I have mild acne and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but if you want it to dry and don&#x27;t have all day, thinner is better.</li>
            <li> and I was sure my skin would be dry after rinsing, but...</li>
            <li> After using many lotions to get my face to get back to normal</li>
            <li> However, after the first use, I didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference.</li>
            <li> This product is really strong you actually feel the pulse on your face like the mask is pulling out all impurities from your pores and cleaning it..</li>
            <li> Strong mask gives a deep cleansing feeling  for days after</li>
            <li> (this one is strong, for deep cleansing, so you may want to dilute it with almond or jojoba oil).</li>
            <li> Strong mask that helps in deep cleansing of skin and improving fairness.</li>
            <li> Really, the price is right and it does the job much better than any other product on the market...</li>
            <li> and it starts to feel tingly on your skin, leaving it fresh and VERY soft.</li>
            <li> and It feels very soft and fresh now.</li>
            <li> It has helped me with my oily skin and large pores.</li>
            <li> It brought some clogged pores I had to the surface and got rid of the large pores around my nose.  </li>
            <li> I have large pores and lots of blackheads on my nose...</li>
            <li> product is a pure unlimited Jackpot for the skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have large pores and often treat them with a BHA liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also works well for drying out acne if used in certain spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has helped a ton and has reduced the amount of time that I have a large lump under my skin from the acne.</li>
            <li> clay and you don&#x27;t have to worry about the harshness of certain compounds.</li>
            <li> I follow it up with either pure coconut oil or The Body Shop Vitamin E moisture mask.</li>
            <li> Afterwards I apply another product bought here at Amazon: pure Emu oil.</li>
            <li> The large pores are on my chin cheeks and nose.</li>
            <li> so I need to get a large bowl and put it in the sink to rinse.</li>
            <li> I will certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> And right before my son&#x27;s 2nd birthday party, right on!</li>
            <li> this is the pure truth.</li>
            <li> It does wonders on skin with large pores, Sebaceous Filaments, and helps to reduce acne and inflammation.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to improve the appearance of large pores and for acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> From this product I was hoping to reduce the appearance of large pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 100% pure dirt.</li>
            <li> This, however, is pure clay/dirt that will literally dig into the pores and flush out whatever gunk</li>
            <li> I have large, clogged pores that occurred after moving to desert.</li>
            <li> In addition, the pores in the corners of my nose are quite large.</li>
            <li> Pure clay.</li>
            <li> And yet, with large pores and the occassional breakout  (because I dont; stick to routine) I seek out products like these.</li>
            <li> comes in a powder form, was thrown off and still haven&#x27;t reopened it because you have to mix it a certain way with water.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin with large pores, and blackheads.</li>
            <li> acne is GONE and my large pores have shrunk.</li>
            <li> It certainly did not work for</li>
            <li> I have large pores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pure bentonite clay.</li>
            <li> skin (and I certainly didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel</li>
            <li> My skin plumps and is so supple, and if i have acne in a certain spot - it will be reduced to almost nothing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pure clay, which means no fragrance.</li>
            <li> I ordered a large 2lb bag of this off of ebay.</li>
            <li> I certainly fond this mask.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and large pores.  </li>
            <li> It clears blackheads, exfoliates, softens skin and is made of pure earth, no added whatevers.</li>
            <li> But this product certainly lives up to the hype!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> ON OILY SKIN AND SHRINKS LARGE PORES.</li>
            <li> I have large pores and this helps reduce the appearance of them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Yesterday afternoon I noticed a large insect bite on my forearm.</li>
            <li> I feel like im not just peeling my skin like certain peels out there--</li>
            <li> maybe people who force large amount of it had problems with drains</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re basically getting is a large jar of powdered mud.</li>
            <li> My mother has large pores on her nose.</li>
            <li> me and my mother have struggled with sagging skin and puffiness under the eyes as well as large pores.</li>
            <li> So I rinsed off my face in a large bowl which was not helping the mask come off.</li>
            <li> I have Seborrheic Dermatitis in certain areas of my face, and acne all over my forehead.</li>
            <li> I have large pores that get clogged often</li>
            <li> I used it on my hubby who has large pores and you can see them clogged...</li>
            <li> OR my pores are too large</li>
            <li> I have oily skin with large pores...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really interested in pulsation, just smooth clean skin.</li>
            <li> A very fine, soft, odorless powder meant to be mixed with water or vinegar.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin amazing and mask gets super hard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice now and so far it&#x27;s made my face really soft and smooth and seems like it&#x27;s really gonna start to fade my acne scars!</li>
            <li> It leaves your face soft and beautiful and has helped clear up a couple trouble spots on my face.</li>
            <li> Your face feels and looks fresh after each use, and the fact that it clear my acne is a plus!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my first mask of any kind, so I was not really expecting too much wow factor.</li>
            <li> It tightens your face to the point where you cant even open your mouth, so it&#x27;s kind of a hassle if your significant other is home, and you can&#x27;t do anything but whimper at them</li>
            <li> this was the first time i mixed my own facial</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin fresh and soft!</li>
            <li> This did live up to the hype and my skin looked much better after using it only once</li>
            <li> /&gt;Washing it off is pretty easy, I ran hot water for 2 mins to make sure that it washes off the mud in the drain.&lt;br /&gt;After, I can physically see that my pores were 90% smaller, I can barely see it.</li>
            <li> far I&#x27;ve only used this product twice a week for two weeks, yet the results are far more exceptional than I had expected.</li>
            <li> The left over mask does not dry out in the plastic container and is just as effective as the &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; batch.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> id half to buy another $17 worth of products from amazon  to be able to check out.</li>
            <li> It mixed to a very smooth,creamy consistency and was quite easy to put on my face.</li>
            <li> It does dry the skin so you definitely need a good moisturizer after.</li>
            <li> I splashed my face and neck thoroughly with warm water (without rubbing the skin) until all the clay melted away, then I patted dry with a soft towel.</li>
            <li> Easy, fast and simple.</li>
            <li> Once the mask is dry I rinse with warm water and a soft cloth.  </li>
            <li> Amazing tight cleansed skin.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel nice and tight.</li>
            <li> The mask feels nice on your face, it gets really tight.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it pulls so tight across the bridge of my nose, it opened my sinuses.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it pulls so tight across the bridge of my nose, it opened my sinuses.</li>
            <li> So I just added a bottle of my usual hair conditioner, which I essentially got for free because it gave me the magic number I needed for free shipping.</li>
            <li> I was able to clean up pores around my nose, easily with the proper tool, because of this prep, and I then followed my usual skin care routine.  </li>
            <li> Honestly my skin is pretty much the same after several uses.</li>
            <li> Rinse mud off with a lot of warm water (pat the dried mud with wet hands first to get the ball rolling), then use more water to massage it around and eventually rinse off fully.</li>
            <li> have been using the mask for about 4-5 months now, once a week or before special or major events...</li>
            <li> Sure it&#x27;s more pure than what&#x27;s out back and has less worms, but it&#x27;s just dirt.</li>
            <li> This stuff seriously works and it is amazing!</li>
            <li> For me I noticed my fine lines diminishing after the second mask.  </li>
            <li> After washing my face clean, I can actually feel the difference in my skin; it  feels soft, clean and renewed.  </li>
            <li> I keep my tub in a zip-lock bag the powder is extremely fine, also I recommend tying the hair back.</li>
            <li> It feels refreshing and exactly like any other toner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> it sure worked wonders for my dry aged skin... :)</li>
            <li> It has not improved the fine lines I have around my eyes, but it has definitely reduced the pore size and seems to have started some collagen production.</li>
            <li> I use it for the occasional blemish, works fine for that.  </li>
            <li> I just bought it a couple days ago, but my first results have been better than other masks I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It left my face squeaky clean, literally, and I&#x27;ve never had skin this clean or soft... ever.</li>
            <li> I have always mixed it with water &amp; it worked fine</li>
            <li> It worked fine on all three applications, and I used it with equal parts apple cider vinegar to clay powder.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is an all-natural, decently priced godsend!</li>
            <li> This mask in particular has changed my face!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried it with the water as a facial mask, but it did make my pores seem invisible, and my face was super smooth!</li>
            <li> Kind of messy, but easy enough to apply.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think of it as a mask to make your face smoother and vibrant but as a pimple killer!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think of it as a mask to make your face smoother and vibrant but as a pimple killer!</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this VERY highly, she has been using this mud for years.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin with large pores</li>
            <li> A friend of mine, who suggested this to me, has oily skin, large pores and breaks out a lot, so she uses the vinegar, and it works really well for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I really guess I thought it would keep my skin pure</li>
            <li> Be sure to moisturize after using it because your face will be very dry afterward</li>
            <li> There is a very noticeable pulsing and your face will most likely be red afterwards, but it fades quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update - the weather is getting a little cooler and drier now, so I don&#x27;t do the mask as often, maybe once a week max, but the anti-aging cream I recommended, Bel Essence is amazing in the cooler and drier weather.  </li>
            <li> Amazing mask, dries pimples and evens skin tone a little.</li>
            <li> I went through the greenbelt in austin the other day, its enormous, lush and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Getting the mask off can be a little challenge, even if you use copious amounts of warm water.</li>
            <li> and it felt a little tingly, but really nice.  </li>
            <li> I mix with filtered water and a little rose water.</li>
            <li> So nice, I like to use this for a little &#x27;me&#x27; time.</li>
            <li> Honestly this makes me break out in little pimples all over my forehead.</li>
            <li> I took a warm facecloth to melt it off little at a time.</li>
            <li> Another good way to mix the clay is to use raw and unfiltered honey!</li>
            <li> I mainly wanted to try this to give my skin a &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34; pretty much.</li>
            <li> The product arrived fast and the price was pretty decent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the easiest thing to mix, and I can usually never get the right texture...</li>
            <li> I grabbed a Tupperware bowl and poured quite a large amount of the clay into it which when mixed with the apple cider vinegar ended up making a huge batch.</li>
            <li> it is very easy to remove but for someone lazy like me, it can be a pain (but still worth the effort!)oil control</li>
            <li> I use the clean and clear dual action moisturizer, it works really well!</li>
            <li> so I used witch hazel with a little lavender essential oil and it was great.</li>
            <li> For the rest of that month my mom used a whole shampoo bottle of Nizoral on my scalp &amp; effectively got rid of practically all the fungus except for two little parts on the nape of my scalp.  </li>
            <li> but I waited a little bit before writing a review, to make sure that I can give a useful feedback.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This says good for 10 uses, but I&#x27;ve covered my face in it now 4 times and hardly see a dent in the amount gone.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to blend to a good result.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get a good consistency as well.</li>
            <li> I mixed 2 table spoons of clay and 2 tablespoons of organic cider vinegar plus a tiny bit more water in a non - metallic bowl and mixed with a plastic fork until very smooth .</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to put oil on my skin, but it has only made my skin better, and it works better than any chemical anti-aging cream I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to put oil on my skin, but it has only made my skin better, and it works better than any chemical anti-aging cream I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ok so I thought my skin looked brighter, I looked at my pores and thought ok, they look a little smaller.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit hard to mix with water into a smooth paste, so I recommend pre-mixing a batch in a cup or bowl and letting it sit overnight with saran wrap over the top of the container.</li>
            <li> Ok, like many of the other reviewers, I&#x27;ve had acne for a very, very long time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very clean pure powder and the apple vinegar recommended below taste like crap but its very good when mixing with the aztec powder.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, all was great being acne free but now for the past 3 days all around my mouth I have been breaking out really-really bad, I honestly have counted 15!</li>
            <li> I finally decided to give this a try after seeing it a few times , and I am happy I bought it.</li>
            <li> My skin is slightly red after taking it off, but the next morning my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this for just one time, I woke up the next morning and noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> It totally shrunk my huge pores on my nose and</li>
            <li> I did my whole face last night and he commented on how smooth my face looked today.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it enough to truly give an accurate review, but seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> However what I am most pleased with is how it has peeled off the old dead skin on my legs and clear up the eczema/dry like skin</li>
            <li> my boyfriend had huge pores and red skin</li>
            <li> I went from worrying about when the next huge breakout would happen to having no worries at all.</li>
            <li> It works great on facial issues, blackheads, and also on dead skin on feet and athlete&#x27;s foot.</li>
            <li> My skin felt smooth but not great or amazing.</li>
            <li> I had a huge pimple that wouldn&#x27;t go away for 2 weeks and was deep under my skin.</li>
            <li> When i work out or sweat, i get huge bumps on my inner thighs.</li>
            <li> Ive used this several times on my clients and have noticed a huge difference with blackheads and acne.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is a huge hassle to mix(clumps, splashes, etc), and I have tried the vinegar mix as well as the water mix with identical results; it does help with pimples and blackheads, but it is no miracle worker, and when used as instructed it dries out my skin during use to the point where it begins to burn, and leaves my face red and ultra-sensitive for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> Although it will not give you amazing skin in 3 days, it will do the following from my personal experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My mom actually bought this and since this container is absolutely huge...</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t help myself when there is a huge white pus bump on your face).</li>
            <li> I was having a huge breakout when I started using this product and only used it twice at this point and was amazed by how fast my face is clearing up.</li>
            <li> but it is so worth it for me to have my fave clear up as much as it has.</li>
            <li> It comes in powder form, so mixing it with water yields a different texture every time, and it&#x27;s too much work to put it in a plastic baggy every time in order to make a completely smooth mask.</li>
            <li> Huge tube, will probably last me forever.</li>
            <li> Definitely intense suction, and left my skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Huge container, will last forever.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-It made such a huge difference in shrinking my boyfriend&#x27;s pores.</li>
            <li> but now I only have battle scars (Blemishes), white/black heads and huge pores on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The amazing result is: it actually caused about 30 tiny breakouts on my face in just one night;</li>
            <li> but I have already seen a HUGE change in the texture of my skin, especially my forehead.</li>
            <li> if you want to clear up your acne you would need to first figure out what&#x27;s causing the acne in the first place</li>
            <li> Add these to your skin care routine and in a few weeks you should see amazing results.</li>
            <li> I have huge pores and a deep rooted whiteheaded pimple that wouldn&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li> but once I rinse the clay off my skin is soft, clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> With only two uses I see drastic results, my pores are smaller, acne vanished, amazing even skin tone.</li>
            <li> This is assuming that you&#x27;re using it on your whole face.</li>
            <li> The stuff really pulls everything out of your face.</li>
            <li> but I am going to see if it makes as much of a difference as everyone says.</li>
            <li> I feel like it really helped my skin.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t need that much for your face-</li>
            <li> I would like it this much.  </li>
            <li> the process of peeling it off, I realized this stuff really does get into the pores.  </li>
            <li> Can anyone tell me how much I should mix with vinegar</li>
            <li> and it didnt show much improvement</li>
            <li> Mix really well.  </li>
            <li> I really like it and will use again.</li>
            <li> this stuff dries, it really shrinks and pulls.</li>
            <li> I felt like this product really helped with combination issue.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really no secret that it helps cleanse the pores and tighten the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things to try to cleanse my skin but nothing ever really worked.</li>
            <li> This did work really well for me.</li>
            <li> and I was very depressed and started looking online for a remedy.</li>
            <li> its so time consuming to come off, since I recommend not washing it off straight in your bathtub or sink; the material turns into dirt once it dries</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 37 and don&#x27;t really have acne anymore</li>
            <li> Her whole face was inflamed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found a microfiber cloth takes it off much easier than a washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Forget clay - join this century and check out what modern science can do for you.  </li>
            <li> but it really hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> However, on the third week onward, my face starts to feel smooth and the pimples are reduced in size and number.</li>
            <li> All in all, i am very please with this product and</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Trust when I say this stuff is really helpful for acne prone skin..</li>
            <li> I saw this on amazon whole browsing and had to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know its dirt, or whatever, and I know some people question what the reAl ingredients and authenticity of those ...</li>
            <li> I know its dirt, or whatever, and I know some people question what the reAl ingredients and authenticity of those ...</li>
            <li> Really tightens pores.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely astounded at the improvement in just one application (I used [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> He rinsed it off gently in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> and it has really helped with my skin.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe you get so much for the price.</li>
            <li> It made my face really itchy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It can take you a bit to figure out how much powder and liquid to mix.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li> really recommended</li>
            <li> I made a mask for my husband and I, and I still made too much (I used a quarter cup of the clay and a quarter cup of apple cider vinegar).  </li>
            <li> Really helps with acne and scarring.</li>
            <li> Upon washing it off, my skin looked smooth, the pores were smaller, and my pimples had diminished.  </li>
            <li> When I woke up the next morning, my face was smooth, my skin looked rejuvenated, and the pimples were reduced in size and severity.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll be continuing the regimen with high hopes!</li>
            <li> but it leaves my face feeling fresh and soft</li>
            <li> It really works .</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t do that much.</li>
            <li> It is reasonably priced for the benefits that it delivers.</li>
            <li> Let me tell ya, I changed my whole face routine in hopes that my face will heal soon.</li>
            <li> The mask will leave your face somewhat red but its temporary and a smooth look.  </li>
            <li> It does wonders for cleaning up my skin, really.</li>
            <li> I have really acne-prone, oily skin as well.</li>
            <li> As most reviews say, be careful using this stuff in the shower.</li>
            <li> It was delivered fast and once I got it home</li>
            <li> I havent seen any improvement really in my skin.</li>
            <li> if you struggle with acne-prone or oily skin, I highly, HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> it.ly, HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> but I feel like this product doesn&#x27;t do much for my face or acne.</li>
            <li> , it suctioned so much, that it had drawn the corners of my nose &#x27;in&#x27; some and</li>
            <li> This clay really works.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It is so gentle on my skin and my daughter uses it as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Here&#x27;s what really happened to me:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Overall, I enjoy the product.</li>
            <li> really?</li>
            <li> After years of suffering acne and the inflamed wasteland that comes after, I finally see a light at the end of the tunnel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make the commitment to use it as much as you need.</li>
            <li> Make the commitment to use it as much as you need.</li>
            <li> I really like it and so does my sister.</li>
            <li> Make sure to wash your face carefully after.</li>
            <li> I saw it here on Amazon and was contemplating buying it, but then I saw it in the beauty section at Whole Foods and bought it along with the Apple Cider Vinegar.</li>
            <li> It really makes the skin cleaner.</li>
            <li> evenly so my clay mix was very watery.</li>
            <li> I only have light acne</li>
            <li> And it didn&#x27;t really start the \\&quot;pulsing\\</li>
            <li> but nothing intense.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think it works for acne, except it shrinks my blackheads sometimes.</li>
            <li> sometimes so much that I can&#x27;t even leave it on for one minute.</li>
            <li> This thing really does wonder.</li>
            <li> And it is very affordable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I got the Clay is because of all the minerals it can deposit into your skin and to help tighten pores, which this does very well.</li>
            <li> This jar I skeptically mixed and put what looked like mud paste with clumps I couldn&#x27;t quite smooth out on my face.</li>
            <li> Well, I ordered it and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> and my skin was much smoother.  </li>
            <li> Nothing seems to work very well.  </li>
            <li> It could be improved if it was ready to use instead of mixing powder with water to put on the face.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, which means that I am also acne prone.</li>
            <li> It really cleans well</li>
            <li> The second night using this product made my face feel smooth as a baby&#x27;s ass</li>
            <li> I really want to like this product</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It feels like it really cleans your skin and penetrating in to your pores and getting the filth out.</li>
            <li> When I tried mixing with water, the clay clumped and had a really lumpy texture.</li>
            <li> i guess time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;The pulling and tingling feeling is definitely intense.</li>
            <li> I really like the product.</li>
            <li> realized I had no idea how much to mix</li>
            <li> I used a pre-moistened face wipe but that didn’t really work.</li>
            <li> I really can’t wait to see what using this stuff for 3 weeks will do!nd of course then my friends asked me to go out.</li>
            <li> I really like this clay.  </li>
            <li> This is very cost effective for me, it saves me time and money than going to spa for a deep pore cleansing facial, which earns another star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This mask works great!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and for the price</li>
            <li> and this clay is very alkaline.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-aloe vera gel (to soothe)&lt;br /&gt;-turmeric powder (an anti-inflammatory agent, not too much though as it can</li>
            <li> I am becoming a life long customer and will always trust this company with all my heart.</li>
            <li> I cant say much yet as iv used it once</li>
            <li> Hopefully my face recovers very</li>
            <li> I also put too much on (the directions say</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY inexpensive and works.  </li>
            <li> really well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make me break out, leaves my skin looking fresh and soft.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t notice as much oil the day after using the mask.  </li>
            <li> I was really hoping for the miracle everyone was talking about...</li>
            <li> - it doesn&#x27;t cost much for the number of uses you can make from this product.  </li>
            <li> But i am reviewing this from my point of view and it really burned my skin.</li>
            <li> but it really did disappear even though I thought it wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s Much easier to use with ACV than water.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t want to clog my drains or my washer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t want to clog my drains or my washer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing for my son&#x27;s acne.</li>
            <li> I really like this mask, it does what it claims.</li>
            <li> This product really works and results are seen within a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> this wasnt really a miracle.</li>
            <li> it is however like ive heard very tightening</li>
            <li> We tried Proactiv, but it didn&#x27;t have much of an effect for either of us.  </li>
            <li> I had no idea of how much to mix up</li>
            <li> Try a tablespoon at a time, until you know how much you require.  </li>
            <li> Mix a bit of water with it, and as it dries it really pulls on your skin.</li>
            <li> You really feel this working</li>
            <li> We have had the whole family try ouet.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Once I am done with my bath or when the tightness is too much for me, I remove the mask with a washcloth.</li>
            <li> I also notice my pores seem to get smaller and if I use it before an event, my makeup looks more natural( I also don&#x27;t have to use much)</li>
            <li> When I do do my whole face</li>
            <li> Not so much.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> This really cleanses the deepest layers of the skin, you can feel it sucking out all the oil.</li>
            <li> but it performs better than I expected it to.</li>
            <li> Man this stuff really gets the job done with pores/ acne.</li>
            <li> It will really itch and make you crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I personally put mine in a plastic baggy and cut the tip and apply it like you would decorate a cake and then smooth out.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t use as much as you think.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like anything else, it&#x27;s as much what you put in your body as what you put on it.</li>
            <li> it really makes a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> Thanks to all the reviews too.  </li>
            <li> I whole-heartedly I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This works really well.  </li>
            <li> My skin has been very acne prone</li>
            <li> If you use too much it can clog up your sink/shower.</li>
            <li> and it was really embarrasing</li>
            <li> The mask really does pulsate...</li>
            <li> Being very inexpensive, I decided to order it and try it out.</li>
            <li> I think this is what really stopped my body from \\&quot;making\\</li>
            <li> Tanda blue light 1-2x/day on problem areas.</li>
            <li> I havent really seen improvement..</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and sebacious cystic acne.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I use this on spa night once a week and the next morn by face is smooth.</li>
            <li> or I gently press on acne pimple to remove puss</li>
            <li> It was very clumpy, very un mask like.</li>
            <li> I really didnt see a difference in my skin after taking it off.</li>
            <li> I absolutely L.O.V.E.</li>
            <li> This really cleans out your pores but it itches like hell</li>
            <li> My face felt so much smoother, and there was no irritation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It then made me realize how much healthier this is rather than premade masks.</li>
            <li> It really cleared up alll my acne.</li>
            <li> If it starts to burn too much</li>
            <li> Really, I have used this stuff for about a month</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I ddnt really feel much of the pulsating feeling of it</li>
            <li> You really can feel it working.</li>
            <li> For the record, I have very oily skin, and after reading all the 5 star reviews I figured this product had to do SOMETHING for my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> HAHA</li>
            <li> Best of all, when I felt an emerging acne cyst--which can develop and last for MONTHS--I put the mask on it a few nights in a row in desperation, and it actually stopped and reversed the progress of the cyst!</li>
            <li> amazing!My pores are soo much</li>
            <li> Never thought I would like this as much as I do.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> As I started using it, you can really tell that it opens up your pores</li>
            <li> It has a very earthy feel and smell.</li>
            <li> It has helped my face so much.</li>
            <li> The bottle lies, you don&#x27;t need much at all.</li>

            <li> Like, it literally started drying on my cheek as I moved to my nose, haha.</li>
            <li> , I do not think that I am breaking out quite as much, and if I have acne, this helps to heal it faster.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will make a liquid paste and apply to whole face or just the acne</li>
            <li> I used this mask for 3 days in a row and the acne isn&#x27;t really improving.  </li>
            <li> and i see what the whole \\&quot;pulsating\\&quot; thing is about.</li>

            <li> I expected more of the cleaning effect from this clay...</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t really work so well for</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim and didn&#x27;t expect much from it.</li>
            <li> like really, really break out like</li>
            <li> Your skin really feels like it&#x27;s pulsating</li>

            <li> and my face is much smoother.</li>
            <li> my surprise, my face was much smoother.  </li>
            <li> my surprise, my face was much smoother.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne my whole life.  </li>
            <li> I had to wear a cast for a whole week, so I couldn&#x27;t wash my face.  </li>
            <li> My skin literally looked like gravel on Monday - it is now Thursday and some of my skin is smooth and the rest of the pimples are significantly smaller in size.  </li>
            <li> The premixed is much easier.</li>
            <li> I really like how it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> /&gt;While some people say you can use it with water, I really don&#x27;t recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I had to aggressively wash it off and it took so much longer to do.</li>
            <li> Very misleading.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It really opened up my pores and cleaned them out.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and acne scars.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty normal skin</li>
            <li> it really helps a lot.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see a difference</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon, you have really thought about what your customers may need and</li>
            <li> Really tightens my pores</li>
            <li> , made a thousand times too much for my face.  </li>
            <li> and you can mix as much as you like.</li>
            <li> I used my clay, and I can tell you it was the real deal.</li>
            <li> so I added as much water as I felt needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so much about this mask refering to acne</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but I really recommend applying this stuff maybe - to start - once a week.</li>
            <li> Another note, I find that 1 tablespoon of the clay to 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar (or water) works really well.</li>
            <li> really?</li>
            <li> I mix a very miniscule amount of powder, maybe 1/2 tsp with bentonite clay liquid.  </li>
            <li> and you really can feel that tightening/pulling sensation.</li>
            <li> You really can feel the pulse as it dries on your skin.</li>
            <li> , i don&#x27;t really care about that.&lt;br /&gt;after</li>
            <li> I really like it and&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> works well, too much, and</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Fast service too</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, the whole \\&quot;feel your skin</li>
            <li> it really is a mud mask</li>
            <li> Give it a chance to really work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This really DETOXES you, so be prepared.</li>
            <li> This really DETOXES you, so be prepared.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s drying, at this point, and it&#x27;s really tightening...</li>
            <li> It really cleaned our faces and shrinked my pores.</li>
            <li> My scalp has so much build up</li>
            <li> but it  really does help with everything</li>
            <li> thanks to this mask i dont have acne anymore&lt;</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need that much at all with each use.</li>
            <li> It has really increased my confidence.</li>
            <li> It was very lumpy</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it really lifted all the dirt and oils frm my face</li>
            <li> I was really hoping it would take away my blackheads</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really get it</li>
            <li> and my skin glows, feels tighter and much healthier once I wash it off.</li>
            <li> but she has also found it works really well as a neutrally colored finishing powder.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make much of a difference, I don&#x27;t think.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> As the mask dries, you can really feel the clay pulling out the impurities from your pores.</li>
            <li> I really felt my face tighten up this stuff is legit</li>
            <li> and it really makes my skin feel so much softer.</li>
            <li> Never had a product tighten my pores so much.  </li>
            <li> , it really is.</li>
            <li> but it really works to help pull curl pattern out of your hair</li>
            <li> For some reason I thought the consistency was going to be much thicker.  </li>
            <li> I really like the product and use it once weekly.  </li>
            <li> Results are fast.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t make out how much clay, water, and apple cider vinegar to use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think it worked too well.  </li>
            <li> This came soooo fast, I almost couldn&#x27;t believe when I found the package on my doorstep in what just felt like three or four days.</li>
            <li> Cant really be beat for that price.</li>
            <li> Made my skin look and feel smooth and made my pores appear smaller.  </li>
            <li> But the reason I continue to put so much care into my routine is to maintain it.</li>
            <li> really wish I came across this sooner.</li>
            <li> It really does feel like it&#x27;s sucking all the impurities.</li>
            <li> I used it with white vinegar and it just makes my skin look so smooth.</li>
            <li> REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> ITS VERY CLEANSING, IT DRAWS OUT A LOT OF IMPURITIES</li>
            <li> Really, where do I begin.</li>
            <li> But in college, you really expect by about the time you&#x27;re 18, your acne should be dissipating.</li>
            <li> never thought there would be a miracle product, because we&#x27;ve always been led to believe there really isn&#x27;t a miracle product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to really stock up on this stuff.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d just say use whatever cleanser (GENTLE cleanser) works for you.  </li>
            <li> it on for 15-20 mins or 30.. depending on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Use witch hazel with cotton pads (trust me on this) gently wipe skin with it</li>
            <li> besides your cleanser and moisturizer, but that&#x27;s why I advise using a quality, gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> go to Skinstore.com or dermstore.com and do some research on a gentle cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ranting for well over 10 minutes now, but clearly the reader can tell that I&#x27;m venting about this success story.</li>

            <li> works really well.</li>
            <li> I think I got this whole tub for about $5.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is getting it smooth.</li>
            <li> Id say go for it, especially since it is so cheap.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use as much as they say to.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me...used it for couple months.</li>
            <li> I do NOT suggest adding water to the clay, it absorbs really fast</li>
            <li> Works very well as a body mask/wrap.</li>
            <li> Really helped shrink my pores</li>
            <li> The clay is very well milled.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> It works, and it works fast.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin.  </li>
            <li> Turn on your faucet and let the water run very</li>
            <li> I was absolutely astounded to see, after ONE use, its lifting effects.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be curious to see if repeated use of the clay makes that effect more permanent.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I mix with apple vinegar and it really gets the blood flowing in my face which creates a glow after the mask is off.</li>
            <li> Dealt with acne my whole life.</li>
            <li> is being sucked haha..</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> but I find myself not doing it as much because I have to do it before I take a shower</li>
            <li> These works really well for cleaning out my pores.</li>
            <li> this thing really opens pores.</li>
            <li> Such a fabulous clay mask for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li> It really has improved the health and vitality of my skin.</li>
            <li> and ruff i thank it works very well</li>
            <li> I really wish I would&#x27;ve found this sooner.</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin</li>
            <li> I can really feel it working while I have it on.</li>
            <li> and this has work really well for me .</li>
            <li> but it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> You can make different scrubs for your face that leave your face feeling smooth and cleansed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much it pulled out of my skin.</li>
            <li> As for me, my skins pretty normal</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> , it really burns when it say pulsate believe me</li>
            <li> but it burns too much</li>
            <li> , it all soaked into my skin as fast as I put it on.  </li>
            <li> also it made my face really itchy while it was drying.</li>
            <li> So when you&#x27;re ready to take the clay off, just keep wiping all of it off with the cloth and wring it out in the bucket.</li>
            <li> Haha...</li>
            <li> the Vitamin Shoppe has this product on sale for 4.99 plus 20% of your entire order PLUS free shipping for orders over $25.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much and even a think</li>
            <li> , twenty minutes doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> Works well, but it REALLY clogs the sink.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a real challenge to unclog.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this clay much at all.</li>
            <li> to finally have a cheap product that will salve ALL my problems.</li>
            <li> used it with Bragg&#x27;s Apple Cider Vinegar (which you can also purchase here on Amazon) and used about 4 tsp of each for my whole face, although I think you could get away with 3.</li>
            <li> Fast forward to 2013, I saw &amp; read (through youtube &amp; blogs) about some people doing a mud wash on their scalp to help them get rid of product buildup, dandruff, and psoriasis or to keep the psoriasis at bay for a while.  </li>
            <li> For the price, I absolutely recommend.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really get anything from it.  </li>
            <li> The sulfur mask really felt like it was working my skin.  </li>
            <li> Although I added this as a &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; got get free shipping on my total order, I had tried it before.</li>
            <li> but I think its the apple cider that you use with it that really has the effect.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really need clay to help your skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is all oily in the morning and this helps it sooo much</li>
            <li> I accidentally created a mixture that was too much</li>
            <li> Got my whole family using it.</li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t talk with this stuff on as it hardens when it dries and can stretch the skin if you move too much with it on.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews on here about how it works so well, and I thought I might as well give it a try since I really have nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne since puberty hit (which was a loooong time ago) and nothing has ever really worked.</li>
            <li> Found cheaper at Whole Foods (hence 4 stars), but they were out, so I bought online as a gift for a friend.</li>
            <li> The pores look the same and all it does feel smooth...</li>
            <li> Reading the 3, 2 and 1 star ratings was very illuminating and made me too nervous to use it on her, considering my redness.  </li>
            <li> Reading the 3, 2 and 1 star ratings was very illuminating and made me too nervous to use it on her, considering my redness.  </li>
            <li> U really do feel tightness and ur face pulsing...</li>
            <li> Works really well to help suck up oil from my skin.</li>
            <li> Really clears up the skin.</li>
            <li> There is nothing I can say to express how much this saved my skin.</li>
            <li> people really mixing this with water?  </li>
            <li> Really?  </li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t tell my roommates, and try to get as much of it off before hitting the shower.  </li>
            <li> Bentonite is really great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it really cleans out my pores.  </li>
            <li> and I must say this is a much cleaner and smoother application than using your fingers.</li>
            <li> My face was not bothered at all by the burning-which is a really itchy sensation but my neck and chest were.</li>
            <li> Rub it between your hands and really squish the mixture</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> -it made the process much easier.</li>
            <li> Rub it between your hands and really squish the mixture</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this isn&#x27;t too much of a chore, but</li>
            <li> Consequently, much of this stuff is still lying around my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I like this because it pulls oil from my face very well, without drying it too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I drink this clay every evening before bed it really helps with elimination.</li>
            <li> I used it and it really drew out impurities.  </li>
            <li> It remained very lumpy</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> I can really feel my skin tightening when I use this.  </li>
            <li> that really aren&#x27;t compatable with my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting this skin forever, and it&#x27;s largely in thanks to this product that I have it.</li>
            <li> suggest you use this once or twice a week on your whole face and then however often you need it just on those problem areas.</li>

            <li> I have really oily skin</li>
            <li> I tried mixing it with water and it came out very clumpy even after mixing and mashing thoroughly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has helped my skin so much.</li>
            <li> Yes, very annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You feel your whole face pulsate</li>
            <li> This can prevent scaring from itching bug bites too much which is a quality thing to have in a medicine cabinet too!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;m a straight  guy  </li>
            <li> Really gets out impurities</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> But u really need to follow the instruction cuz theres</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this mask, or whatever you want to call it.</li>
            <li> It really does help draw \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; (ie.</li>
            <li> Then I gently rub, rinse the cloth, and repeat until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it as a \\&quot;maintenance\\&quot; skin care product, because I really do think it does what it says regarding removing gunk from your pores.</li>
            <li> Just use a wet paper towel to remove most of it and then wash off.</li>
            <li> I am really fond of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Activated charcoal makes for an incredible mask on its own, but is quite messy and can be difficult to remove from your skin.  </li>

            <li> I bought this mask from Whole Foods for $6.99.</li>
            <li> Overall i liked this product especially it being so reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> really wish that there were an easier way to use this.</li>
            <li> Yes whole foods even sells it for about 8 dollars.</li>
            <li> So if you cannot wait go to whole foods and buy it or order it off here.</li>
            <li> Thanks amazon for your services.</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful for this product.</li>
            <li> (It really hurts, man).</li>
            <li> haha).</li>
            <li> I really like this as I feel when I use this ( which take a while since I put it on the thicker side)</li>
            <li> it really is drying and cleaning out my skin.</li>
            <li> Better than expected.</li>
            <li> but i did not have any redness and wouldn&#x27;t really mind if I had.  </li>
            <li> It really removes blackheads with ease and calms any signs of acne.</li>
            <li> stop thinking about it and go for it because you really won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic mask especially mixed with apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> I saw all the real benefits.</li>
            <li> I suggest once or twice a week, no matter how much you want to speed things up.</li>
            <li> I really encourage anyone to try it.</li>
            <li> This stuff (as well as a strict skin regimen) is truly responsible for building my self confidence up again.</li>
            <li> So let&#x27;s face it, this stuff looks really hokey.</li>
            <li> Not expecting much, I gave it a whirl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really works.</li>
            <li> Make no mistake, you really feel this stuff contract and pull at your pores, you&#x27;ll literally feel like your face is pulsating.</li>
            <li> However, it is VERY drying.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Ok I&#x27;m going to start off by saying that I&#x27;ve never really had pimple problems...</li>
            <li> I have had oily skin and acne problems my whole life.  </li>
            <li> This really is a miracle product.</li>
            <li> but it really didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s ready to take off</li>
            <li> Nearly every comment was a success story.</li>
            <li> The real shocker was when I applied my make up.</li>
            <li> but i really did not like it.</li>
            <li> We both really like it</li>
            <li> My skin really likes this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the type of person who wants to spend a lot of time on my appearance, so I don&#x27;t use this nearly as much as I probably should to fully benefit from it.</li>
            <li> After about 2 months of using it, it did not do much for me.</li>
            <li> I really wanted it to work for me</li>
            <li> My skin is always left feeling super soft and clean.</li>
            <li> but I really like this product.</li>
            <li> (I have a whole arsenal of oils I use on my skin--olive, pomegranate, rosehip seed oil, grapeseed oil, coconut oil)</li>
            <li> .that&#x27;s when I could really tell the difference.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to fellow reviewers for introducing this to me.&lt;br /&gt;6.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- wipe face gently with cotton ball</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s really because of the apple cider vinegar though.</li>
            <li> Nothing has helped my blackhead issue as much as this clay.</li>
            <li> it just really did help get this stuff out of my pores.</li>
            <li> I open the bag up wide and I lightly scrape off what I can, most of it cracks and falls off into the bag</li>
            <li> everytime i do use it, my skin feels so much softer and much cleaner than an already made clay mask.</li>
            <li> but boy does this really kill zits.</li>
            <li> and it did come off really chipped</li>
            <li> Follow it with a gentle moisturizer.</li>
            <li> So when I use a toner it really shows how much of the clay gets into my skin.  </li>
            <li> It really does the trick.</li>
            <li> You can really feeling it working on your pores as the application dries off.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much for me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if it worked.</li>
            <li> I bought bentonite clay really cheap, like 3lbs of it for a couple bucks, it&#x27;s the same thing as this</li>
            <li> I figured it would really pull out everything from all the reviews I read on line.</li>
            <li> clays will suck absolutely anything out of your pores.</li>
            <li> I do a heaping tablespoon of the powder and a tablespoon of the vinegar then mix it really well, getting rid of all the lumps.</li>
            <li> This mask (when made with the apple cider vinegar, NOT water) really helped my skin.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t seem to get it mixed smoothly.</li>
            <li> For the price though, I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> i really like it.</li>
            <li> You can really feel it working.</li>
            <li> It cleans my skins really well.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the very earthy feel of it.</li>
            <li> REALLY HELPED UNTIL I TURNED 3O.NOW</li>
            <li> I would always make to much.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it it helped with my acne and scars!</li>
            <li> Once I start feeling the mask pulsate (it really does make my face feel</li>
            <li> and at that point you really want it off).  </li>
            <li> The sensation when it was drying was really neat haha.</li>
            <li> Over all, I am content with this product and would absolutely recomment it.</li>
            <li> Very drying, don&#x27;t forget your moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell the difference.</li>
            <li> How much water should I use?</li>
            <li> I just wish the product were sent in a package fully ready to apply.</li>
            <li> I have sooooo much leftover.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> It really does pulsate.  </li>
            <li> Its occurred to me now that it was working all the time, and It just took cumulative progress for me to finally really notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to buy it</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have to wear much makeup anymore</li>
            <li> I actually really do like this product.</li>
            <li> I did notice that if you try to mix it with just water it has a very clumpy consistancy</li>
            <li> I really wanted to see the effect on the problem areas (chin-to-lip area), which is grand.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Not so much changes about the acne.</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin</li>
            <li> Yes, it really pulls on your skin, like it&#x27;s trying to suck your face off (</li>
            <li> Those are the really bigs ones I use this mask for.</li>
            <li> It doesnt do much to the skin, but I guess I will just keep using it.</li>
            <li> It cleaned out my pores very well.</li>
            <li> But if you have problematic skin that is very oily, plagued with whiteheads, etc.</li>
            <li> this might be very helpful for you.  </li>
            <li> Has really helped with my acne.</li>
            <li> As described, fast delivery, looking forward to trying it.</li>
            <li> I keep promising myself I will use it as it was intended, as a face mask.  </li>
            <li> You really feel it when you put it on...</li>
            <li> really worked on my acne prone skin</li>
            <li> There is just too much to wash off.  </li>
            <li> its cheap as hell and will probably last you a year if you use just a teaspoon or so at a time, which is all you need for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried everything to stop acne.</li>
            <li> I also recommend leaving it on for 30 mins and using a moisturizer (I use straight up aloe) afterwards.</li>
            <li> It is also quite gentle.  </li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> But now I will cut a bitch if they even so much as sniff my dirt.</li>
            <li> It really works for my oily skin and it arrived sooner</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t really see the benefits.</li>
            <li> But it really burned my skin</li>
            <li> So fare it didn&#x27;t do much for my skin and didnt help acne.</li>
            <li> You really can feel your face throbbing..</li>
            <li> I dont have to use as much makeup to cover up...</li>
            <li> It will be lumpy if you mix it will water, but surprisingly smooth when mixed with apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even consider the thought until it began to tighten, and I don&#x27;t think I had that much on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried to peel and rub off as much as I could and toss it as to not clog up my drains.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience with clay masks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> I honestly expected more from this...</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> This mask is really intense.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very drying</li>
            <li> This really shrinks the pores.  </li>
            <li> It gets really clumpy/chunky though.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My pores really tightened up after using this and I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> but no biggie there is so much in a container</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t see much improvement on my blackheads.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of problem areas that were very bumpy and nothing seemed to get rid of them.</li>
            <li> ✿✿ ABSOLUTELY</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fast solution.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fast solution.</li>
            <li> My face was pinker , my skin , especially on my upper chest was smooth as silk.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to be the frilly mask that smells like cucumbers and roses - it&#x27;s the real deal.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to find out what it&#x27;ll do if too much of it gets caught up in my pipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If it wouldn&#x27;t look so bizarre to walk around with this mask on, I might just do so to look 10 years younger!</li>
            <li> You can really feel that it&#x27;s working which I like.</li>
            <li> I expected more</li>
            <li> The divine beauty this product brought to my face brought a whole city into turmoil.</li>
            <li> it gives you real (life changing) results.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKS VERY WELL</li>
            <li> VERY DRYING to skin.</li>
            <li> When used as directed, this product really pulls the dirt from your pores.</li>
            <li> and I really can feel my face pulsate like they say on the label.</li>
            <li> this \\&quot;healing\\&quot; clay really lives up to its name.</li>
            <li> : works really well, closes pores, doesn&#x27;t break out my skin, oil control</li>
            <li> really hope this helps my hormonal acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I can keep track of how much I&#x27;m drinking.</li>
            <li> I can control how much sugar I&#x27;m ingesting and to me</li>
            <li> I can control how much sugar I&#x27;m ingesting and to me</li>
            <li> and it was a bit too much for my skin.</li>
            <li> I did not experience redness following my application, I think because of the steam and lightly rubbing my face in a circular motion.</li>
            <li> But I just can not believe how much it cleared up my face.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t think it did much of anything . . .</li>
            <li> Like I said, too much work.</li>
            <li> I put on my acne lotion after, so it gets soaked up really fast.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li> I would mix for 10 minutes but it was still very lumpy.</li>
            <li> This mask works really well to cleanse face tighten pores.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have very acne prone skin</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> For $7.50, I didn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li> , at 20mins I didn&#x27;t really see any changes</li>
            <li> It really helped their faces.</li>
            <li> THANKS FOR THIS</li>
            <li> but the solo cup with a spoon is much easier.  </li>
            <li> Nothing really out of this world</li>
            <li> , I know nothing about it, but it got here fast</li>
            <li> can really feel the tingling sensation, which I like because it means it&#x27;s doing something.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> Now my mother wants to try it.  </li>
            <li> So I try to get as much as I can peel off my face into the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I try to get as much as I can peel off my face into the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will feel the freshness write away and the mask gets really really tigh as it pull Al of the dust and crab from your face</li>
            <li> but it turns out that this mask really does make your skin baby soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use a really think layer, maybe 1/8 of an inch.</li>
            <li> use this clay mask (5) rinse off (it comes off easiest if you use a wash cloth to collect water and splash it on your face just as you would if you were rinsing your face after washing it and using the cloth to gently remove the mask.</li>
            <li> but it makes too much</li>
            <li> First off let me say I have normal skin.</li>
            <li> It is too drying for me, not doing much.  </li>
            <li> I have used this on my skin and in my hair and both ways the products worked very well.</li>
            <li> He has really oily skin and since he shaves his head, the oily skin doesn&#x27;t seem to end until the neck.</li>
            <li> This mask is fun to apply and makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> yes it really does pulsate as its pulling gunk from your face.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it to everyone no matter what skin type!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need the whole scoop to use on face.</li>
            <li> but it does not mix very well...</li>
            <li> It really made a difference to my skin.</li>
            <li> You can tell how much it dries out your skin.....</li>
            <li> Intense, and really tightens.</li>
            <li> I really do see some difference after using this product.  </li>
            <li> This is an intense mask.</li>
            <li> so I figured I didn&#x27;t have much to lose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li> You want to have all skin covered throughout the whole process.</li>
            <li> because I let the shower rinse it off gently</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference with the size of my pores, but I&#x27;ll update my review after a longer time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is really clingy.</li>
            <li> I really feel it pulling all the gunk out of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> and it really worked.</li>
            <li> she tells me i have to try it with her because the stuff really works...</li>
            <li> she was upset that her face was broken out but happy that she had just the product to fix it...</li>
            <li> Have to admit I was very intrigued by this product.</li>
            <li> No matter how much I stirred and adjusted the water/mud ratio I still couldn&#x27;t get the lumps out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (this didn&#x27;t have much of a scent).</li>
            <li> So I say why not go straight to source and just use the real stuff.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this face mask, my husband and I both use it and like that it doesn&#x27;t have any additives or extra chemicals in it, it is just clay.</li>
            <li> Even my husband had pointed out how much cleaner my face is getting.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel like it is too much at all.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast though</li>
            <li> Heck ya, it&#x27;s much cheaper than going to see a doc and take medicine.</li>
            <li> Heck ya, it&#x27;s much cheaper than going to see a doc and take medicine.</li>
            <li> Really tightens</li>
            <li> You really do feel your face pulsating..</li>
            <li> This stuff is promising.</li>
            <li> It also has a very noticeable tightening effect on the skin.</li>
            <li> Cant say how much it helped with acne or scars after 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I am olive complected with very oily, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> and you can really feel it working while it dries.</li>
            <li> Every household should have some at the ready.</li>
            <li> my skin&#x27;s so much happier since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have crator pores thanks to my genetics</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it as a mask, but I don&#x27;t really need to use masks.</li>
            <li> I struggle with acne and very oily skin.</li>
            <li> , my body was very reliant on it.</li>
            <li> with the vinegar it is much smoother on the face.</li>
            <li> I wash with a gentle face wash before applying this.</li>
            <li> It really does make your face pulsate.</li>
            <li> It really does make your face pulsate.</li>
            <li> It really tightens the face and feels like it cleanses the pores.</li>
            <li> Just need to find something for the scars as neither one of these products helps much with that.</li>
            <li> I have not broken out since I started using this stuff two weeks ago</li>
            <li> I really like the cooling effect.</li>
            <li> This product really is the answer.</li>
            <li> After, I use gentle cleanser and</li>
            <li> was expecting much from this product</li>
            <li> I really hope this works.....</li>
            <li> and I have really acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I really did like this mask, I tried it with both vinegar and water but found it a bit drying after using.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to do a whole lot.</li>
            <li> This mask really shrunk her pores.</li>
            <li> You really feel that pulling sensation like your faced</li>
            <li> This has helped my face so much.</li>
            <li> but my skin is so much smoother and even.</li>
            <li> However, VERY EFFECTIVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really do..</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> mask is really a wonder.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s under $5.00, fast shipping</li>
            <li> Once the clay was smooth, I stirred in 1 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil.</li>
            <li> However, if making a mask and figuring out just how much you need</li>
            <li> and when you mix it with water it wont really stick to your face or pulse.</li>
            <li> It is a great secret .</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t see why theres so much hype to it</li>
            <li> This does what it&#x27;s supposed to do- absolutely TONS of clay</li>
            <li> but now I really like it.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t even feel like it does as much as it says it does.</li>
            <li> I Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my skin..</li>
            <li> I noticed my face was literally turning blue/purple and was very puffy.</li>
            <li> I didnt have much acne before I used this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made my skin look and feel much smoother and even-toned.</li>
            <li> That way I don&#x27;t have to use a washcloth which causes too much irritation.</li>
            <li> Really regret it.</li>
            <li> I was very concerned this is a drain clogger.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin...</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li> And it is soooo much product as well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that you had to mix it to make the face mask, but mixing it isn&#x27;t too much of a hassle</li>
            <li> Really like this product</li>
            <li> I guess I don&#x27;t use this as much as I should</li>
            <li> does on the skin it really lets you know that</li>
            <li> /&gt;Incidentally, the tingly and pulsating comments by others is very valid.</li>
            <li> begun mixing a bit of water and 3 tea spoons of clay.mix til its smooth no clumps.mix honey or substitute the water with green tea for a more delicate clean.and remove with warm water only!!let</li>
            <li> so it really depends</li>
            <li> My face gets really oily in this hot-humid season.</li>
            <li> Cleans and shrinks pours very well</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand what the fuss is about.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice, don&#x27;t really see what all the hype is</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this.  </li>
            <li> used it with apple cider vinegar (you can use water if you want) and put it on my very wrecked skin.</li>
            <li> I havent really seen a difference.</li>
            <li> cause Giiiirrrrlllll it does not dissolve very well.</li>
            <li> It really helps with my acne and replenishes my skin.</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because I was hoping it would help with my blackheads that I have literally all over my face, but it didn&#x27;t really seem to do much.</li>
            <li> I use the apple cider vinegar and it really makes a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a miracle worker, but as a part of my skin care regime, it has worked really well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s changed my whole appearance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not quite sure what to think about this clay.</li>
            <li> I used it a handful of times and didn&#x27;t really see any results at all.</li>
            <li> The reviews here about it are very persuasive</li>
            <li> Probably won&#x27;t  use it very often.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Really.</li>
            <li> My cat stared at me the whole while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this purchase!</li>
            <li> and I can say that this mask has really improved the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li> haha..</li>
            <li> but i am okey with it as I think this mask has really added glow to my face.</li>
            <li> My skin felt soft and smooth.. Will definitely be using this product regularly :)</li>
            <li> Really.</li>
            <li> Havn&#x27;t used it for much time</li>
            <li> I was skeptiical of buying skin care products off of Amazon because you don&#x27;t really know what you&#x27;re getting</li>
            <li> Really did shrink my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didnt really see much of a difference</li>
            <li> it really agitated my skin...and it isn&#x27;t eligible for return.  </li>
            <li> its really clumpy.</li>
            <li> - really deep-cleans my pores.</li>
            <li> Your face really does pulsate.</li>
            <li> this stuff helped so much with my breakouts.</li>
            <li> wherever you apply the mask because the pull is SO INTENSE as it hardens.</li>
            <li> I have very problem skin, pores, acne, oily..</li>
            <li> And after rinsing it this time, my skin felt much softer than before when using water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gently towel dry.&lt;br /&gt;8.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions carefully and be sure you consult with your health professionals.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more in the near future thanks again.</li>
            <li> and it really works.  </li>
            <li> Its cheap and last me months too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ve only used it twice so far but my breakouts look tons better,  </li>
            <li> Not only does it mix better than water, its a natural antiseptic, analgesic, and reduces inflammation.</li>
            <li> you probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to handle it more than once or twice a month because it is irritating.  </li>
            <li> you probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to handle it more than once or twice a month because it is irritating.  </li>
            <li> , it was too harsh for my face, when I removed it with a warm towel it scarred my skin.</li>
            <li> Wen I washed it off, my skin didn&#x27;t redden, looked so super clean, and I went to feel my face while it was wet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best kept secret for truly deep cleaning your skin even if you used once a month.</li>
            <li> However, I recently started using this mask regularly and I am thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> You do need to have a good face lotion to use with this, since it kinda sucks everything out of your face...</li>
            <li> Then the warm weather hit and my back acne came back.</li>
            <li> I mix a few tablespoons of clay with milk, water or rose water and plaster it</li>
            <li> After I took it off my face was clear, toned, smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Do not chip off dried pieces, remove with warm water (as the instructions say)</li>
            <li> When you go to wash it off, soak a wash cloth in warm water and place it on your face for a few minutes to loosen the mask.</li>
            <li> The aztec secret is the best clay facial I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I do apply a good amount of it and leave it on for at least 30-40 minutes.</li>
            <li> It seems like this will last months to a year or more depending on how frequently it&#x27;s used.</li>
            <li> This Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay Deep Pore Cleansing is awesome.</li>
            <li> The entire process was pretty cool.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has made my pores smaller, and my acne more manageable, but it hasn&#x27;t completely solved that issue.</li>
            <li> I have recently been trying to find a more natural and organic skin care routine.</li>
            <li> Use with water for more sensitive skin or apple cider vinegar for deep cleansing.  </li>
            <li> I guess I was secretly hoping for some magical effect, but I should have known better.</li>
            <li> Kind of messy though.</li>
            <li> Really love using this product as a facial mask so far.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this product, especially since it is all natural.</li>
            <li> Definitely mix with natural vinegar; it works much better than water.</li>
            <li> Equal parts clay and ACV is a good starting point, but don&#x27;t be afraid to experiment with ratio to get a nice mousse-y consistency, and you really don&#x27;t need more than a teaspoon of clay</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and heard many recommendations online from this specific product.</li>
            <li> it makes your skin soft, smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> This surprised me as I was sure that it was the extra oxygented blood being pulled to the surface that aided in the healing process.</li>
            <li> trendy stuff that she swear the gimmicky stuff is doing somethng.</li>
            <li> After reading all the other reviews I feel confidant they are all true and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> ordered the 1 pound container, and I can honestly say, it will last me an entire year... if not more!&lt;br</li>
            <li> just as good a a thick one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this clay does what it does, but it certainly made my hair react differently that it has to other hair products...and in a good way.</li>
            <li> Sure, everybody&#x27;s skin is different and I&#x27;m usually warry of most products because my skin is super sensitive</li>
            <li> With that said, I used only water for the first 3 times and still love the results: very clear and soft skin.</li>
            <li> I love this, I mix it with some other ingredients to give my skin more \\&quot;food\\&quot; and my skin feel baby soft after, the black head are all clean.</li>
            <li> At an average of $12 a tub, that&#x27;s less than $3 a month for the most effective skincare product I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> And this helped clear up my acne a lot!!!</li>
            <li> my face is clear !!!</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!!!</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> Wish they sold this mixed and ready to use !!!</li>
            <li> The microdermabrasion REALLY improved my right cheek and forehead, and today it&#x27;s quite clear because of it.</li>
            <li> If your skin is drying out too much from it, just moisturize right after, it&#x27;ll leave your skin ridiculously soft.</li>
            <li> If your skin is drying out too much from it, just moisturize right after, it&#x27;ll leave your skin ridiculously soft.</li>
            <li> The first day it made my face super red..</li>
            <li> the first time i tried it i did get scared  because after washing it off my face got super red!</li>
            <li> You aren&#x27;t supposed to leave it on for too long either, it will completely dry up your skin, which isn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li> you can actually SEE it pulse if you look in the mirror - super intense!</li>
            <li> you really do feel the pulsating on your face that it claims and my skin is red for about 20 minutes but other than that nothing but good things from this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It calls for Apple cider vinegar, which is an irritant to the skin, but it also good for you in small doses!</li>
            <li> And it hurt taking this thing off, but it was that good hurt if ha know what I mean.</li>
            <li> These were to be seen on my entire face, but the most powerful effects were on the areas above the eye, you know, those puffy places beneath the eyebrows that begin to droop over your eyelids as you get older.  </li>
            <li> So far, I love this mask and it seems to be working for what I needed, which is to clean out my pours, make them appear smaller and help the overall appearance and texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> At first, I ignored the new pimples because I believe it&#x27;s the purging.</li>
            <li> After the first week of using the product (with ACV), I was observing new pimples on my face, but I persisted with the product anyways after falling for this &amp;#34;initial purging period&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> If you lie down on your clean bedding, or put on your clean clothes you will start the cycle all over again.  </li>
            <li> I let everything fall into the bowl and make sure you dump it outside and not down your drain.</li>
            <li> We mixed it raw apple cider vinegar and it made a nice smooth (and bubbly) paste.</li>
            <li> Use raw unfiltered organic apple cider vinegar and only add just enough to get it into paste form for best results.</li>
            <li> In one instance I used it two times within a week (2 days apart) and on the second time I noticed that I was able to easily remove the black heads on my nose.</li>
            <li> But in the shower last night, while washing my face, I wasn&#x27;t even thinking about having used the mask earlier, and noticed how smooth and clean my pores felt.</li>
            <li> Not much to add to all the other great reviews of this product.</li>
            <li> I have seen success stories on other posts, and for those people that&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> I also used the tip from other reviewers to splash some warm water when removing to soften the clay and use paper towels to wipe them away instead of rinsing directly into the sink.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, but only if you mix with an acidic liquid, in order to balance the ph, since the clay itself is highly alkaline and will destroy the skin if you use with water alone.</li>
            <li> for acne scarring it really doesn&#x27;t do much, in fact it may actually make them more apparent</li>
            <li> for acne scarring it really doesn&#x27;t do much, in fact it may actually make them more apparent</li>
            <li> its first use and my skin is very clear, blackheads is reduced and hope they will disappear at all.</li>
            <li> I really like it, especially for the price you can&#x27;t beat the clean feeling</li>
            <li> It likes to clump up and can easily get messy quick.</li>
            <li> I have acne and this really gives you the deep clean you need.</li>
            <li> It really pulls all impurities to the surface of your skin and allows for a very deep clean.</li>
            <li> it can either be extremely messy or quick and easy; that depends on you.</li>
            <li> The vinegar helps to clear up any bumps/acne since it offers a deeper clean.</li>
            <li> I get those huge, mountain sized pimples that usually take a week or more to completely surface</li>
            <li> This mask  hardens on your face like concrete!</li>
            <li> and I definitely noticed a SIGNIFICANT difference in how oily my face was throughout the day.</li>
            <li> i am not saying they are completely gone, because they are not but definitely smaller then they have been, I also have body acne and have used this on my tush ;) and have seen a huge improvement there as well.</li>
            <li> It has worked better than any other treatment/product he has used.  </li>
            <li> Another friend that has been using a bentonite clay for years told me there are many other uses, so I plan to be experimenting soon.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s normal and goes away!</li>
            <li> The Regimen from Acne.org, and many other acne products you can pick up at Walmart.</li>
            <li> The mask works better than any other mask I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> There are people that have claimed they notice their drains stay more clear(probably partly due to the acidity of the vinegar.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the second day I tried it, I steamed my face first for 7 minutes (something I&#x27;ve done now once a week for 20 years) to open up the pores, added more ACV and waited.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when my facial powder came in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so excited to have finally found something that works!mething that works!</li>
            <li> Nothing changed in my face other than more hurting.</li>
            <li> Mixing was not a problem to me unlike many other reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li> Other products are better.</li>
            <li> (And it&#x27;s not just me, other people have commented how my skin has started looking better too,</li>
            <li> originally bought it for my daughter&#x27;s face and back blemishes.</li>
            <li> I would choose one of the other many pore cleansing options out there..  </li>
            <li> Next time, I put some in a pan on the stove and whisk until it&#x27;s smooth and steaming, then whisk until it&#x27;s cool enough to put on my face.  </li>
            <li> It is much better than any other clay product I have used.</li>
            <li> I tried to reused this, which albeit easier than kitty litter, and it is never quite the same as the original batch.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that for $8 this thing did more to improve my face than what all the other products I have used put together.</li>
            <li> i noticed changes in my skin and also other people throughtout the college and co workers i love it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found many other products that work as well.</li>
            <li> i tried once more, thinking maybe it was just that one time, but once again my face was itching, it wasn&#x27;t a pulsating sensation it was an extreme itching.</li>
            <li> Really love that it doesn&#x27;t have all the additives that other clay masks have.</li>
            <li> First facial left skin a bit red...must have worked:)</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with this is that it dries out your skin significantly.</li>
            <li> This works better than other mud masks I have.</li>
            <li> I got a prescription for Differin gel (which didn&#x27;t work when I was younger, but over the counter treatments don&#x27;t work, so I figured it&#x27;s worth another shot!)</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of the blackheads on my nose like it has for other people, but i think it&#x27;s still a fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I am so excited that this product actually works.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve majorly scaled back to one latte a day and drink mostly water with lemon for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> I have never been so excited about a facial</li>
            <li> Is that normal?!</li>
            <li> The next morning, my child had significant clearing in their skin.  </li>
            <li> Excited to hear back from you.</li>
            <li> it according to the directions I didn&#x27;t find it any more gunky for the sink than any other clay mask that I have used; therefore, I do not see any reason to go through all of the acrobatics to remove the mask that others suggest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love its versatility and I can&#x27;t wait to try it with ACV and other mixes to see what it does</li>
            <li> While my pores are smaller, they aren&#x27;t completely unclogged, though it&#x27;s done an impressive job (especially compared to all the previous products I&#x27;ve tried).</li>
            <li> Even in my low humidity apartment in the middle of winter with the heater making static electricity out of everything, the 20 minute dry time is more like 1 hour and 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend toning with ACV and using an oil free moisturizer if you have similar skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin because I have Seborrheic dermatitis and have not found a product to clean my face without major irritation.  </li>
            <li> it was a mess to clean out of the bowl and it was a chore to wipe clean off my face.  </li>
            <li> After completing radiation therapy and waiting 8 weeks for the full treatment to run its course, I made a giant tub of the clay using vinegar and water until it was smooth and runny, mixed it into a warm bath, grabbed a big bottle of water and rested for as long as I could take it.</li>
            <li> It has limited my clothing choices and has made me insecure when it comes to exposing my back (which is a shame, as I am in great shape and it would be a good asset otherwise).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> The clay keeps your skin clear, and then putting the natural moisturizer on your skin (and using a little of the oil in the clay), has given both of us amazing skin, soft, smooth and</li>
            <li> This product, together with the raw apple vinegar is amazing on the skin.</li>
            <li> I think it works amazingly on my forehead because it is very tight skin.</li>
            <li> kind of like very tight and puffy.</li>
            <li> My hair, on day 7, still looks clean after I last washed it 24 hrs ago.</li>
            <li> In the past I have tried all kinds of washes and been to the dermatologist many times and never had much success.</li>
            <li> It gives your skin a deep clean and helps with anti-aging as well.</li>
            <li> next day, my face was smoother, softer and generally looked better.</li>
            <li> next day, my face was smoother, softer and generally looked better.</li>
            <li> as only clean skin does-as my hands passed over the surface.  </li>
            <li> In the first 7-10 days, my face felt cleaner but did experience a few more breakouts while the skin detoxed...</li>
            <li> I use this mask every couple of weeks, especially on my nose, to clean out and shrink the pores in my skin.  </li>
            <li> It does deep clean and my skin is thankful for it.  </li>
            <li> only reason this is getting 2 stars instead of 1 is because my skin does feel clean after I use it.</li>
            <li> but it left my hair clean without any build up in it.</li>
            <li> Next I will be using it as a face mask to clean out my pores.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After it dries I&#x27;ve been filling up my sink with water and using a wash cloth to clean off the clay, I then smearing the larger chunks around until they break up in to mush</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to deep clean my pores, and shrink pore size.</li>
            <li> make sure to not leave this on too long if you&#x27;ve got sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Not only did it clean my pores, but it brightened my skin...</li>
            <li> clean up is the only crappy part of all this</li>
            <li> and I felt like it helped me deep clean throughly.</li>
            <li> and you end up having to clean the sink or shower to get the &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; out since it is in big chunks.</li>
            <li> so it definitely helped clean and tighten my pores.</li>
            <li> The only mask that makes my skin feel clean.</li>
            <li> This is the only mask that leaves my skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li> The clean up with this is the only reason I cannot give 5 stars.</li>
            <li> and I use this once a week to deep clean.</li>
            <li> , my acne and blackheads looked the same, but my face felt and looked refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> you can use this and actually tell your face is clean.</li>
            <li> I always wash things like masks or scrubs off my face in the shower instead of over the sink, so that I don&#x27;t have to worry about clean up later.  </li>
            <li> It gunked  up my sink and shower , so be prepared to have some extra time to clean your drains out after you use this.</li>
            <li> It also feels really clean which is what I want in a deep cleanser.</li>
            <li> Deep clean</li>
            <li> This product actually lives up to the the results, it causes the face to pulsate as it clean and tightens the skin.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin clear up pretty fast</li>
            <li> I clean the bowl I use to mix it in outside.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I took one star off is that it doesn&#x27;t clean my white heads well.</li>
            <li> BUT needless to say this actually is a great product for people that don&#x27;t wear makeup, or for people that don&#x27;t have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Because my skin tends to be more on the sensitive side, I didn&#x27;t want to take any risk leaving in on for too long.  </li>
            <li> It super tightens your skin, and my pores are noticeably smaller (and I never had large pores, but after using this and noticing the difference it makes, I guess my pores were getting</li>
            <li> It pulls on my skin after a while, but like magic, the next day my skin is very soft and clear.  </li>
            <li> The mixing ratio is an estimate, so I ended up needing to play with a little more vinegar and then a little more clay to get the consistency right.  </li>
            <li> This is a real amazing product with high quality and small spending for facial clear product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20s and had spent my life with occasional pimples but mostly very good skin (albeit fair, dry and very sensitive.)  </li>
            <li> I have tried other masks, but they don&#x27;t seem strong enough, and still left me feeling kind of oily.</li>
            <li> Well, of course it will come off, but make sure your face is down into the bowl, and you will need a washcloth to gently get it off.  </li>
            <li> Well, of course it will come off, but make sure your face is down into the bowl, and you will need a washcloth to gently get it off.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really is great but make sure you don&#x27;t over coat your face because once it dries it will take a lot of scrubbing with a wet rag in order to clean it off, other than that it really tightens up on your skin and makes it extremely soft for at least 12 hours after using it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;I am very much into natural organic health remedies.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tricky to get the right ratio mixed (doesn&#x27;t seem that 1:1 is enough liquid), but it works great</li>
            <li> I have used other brands of healing clay before and love using it for deep cleaning, so when I was offered this Aztec Secret Indian healing clay I gladly accepted it at a promotional price in return for my my honest opinion&lt;</li>
            <li> &amp; kudos for being smart enough to read reviews first ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mask several times now, as well as on my boyfriend, but I haven&#x27;t seen anything special or any improvement.</li>
            <li> This clay mask has helped me a lot with my extra olily skin, specially if you use it with apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> It does smell a little funky, but I definitely got a better texture and smooth feeling afterward on my face.</li>
            <li> my skin is a little sensitive, but it worked out great as a facial mask.</li>
            <li> But I think it makes a lot more if you use less than how much it recommends (1/4-1/2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product feels great and after a few minutes it dry&#x27;s up and forms a mask.</li>
            <li> I tried a few products over the counter and quickly realized it was a huge mistake.</li>
            <li> I can see a real difference without anything on my face :)producing less oil.</li>
            <li> Let dry 10-15 min and remove with facial wipes (the pre-moistened kind).  </li>
            <li> Add some aloe vera juice for moisturize, leave on for a while but don&#x27;t let the clay dry, wash out with warm water then deep condition your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for overall skin tightening but my black heads remain.</li>
            <li> Also to get this off, I have to use warm water and a wash cloth, and slightly soak the clay before it gets soft again.</li>
            <li> I have mild to moderate acne and combination skin, but I can&#x27;t really call this stuff a miracle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a dry powder, which was unexpected but made even better by mixing with apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> It is easy to mix with the ACV and after I wash the mask off it makes my face feel tighter, my pores looks smaller, my skin feels soft.</li>
            <li> Yes, it will be red for a good half hour after you wash it off, but that is no reason to not try this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my skin tone is more evened out, no new breakouts, old acne drying up &amp;</li>
            <li> Tried using it to condition my hair, but I didn&#x27;t really see much difference, since I have very soft hair anyway.</li>
            <li> (like I thought there would be) and the huge pores I have around my nose area were actually diminished considerably!</li>
            <li> I moved a month ago, and the increase in humidity has made my otherwise pretty clear skin a wreck.</li>
            <li> This stuff if used consistently made my skin clear up, like if I was using it every 2 nights or so,</li>
            <li> Even my husband noticed how clear my face was the day after my first time using it.</li>
            <li> once its wet enough it ll slide off easily - Wipe it clean with the paper towel to avoid sink</li>
            <li> Messy..other products available that do just as well but don&#x27;t leave your towels grey.</li>
            <li> Within a couple of hours the color of each bite turned from bright red to a pink color, and the feeling of itchiness completely went away.  </li>
            <li> My face is red for about a half hour afterwards, but then my skin is so clean and smooth!</li>
            <li> I have blackheads and minor blemishes, instantly cleared up the blackheads and this morning my minor blemishes are greatly reduced.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of all the fantastic reviews, but unfortunately I didn&#x27;t have such great results.</li>
            <li> Figured it would be ok as it says you can take mud baths with it, and I normally apply tick layers of other kinds to my skin.</li>
            <li> apparently that&#x27;s what makes this mask so powerful.</li>
            <li> Strongest facial I&#x27;ve ever experienced, good grief.</li>
            <li> The first thing that surprised me was when it said there was no chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American female and this product is good for remove oil and clogged pores.</li>
            <li> But suddenly my acne returned in full force and I was devastated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product and can tell it will last me a long, long time.</li>
            <li> Not sure why this product is do popular.</li>
            <li> My hair had never had the type of curl definition and soft texture it had after my first use.</li>
            <li> I first wash my face with an all natural soap and then i use this mask.</li>
            <li> I bought this clay to see if what I&#x27;ve read about clay masks actually was true.  </li>
            <li> out\\&quot; but last night proved it true.</li>
            <li> The first couple of batches I made were a bit chunky, but I used the smoother parts to apply to my sensitive, combination skin.</li>
            <li> I put it on him and his wrinkle on his forehead nearly completely vanished on the first day.</li>
            <li> I tried other drugstore brand moisturizers and anti-aging creams, and the Bel Essence gives me the best results that last - you don&#x27;t go back to your &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; picture even if you stop for a short time (as if I would).  </li>
            <li> Today I tried it for the first time with Apple cider vinegar and WOW.</li>
            <li> I use about 1/2 spoon full and I have enough for my face.</li>
            <li> My only drawback is that this is messy and kind of clumpy, but it&#x27;s worth it for the clearer skin.</li>
            <li> First off, this product has changed my skin completely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep it short and sweet since my review itself is a novel...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep it short and sweet since my review itself is a novel...</li>
            <li> Even with regular use of twice weekly, my face is still full of blackheads.</li>
            <li> I tried mixing it with water the first time in case my skin would be sensitive to it, and no improvement.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided to switch my routine to all natural products and for the first time in YEARS my skin is clearing up.</li>
            <li> winter break my skin decided to go all out - I became fed up and was not about to go back to school with my face full of acne and blackheads.</li>
            <li> Next I plan to try and make a more natural hair care routine, and then find natural alternatives for deodorant and toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Next I plan to try and make a more natural hair care routine, and then find natural alternatives for deodorant and toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Honestly, still not sure how I feel about this product.  </li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive and Thai has been a struggle for years .</li>
            <li> It definitely helps clear up your skin but the consistency isn&#x27;t great which makes it really messy.  </li>
            <li> I do use essential oils after the mask and I do use full apple cider vinegar to mix the mask.</li>
            <li> i have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Caution, it is an intense mask and will leave your face red after using especially if you leave it on for more than 10-15 min.</li>
            <li> and my skin is also pretty sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Its not worth all that hassle for a face mask to me, and I love DIY facials.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling soft after the first use.</li>
            <li> It is TRUELY a mud facial in a jar!</li>
            <li> so I just got a small cotton towel and put warm water on it and rinsed it that way.</li>
            <li> Such a weird feeling, but I kind of liked the pulsating.</li>
            <li> It definitely felt tight, but it didn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely need to figure out a good way of mixing it tho.</li>
            <li> Your skin may feel uncomfortably tight as the clay dries (good luck making any sort of facial expression)</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to wash off but, the results and skin tightness is wonderful.</li>
            <li> You can literally feel your face pulsing (especially if you mix it with apple cider vinegar, but it&#x27;s best to mix half water and half ACV as it doesn&#x27;t tighten up as much as straight ACV does).  </li>
            <li> I read many of the reviews so I decided to mix my clay with raw Apple cider vinegar, first I placed three tablespoons</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin and this mask has been fine for me when mixed with Apple cider.</li>
            <li> Make sure to follow the instructions, and do not wash down the drain.</li>
            <li> After one use I was able to squeeze out the pus and it went down to 1/3 its size.</li>
            <li> but you just have to remember to make sure none if it goes down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure you buy some sort of filter that will catch the chunks of clay in case you do decide to wash it down the drain.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it will not heal your acne or make you beautiful overnight, it may take TIME to get the results you want, and your expectations have to be REALISTIC.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions used Bragg&#x27;s Apple Cider Vineger and hit the bathroom, at first I got a bit of a tingle and was underwhelmed but quickly changed my mind as it began to dry.  </li>
            <li> My skin was a little red but nothing extreme, and after washing the rest of the mask off I put Vitamin E oil on my face and after 10 minutes my skin was glowing, rosy, and wonderful.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very self conscious about the acne and large pores.</li>
            <li> My skin was bright red and burned a little after removing this stuff.</li>
            <li> In full disclosure, my skin has gotten exponentially better since my teens, but I still break out regularly and have an oily unpredictable complexion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It definitely pulls out any oil you have in your skin, so if you have dry skin or combination skin, I am not sure if this would be the best for you.  </li>
            <li> Your face will be a little red afterwards, just put a good moisturizer on and relax.</li>
            <li> The skin feels tight and very smooth after removing the product.</li>
            <li> and my skin was very smooth and tight after removing the mask.</li>
            <li> Live this face mask!</li>
            <li> you will feel like a new person!</li>
            <li> Made my skin smoother and has stopped new acne from forming on my face!</li>
            <li> I had a new skin complexion!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel brand new!</li>
            <li> It takes everything off your face like you will feel like a brand new person!</li>
            <li> My new beauty staple!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this for anyone who is wanting to lighten some lesser acne scarring (full disclosure:</li>
            <li> When mixed with Apple Cider Vinegar it breaks down easily into a smooth paste.</li>
            <li> but it leaves your skin feeling dry but other then that its really good</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to not use the clay for a couple days then just put a fair amount of water so it doesn&#x27;t dry up due to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every over the counter treatment there is, and I&#x27;ve balked at trying Proactiv or any other really strong product because I don&#x27;t really want to put that on my face.</li>
            <li> (maybe excessive, but I&#x27;ve only seen positive changes, one must experiment) for about two weeks, always followed by a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> (maybe excessive, but I&#x27;ve only seen positive changes, one must experiment) for about two weeks, always followed by a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This clay squeezes out all of the old sewage built up in my deep pores and minimizes those little pot holes, making my skin feel smooth with a nice soft glow.  </li>
            <li> I mean, clothes only look as good as the skin that wears them right?</li>
            <li> omg, it was a whole new product.</li>
            <li> and I have not had any new breakouts, my skin also looks very radiant and glowing</li>
            <li> I was only able to prevent wasting most of it in lumps by using a super tiny whisk and mixing it in a cut-down paper cup, adding a very small amount at a time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll be smooth, clump-free, and although it smells faintly of apple cider, it&#x27;ll feel amazing.</li>
            <li> I got two HUGE soft cyst like pimples one on each temple and the are still there over a week later</li>
            <li> Face felt fine after first use with a slight burn from the moisturizer applied afterward.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and dry out using clay, put a capful of olive oil in with it as well...makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I know, it sounds odd to have to rub that onto your face, but trust me, your skin will love you for it.</li>
            <li> Less is more.</li>
            <li> You might need to use it more or less often.</li>
            <li> I always mix it with apple cider vinegar to a clump free, whipped texture and leave it on until it is all the way dry.  </li>
            <li> Whereas the water mixture was harder to mix, came out clumpy, latched on to my skin and could not be removed as easily.  </li>
            <li> Pores were small and clean and complexion was fresh looking (reddish at first) but it works well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have many black heads</li>
            <li> My pores do look much more refined and blackheads are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Smooth and in the morning my face didn&#x27;t feel dry like it does in the mornings.</li>
            <li> In my case I suffer from black heads more than pimples.</li>
            <li> I am truly satisfied with this product I don&#x27;t understand how any one could give less than 5 stars</li>
            <li> Immediately after I took off the mask, I noticed the black heads on my nose were better.</li>
            <li> Got most of the black heads</li>
            <li> Love it so odd</li>
            <li> and I got much better results with less sit time.</li>
            <li> Less is more with this mask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a few friends to try it and they love it as much as I do</li>
            <li> Second, DO NOT USE ON YOUR ENTIRE FACE more than once a week.</li>
            <li> I have always used face masks since my teenage years, mostly to combat acne as it occasionally flared.</li>
            <li> If you make a decent quantity, its easier.&lt;br /&gt;--Read the directions and follow the directions on usage.</li>
            <li> If you make a decent quantity, its easier.   </li>
            <li> My skin gets shiny by the end of the day, but it normally stays pretty clear.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more in the future when I run out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My last trip to the dermatologist resulted in her telling me I&#x27;m lucky for oily skin...</li>
            <li> I am an older woman and have been having all kinds of problems with my face breaking out.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s the best thing you can do for your face without having to suffer expensive medical costs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better ones from Deep Sea Minerals from Australia and it came pre mixed.</li>
            <li> I particularly like it in my hair.</li>
            <li> I was having problems with clogged pores and was considering going to get a facial at a local spa for more than $100.  </li>
            <li> It felt nice and dried completely after about 25 minutes.  </li>
            <li> The only thing you need to be careful about is not letting it clog up your sink when you rinse it off, I just use a warm washcloth and rub it off chunk by chunk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given it several honest tries, and every time I do</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t think it really did anything besides clean my face and make it dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I gave this simple mask mix a second chance.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t totally eradicate her problem since it was cystic (and that requires more than a simple mask)</li>
            <li> I had some mild cystic acne on my left cheek,</li>
            <li> My advice to anyone reading this review is to have plenty of disposable paper towels on hand, because it is better that it ends up taking you ten minutes pulling it off your face with a bunch of paper towels, and then rinsing the last portions off in the shower, than to try to wash it</li>
            <li> I wet several washcloths in warm water and apply to my face to soften the mask.</li>
            <li> And, yeah, I have the classic &#x27;</li>
            <li> I used it to pull impurities out of the skin on my arms, and it left my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> You will not believe how soft and smooth your skin is after this facial/cream, and your pores are immediately smaller.  </li>
            <li> was super red.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We are definitely looking forward to trying it again and will keep an eye on the &#x27;benefits&#x27; of doing it over a period of time and report back if anything is out of the ordinary.h my face felt more smoother, even-toned and even firmer.  </li>
            <li> After it&#x27;s off, my face is super red since all the blood was being sucked to the surface</li>
            <li> If you mix this with apple cider vinegar it leaves your skin looking vibrant and feeling soft/smooth.</li>
            <li> Cheap, natural and with instant results.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels vibrant afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> It left my skin smooth and soft after just one application.</li>
            <li> I risked it and gave it a try wondering if it would cause more breakouts, but it has only improved my skin and become part of my regimen.how deep they are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not 100% sure it actually was a deep pore cleansing mask</li>
            <li> week later  and face is still  soft and smooth as a  baby&#x27;s bottom.  </li>
            <li> The ancient Indian seceret helps cleanse pores to the core it helps seal them up not all the way since I have big pores but it definitely helps out I love it</li>
            <li> my first try was last week it felt stinging at first</li>
            <li> I definitely can&#x27;t use as a facial more than twice a week, but I don&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li> Luckily after another 3 months, my face finally recovered.</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller, my face is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin and the next day is like a breath of fresh air for my pores.</li>
            <li> I tried tons of different methods and this is the most efficient way I have personally found works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive and yet it does more than more expensive masks.</li>
            <li> If you buy the nose strips, you should switch to this because it works better and this giant jug will probably last for longer than a year.</li>
            <li> I like that a company has conned me to purchasing mud for a decent amount of money.</li>
            <li> I have used so many of the more expensive products out there and</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and forms a solid mask.</li>
            <li> You just have to find out what your particular skin type needs.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly in the summer as a facial mask mixed with the apple cider vinegar when I think that my pores need some tightening after all the heat they endured.</li>
            <li> Definitely contains enough clay for more masks than the packaging claims.  </li>
            <li> Add a few drops of tea tree oil and coconut water and you have the perfect hydrating mask that sucks out all the nasties.</li>
            <li> I mainly purchased this for my enlarged pores--they&#x27;re not craters</li>
            <li> All my life I&#x27;ve had decent skin.</li>
            <li> The older I get</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m older &amp; have sensative skin.</li>
            <li> The next day, more white heads started to surface around my jawline.  </li>
            <li> (I left it on for like 20 minutes the most recent time).</li>
            <li> I think it really does work by pulling impurities to the surface so after 2 or 3 times you&#x27;ll really start to notice how clear your skin is.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t tried it as an face mask yet and that will be my next step as I have mild acne and combination skin with that oily &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; zone.</li>
            <li> I have mild acne and big pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the apple vinegar is totally an acting agent with helping but out of every mask and acne product I have ever used, this is the only thing that has ever shown the fastest results and gotten rid of those mountainous zits in a speedier manner.</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller and my face is clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> ; Still, fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked really well, and while my face was indeed red for about 30 min, that went away and someone actually said I looked tan later in the evening, which is a welcome compliment in the middle of the winter when in reality I was pasty white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different topical products.</li>
            <li> It does burn/tingle a teeny tiny bit so make sure you dont have any open sores.</li>
            <li> I mainly wanted this for my pimples and on times of the month when I break out with cystic acne bumps.</li>
            <li> and I have mild acne, especially on my cheeks and forehead.</li>
            <li> felt refreshed and soft and smooth, and my pores were visibly smaller.</li>
            <li> I started out using a regular kitchen bowl and spoon when mixing it, but was having a lot of trouble getting a good consistency</li>
            <li> I washed it off with warm water and my face was not red at all, it was pink in some areas from me scrubbing to take the clay off.</li>
            <li> You skin gets oily throughout the day and if someone touches your face you will most likely get a zit there the next day.</li>
            <li> I have acne-prone and super oily Asian skin.</li>
            <li> I definitely would use apple cider vinegar instead of water, because its super lumpy when you use water.</li>
            <li> This product dries quickly so you have to rinse well and deep condition.</li>
            <li> I am still very hopeful as its only been a week since I started using, but just for the softness alone its worth it.</li>
            <li> Decent product.</li>
            <li> i mixed it with equal parts of water and ACV and it worked magically.</li>
            <li> My pores are slowly releasing blackheads constantly which is great, but it does make my skin a bit greasier than it used to be now that all the grossness is coming out of my pores.</li>
            <li> I do not know how well it works for that particular issue.  </li>
            <li> mainly cause of the hassle of using this.</li>
            <li> My face was red afterward (as they say it will be), but that redness went away rather quickly.</li>
            <li> tried it several times just to be sure and am only writing this a month after being off of the stuff and realizing it caused a lot of my skin troubles.</li>
            <li> thing is the main reason my skin is clearing up.</li>
            <li> I have had mild acne on my face since middle school (I&#x27;m 24 now)</li>
            <li> I also woke up the next day with my eyelids swollen, which was super</li>
            <li> I use it as the main ingredient in my homemade face masks.</li>
            <li> Seriously I am never using another mask ever again.</li>
            <li> Very easy to mix, I use a 1 cup glass sugar spoon and a wooded butter knife to stir this product with Bragg&#x27;s Raw vinegar.</li>
            <li> I recommend trying it mixed with apple cider vinegar first, and if that&#x27;s too much you can certainly use water.</li>
            <li> It does dry my out a little more than others do, but in regards to my pores or acne, it works just fine.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant as I do have pretty sensitive skin, but I am so glad that I purchased this.</li>
            <li> I can so notice a significant difference with consistent use: less breakouts, and any breakouts that do occur are much smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This feels pretty good on my skin, didn&#x27;t make me break out like a lot of other products do and it also seems to reduce black heads.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that using this clay every other day to start with is very good, if a bit hard on the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Enjoy your day and think positively in the pursuit of clear skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Enjoy your day and think positively in the pursuit of clear skin.</li>
            <li> really useful and make my face clean and tight.</li>
            <li> Really does clear out your pores!</li>
            <li> After using it twice in a row I broke out pretty bad, but its my own  fault because this is meant more for a weekly use anyway.</li>
            <li> This really helps to clear up my skin alot!</li>
            <li> Used this about 2-3 times a week and it has really help clear up my skin!</li>
            <li> I was worried, but then later while it was still drying, it felt like it was giving a relaxation tingle like a mini facial massage, and ,first it felt like bunch of vacuums were sucking out each pore one by one, and it was bizarre.</li>
            <li> But this cheap looking miracle is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that has actually worked CONSTANTLY.</li>
            <li> (I used olive and had soft gorgeous skin afterward, but too much oil is no good for me.)&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li> (I have very old drains/pipes!).</li>
            <li> Works really well for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I just tried this product last night for the first time and it was much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I do love the cool pulsing sensation you get as it starts to dry...makes me feel like its sucking out the impurities in my skin, but after a few weeks of use, I was hoping some specific skin issues I was having would have been cleared up, but they were not.  </li>
            <li> As our skin surface is weakly acid, I think using vinegar to neutralize is good.</li>
            <li> I noticed this really matters when your applying this product because it can cause an opposite effect if you don&#x27;t use it the right way.</li>
            <li> Immediately after rinsing my face is a little red, but it fades quickly into a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> It comes off pretty easily and isn&#x27;t messy, unless you make a wave pool with the water and</li>
            <li> Its pretty powerful and could dry out your skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tingly and tight and it just feels satisfying.</li>
            <li> Your face gets incredibly tight, more than you&#x27;ve ever felt before, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li> It sure gets the gunk out and makes your pores look really tight.</li>
            <li> Talk about a tight fit!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mild astringent that doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like many other astringents</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different skin care products, and I have found very few that make a huge difference on my skin, and this is one of them.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had high expectation for this products.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because of the high reviews.  </li>
            <li> My pimples have decreased by a tremendous amount and leaves my skin feeling clean, smooth, and clear.</li>
            <li> It did make my skin a little red right afterwards (try touching the skin with an ice cube gently) but the color faded after 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I am a real person who has VERY sensitive acne prone skin; I am female, 40, have oily skin and large pores.  </li>
            <li> WOW, This stuff is amazing, and one jar will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> it never fails to make a huge mess all over the bathroom counter</li>
            <li> and it was both aromatic and great for the skin and left my face much less red than just using the clay &amp; vinegar without the EO.</li>
            <li> I also have some uneven texture due to acne scars, and this seems to soften it a great bit.</li>
            <li> Do your own google searches and you will be amazed at the significant weight loss people have been experiencing, cures it has provided for things deemed &#x27;incurable&#x27;, etc.</li>
            <li> but this mask has worked wonders to clear what many other products couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> After a long day of work I&#x27;ll come home and take a hot shower, my face is usually pretty hot and red from work, but a hot shower helps me relax a bit.</li>
            <li> thing I would add is that I was really surprised at the POWERFUL tightening effects of the mask as it dried, so strong</li>
            <li> thing I would add is that I was really surprised at the POWERFUL tightening effects of the mask as it dried, so strong</li>
            <li> I have an oily face, and after using this it has minimized the oil, and leaves my skin very vibrant and soft.  </li>
            <li> but I found re-wetting my face with just water and using a wet wash cloth worked fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay is so pure, safe and effective that it can replace every other mask you&#x27;ve ever used, no matter what the price.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with large pores, old acne scars, and blackheads.</li>
            <li> Some products overpass the test of time because they are pure and natural.</li>
            <li> Yes, these are all oils, but pure, organic, unrefined natural oils that do wonders for the skin.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, do a test patch before applying it to a large area.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working, but I may look in to using a large Tupperware container of bowl to avoid any clogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I a 42, with combo skin, large pores in the t-zone that are a struggle to keep clear.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice, the first time I put too much, trust me less is more.</li>
            <li> I went and had a facial after the wedding, about 3 months later (using it 1x a week to maintain) and the girl doing my facial was blown away at how good my skin looked, literally no black heads to extract except that part just under your nose where you cant put the mask (hello vinegar).</li>
            <li> have also started putting it on the top of my hands for dark spots and see results already!  </li>
            <li> usually leave the mask on for 30-45 minutes, which is a bit longer than what the packaging recommends, but my skin is, like I said, extremely oily, way more oily than most people who complain of oily skin, so my circumstances call for &#x27;stronger&#x27; skin care measures, if you will.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so surprised I&#x27;ve never heard of it before and that it was so affordable!!</li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> :)lved, then ran the tap a little longer to ensure no clay chunks were latching themselves in my s-pipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> like an inactive zit) that needed to &amp;#34;purge.&amp;#34; There&#x27;s a difference between your skin getting rid of these little comedones and having a reaction to a product, so make sure you watch and know which one it</li>
            <li> just make sure you have a little scooper, and bowl to mix.</li>
            <li> So far I like it, my face was pulsing!!</li>
            <li> but wow! Must have !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too soon to tell, but I love the pulsing effect this gives off</li>
            <li> My skin looks a little better and feels a little better already.  </li>
            <li> I ended up putting a little bit more water anyways.</li>
            <li> Tried again and was a little better.</li>
            <li> I did feel the tingles and a little itchy, not pulsate for sure</li>
            <li> note I have been trying proactiv, and that stuff has not been helping on my face, if you have been using it more than 30 days and your face has not been healing  just a little bit,</li>
            <li> I noticed the size my pore smaller the first time I used it!</li>
            <li> and if i do its just a couple at most little zits.</li>
            <li> I also still have the little pimple thingy on my forehead but a bit better than before.</li>
            <li> I found the mixing portions to be a little off and ended up adding more water than suggested.</li>
            <li> After rinsing my face is glowing the next day and looks so clean and clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne and decent sized pores and uneven skin tone for most of my life.</li>
            <li> It is a bit messy to clean up but worth it.</li>
            <li> Every mask that sephora offers to deep clean the pores, has clay in it.</li>
            <li> You start to feel it dry fairly quick, but after about 10 minutes, your whole face feels pulsating.</li>
            <li> and you will have super tight, clean, clear skin.</li>
            <li> was by far the most intense mask I&#x27;ve ever had, in terms of how tight my face got.</li>
            <li> This mask works better than other much more expensive ones and you get a huge amount that will take years to go through.</li>
            <li> My acne did get worse after the first few days, but it&#x27;s getting progressively better and better!</li>
            <li> This product would have been amazing if it wasnt so hard to get off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of hard to remove when you&#x27;re finished.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of hard to mix together.</li>
            <li> It was kind of hard to wash off</li>
            <li> Afterwards, you can put a few drops of pure lavender essential oil on a warm damp washcloth and use as a compress.</li>
            <li> face was nice and smooth and it seemed to clear some of the previously noticeable black heads around my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Preparation and cleanup is a little messy, and the smell isn&#x27;t great, but this product is very clarifying and purifies your skin.</li>
            <li> Normally I wake up with a nice layer of grease on my face, but there was hardly any grossness to my face that morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s very hard for companies to sell me onto something new if I&#x27;ve found something I&#x27;ve really loved.</li>
            <li> She couldn&#x27;t believe it either, but that zit not only went almost completely away after she washed it off, but her skin looked so great after that she used hardly any foundation</li>
            <li> It does get super tight on your face but that&#x27;s the fun in it for my daughter and myself.</li>
            <li> No pimples, nice tight pores, not oily and not dry..</li>
            <li> You can take plain (NOT flavored/sugared pouches) oatmeal and run it through your food processor until pretty fine.  </li>
            <li> You can take plain (NOT flavored/sugared pouches) oatmeal and run it through your food processor until pretty fine.  </li>
            <li> Meaning that it doesn’t smell wonderful like a perfume, but the smell isn’t bad and take away from the awesomeness of this product.</li>
            <li> I really think if your skin is sensitive like mine</li>
            <li> I really think if your skin is sensitive like mine</li>
            <li> It is a really weird feeling, but you know it is working great.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive oily acne prone skin I have tried absolutely everything for my acne</li>
            <li> As far as acne goes, I don&#x27;t think this product does a whole lot</li>
            <li> Just a warning though, it can be like concrete when it dries, so</li>
            <li> , I have sensitive and very oily skin(face) and to my surprise</li>
            <li> , I just wet my hands and slowly using circular motions re-moisten the clay all the while rubbing gently and greatly reducing the clog factor as the slower method</li>
            <li> After reading all the hype about this mask all over the web, I had to try it, so I ran out to Whole Foods early in the morning to get my hands on a tub of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I ended up using it on my body, as it really does make your skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> PocketDerm is all I really rely on now to keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li> It really makes my face soft and reduces the pores.</li>
            <li> gonna lay it on the line about the whole acne thing, I&#x27;m 30 yrs old</li>
            <li> This clay really helps define the natural curl pattern of my hair and cleanses my hair as well.</li>
            <li> I use it in combination alternating between this and a moisturizing mask because it can be very drying to your skin if used too frequently.</li>
            <li> did use this with several different liquids, and I can say that all are amazing, and after 3 months of 1-3 times/week use, my complexion is noticeably clearer and my pores are smaller.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s all too much ,just to clear your pores.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, I had hoped I found a great pore cleanser, but I would not recommend this product to others...</li>
            <li> If you wait until the mask is fully dry, the mask wil cleanly peel off with the gauze.  </li>
            <li> I have adult acne and this has really helped when all kinds of prescription meds did nothing.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it too often, because my skin feels squeaky clean and dry afterwards...</li>
            <li> I has really helped to clear up my skin and made by skin glow.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really help as far as my acne goes.</li>
            <li> Real classy like.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then peel, wipe wash, clean, dry, moisturize, repeat?</li>
            <li> Then peel, wipe wash, clean, dry, moisturize, repeat?</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling absolutely baby soft.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone, extremely sensitive skin and really like it.  </li>
            <li> Made my skin soft, but didn&#x27;t really see an improvement for my acne</li>
            <li> It really made my face red and kind dried it out.</li>
            <li> I really like that it’s a natural product and can help me limit the chemicals that I use to fight the signs of aging.</li>
            <li> My blemishes clear up much quicker compared to when I do not use it.</li>
            <li> I may grade upward after a few more times but will not use this product more often than a few times a month.</li>
            <li> and you can really feel the natural mud cleansing all of the impurities from your skin.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised it came fast in the mail.</li>
            <li> Sure I look like a green monster every time I use it, but wow this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> But i really have seen a difference in my skin tone and it leaves my skin feeling so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> It works really well and has helped clear my son&#x27;s skin.  </li>
            <li> Really gets toxins out of skin, I notice my skin is clear and firmer</li>
            <li> I really wanted this help clear my pores</li>
            <li> I have been FIGHTING with my skin so much as a 27 year old woman.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel happy afterwards either, because it was difficult to rinse it</li>
            <li> The product works great, but it&#x27;s difficult to remove and keep from clogging the drain...</li>
            <li> but this was too much for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My hair is baby soft and retains so much moisture after washing with the clay.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily, sensitive, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> It sets up like concrete and it may clog your pipes.  </li>
            <li> The pull is so intense when it hardens completely.</li>
            <li> This is all normal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s waaaay too harsh to use more than once a week.</li>
            <li> but that is said in the instructions that it&#x27;s a normal result.</li>
            <li> but that is said in the instructions that it&#x27;s a normal result.</li>
            <li> I tried to get most of the dried on mask in the trash so it wouldn&#x27;t clog my drain</li>
            <li> I will update in a few weeks to see if I notice any magical results.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff kinda messy but</li>
            <li> but i sure had the sweating, tingling and a bit of tightening as the mask dried up which makes sense to</li>
            <li> , i pretty much believe this product is similar to it and hence is doing its work.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The shedding has lessened in just a few weeks and my curls are more defined.</li>
            <li> and I felt like my skin was greasier than normal,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally use either, and it was probably just my skin flaring up from the introduction of unfamiliar chemicals.</li>
            <li> when I finally went to wash it off my face, I had to laugh because it made my nose look like &#x27;Miss Piggy&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I washed the mask off my face and followed my normal face cleansing routine.</li>
            <li> but it is not my favorite since it is a bit messy.</li>
            <li> will give it a month and a few more masks and see how I feel about it.</li>
            <li> I normally just dampen it with some water again</li>
            <li> mixed it w/Braggs ACV rinsed after about 15 min and reapplied to freshly opened pores.</li>
            <li> I mixed up WAY too much the first time I used it</li>
            <li> My skin has a normal amount of sensitivity.</li>
            <li> But what I did is I made it into a cream, which saves you more clay powder and makes the product last REALLY long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfectly normal as the bacteria is flushing from your skin.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know that is normal reaction or</li>
            <li> I have read that&#x27;s normal for your skin to breakout</li>
            <li> I then rub it off with hot water and a wash cloth and after I use bare minerals moisturizer.</li>
            <li> &quot; daily (juice fresh carrots, parsley, apples, ginger root, lemons, and celery)So, combined with the clay regimen</li>
            <li> Well worth the money, will buy the 2 pound next time.</li>
            <li> The tiny pimples are pretty much everywhere on my face.</li>
            <li> I will use this a few more times &amp; update after.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to everyone with problem or even normal skin.</li>
            <li> I plan on applying it on again in a few more days after the redness goes away.</li>
            <li> I waited a few weeks before writing this review to make sure it continued to work.  </li>
            <li> and then a normal application in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it dried it out even more.</li>
            <li> I just know I&#x27;m not going to a club with green armpits in a sleeveless top.</li>
            <li> but once I got past that second week my skin started looking really good and clearing up</li>
            <li> normal cause</li>
            <li> It really makes your face pulse when it is on and the FIRST time I actually saw the blackhead come out of my cheek.</li>
            <li> Acne is normal, it&#x27;s everywhere.</li>
            <li> This is such an exciting product.</li>
            <li> This is such an exciting product.</li>
            <li> My skin is typically normal with no break-outs.</li>
            <li> and I just wash my face with the normal cleanser at night, witch hazel toner in the morning and use the mask twice a week.  </li>
            <li> I will warn you that this mask is powerful, it definitely tightens and pulsates.</li>
            <li> Too messy an application for me to love.</li>
            <li> The first week I only used water and it didn&#x27;t mix well very clumpy</li>
            <li> This thing took everything out and made my pores look normal and</li>
            <li> This size tub is lasting me for ever, it&#x27;s worth every penny</li>
            <li> which is completely normal -</li>
            <li> This has hindered me from wearing swim suits, backless dresses, cute tank tops, etc.</li>
            <li> I will indeed finish the rest of this mask until it expires because I don&#x27;t want my money to go to waste however, anyone who is thinking of buying this you would be better off doing a DIY mask.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with apple cider vinegar and this stuff reallly tightened up, I could barely smile.</li>
            <li> Totally normal.  </li>
            <li> but I read that that&#x27;s normal</li>
            <li> I love this mask, not to harsh.</li>
            <li> Only been using it for a few days, and so far so good.</li>
            <li> And if I stop use and just use my normal soap, my face clears.</li>
            <li> But as it dried more, I feel it sucking my face, and I sat there laughing inside</li>
            <li> Sucks everything out and leaves your skin nice and silky.</li>
            <li> I think with another few treatments I&#x27;ll probably see even better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll do it a few more times and then do a follow-up review if I have anything else to add.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin and have never had problems with pimples, except for the one or two popping up before my period.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;pulsating\\&quot; sensation can be a bit irritating, but once you wash off the mask and feel how smooth &amp; soft your skin is and see how youthful &amp; radiant it looks, you know that sensation is the mask working its magic.</li>
            <li> but it is actually a lot of fun to me.</li>
            <li> but it is actually a lot of fun to me.</li>
            <li> but well worth the extra effort</li>
            <li> Just make sure you have a heavy duty moisturizer to use after.</li>
            <li> where I normally breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally believe all the reviews but</li>
            <li> Purchased for a friend who has not complained about it.</li>
            <li> This is normal but plan accordingly if you&#x27;re going out after.</li>
            <li> Once the mask had fully dried and gotten all crackled like it does, I was able to peel a few flakes off and see even more blackheads on the underside of the mask flake.</li>
            <li> Is that normal?</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> I am an African American, 21 year old woman with more acne scars than acne</li>
            <li> always laugh when I read the back of the bottle, though: &amp;</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s on, you will feel your face &amp;#34;pulse.&amp;#34; Don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much creating an electric current when it&#x27;s introduced to liquid.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll have to try it a few more times to see if it lives up to the hype of improving your complexion (some review claim a drastic difference after just 3 uses).</li>
            <li> its normal.</li>
            <li> i like to take long showers so after 10 more min there is almost no mud left in the shower.</li>
            <li> No wonder so many people reported that their skin really dried out with this.</li>
            <li> (this is longer then normal, but the longer I want, the softer my skin is afterwards).  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know if it was normal or not.</li>
            <li> , I leave it on until it fully dries which is normally 45+</li>
            <li> I mixed way too much to do my face the first time.</li>
            <li> My skin type has gone from oily, to dry/peely (when I tried using benzoyl peroxide), but it&#x27;s fairly normal now.</li>
            <li> Pretty thick clay.. will bring all impurities out, as it did for me, almost through my retinol away, but then I thought NO WAY, to many uses with retinol.</li>
            <li> but that is normal for a clay mask</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a rare breed of mutt, a lot of my heritage is African</li>
            <li> I use it once a week in place of my normal cleanser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman of color with normal skin if this helps anyone</li>
            <li> This is the only one worth it.</li>
            <li> But after reading that this is normal, I kept using it.</li>
            <li> Maybe a few times more should have effect.</li>
            <li> Still worth a try though, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Aztec Secret is a really good product.</li>
            <li> I mix mine with apple cider vinegar (since it also has its own cleansing properties) and it gives the clay the texture of a thick mousse and easier to work with than if you just use water.</li>
            <li> A slow but effective ninja.</li>
            <li> A slow but effective ninja.</li>
            <li> Good results, not great.</li>
            <li> nothing Secret here, buy a good scrub instead.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strange feeling, but not a bad one.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling very clean and tight.</li>
            <li> so now I use it a little less.... but still think it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Really tightens pores and makes your face or other areas feel clean and tightened.  </li>
            <li> far, I&#x27;ve seen my face feeling tighter, less acne, smaller pores, and just overall feeling great.</li>
            <li> I have also started taking it internally and feel more mental clarity and more hours in the day of energy, less need for sleep.</li>
            <li> Also it left my arms, definitely the next day, super smooth.</li>
            <li> I thought they looked smaller after the first use, but it was so slight that I wasn&#x27;t completely sure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard to take off</li>
            <li> I used it on myself and several other people , who all have different skin types,-oily, sensitive, aged skin, and the results were great!</li>
            <li> I had so many black heads on my nose and look !</li>
            <li> I loved it so much, i made the mistake of using it too often and got a small dry patch.</li>
            <li> Was weird at first and is weird when it is all bubbly and even more when it dries (feels like your face is tighter than everrrrrrrr) but it worked great and my face was SO clean and SO clear.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, highly reactive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin was a little red, but felt clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> 13 minutes have passed and there was no irritation or allergic reaction and it left my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to escape acne as a teenager, but now that I am in my early 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> only time I ever had clear skin was when i was pregnant...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always wishing it was super clear especially since I&#x27;m not longer in my teens.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive and reactive skin, with eczema especially on my hands.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and strongly recommend though it&#x27;s not for the faint of heart.</li>
            <li> IF you have dry skin do NOT keep it on for more than ten minutes.</li>
            <li> This clay mixed with apple cider vinegar gives an extra kick and foams up for an easy, mousse-like application.</li>
            <li> for me personally it made my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> I recently turned 21, but for nearly 2 years I have struggled with mild acne.</li>
            <li> I mix equal parts clay and vinegar and leave it on until most of it is dry.</li>
            <li> This will probably be hit or miss with a lot of people just because it can be super irritating to your skin, but for under $10, I don&#x27;t think it would break the bank for most people.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend applying an oil-free acne moisturizer after washing off the mask and not following washing off the mask with washing with any strong acne cleanser (clearisil, proactiv, etc.)</li>
            <li> I suffer from mild breakouts but what was even more frustrating for me</li>
            <li> Part apple cider vinegar and part clay is all it takes for amazing skin, unbelievable!</li>
            <li> my pores would probably return to their original size but at least I have found something that gives me noticable results that last for more than one day at a time.  </li>
            <li> my pores would probably return to their original size but at least I have found something that gives me noticable results that last for more than one day at a time.  </li>
            <li> I was immediately turned off by the fact that when I opened the jar this product did not come with a protective cover that cosmetic items normally have when they are brand new.</li>
            <li> 2 tsp Plain yogurt - More moisture needed</li>
            <li> Receive the product promptly and use it right after the same day received at that night.</li>
            <li> Right around the time when you think you regular cleanser isn&#x27;t working for you any longer</li>
            <li> The only thing is trying to find a right balance between powder and water</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect totally miraculous results right away.</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t complain because the price is right in my area when it comes to facial products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s chunky and gross and it doesn&#x27;t go on your skin right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a trial and error to get the process right</li>
            <li> Right now, my face is continuously at a Moderate level 2.</li>
            <li> After I stopped the microdermabrasion sessions, again my breakouts started coming back (even on the right side and forehead).</li>
            <li> I had an extraction facial right after i used this mask</li>
            <li> I had a deep cystic blemish from using Oil of Olay, and the mask brought it right to the surface.</li>
            <li> I just rinse right away when it burns, doesn&#x27;t leave a mark, nor lasting pain.</li>
            <li> I believe it works better than the plain water.</li>
            <li> The second time I used it was right when the spots started showing up.</li>
            <li> very good aztec secret indian !!</li>
            <li> Make sure to get the raw apple cider vinegar to go with it, makes a big difference and its worth it as well.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin and acne, use Sweet Almond Oil, or Avocado Oil, to mix it...and just leave it on for the 10 minutes, no longer.  </li>
            <li> is becoming less oily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to wash off and that takes more time.</li>
            <li> It was SUPER itchy on me, and I wore it as long as I could stand it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> nice but big mess after</li>
            <li> This particular brand seems to be a bit more harsh, and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It adds a cool, tingly, freshening sensation while I&#x27;m waiting for the mask to dry.</li>
            <li> Ok so I tried this and at first I was a little taken back by the smell of it and sizzle noise when I added the vinegar</li>
            <li> It feels amazing on my skin and when washed off, my skin feels tight and refreshed and my pores are smaller.  </li>
            <li> After that I have huge pimples from eating too much junk, so I reluctantly use this product once every week without complaining how stink and tight it is.</li>
            <li> the clay is very messy and has a drying effect, I would suggest using a glove to apply, it works best with a tight medical glove.</li>
            <li> the clay is very messy and has a drying effect, I would suggest using a glove to apply, it works best with a tight medical glove.</li>
            <li> I found the product to be very hard to use, you need to create the clay yourself, i bought it because the reviews were great, but i do not like the entire process.</li>
            <li> When my face had dried completely, I applied a few drops of Kiehls Midnight Recovery Concentrate and when I woke up the next day, my complexion was absolutely flawless and glowing!</li>
            <li> I have very large pores and can pick at them daily.</li>
            <li> This seems like a fine simple American product.</li>
            <li> Rinse off (in a basin, not down the drain) and you can gently extract.</li>
            <li> I heard that if you wash everything down the drain, you can easily clog your sink.</li>
            <li> I am the type of person who does not like to spend a ridiculous amount of money on beauty products and I find most masks and things like that, you are paying for the brand and the pretty label.</li>
            <li> Leaves face red but only overnight it&#x27;s fine in the morning.</li>
            <li> The price is right and it doesn&#x27;t take much at all for a single use.</li>
            <li> When I took it off of my face (I usually pull off the big chunks and then use a warm wash rag to gently remove the rest)</li>
            <li> This is a miraculous product and so cheap compared to all the other treatments I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> You need to use it religiously and don&#x27;t stop when you see your skin pushing out a few more blemishes in the first week or two.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few weeks since my first review and my results have only gotten better.  </li>
            <li> I AM SO CURIOUS ABOUT OTHERS&#x27; success stories from this product!</li>
            <li> I AM SO CURIOUS ABOUT OTHERS&#x27; success stories from this product!</li>
            <li> The instructions say that this is normal, however the next day I really did not notice that much of an improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> It gets a little messy and takes a bit of work preparing, but its great.</li>
            <li> It was a little messy, but otherwise a great product.</li>
            <li> I first mixed it with green tea, and it was okay.</li>
            <li> Also, the first few times you use this, your face will turn red and you will get even more breakouts.</li>
            <li> but after I take the stuff off then my face turns red, and heats up, &amp; kind of gives me a headache for a little while.</li>
            <li> After I washed off my skin was feeling warm and a little red.</li>
            <li> Perhaps she has more sensitive skin and with such minor blemishes doesn&#x27;t need a product like this.  </li>
            <li> Now here&#x27;s the shower part - if you try to wash this off in the sink like any other masque - be aware it does not just rinse right off.  </li>
            <li> I am hooked, and I hope it works for you if you decide to try it.re&#x27;s the shower part - if you try to wash this off in the sink like any other masque - be aware it does not just rinse right off.  </li>
            <li> Once I dried off I must say my face doesn&#x27;t feel dry, it actually feels pretty good.</li>
            <li> Every time I use this I find a new pimple on my face</li>
            <li> to dry/chap with New England winters.</li>
            <li> I cannot express how mug I live this stuff</li>
            <li> I still have scars, but preventing new acne to make new scars will help the healing process.  </li>
            <li> If you are reading this and live in NJ....</li>
            <li> My foot felt brand new.</li>
            <li> All of my blackheads are gone as well as the newly formed pimples.</li>
            <li> I have to be using a new makeup.  </li>
            <li> I have to be using a new makeup.  </li>
            <li> Still giving it a chance to live up to it reviews.</li>

            <li> im a new person now</li>
            <li> skin feels renewed (TOTALLY NEW SKIN!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My new favourite mask</li>
            <li> /&gt;The KonjacSponges are a new addition to my routine.</li>
            <li> Sponges are a new addition to my routine.</li>
            <li> I then apply acnedot spot treatment from Alba which is a new product..</li>
            <li> I received a new mosquito bite --</li>
            <li> Bought it on a whim after getting a severe breakout from a new supplement ive been taking for an bum shoulder.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this mask.</li>
            <li> so you may notice new pimple growth afterward</li>
            <li> And by then, new acne has shown up - ah, what a pain.</li>
            <li> This has become a new holy grail product for me, I will be buying this again when I run out, if I ever run out this is a lot of product.</li>
            <li> My face literally felt brand new.</li>
            <li> After taking off the mask it felt like I had a new face.</li>
            <li> My skin is like new again.</li>
            <li> My skin soaks up the moisturizer like a champ and looks brand new post-treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin soaks up the moisturizer like a champ and looks brand new post-treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s from the clay or a combination of all the new products, but I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> I bought this just to try out a new mask</li>
            <li> Truly live changing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that, I really do believe it has helped with my acne tremendously.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe because it&#x27;s so reasonably priced compared to most skin care masks</li>
            <li> , if you are doing this with a friend you will not be able to talk while doing the face mask, it really tightens up your pores and makes it hard to move your face.</li>
            <li> Super hard to clean though unless I just clog up all my drains.</li>
            <li> After applying it for a few more days after my skin would get a little red in areas that are kind of sensitive</li>
            <li> After using it for the first time I immediately noticed that my pores looked smaller and my skin was so soft!!</li>
            <li> thank you guy with the super long review!</li>
            <li> My skin was not especially soft or smooth, but it definitely feels clean and not overly dry.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s face definitely looked brighter from the beginning but that might have been due to lack of even washing her face on a regular basis but she liked it&#x27;s effect and wants to do it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s face definitely looked brighter from the beginning but that might have been due to lack of even washing her face on a regular basis but she liked it&#x27;s effect and wants to do it again.  </li>
            <li> I feel like leaving a positive review for this stuff at this point is overkill--but I bought this clay a little over a month ago, and I&#x27;m so in love with it, I actually wanted to spend 4 minutes out of my day to write a review.</li>
            <li> but I think it would&#x27;ve worked even better if I had used the raw, full-strength stuff.</li>
            <li> Make sure to use the raw apple cider vinager.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re using it with the Bragg&#x27;s raw apple cider 50% of the time for greater results.</li>
            <li> I love that the recipe requires to mix it with raw apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> Make sure you purchase raw apple cidar vinager to mix with it.</li>
            <li> Use the raw apple cider vinegar though cause it&#x27;s way better.</li>
            <li> holy cow, this stuff is on my face for the first time right now</li>
            <li> As it drys your face does pulsate and it makes your face feel like its getting very tight which I love.</li>
            <li> It was red for 30 mins after I washed it off but the difference in pore size and skin clarity made such a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> When I rinsed it off my skin was red, but not super bright red.</li>
            <li> I wish this would be easier and worked for me because I do need something that will clean my skin minus the side effects.</li>
            <li> Was fun to use, I&#x27;m not very observant about whether it worked or not, because I have very discrete acne.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave it on any longer than the 15-20 minutes recommended since it can be kind of intense and irritating though.</li>
            <li> When I initially mixed the mask up, it puffed up some of the dry clay into the air and started fizzing, which kind of scared me actually, because I hadn&#x27;t read anything that said that it would react like that.  </li>
            <li> This mask works to cleanse &amp; possibly helps with maintaining an acne free complexion if used regularly but all the sensations that you might feel is just the mask drying up.</li>
            <li> Mainly because I have sensitive, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not only a relaxing facial, but it will smooth your skin and help remove any blemishes while doing</li>
            <li> I recommend moisturizing after every use because this will make your skin feel super dry.</li>
            <li> Used ONCE by far, really at a loss for words, WOW....</li>
            <li> Now that I am over that 2 week hump, my skin is clear and I feel that the scars I have from older blemishes are lightening.  </li>
            <li> My whole face would be very red after removing the mask, even when I was gentle with the removal.</li>
            <li> but overall I have not seen much improvement or much of a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I put a lot of vitamin C serum on but it was super dry.  </li>
            <li> I think you should definitely try this out, and for the price, you really have nothing to lose., and for the price, you really have nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> I have to make sure to moisturize my face after with lotion as this does dry my face out, but it definitely makes my face BABY soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing absolutely no makeup for about a year now, but finally feel confident without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once dried, I simply use a washcloth and warm water to scrub it off with.</li>
            <li> I used to use this a few years back, and I remember loving it.</li>
            <li> I tried scrubs but none that I have tried have ever been really effective at removing the dead skin flakes, it seems to only make it worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a decent mask but clearly overhyped</li>
            <li> only issue is that it&#x27;s kind of a pain to get off of your face because it&#x27;s literally dried mud</li>
            <li> I still break out, but not as much as I used to, and they don&#x27;t last as much anymore.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so smooth, air brushed, smaller pored, hydrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it to my cousin who has more resilient skin than I do in hopes it will work wonders for her, but for my sensitive skin, it&#x27;s just too harsh and leaves it feeling like it went through a war zone.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother if you have sensitive skin, or already decent skin.</li>
            <li> I liked the product, but I don&#x27;t think it made a lasting impact on my skin even with a few uses.</li>
            <li> By a mile it is better than all the expensive products that are available.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I am fortunate to only get the occasional pimple</li>
            <li> Mixed with water helped alleviate some of the dryness but not enough to comfortably continue using this product.  </li>
            <li> This mask 1) really helps to clear up my breakouts 2) hasn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive skin 3)</li>
            <li> A good base for most mask recipes.</li>
            <li> After rinsing I put on a small dab of pure 100 percent jojoba oil to moisturizer while I sleep ( go easy on it)</li>
            <li> Made my face a little red after first washing it off but it made it so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other masks before but this stuff is very, very powerful.</li>
            <li> The clay mask cleans out my impurities, leaves my skin very soft and I now have skin that I am comfortable enough to walk out the door with without wearing make up (this is a big deal for anyone working with make up ;</li>
            <li> first it was a little too painful but its soo worth it after you rinse it off :D</li>
            <li> If I had a HUGE problem with acne, I would continue to use this product and probably get decent results, but for someone who just wants a weekly deep cleanse, I would highly suggest the Queen Helene Masque or the (more expensive but</li>
            <li> /&gt;Exfoliation is usually too harsh for my sensitive fair skin, but this seems to have given me the benefit of exfoliation with no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed!  </li>
            <li> and I can really see a major change.</li>
            <li> is a little hard to mix to a smooth consistency but is makes my skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li> , you feel the pulsation of your skin, the instructions are very clear on how to apply and take off the product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any irritation, but noticed some reviewers saying that it caused irritation, so it may cause irritation for people with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin &amp; this is non-irritating.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you want to care for your skin into old ago.</li>
            <li> The transport is very fast and quite a big bottle.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, but if you do have sensitive skin I wouldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling very soft</li>
            <li> It is very masculine</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin with some cystic acne.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel very soft after I moisturize.</li>
            <li> Not for very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the miracle mask i was hoping, perhaps because my skin is very sensitive and not oily.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive face</li>
            <li> My skin felt very soft after using this.</li>

            <li> I was VERY surprised when I put the Indian Healing Clay on.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I also use it in my hair and it makes it very soft and helps detox my scalp.  </li>

            <li> The clay made my hair very soft.</li>

            <li> very early (4am) for work</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I diluted the apple cider vinegar with water.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone seeking clear skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive acne prone skin with scarring and have seen improvement since using this product.</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My son and I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> it make my skin very soft and bright.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it makes your skin very soft and reduces the pores.</li>
            <li> I guess my face is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> No, but it gave me nice fresh skin, calmed some redness and preformed as well, if not better, than products that are much, much more expensive.</li>
            <li> It says in the description that your skin will be red and look slightly irritated right after the mask, BUT when you wake up in the morning, your skin will me smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li> Its easy to apply and hop to shower so to avoid mess in sink</li>
            <li> I bent into the sink and turned on very warm water and started slowly washing my face, no rubbing just gently moving the water over the mask until it started &#x27;melting&#x27; and washed off completely with no chunks of clay in my sink, it just blending into water down the drain like normal.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even say that this product caused me to breakout, because many of the new blemishes were in the usual troublesome locations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It sucks it right out and doesn&#x27;t leave a huge swollen bump that squeezing would.</li>
            <li> Right now, any pimple I get is completely halted after a night of this stuff.. even the deep cysts.</li>
            <li> Right now, any pimple I get is completely halted after a night of this stuff.. even the deep cysts.</li>
            <li> base is mostly the apple cider vinegar, but in addition to the apple cider vinegar, I add some pure aloe vera juice and some rose water.  </li>
            <li> I mixed the clay with rose water and a little vegetable glycerin , i like the effect on my face so far.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference the night I did it, but the next day a lot of the little pimples had gone away, my skin was a lot more toned</li>
            <li> Pay special attention to the outer edges and make sure they aren&#x27;t too thin, or they will dry first and pull the hardest.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> I would completely reccomend this product to anyone looking to deep clean their skin, refine pores, and who wants a natural skin care product that actually works!</li>
            <li> But my skin is already dry, so not sure this is good for people over 50.</li>
            <li> Got tight very quickly.  </li>
            <li> The mixture came out really lumpy and kind of gross and hard to apply in any sort of even coating.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff, if you are using it as a face mask with ACV be sure to only use a tiny bit as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t cause it to become more dry like other face masks can, which I appreciated.</li>
            <li> Then I rinse and wash with a gentle cleanser and the little \\&quot;scrublet\\&quot; that came with Loreal&#x27;s 360 Clean cleanser.</li>
            <li> I tried it once using bottled water to keep it simple and pure (not vinegar as suggested) and as it dried, my skin started breaking out in large puss filled bumps.  </li>
            <li> and my skin is practically clear!</li>
            <li> my pores are almost all clear!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s helping clear my skin!</li>
            <li> Upon waking up my skin was clear!</li>
            <li> Clear skin!</li>
            <li> It looks so clear!</li>
            <li> Hopefully as I continue to use it my face stays clear!</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt so soft!</li>
            <li> put the mask once with my fingers, and I had some areas that hurt more than others, almost causing a skin irritation in small areas.</li>
            <li> It does smell funny once mixed with the apple cider vinegar but</li>
            <li> My dark circles are clearing up, my skin feels so smooth,</li>
            <li> Looked in the mirror and my face was smoother and better than it had been in the past without any trace of the allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first mixed by hand and it turned out clumpy.</li>
            <li> If only he would be consistent on using it.</li>
            <li> so I overmade my first batch with 1/3 cup of each in a glass bowl and mixed it with a a plastic butter spreader.  </li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t make any funny faces while applying it as a facial mask.</li>
            <li> This is the first skin care product I&#x27;ve EVER used that has actually substantially helped the appearance and quality of my skin.</li>
            <li> I wish I could be of help to somebody, if you have sensitive skin please don&#x27;t bother, it will just disappoint you!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> like this mask though, but the people who read how \\&quot;good\\&quot; this clay mask is, be aware that you would feel the same experience like the others including me have.</li>
            <li> It shrinks pores withing tqo uses, makes skin baby soft!</li>
            <li> I mixed it up about an hour after I opened the package, I was pretty eager.  </li>
            <li> think I will be cleaning other areas of my skin next :) Why not?</li>
            <li> Wow after reading the reviews I went ahead and purchase this product!</li>
            <li> My skin is baby soft!</li>
            <li> My skin is baby soft!</li>
            <li> and I am not sure that it is making my skin look any better.  </li>
            <li> This made my skin feel so soft!  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I find myself looking forward to my next at-home spa session featuring this and a hot bath.</li>
            <li> but i can say that first time i used it all my back heads on my nose were gone!</li>
            <li> I was like, WOW!</li>
            <li> After using it for the first time last night, I can tell you that this mask lives up to all the hype.</li>
            <li> I tried the mask for the first time today and saw instant results.</li>
            <li> My face cleared up in about a couple days and my scars have lightened considerably too!</li>
            <li> but in the long run it is worth it you also can use water</li>
            <li> I would have used it more often in the past if I didn&#x27;t have to mix it.</li>
            <li> I have been using is for about 3 weeks pretty religiously.</li>
            <li> My first try mixed with apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li> The first time i used it i mixed it with water.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> A pal recommended I use it on my hair and , WOW! .</li>
            <li> The jars are pretty big</li>
            <li> WOW is all I can say.!</li>
            <li> I also use it on my hair and it made it so incredibly soft!</li>
            <li> My skin feels velvety soft too!  </li>
            <li> pour just a tad of apple cider vinegar in a plastic tupperwear bowl &amp; add small amounts of the clay &amp; mix with a plastic spoon until I get a smooth (not too runny!)</li>
            <li> a big thank you to the person who tipped me off that I could buy it at Whole Foods!  </li>
            <li> I even put hot pack on several days in a row.  </li>
            <li> You want be disappointed MIX with the vinegar for best results.</li>
            <li> I first tried my usual warm wet washcloth to start wiping the mask off.  </li>
            <li> Yes, even my fine lines on my forehead have become less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Yes, even my fine lines on my forehead have become less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I have put excess in the fridge and used it later with no ill effects</li>
            <li> I was aware of the red face side effect but it just goes away after 30 mins.</li>
            <li> The first time i used it, I began by mixing it with water and a small amount of apple cider vinegar and left it on for about 20 minutes (which was really too long) and then rinsed with warm water.</li>
            <li> It definitely took some time though - the clay really sticks to your face!  </li>
            <li> I would definitely buy this again, as it is an all natural cheap product that actually does what it says it does.</li>
            <li> To begin, I will steam my face to open my pores by applying a towel that has been moistened with hot water.  </li>
            <li> Anyways, I discovered this recently and it really, really works!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I mixed it with water.  </li>
            <li> (you rinse off the clay in the shower), however, I usually wipe a lot of the clay off with a paper towel before jumping in the shower, just to be safe that I don&#x27;t clog the drain.  </li>
            <li> Simple, as other reviews have stated, the mask is drawing all of the dirt to the top of the skin.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, scrubbing is needed--as hot water doesn&#x27;t seem enough.  </li>
            <li> My face felt like a baby&#x27;s butt afterwards and that&#x27;s soft!</li>
            <li> This clay comes ALIVE on your face after you apply it - you literally feel it moving and getting it on with your skin!</li>
            <li> it is pretty essential to the healing method.</li>
            <li> I am a male and wanted to get pretty to find a lady.</li>
            <li> Received yesterday, used last night for the first time.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been consistent enough to notice a difference</li>
            <li> I should store it beside a small bottle of apple cider vinegar to promote myself to use it more often.</li>
            <li> When first using the mask for a facial your skin will start a purge</li>
            <li> after  first  use, I seen I  big difference.</li>
            <li> For people who are using this for the first time, make sure you test it on your hand first before you use it (just in case it feels uncomfortable).</li>
            <li> First time using the clay mask, I used ACV, mixed together and within minutes the clay hardened.</li>
            <li> rather use some other face wash from the local store and works better</li>
            <li> It took Aloe Vera gel applications every hour the first day and every three hours the next to get rid of the burning sensation and the redness.</li>
            <li> love this stuff, it&#x27;s like any other facial mud mask u would put on just tat</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars because I&#x27;ve gone through various treatments for my acne (prescription and nonprescription) and it has truly improved my complexion after the first try.</li>
            <li> I instantly notice a difference after i first used it.</li>
            <li> First time using this last night</li>
            <li> my 28 year old acne ridden face like nothing I&#x27;ve ever used before!</li>
            <li> Does make face red for a bit afterwards so just be aware that&#x27;s norml</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t leave it on too long, it can irritate the face because it is so powerful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li> BS  and mixed up a batch for my first go.</li>
            <li> This was my first and only rip off.</li>
            <li> I used it on my hair and it made my natural curls pop!</li>
            <li> /&gt;BE AWARE that this only cleans out your face</li>
            <li> /&gt;BE AWARE that this only cleans out your face</li>
            <li> Probably since I was like 8-9 years old!  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> As a woman in her 30s who recently developed troublesome skin, this stuff is a lifesaver!  </li>
            <li> First time i used it, i mixed it with the suggested viniger.  </li>
            <li> They are so soft!</li>
            <li> They are so soft!</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time last night.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how affective this mud, sorry - clay, really is, but it sure feels fun.</li>
            <li> Usually you end up making much more mud</li>
            <li> Worth every penny, just don&#x27;t leave on for too long or your face will look sunburnt for hours.</li>
            <li> I had purchased other products to help w/my sporadic, stress/hormone-induced acne for much more and hadn&#x27;t seen any lasting results.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> The first time, I mixed it with water; and like others have said, it does make the mixture clumpy, but it still works.</li>
            <li> Simply amazing.i just tried it for the first time.</li>
            <li> I mixed it up with ACV and after using it I felt like my face looked so much nicer!</li>
            <li> My skin was pretty red afterwards for about 30 mins.</li>
            <li> My skin was sooooo soft!</li>
            <li> i first mixed it with water, but it did not blend well</li>
            <li> When I first take the mask off, my skin is initially very red.</li>
            <li> I follow with Young Living Tea Tree Oil to soothe!</li>
            <li> This was her first step in doing a facial.</li>
            <li> My skin does turn red at first</li>
            <li> She paid something like $25 for this exact same thing except hers came from some boutique,</li>
            <li> Just used this for the first time last night.  </li>
            <li> This is a first of having Amy sort of reaction to facial products.  </li>
            <li> First I apply to my chest, shoulders, and back.</li>
            <li> (I thought it might be more solid like other clay masques I have used, as in already damp in the jar).  </li>
            <li> but wow what a deal!</li>
            <li> my significant other use these</li>
            <li> It makes pretty big claims, but it lives up to them.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> My first attempt in using this clay was last night.</li>
            <li> On my second container (first lasted nearly a year!</li>
            <li> This mask rivals all other much more pricey facial masks ANY day of the year!</li>
            <li> First thing I should say to anyone wanting to buy this product- OPEN IT OVER THE SINK!</li>
            <li> i have used other similar products and they have done better job than this ..</li>
            <li> I usually leave it on for 20 + minutes (more than direction say to).  </li>
            <li> I just used it last night for the first time.</li>
            <li> I would buy it again only because it does seem to help more than any other products that I have tried.</li>
            <li> When I use it on my face my skin gets red and hot when I wash it off.</li>
            <li> I have only used it twice (once Friday and once Sunday) and my skin is already much clearer!  </li>
            <li> You could feel and see the difference on your face in the first facial treatment.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slowly switching over to more gentle and natural products for my skin and</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle at GNC last weekend</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle at GNC last weekend</li>
            <li> and WOW..my hair felt incredibly soft and managable!</li>
            <li> I was like wow!</li>
            <li> Really smooth and clearer, a type of clear I dnt get from my other face masks.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s a small price to pay for porcelain skin if you ask me. :)</li>
            <li> Wow did this work!</li>
            <li> small amount of clay and a small amount of the apple cider vinegar, it fizzes up and mixes perfectly, something you cannot do with regular water.</li>
            <li> Delivered today, I tried for the first time, mixed with water.</li>
            <li> well was I surprised!</li>
            <li> Ive used other products before that I was excited about</li>
            <li> Pretty basic, works well though.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 20 and use this on my acne prone skin and it works wonders, I noticed a big difference after the first 2 weeks of using it</li>
            <li> I decided to check my blackheads and WOW!</li>
            <li> This was only my first use</li>
            <li> Completely recommend!</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin red at first</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use vinegar… I used hot water so it can open up my pores.</li>
            <li> I mix exactly 50/50 powder to water ratio using only plastic bowl and utensil.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin really soft!</li>
            <li> I have a sudden outbreak for the first time in my 23years of life.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Applying the mask after it&#x27;s done is pretty simple.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, I saw results instantly after the first use.</li>
            <li> I mixed this with water to use for my first try.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I requested, and I&#x27;m now on my second jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I never quite &amp;#34;believed&amp;#34; in masks to make a significant different in your skin, but this definitely proved otherwise.</li>
            <li> pH. First time users, leave it on for around ten minutes</li>
            <li> First time I used it, I saw a difference the very next day.</li>
            <li> It does make your face pretty red for about 30-60 minutes after use.</li>
            <li> I also heard this does wonders on your natural hair, but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet!</li>
            <li> it definitely helps improve the complexion but if you&#x27;re an acne sufferer you definitely want to look at more internal things.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt feel like my face gets detoxed and when I take it off my face is pretty red.</li>
            <li> It also helps with my 17 year old son&#x27;s breakouts!</li>
            <li> First day I tried it I mixed a couple spoons with organic apple cider vinegar as some reviewers say to do so.</li>
            <li> ONLY if you&#x27;re using it consistently.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Almost completely HEALED!</li>
            <li> It clears my blackheads, especially my nose for exactly a week.  </li>
            <li> It is green in color as it should be and make a good deep cleaning facial mask.</li>
            <li> I used up a whole tub of this clay trying many different ingredients and have come up with a few</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may have been not mixing it with ACV yet, not a whole lot of tingling, but it was kinda cool with the tightening thing.</li>
            <li> liked the soft feel of my skin after the mask and will be using this product a few times a month, in addition to the daily scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has some too good to be true reviews along with some normal and of course bad ones.  </li>
            <li> Its pretty strong and will leave your face red for a little while afterwards, but my face has never been softer or clearer.  </li>
            <li> You will not be able to make facial expressions comfortable once it is dry, so do leave plenty of time to make a facial, have it dry completely, and then to remove it.</li>
            <li> It leaves both soft and supple and my hair is not hard or crunchy from the clay.</li>
            <li> I was a little scared from the label that it would be too strong.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because every ones in awhile, i feel i need that extra feeling of DEEP clean skin.</li>
            <li> I use this mask to deep clean my pores around once a week, which it definitely does.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help deep clean my pores and give me a facial without paying $30.</li>
            <li> Such a deep clean</li>
            <li> smeared it on, easy enough, and waited for it to dry for about 30 mins.&lt;br /&gt;It tingled and after awhile, I could not move my face at all.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> -- I use Bioderma and Neutrogena face wipes to take off my make up (only on days that I wear make up), then I use the clarasonic mia and cetaphil daily face wash to clean my skin.</li>
            <li> It feels as if after using this for several months, my skin definitely feels detoxed and clean.</li>
            <li> This bite did feel a bit itchy, only sometimes, even with the paste on it, but instead of feeling like I needed to intensely scratch it, like I did the older bites, this one began to heal faster.  </li>
            <li> Definitely gave me a deep clean</li>
            <li> Lastly, once the clay mix is completely dry in the bowl I used to whip it up, it&#x27;s easy to wipe the excess into the garbage.  </li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and this stuff did not irritate or dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> For acne seriously this really does help but make sure you combine this with the apple cider vinegar, you wont regret it.</li>
            <li> It just takes longer to dry and is less effective.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find that the 6-month old henna that I thought had grown out to the tips of my hair was vibrantly all over my hair.</li>
            <li> It really keeps your skin and pores clean along with removing dead skin .</li>
            <li> I seriously cannot say enough good things about this face mask.</li>
            <li> It never pulsated the first few times but did last time and was kinda cool!</li>
            <li> The container is a large container filled with lots of powder, im not sure if i can use it all before the expiration date</li>
            <li> It cleans and detoxifies ur skin to give you a clean feeling unlike other cleansers.  </li>
            <li> I just add water and put it on, not with the other stuff.&lt;br /&gt;*makes skin glow-you definitely will feel a fresh, clean face with a glow.&lt;br /&gt;*prevents major breakouts</li>
            <li> One thing I read though is that you should clean this off your face into a bowl or pot or something other than your sink since the clay can build up and cause a clog after a while.</li>
            <li> There will also come a time when you will have to decide if you prefer to have a clean face and blocked drain or the other way around.</li>
            <li> plus it doesn&#x27;t cost that much compared to other stuff you are probably buying right now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to have it for the occasional (or frequent) facial, and I&#x27;m probably going to try it on my shoulders next.</li>
            <li> Definitely has tightening qualities-time will tell if it lasts beyond a few days following application, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> One of the big reasons I use the Bel Essence cream is because after using the clay, I put oil back into my skin, so I don&#x27;t end up with super dry skin, and also, Idon&#x27;t end up with super oily skin.  </li>
            <li> It turned out to be enough to put a pretty thick mask layer on my face and a thinner, more normal layer on my neck.  </li>
            <li> The ultimate soft feeling that is left behind is ideal.</li>
            <li> I use this product with my acne medication and then go on top of my acne medication with a very heavy over night cream.</li>
            <li> For the first time I was also able to apply a very thick layer as the lable suggests.</li>
            <li> thing I have to complain about is it&#x27;s a little messy trying to clean up :)</li>
            <li> I wipe most of it off first with a paper towel so there are no chunks of clay going down my sink than I rinse with warm, than cold water to close my pores.</li>
            <li> For dry skin it&#x27;s best to mix it with a little moisturizing agent like milk cream and honey (and a little water) to apply so it does not dry your skin out.</li>
            <li> It really makes your face super tight when it dries up</li>
            <li> I am always on the look out for new, natural products that I haven&#x27;t tried before.</li>
            <li> I am always nervous about putting new products on my face because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin that breaks out in acne if I try a new makeup product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long the redness lasted because I went to bed right after.</li>
            <li> It is hard to remove but with a little hot water you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will continue to use this mask faithfully, experimenting with different liquid mixers despite the unpleasant feeling as it dries because the results are so impressive.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell amazing when made, but it works, and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It last a long time and it keeps my face youthful and smooth.</li>
            <li> my face is free of acne and black heads.</li>
            <li> which may work for them, but I have arthritis in my hands and they give out long before the mixture is smooth enough to be usable).  </li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic and it is long lasting.</li>
            <li> i also believe it would be fine for sensitive skin if you only mix it with water and dont leave it on for too long.</li>
            <li> It applies lumpy and not smooth and does not remove easily.</li>
            <li> It takes awhile to dry, but I think that&#x27;s part of the fun with masks.</li>
            <li> A few of the cysts were brought to a head that I could easily pop (I know it&#x27;s not recommended to pop your pimples...</li>
            <li> I let the clay dry on my face and upper portion of neck for about 15 minutes, until dry, and then washed off with warm water and a cloth towel.</li>
            <li> next time I will try for 5-7 minutes instead of the full ten minutes.</li>
            <li> next time I will try for 5-7 minutes instead of the full ten minutes.</li>
            <li> I barely stirred the mixture before it became a fluffy, mousse like consistancy, completely free of lumps!</li>
            <li> I was kind of skeptical when I first bought it, but</li>
            <li> love green clay in general.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely messy but cleans up easily as long as you don&#x27;t use a nice towel.</li>
            <li> I make sure that I put on a pretty thin layer.</li>
            <li> (I also have had eczema like skin occasionally on my legs and arms, so I have pretty sensitive skin.)  </li>
            <li> But yeah, if you can find it at  your local natural aide-type place, look around there first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also mixed the mask in an old protein scoop, which works pretty well too.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about this product, but I have used it twice now and can honestly say that it does, in fact, produce immediate results.</li>
            <li> I went to two dermatologists, paid for countless microdermabrasion facials (which I love by the way and ultitmately helped with dark spots caused by acne, and also unclogging the pores,)</li>
            <li> The combination of ACV and the bentonite clay left my skin feeling pure, clean and it only left some redness that subsided after about 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I had multiple large break outs on my cheeks and it was pretty gross looking, but I used it once</li>
            <li> We let it dry and then applied a large bandage to cover the whole area.  </li>
            <li> : The first few times stick with the instructions (specially the first time); however, I would recommend waiting longer and let the mask dry completely on your face.&lt;br /&gt;3-</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;First, if you have oily skin and aren&#x27;t very sensitive, use the apple cider vinegar for mixing; if you are sensitive use distilled water.</li>
            <li> My adult acne has cleared  and my skin is very soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31, so I have adult acne, and very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Sure, it was probably just a few years, but when you&#x27;re one of the only teens with pizza-face in both your high schools, it seems like an eternity or two.</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t &#x27;unclog&#x27; my pores any more than any other generic facial cleaner.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels and it cleans your face down to the last bit.</li>
            <li> Also, if you have white pillow cases, the mask leaves a striking stain when you lay face down on the pillow.</li>
            <li> I suggest not washing it off down the drain first, but removing it with a makeup remover towelette first to get it started in the removal process.</li>
            <li> your face will get dry and also open up your pores by steaming your face with very hot towels then applying the mask so it really works.</li>
            <li> This is the first thing that made a very obvious and very significant difference after the first use; I wasn&#x27;t waiting for weeks to see any improvement or forced to use an entire skin care line and not mix product to see a difference after weeks of use.  </li>

            <li> how I felt it getting tight on my face after about 1-2mins I left on for about ten mins, my face has been so shining and Oily after washing off my face feels refreshed and cleaned , I can tell I&#x27;m going to love this product by my first use of it.</li>
            <li> The next day, he said he could still feel the positive results of having this clay sit on his oily skin for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> only have positive comment about this product.  </li>
            <li> I recommend that you will want to listen to the other comments and DO NOT try pulling this off your face, it is very strong and you will tear your skin and it really hurts, I did it by mistake in a very small area and it really really hurt!</li>
            <li> Instead of washing it off and making a huge mess in the shower, I peel it off in chunks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to not do the &amp;#34;before shower&amp;#34; step, but I always end up making a HUGE mess in my sink</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin and this hasn&#x27;t caused any problems, but it has helped clear up my acne!</li>
            <li> Also these reviews of pulsating and blackhead free skin are just not true.</li>
            <li> I accidentally mixed it with cooking wine the first time, so it was really itchy, but when I actually used ACV it worked amaizingly well.</li>
            <li> I really have only used it probably 3-4 times and the first time I left it on for about 20 mins until I felt my skin start to pulsate</li>
            <li> At least five white heads popped out of no where, I am sure if I waited another week, they would pop out by themselves and it won&#x27;t be pretty.</li>
            <li> It pretty messy, but I enjoy the fact that I can give myself an at home facial.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, yeah, but I also think I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth it if it makes my skin really red, seems like I shouldn&#x27;t be doing that to my face, you know?</li>
            <li> You WILL BREAK OUT after using this the first 3 or 4 times but stick with it, its getting gunk from the teenage years out (haha I&#x27;m 27) and its gross.</li>
            <li> My pores are not small as yet, but hoping to see a change in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> so I had my other items full of powder.</li>
            <li> my breakouts got worse before they got better, but my skin became the softest it has ever been after 3 uses!</li>
            <li> True to all of the other reviews-</li>
            <li> Mixed with Apple cider vinegar and water, 3 equal parts, kinda cool watching the bubbling action of the mixture.</li>
            <li> 1981 called and wants its skin care product back - nothing new here.  </li>
            <li> I bought this after starting a new medication that caused some unusual breakouts for my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sensitive to certain products and is somehow simultaneously really oily in the T-zone and really dry along my cheeks and chin.</li>
            <li> I use this mask every other night (if you don&#x27;t have acne / oily skin or if your skin is really dry and sensitive, I would only do 1 or 2 days a week at very most and see how your skin does).</li>
            <li> and then when I came back to check on his face about an hour later, it was amazing how the redness and inflammation (from the acne) had gone down.  </li>
            <li> My skin leans more towards the dry side, so i have to be careful as to how often i use this clay.</li>
            <li> This product works very well on my face, however it does dry it a bit too much.  </li>
            <li> black heads come to the surface and even 2 to 3 days later love it</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it too much because it really does dry your skin</li>
            <li> Next advice LESS IS MORE- when it comes to mixing it.</li>
            <li> I thought, maybe I need to dilute it more, only made a negligibly slight difference.</li>
            <li> it was really fun to do together, and the pulsing claim is real, it tightens and you can feel a slight pulse as it drys..</li>
            <li> Softens your skin, helps reduce black heads and acne, and overall makes your face feel better.</li>
            <li> This is the only item that was able to 100% pull all of the black heads out of my nose.</li>
            <li> had no problems, but just be careful if you have super sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Id be careful mixing with apple cider vinegar if your skin is super sensitive, but its definately a MUST in my skin care regimen now.</li>
            <li> WELL I read on a website from this super knowledgeable person that the white stuff is actually the over-refined/bad quality clay, so THERE.  </li>
            <li> WELL I read on a website from this super knowledgeable person that the white stuff is actually the over-refined/bad quality clay, so THERE.  </li>
            <li> I strongly suggest this for men too but only thing is we need to be careful while mixing this with water as it forms lot of lumps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it off for about 10 minutes now, and my skin still feels tight and smooth.</li>
            <li> Not only is the clay powder so fine it makes a mess of absolutely everything (both in preparation and removal), the resulting mask feels like you&#x27;re setting your face on fire.</li>
            <li> At first, when I read that this is the world&#x27;s most powerful facial, I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> swelling of one of an emerging zit went down significantly and it was no longer hurting.</li>
            <li> The swelling had gone down significantly and the bite did not hurt anymore.</li>
            <li> and it is completely dry remember to go in with a moisturizer, because now any treatment you want to use with sink right in.</li>
            <li> and it is completely dry remember to go in with a moisturizer, because now any treatment you want to use with sink right in.</li>
            <li> If you use the moisturizer right after you take off the mask it shouldn&#x27;t dry out your face at all.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s cuz the vinegar dissolves some and leaves you with a dry, unmixed turd, so you have to keep adding and adjusting til the consistency&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li> You need to apply serum and moisturizer right after rinsing the clay off because your skin will feel quite dry.  </li>
            <li> It leaves no mess!</li>
            <li> I had no foundation on, and my skin was a little red from removing the product with a small towel, and yet my face still looked good!</li>
            <li> No mess that way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice so far, but I&#x27;m already seeing some positive changes.</li>
            <li> My hair looks extremely shiny, which is pretty amazing considering that I have pitch black natural hair (natural meaning textured &amp; of African ancestry)&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> Regardless, leave it on for 10-15 minutes especially in a dry cool environment and you will feel your skin and pores tighten like never before.</li>
            <li> Soft, soft, soft!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with different skin types, just be sure to use a moisturizer after so your skin doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> it did not magically clear up my entire face in 30 minutes, but it did significantly reduce what was on it.  </li>

            <li> I pretty much evaluated/tested my skin for every other factor the rashes could be from, but I could not find any indicator of it being anything else ....</li>
            <li> This will probably be hit or miss with a lot of people just because it can be super irritating to your skin, but for under $10, I don&#x27;t think it would break the bank for most people.ls off in clumps, so I&#x27;d recommend washing your face over your kitchen sink if possible</li>
            <li> Age: 33 | Skin Type: Sensitive, Reactive, EXTREME oily (full onset oil</li>
            <li> 35 minutes later I washed my face in the shower, and as long as you are patient and let the warm water to the majority of the work with light rubbing, the clay should turn back into mud and rinse off nicely, not in clumps.  </li>

            <li> I have mixed it with ACV (Braggs organic pure) and water and didn&#x27;t notice a difference in results when using either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it certainly isnt the same product I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li> The container is large and I think it will last me a while.</li>
            <li> It got rid of almost all of the blackheads on my nose with the exception of one or two large big ones.</li>
            <li> Simple fix, just paint some more on until your whole face is covered in a decent layer and there are few dry patches [ normally at the edges ].&lt;br</li>

            <li> I misjudged and did like a half cup of water/apple cider vinegar and couldn&#x27;t get the right consistency of mud without adding the whole container.</li>

            <li> This isn&#x27;t a magical product but it seems helpful, I wonder if it&#x27;s worth the mess and trouble though.</li>
            <li> Make sure you buy raw Apple cider vinegar to mix with this product- DO NOT USE WATER!</li>
            <li> use with acv and raw honey! :)</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t bounce back with extra oil the next day like many products that are supposed to remove oil and really just dry out</li>
            <li> Works very well and makes skin look and feel great, but it can be very hard (and messy) to remove.</li>
            <li> I mixed 1 tbsp of the clay, 1 tbsp of Bragg&#x27;s ACV (Apple Cider Vinegar) &amp; 1 tbsp of water in a large plastic cup (old cottage cheese container) with a plastic spoon.</li>
            <li> And worth the price, I mixed my first mask in a small tupperware, let the extra dry and added more water when I wanted another mask.</li>
            <li> I mixed the water and acv in the bag and then poured  little bits of the clay into the bag, I locked the zip bag and gave it shakes until I got the consistency I was looking for, adding more clay as needed.  </li>
            <li> (Aug 29): ok, i did it with Apple Cider Vinegar this time and mixed it in a little ceramic cup instead of a ziplock baggy...</li>
            <li> I do agree that some of my pores did look a little bigger, but I guess that could be because its bring the acne to the top???</li>
            <li> I suppose I should have researched this product a little more, but there was nothing in the description or reviews that led me to believe it would be such a</li>
            <li> Oh, and a little advice, many times beauty products will say to apply a product to your face and neck so with that prior advice</li>

            <li> It was pretty cheap and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> it will then just run off on its own, use your hands a little if necessary, but only after its softened.</li>
            <li> I am just blown away by how amazing this product is and how inexpensive it is compared to all the other &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; products on the market that are like it that don&#x27;t work half as well as this...</li>
            <li> The next night I mixed it with water, and found that it mixed a little easier but worked just as good.</li>

            <li> This stuff should be used by anybody that has struggled with acne and even those who want clear skin who just need a weekly</li>
            <li> I was blown away at how soft my skin was.</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW</li>
            <li> WOW WOW.</li>
            <li> I have faith that you will achieve your goal of having clear and soft skin.</li>
            <li> So far so goog.</li>
            <li> everyone,  may all our skins become soft and youthful like a baby&#x27;s bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> The only differences are that this product takes 10 times as much effort</li>
            <li> No itching or burning so far.  </li>
            <li> I like it so far.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve used it 2X so far since ordering).</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to gross you out hahahaha)</li>
            <li> It has even gotten rid of old acne scars.</li>
            <li> My skin is clearly and remarkably soft.</li>
            <li> But I must say, I prefer the ready made which I have also, and will probably go back to that.  </li>
            <li> My daughter, who is twenty yr old, bought this product after reading these reviews.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve just used it this once so far, but I am planning to use it bi-weekly.  </li>
            <li> Tried all sorts of natural and chemical products.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s probably because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, use the water.</li>
            <li> Have sensitive skin and 40 years old.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I didn&#x27;t want to use the vinegar.</li>
            <li> It leaves it feeling so soft.</li>
            <li> Posted a few detailed photos for others to see.</li>
            <li> I used it once so far.</li>
            <li> If you end up with too much, you can store it in a ziploc baggie or a glass jar and use the rest later.</li>
            <li> However, my skin feels so soft</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see it as being healing and the miracle potion that makes the skin soft</li>
            <li> It took about 3-5 minutes of light scrubbing to get the mask off, and my face was red, red, red.  </li>
            <li> It took about 3-5 minutes of light scrubbing to get the mask off, and my face was red, red, red.  </li>
            <li> (but my blackheads have always been really stubborn- like permanent scars, so I only got to remove about like 10), then I put the clay on my face using apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li> My T-zone is completely covered in blackheads...</li>
            <li> After the mass was removed my skin felt soft refreshed.</li>
            <li> But this mask made my face itch soooo much it was such a pain having it on for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I am American Indian and my skin is very Olive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I have borderline sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It tightened my pores and made my skin soft.</li>
            <li> and even he was surprised.</li>
            <li> It feels soft just after washing it off....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Firstly, you definitely never want to mix with water--you&#x27;ll just end up wasting clay because water makes the mask very clumpy.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I bought this clay per the recommendation of natural hair blogs</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this bentonite clay!</li>
            <li> Natural and organic without chemicals or preservatives.</li>
            <li> After the initial purge I stopped breaking out altogether, and I know it was mostly thanks to this mask because I stopped using it for a month or so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle, but it works VERY well, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle, but it works VERY well, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> After I do the mask I use the Nivea soft moisturizer and</li>
            <li> it really is that simple.</li>

            <li> and oh so soft</li>
            <li> I like to lie in bed with my head hanging over the edge to allow as much blood as possible to flow to my face.  </li>
            <li> He put this on the sores for 20 minutes, and it has almost completely cleared up overnight.</li>
            <li> Having acne postpartum, I used with apple cider vinegar and it really helped to bring the pimples to the surface both on my face and my back.</li>
            <li> initially used this clay with apple cider but the fumes from ACV was too much for me.</li>
            <li> The application was simple and the smell of it really didn&#x27;t bother me, I actually didn&#x27;t really smell the vinegar at all.</li>
            <li> and after that one the pores around my nose were almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> My skin feels amazingly soft after using this product.  </li>
            <li> Really takes all the junk out of your face especially blackheads.</li>

            <li> I have also used this clay mixed with apple cider vinegar for spot acne treatments and it works very well for that too.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t seem any difference in my skin</li>
            <li> its natural its a mask and</li>

            <li> My skin is usually sensitive, dehydrated (lacks water not oil) and acne prone.</li>
            <li> Bentonite clay is a natural detoxifier</li>
            <li> I am hoping within a few months of regular use to see many of my skin issue clear up.</li>
            <li> I have oily, acne-prone, sensitive skin that will break out if anything even comes near it.</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin.  </li>

            <li> It makes your skin feel baby soft.</li>
            <li> ( I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin)</li>

            <li> I bought this product a week ago and have used it twice so far and</li>
            <li> But it Def made our skin soft.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t even put it on his whole face just put it on the two spots he had and today they are much smaller.  </li>
            <li> NO one has mentioned the smell that I&#x27;ve read so far.</li>
            <li> I need to find a better way as throwing away rags is not resourceful at all</li>
            <li> I need to find a better way as throwing away rags is not resourceful at all</li>
            <li> I have to mention that my skin is pretty resilient and not sensitive - it withstands the highest % Retin A rx cream, as well as glycolic peels without incident.</li>
            <li> and i have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> it hurt but after, my skin was considerably softer.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product even with clear skin as it also leaves your skin soft after washing it off.</li>
            <li> None of them surprised me like this one.  </li>
            <li> This itching means your skin is sensitive</li>
            <li> So far I have not had any problems.</li>
            <li> I am amazed how clear and soft my skin is by using clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have spent more money on different moisturizers to try to get my skin back.</li>
            <li> So far, no luck.</li>
            <li> I have used it once so far</li>
            <li> but my skin looks healthier and natural.  </li>
            <li> Towards the end at least for me it starts to sting/burn/itch but not horribly.</li>
            <li> I have trouble getting it to form a smooth paste, but I refuse to use vinegar instead of water (can&#x27;t tolerate the smell).</li>
            <li> I recommend using a face lotion after you wash it off, but I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I really like how my face feels the next day.</li>
            <li> I felt completely at its mercy.  </li>
            <li> I do not recommend using it with the apple cider vinegar to anyone with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Night Oil for Sensitive Skin--</li>
            <li> my face feels sooooo moisturized and soft..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cleans well and leaves your face with a soft, glowing look to it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination, adult onset acne-prone skin</li>
            <li> directions call for a quarter inch of packed mud, but if you go that far, you&#x27;re looking at a 45-minute-plus commitment.</li>
            <li> No perfumes, all natural.  </li>
            <li> I mix it in an old hair dye mixing bowl.</li>
            <li> i tried it with the facial mask recipe to remove impurities from my skin, it works very well.</li>
            <li> I  have natural kinky 4a(B) texture hair and this clay made my hair feel so soft and</li>
            <li> Do not put it under your eyes as it is too drying for that sensitive</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that is sensitive.</li>
            <li> I used the sensitive skin time and the apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> It made my skin soft</li>
            <li> especially I have a very greasy face, i recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I recomend using natural oils as a moisturizer (coconut or almond oil)  after using this mask since it can be drying if you use lotion.</li>
            <li> I use this on my natural hair after mixing with apple cider.</li>
            <li> or if you become overly sensitive to it, try leaving in on for shorter periods.  </li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and oily and this mud mask seemed to pull out a lot of impurities.</li>
            <li> BUT MY FACE IS SOOOOO SOFT</li>
            <li> My face has a natural glow every time I do</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once so far</li>
            <li> There should be a warning for sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> After 3 uses I see no improvement in complexion or uniform color, but I still can see the value in a natural product that is an alternative to harsher products for people with sensitive skin.</li>

            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>

            <li> skin is a bit on the sensitive side so as for the redness, that does happen but as stated in the instructions it goes away in approx.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22 years old</li>
            <li> I think my skin is too sensitive for this.</li>
            <li> Wow I wish I had known about this sooner.</li>
            <li> Absolutely spa-grade quality facial mask.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even get acne till I as an adult.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all either.</li>
            <li> can definitely vouch for the pulsating effects, as this felt like it was sucking the crud straight out of my pores.</li>

            <li> i have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t noticed a marked difference in my skin tone or texture.</li>
            <li> However, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Use a gentle moisturizer afterwards such as [[ASIN:B00DS842HS Viva Labs</li>
            <li> I also noticed a bit of redness after I completely took the mask of</li>

            <li> (I broke out at like 10 years old</li>
            <li> you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Leave skin incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> all natural cream.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The pimple is completely gone and no redness today.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried virtually everything to control my adult acne and this was another product to add to the list.</li>
            <li> every 3-4 days, it makes my skin really really soft and cleans it, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to treat my acne.</li>
            <li> and this mask has changed my skin completely.</li>
            <li> My skin was so soft and the swelling of the blemishes had diminished.</li>
            <li> Reading the reviews I was able to get the least messiest and easiest way to apply the clay.</li>
            <li> Wow this stuff is fant&amp;aacute;stico</li>
            <li> totally recommend see results fast</li>

            <li> My skin felt amazingly soft and clear afterward.</li>
            <li> get so much for your money &amp; It actually works.&lt;br /&gt;-Its</li>
            <li> I have bought every clay mask sold old there.</li>
            <li> but it hasn&#x27;t had any effects so far.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and feeling refreshed.  </li>
            <li> if you have sensitive skin (like myself), it does tend to burn in the beginning.  </li>
            <li> also, never use it around your eyes and lips, the skin is sensitive and it WILL cause it to wrinkle</li>
            <li> I have adult acne and the two of these products</li>
            <li> Still a few lumps here and there but mostly smooth once on my skin and rubbed in the circular motion.</li>
            <li> I followed with a gentle facial scrub.</li>
            <li> I will keep on using it because it leaves my face soft (:</li>
            <li> so I only use it on the oily areas and it is very refressing</li>
            <li> product completely blew me away.</li>
            <li> Seems to work really well for both &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; and teenage skin.  </li>

            <li> Besides clearing her skin, it made it baby soft</li>
            <li> How ever this mask is NATURAL and its results are not gonna happen over night.</li>
            <li> I have insanely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I changed the recipe several times, and found that I very suck at that.</li>
            <li> After about 3 weeks of using this mask in combination with Insta Natural Age Defying serum</li>
            <li> I would give five stars, it even came a day early</li>
            <li> I have a sticker placed directly over the directions</li>
            <li> Once I rinse off, my skin is so soft, I finish with a night cream.</li>
            <li> Then with the same scoop I measure out my apple cider vinegar into a bowl, then I add my powder and mix fast as it bubbles.</li>
            <li> I have used this product on clients before and so far none of them reported irritations or sensitivity to the clay mask.</li>
            <li> and when I finally got it I put it on my face and it made my face very itchy</li>
            <li> and I was surprised because I feel like I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> After mixing it and letting it sit (I waited until it was completely cracked, aka &amp;</li>
            <li> You can really see the difference after washing it off even if it&#x27;s only temporary.  </li>
            <li> I also use this as a spot treatment for my cystic acne - it really helps with the pain and seems to even bring them to a head after a day or two or just makes them smaller and disappear quicker.  </li>
            <li> HADN&#x27;T HAD ANY PROBLEM WITH DRAIN CLOGS SO FAR.</li>
            <li> Not for a soft sensitive skinned fellow like me.</li>
            <li> I came across a prescribed professional line called M.D. Forte.</li>
            <li> and you can vent to me about your situation, but I promise this will work for ANY skin type because again it&#x27;s completely natural there are no chemicals..</li>
            <li> My forehead is completely spotless, my nose is spotless, my chin is spotless.</li>

            <li> My forehead is completely spotless, my nose is spotless, my chin is spotless.</li>
            <li> :B00HJD8NLY Vitamin C Serum - Antioxidant Treatment - Natural &amp; Organic - Incl.</li>
            <li> So much so that my nose tightened enough to make my breathing different haha.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t worry too much about the amount, because I save extra in a food storage container.  </li>
            <li> I had to mix with only water because the scent of the vinegar was too much when I tried that option.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions (for sensitive skin), but still got severe inflammation.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t itchy or smelly whatsoever, the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was to much work to do.</li>
            <li> Plus, the areas in between my healing acne are softer and smoother, with the blackheads around my nose almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling soft and a noticeable glow.</li>
            <li> Though it doesn&#x27;t completely solve the problem (my pores are clogged again within the hour)</li>
            <li> i never had my skin feel so soft it use to be bumpy</li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne since I was 13 years old.</li>
            <li> Very dense so you only need about 1/2 teaspoon for your face and neck.</li>
            <li> and so far my holy trinity is working.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was causing it, and have tried everything natural to get rid of it...</li>
            <li> soak the clay in water for 4 hours and it gets really soft to mix and applies well on the face..</li>
            <li> The facial itself is intense</li>
            <li> I have mildly sensitive skin, so if you do I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use for face masks, and the only reason I don&#x27;t think I would ever need to buy it again is because it comes with so much product.</li>
            <li> the skin is soft, and I can&#x27;t wait to do it all again.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> So much in fact that I decided to use it again the next night - that was a mistake.</li>
            <li> Leave it on until completely dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling so soft.  </li>
            <li> And it pulls in oils and organic chemicals natural to your skin.</li>
            <li> Wow, where do I start??</li>
            <li> After two uses those blemishes were completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After use, my scalp is completely clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but the clay didn&#x27;t irritate.  </li>
            <li> and my skin is so soft</li>
            <li> wow.  </li>
            <li> if you want to feel old and wrinkled this is the stuff...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s made any improvements to my skin, I&#x27;ve used it twice only because for some reason it makes my face so itchy to the point where I can&#x27;t leave it on no longer than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> We use this for my 12 year old&#x27;s complexion and now it&#x27;s a date routine on Sunday nights.  </li>
            <li> Definitely use it with organic ACV (it doesn&#x27;t mix with water very well).</li>
            <li> The reviews completely sold me.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft and clearer looking.  </li>
            <li> Even my daugher&#x27;s boyfriend likes to use it as he says he likes how soft it makes his skin feel.</li>
            <li> It is all natural as well, I would reccomend trying it out.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to everyone who wants a deep pore cleaning.</li>
            <li> Sensitive skin types should do research before applying.</li>
            <li> No complaints thus far and would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed a decrease in pore size, but it is still early.</li>
            <li> It made my face really soft.</li>
            <li> Oh wow.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Inexpensive, and natural.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The results, WOW.</li>
            <li> people with sensitive skin, dilute vinegar with water or honey or just use water.  </li>
            <li> I use this product once a week and my acne is completely gone..</li>
            <li> You really just need to apply it like a regular mask.</li>
            <li> , the pulsating thing happens far into the drying process.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin but a friend reccomended this to me...</li>
            <li> It was smooth and and dried even and was a tighter feel on my skin.</li>
            <li> So, sensitive skinned girls, this product won&#x27;t be for you if you have problems with &amp;#34;allergy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Only thing that really got rid of my daughters acne without the irritation.</li>
            <li> And it leaves my skin feeling firmer, soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> ACV is a natural astringent &amp; toner.</li>
            <li> The fizzing action of the apple cider vinegar helps the powder to dissolve fully.</li>
            <li> Using the recommended portion on the instructions makes waaay  too much if you intend on using it as a face mask only.</li>
            <li> I only use it a couple times a week though, because it is very drying and can cause irritation, which is why I took off one star.</li>
            <li> oh my was i surprised at the way it made my skin feel and</li>
            <li> I did get a bit of skin redness immediately after use, but it goes away in a few minutes after I toned and lightly moisturized.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> watch a lot of dermatologist video blogger (Veronica Gorgeois) who recommends using a clay mask that is 100% natural calcium bentonite clay, like this product.  </li>
            <li> I made way too much, and I only used three capfuls (cap from the vinegar bottle) of water and cider.</li>
            <li> My skin was so soft.</li>
            <li> I did not expect the sudden and very noticable results.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re oilier (and the back tends to get very oily--hence the acne problem...)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a waste to try.</li>
            <li> Me and my Mother used it today and it works, afterwards our skin was soft and tighter.</li>
            <li> However, I took the plunge since it is natural.</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> my 14 old son has been using this 1 time a week since we bought it and his pimples seem less..he mixes and apply it to himself and showers it off..</li>
            <li> though I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s done much for the existing acne, I think it may be preventing the breakout from going any further, since it&#x27;s purging my pores each time.</li>
            <li> really help him with facial cleansing and remove acne.</li>
            <li> I just took it off, and my face is soo soft.</li>
            <li> My face glows, and it looks soft, too.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that can be a bit sensitive.</li>
            <li> I only use around 2-3 drops a night to cover my whole face.</li>
            <li> The only downside in my opinion is it does not absorb quite as fast into my skin as the rosehip oil does.</li>
            <li> They are made from a plant root and another natural ingredient.</li>
            <li> I also feel a bit indulgent every time I use them because of how soft they</li>
            <li> They are made from a plant root and another natural ingredient.</li>
            <li> I also feel a bit indulgent every time I use them because of how soft they</li>
            <li> The powder substance immediately spilled all over my bed and dresser which was totally unexpected.</li>
            <li> I mixed two spoons of the clay with 3 spoons of APV which turned out to be too much for my face and neck.</li>
            <li> old and</li>
            <li> (I just rinse in the shower, so far no clogs).</li>
            <li> Fast forward to today, 15 years later, I ran across this product on Amazon and bought it on a hunch.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that this product doesn&#x27;t come ready to apply.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have had no problem with this mask.</li>
            <li> Rosewater makes your face beautifully soft and it smells divine.  </li>
            <li> No specification on this product as far as how to use it.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, you may have a reddened face after applying this.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin &amp; helps to even out my skin tone as well as decrease blockages.</li>
            <li> The mask really cleaned pores when mixed with the vinegar as described.  </li>
            <li> I did this facial for a week straight</li>
            <li> I marked on my calendar the day I started using it-which was June 3.  </li>
            <li> It stripped my natural oils.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural, moisturizing and cost-efficient.</li>
            <li> About a month ago after having my son, I developed severe cystic acne on every inch of my face.</li>
            <li> I was completely mortified every time I looked in the mirror.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really do anything for my skin, my pores were the same size</li>
            <li> &amp; it made my face soo soft.</li>
            <li> and it closes my pours which makes my face feel soooo soft.</li>
            <li> so I  used it with water - already my skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li> it is a natural spot treatment gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using Witch hazel ( 100% all natural one)</li>
            <li> It is natural.  </li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> After about 2 weeks using it, my face is really soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others (including professional facials) and for the money, and the result you get, there is nothing like the Aztec Clay Mask that I know of on the market.  </li>
            <li> Now that I am an adult</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wondering how many applications is in the jar, I&#x27;d say at least 20</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do and does not irritate my sensitive yet oily, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> so he knows what I normally look like but now after a few weeks of using it maybe every 3 or 4 days along with my usual acne facial wash my face is looking great.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> So far I like this product.</li>
            <li> (No broken skin, please.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned how to make this as a facial from an aesthetician.</li>
            <li> While rinsing it off my face felt SO soft.  </li>
            <li> My pores are noticeably smaller after using this and this has really helped my acne out.</li>
            <li> but my skin is sensitive</li>
            <li> After applying I had a cooling and tightening sensation then it got really itchy after 10 mins and then started to sting/burn, 5 mins left to spare</li>
            <li> I have used GlamGlow and an Origins Charcoal mask as well as this one, and I must say, for my skin (sensitive), I wouldn&#x27;t buy again probably.  </li>
            <li> but I am 33 years old</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not harsh at all on your skin and has no scents so it can be used by someone even with sensitive</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see it on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much a pound of this stuff actually is!</li>
            <li> It makes my sling feel soft.</li>
            <li> (I do not have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> I am 42 years old and nothing at all has ever worked this well .</li>
            <li> So far I use it once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> early 40s?  </li>
            <li> When I mixed it it became really clumpy.</li>
            <li> but so far I like it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really helps close my pores up, and I only use it a couple of times a month.  </li>
            <li> And regardless a lot use glycerin in their toothpastes which as the effect of not letting minerals settle in the teeth and leaves them sensitive.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li> this is a natural product you wont be dissappointed</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by it&#x27;s effectiveness at clearing my problem complexion.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pulsate much unless left on longer than 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> So natural and works wonders.</li>
            <li> i noticed my zit was almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> adult acne has been a pain in my butt</li>
            <li> I follow up with the Olay 7 moisturizer (I&#x27;m old, haha!).&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to help with adult acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once so far</li>
            <li> My skin has never been so soft and blemish-free.  </li>
            <li> mix it all together (using my fingers) in a plastic container (With a lid), then I have it ready for the next time.</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> So far I have used this mask twice</li>
            <li> My face feels soft from the mask</li>
            <li> I have larger pores and this really helps if I used it once a week.</li>
            <li> It takes me about 15 minutes to get this completely rinsed off.</li>
            <li> nothing has worked completely until I found this product.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve just used water to mix it, perhaps I&#x27;ll try the vinegar method sometime.</li>
            <li> I have always had \\&quot;problem\\&quot; skin and walked into a natural health store.</li>
            <li> It has helped considerably.</li>
            <li> Do not put anywhere near eyes because of the pulling that occurs.</li>
            <li> I do like it so far, just hope the cysts go away soon.</li>
            <li> I have used another brand recently that is ready made</li>
            <li> I have problematic frequent breakouts &#x27;that time&#x27; of the month</li>
            <li> (a far cry from the Tbs recommended on the tub).</li>
            <li> My skin was soft too.</li>
            <li> My brother wanted to use the mask too, so far we both like it.</li>
            <li> You can tell results immediately however when you wake up the next day is when you can really tell.</li>
            <li> I rinse this off in the shower (please use a screen catch in the drain as clogging can likely happen) and after about 15 minutes of redness have much healthier looking and feeling skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect such fast results.</li>
            <li> and I always get ppl telling me how young my skin looks</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft</li>
            <li> You can feel clay in action</li>
            <li> Would not recommend this for someone with sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li> My face really wasn&#x27;t red afterwards.</li>
            <li> I use apricot scrub afterwards, and moisturize with burts bees natural acne solutions moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My 17 year old uses it constanty for his acne.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels softer, healthier and my adult acne is at bay.</li>
            <li> this stuff really does work, I had pimples on my face not big pimples</li>
            <li> i dont even have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne since I was 10 years old.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it works wonders on me.  </li>
            <li> and so far it&#x27;s working.  </li>
            <li> but so far it does tighten and make my skin glow.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a clay mask to use to help clear up adult acne, so I read the reviews and purcahsed this product.  </li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because its really lumpy with you mix it with your liquid of choice.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start this off by saying that I have sensitive, oily, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 20 years old and get a lot of breakouts on my face.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> We were pleasantly surprised at the way our faces felt when the mask was removed.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin clear and soft.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft too which is a bonus.</li>
            <li> Wild Yam Oil - ladies</li>
            <li> Wild Yam Oil - ladies</li>
            <li> It makes me feel like an old aztec warrior.</li>
            <li> I use it as mud wash, leaves my hair soft and moisturize.</li>
            <li> No messy cleanup for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple yet so very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not noticed much improvement with the pores on my nose, but again, that could be because I only use this once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> I am now 43 years old.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and am always looking for something that won&#x27;t irritate me but will work on my oil and blackheads.</li>
            <li> The mask is really stinky if you mix it with vinegar (obviously) but that&#x27;s really the only way to do it.</li>
            <li> And when you take it off, your skin is SO soft.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone, sensitive skin or not.</li>
            <li> face gets a bit red because it really does work.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using this after I break out</li>
            <li> Though I don&#x27;t suggest doing that if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product a couple times so far</li>
            <li> I have a problem with adult acne, so I have tried just about everything.</li>
            <li> Oh and I do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> 100% natural</li>
            <li> I am 27 years old</li>
            <li> It is not harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> With people with adult acne issues, this won&#x27;t solve your problem, but it does help acne heal faster.</li>
            <li> and my hair was so soft.  </li>
            <li> I use the clay for my natural hair kinky texture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I haven&#x27;t really tried this, but the bf likes to take this with fiber drink and such to absorb the toxins from his insides.</li>
            <li> Ironically, wild elephants know to do this to absorb the toxins they eat from all the foliage in their diet.</li>
            <li> and I used it for the suggested 15 minutes for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My face feels soft</li>
            <li> My hair is natural (no chemical processing).</li>
            <li> (this is my husbands account) and i&#x27;m completely blown away by the results after just one use.</li>
            <li> My face felt soft, but it always felt that way, not any softer.</li>
            <li> (don&#x27;t forget that i cover my whole back</li>
            <li> Completely changed how my pores looked.</li>
            <li> and now they are almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks, I feel like my skin has gotten so much smoother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my pore size get smaller and how much  healthier my face looks.</li>
            <li> I also read several comments about bath and sink drains being clogged - when I&#x27;m ready to rinse</li>
            <li> While I like the idea that Aztec clay is natural and does not contain harmful chemicals, it was a lot of effort to: 1.</li>
            <li> I rated this product a 5 star because it makes the skin brighter and soft.</li>
            <li> oh so baby soft.</li>
            <li> I leave the mask on for 15 minutes and it leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> The pulse is so strange, but it really works!</li>
            <li> You can literarily see it working now</li>
            <li> so i try it and the next day my face is a wreck, like a real break out.</li>
            <li> As stated above, I have very shiny, oily skin.</li>
            <li> Mixed with the apple cider vinegar, it worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> the old school packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a lot of blackheads even though I am 27 years old and my pores around my nose and adjacent area are too noticeable for my liking.</li>
            <li> If I pick at them, I of course get pimples and it makes me feel like I am forever 15 years old.</li>
            <li> I surprised.</li>
            <li> , I finally used the whole 1lb jar.(I</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> Acv makes u sensitive to uv.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t felt that they really do what they are supposed to, and now I can say they definitely don&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> I tried that tonight and not only did it hurt but it took much longer for</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I leave the mask on for about 15-20 minutes, or until it completely dries.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has lasted me over a year so far</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for sensitive, combination, oily and acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> i mix with apple cider vinegar with mother and completely cleans skin once a week or 2 times if i remember&lt;br</li>
            <li> has nearly healed completely.</li>
            <li> I have yet to feel any &amp;#34;pulsing&amp;#34; but once the mask dries, WOW.</li>
            <li> This clay makes my skin incredibly soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is some redness directly after use, however it fades within an hour or so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even used it in my natural hair with no problems.</li>
            <li> Im 19 years old</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> My skin was so soft I couldnt believe it.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just too much work for me, especially when I didn&#x27;t feel it did anything after use.</li>
            <li> Well it made my skin soft but hasn&#x27;t helped clear up acne or acne wounds.</li>
            <li> It cleanse out my pores a bit and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Also, I have hyperpigmentation and sensitive skin, this seems to help with my coloring.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend even commented on how soft my face was.</li>
            <li> Was sensitive to touch even the morning after.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The very first time applying the product to my face, it felt like any other clay mask but 2-3 mintues in I could feel the clay drying and tightening on my face, neck and chest.</li>
            <li> My hair had defined curls and felt soft.</li>
            <li> if you are looking for a natural clay mask, this is it.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> Lush&#x27;s Charcoal soap and my acne is almost non existent now.</li>
            <li> she is 70 years old.</li>
            <li> Once the mask was completely removed, I noticed my face was brighter and some spots looked like they were lightening up &amp; healing already.</li>
            <li> YOUR LOCAL WHOLE FOODS cause the one on here is a rip off.</li>
            <li> all you really need is a tiny jar of this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I am 23 years old, and I have been struggling with cystic acne for 10 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from antibiotics, to OTC washes, to natural remedies from Pinterest, and nothing has worked for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nearly 30</li>
            <li> My face felt completely stripped and irritated.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just saying that it aggravated my adult acne</li>
            <li> but once they do, my skin feels so soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Skin feels incredibly soft after each use.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin I recommend not using this product.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and its easier to detangle.</li>
            <li> Maybe my skin is too sensitive for this.</li>
            <li> I leave it on until it completely dries</li>
            <li> It did leave my skin feeling soft but made my skin peel.</li>
            <li> it really provides a deep cleanse.</li>
            <li> in looooooove and its too much i think its last for 100 time of use</li>
            <li> It does make me peel, but sometimes that is what it takes for clear soft skin.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it cleared my face almost completely.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week, so far it&#x27;s been 3 weeks</li>
            <li> this is the only thing that has really cleared my skin.</li>
            <li> I like it so far.</li>
            <li> but my skin felt soft</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t bode well with my sensitive combination skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues so far.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t agree, it does help prevent pores from clogging but if you have severe acne or get frequent cystic pimples this does not prevent them at all.</li>
            <li> So far I like it.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and clear.</li>
            <li> I mixed the clay with water, it took 1 tea spoon of powder and one spoon of water to get ready.</li>
            <li> Plus, my my very oily skin is starting to behave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice so far</li>
            <li> So far I hav noticed any changes</li>
            <li> are almost completely  gone when i remove it</li>
            <li> My skin is really soft after and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mostly 4a natural ( o and s for Lois system)</li>
            <li> I have some adult acne on my chin area.</li>
            <li> Im 19 and have suffered acne since my early teens.</li>
            <li> The whole time it ranged from moderate to severe.</li>
            <li> , I guess I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin</li>
            <li> came off in the shower with no problem, did not clog my sink, And my face feels soft.</li>
            <li> (I will be doing possibly 4 days straight ).</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions and use the organic Apple Cider Vinegar to get the tingling, pulling, cooling action - I used it on face, neck, arms and legs (which is what she told me she is doing, per a nutritionist).</li>
            <li> I have a naturally oily face.</li>
            <li> the headache isn&#x27;t worth the 5 extra seconds it takes to fill a bowl to dump outside</li>
            <li> some days it&#x27;ll clear it up, sometimes it won&#x27;t; my skin&#x27;s also pretty retarded and bipolar, so it could be just me) but as to general deep cleaning and firming, it&#x27;s awesome!!</li>
            <li> I had been using Glamglow, which I liked a lot, but was so expensive for how much you got that I wanted to find a replacement.</li>
            <li> I do see minimal change regarding smile lines</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> I would recommend, but use it carefully because it is so powerful.</li>
            <li> blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;the product also turns out pretty chunky when you first mix it; however, letting it sit in an airtight container or bag for a while (few hours, days, whatever works) makes it smoother.&lt;br /&gt;all</li>
            <li> It also has vitamins, fatty acids, and omega 3s that your skin needs to build healthy skin - I especially like that.  </li>
            <li> maybe 8 times (and wasted most of it each of those times, even only using a Tablespoon each time) and</li>
            <li> /&gt;In terms of application, it is messy like most clay masks so just pin all your hair back</li>
            <li> a dozen facial scrub seemed to only be worth the trash</li>
            <li> My skin was left dried out so most def.</li>
            <li> Love the suction feeling and pores seem to be smaller after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll do it a few more times and then do a follow-up review if I have anything else to add.the same way: it just means its removing a layer or two of your skin.</li>
            <li> it drys like all facial mud and feels crackly but is worth the time use of 1 time or 2 times daily</li>
            <li> For the quantity it is worth the price as it will last a while to finished the entire thing.</li>
            <li> I bought it to help with my acne, so hopefully a few more times will show some results with that, although if all it gives me is smaller pores and softer skin</li>
            <li> This was well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> I even let the water run a few extra seconds to make sure its plenty rinsed.</li>
            <li> used only once so far, but my face felt cleaner and it was more clear after the mask, the only thing I didn&#x27;t really like is it is so messy, I would recommend taking off with a moist papertowel, otherwise it gets everywhere and might even clog the sink.</li>
            <li> Repeat with a fresh wet towel until all mask is removed.</li>
            <li> i bought this product because of all the good reviews and wonder what in the world am i doing wrong when i used this on my face because for one it doesnt do what it says it should.</li>
            <li> (just enough to mix it into a nice, thick paste)</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s better not to put too thick of a layer on.</li>
            <li> It made a lovely, thick paste which I then applied to my face.</li>
            <li> Actually, better, because when I put it on thick, pieces of it would fall off my face.  </li>
            <li> and they all have their own bottles of [[ASIN:B0014P8L9W Aztec Secret - Indian Healing Clay, 1 lb clay]].</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s as good as the expensive masks.</li>
            <li> I like to take a bigger bowl and fill it with warm water and then grab a rag and slowly take off the mask</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the good reviews had me fooled.</li>
            <li> is slowly but surely clearing up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> we loved it, but it can be difficult to wear for the time instructed.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and large pores and wasn&#x27;t really seeing results OR feeling the &amp;#34;pulsing&amp;#34;, so I made a small adjustment to the mixture (a teeny bit more ACV and a teeny bit less clay) and am finally feeling and seeing what this mask can do!  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty large container of a dry clay powder which is reconstituted with water or it suggests apple cider vinegar so in reality the giant tub you receive is doubled in amount of product.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to get the amount right as I always put too much or too little.</li>
            <li> I have tried many things, but this is my answer to getting my face to feel subtle and very soft.  </li>
            <li> When i purchase this product i did not have any high expectations, i just wanted to try a new facial mask for my face and stumbled upon this product and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> The mask really helped at first, but I kept breaking out, so I went down to using it twice a week.</li>
            <li> Every time I mix mine, I use really hot water but its still super clumpy and hard to blend.</li>
            <li> The first couple of times I used it, it left my face a bit pink, but the more times I have used it, the less my skin seems to react this way.</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t been this clear &amp; pretty in a LONG time!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just because my skin is super sensitive (very acne-prone)</li>
            <li> If you mix it just right not only will you feel pulsating and tightening, you will feel as if your face has moved( such as your lips puckering)</li>
            <li> I had a giant pimple right in the middle of my forehead.</li>
            <li> I wash my face with Clean and Clear liquid foaming cleanser, I use CVS astrigent for sensitive skin, facial scrub by Equate, 100% African white shea butter and or Hollywood Beauty tea tree</li>
            <li> Works beautifully with aging, complicated skin (dry and acne).</li>
            <li> smearing it on for coverage is enough and it took the full 25 mins to dry with a fan.</li>
            <li> Face (n pores) looks clean after and feels tight..</li>
            <li> It helps keep my skin tight and my pores clean.</li>
            <li> It works well, my skin felt tight and really clean after use.</li>
            <li> My face feels so clean and tight after.</li>
            <li> After one use, my skin in brighter and my pores are CLEAN and TIGHT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product for a lot of reasons, one of which is due to the relief I felt when I realized I didn&#x27;t wind up being a total sucker.</li>
            <li> Now understand this; each and every one of us have different skin type, different circumstances and many other variables</li>
            <li> I was excited to use it, but a little nervous.</li>
            <li> There are sooooo many other internal and external benefits.</li>
            <li> Within 20 minutes, my skin was back to its normal color and my pores were practically non existent!</li>
            <li> I mix it with other things like green tea extract and sometimes a tiny bit of apple cider vinegar if I want a good purge of my pores.</li>
            <li> I put it on, a thin layer, and use a very warm, wet wash cloth to remove it.</li>
            <li> Where the mask was thicker, were barely pink right after removal.</li>
            <li> It took a couple tries to get the right consistency</li>
            <li> The water is harder to mix and it ends up being clumpy, but the vinegar makes it glide right on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strange the first time you do this, you may have a metallic taste in your mouth when this is accumulating.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strange the first time you do this, you may have a metallic taste in your mouth when this is accumulating.  </li>
            <li> I get occasional little pimples and on rare occasions, I&#x27;ll get a cystic pimple (I suppose this wouldn&#x27;t do much to help with those kinds anyway) and I didn&#x27;t really notice this help with my acne very much as I&#x27;ve seen other reviewers say.</li>
            <li> EVERY single black and white head I had was sitting on the top of my face ready to be washed away.</li>
            <li> I peeled off a large chunk of it from my face, and i could see little oil stains on it, it really did draw out the oil/gook from my pores!</li>
            <li> Only downside-- 1lbs for $10 when its 2lbs for $7 at other retailers with free shipping.</li>
            <li> It has really helped with my complexion, more radiant, less breakouts and black heads on face/nose.  </li>
            <li> My pores are small, my face is smooth and soft, and my acne marks are fading!</li>
            <li> in all my pores are smaller and its a cheap alternative to the other clay masks out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use my regular daily cleansers, but I&#x27;ll use this product as a mask every two weeks or so to get that deep clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been breaking out like crazy due to stress and my dr put me on antibiotics which had me incredibly dizzy for a week!</li>
            <li> As I let the product dry, I felt exactly what the product description said I would.</li>
            <li> (figured I would try that first and then see if I needed the apple cidar vinegar) and then after rinsing off and patting dry, I applied organic unrefined shea butter (which I also purchased on here) on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> tried even more extreme methods like chemical peels, and even spent $750 on a 6 week session of microdermabrasion.</li>
            <li> I just think it&#x27;s easier to use other face masks that are already mixed into the form ready to apply and also find that other face masks leave my face feeling kind of the same</li>
            <li> nose gets pretty dry, flaky, and I have eczema.</li>
            <li> My nose of course was the first to dry so you could feel the tingling/mild burning sensation.</li>
            <li> Normally my skin would breakout all around my chin area, after using the mask about every other day for the first couple of weeks</li>
            <li> I leave it until dry and by then I am ready to take it off!</li>
            <li> My skin is so much smoother, my pores are so clean and my skin is hardly oily at all.</li>
            <li> My face feels refreshed afterwards, when I do a full face mask I typically wash it off in the shower and apply a hydrating cream afterwards.</li>
            <li> Since it is a strong mask, I usually use it once a week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but not amazing as every other review that I read.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it made a difference on my pores because I would definitely need to get 10x mirror magnifier, but I don&#x27;t see huge difference on the large pores that I can already see.  </li>
            <li> I made a major mistake with buying Walmart brand pink grapefruit cleanser instead if putting out 8 more bucks to get the Neutrogena pink grapefruit cleanser.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and the tingling sensation you feel on your face is pretty cool.  </li>
            <li> It does get tight so be aware that it really, really tightens the skin and takes some time to wash off.</li>
            <li> I live in the French Quarter(old pipes, old septic system, old everything!)</li>
            <li> clean up - soak the towels in hot water, then lay it over your face for 10 seconds, then slowly drag the cloth down your face.</li>
            <li> Good bye high end expensive facial products.</li>
            <li> I tried some of the most irritating and powerful acne serums, but still had generally had mixed results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to try it for the other uses as well!!</li>
            <li> Thick paste on your face will take a bit longer to dry, but the point in this mask is to when it even dries you keep it on for a little bit more time while its magic is still regenerating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Every time I stop using it my pores get bigger and when I use it they shrink, but seriously THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING.</li>
            <li> made my skin more or less oily or dry.</li>
            <li> I put my usual moisturizer on and within 15 minutes, it was back to normal but super soft and REALLY</li>
            <li> Worked just as it is said to, made my face feel so clean and soft after a few days of use</li>
            <li> its strong and leave it only for 20 minutes less</li>
            <li> For someone who has up and down skin conditions, it is heaven to hear this!don&#x27;t end up with super oily skin.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it it was a little intense</li>
            <li> It mixes much better with the apple cider vinegar than water and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so you will get way more facials than the description says.</li>
            <li> 2 min apply and no mess.</li>
            <li> And the effect lasts for pretty much the entire day, maybe even partially into the day after that.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t just try to rub it off unless you want your entire dermis to go with it, I would suggest taking a wet towelette and holding it on your face for a while to soften the clay first before wetting the cloth again and using it to gently rub it off.</li>
            <li> its gross but at the same time its cool because you actually know it is working!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it did make my face extremely sensitive and red the next day but after a couple of uses, that went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I discontinued use of all of my other products and just use this clay mask, Aveeno face lotion, and fresh lime juice as a toner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit messy but definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> When I opened the lid, there was no mess.  </li>
            <li> After using the healing clay for a few months, I have noticed my skin has cleared up significantly</li>
            <li> No mess.</li>
            <li> Your skin will get better after the first few uses!!!!</li>
            <li> I recommend Aztec Secret most highly.</li>
            <li> My breakouts were a little more serious than minor but not exactly dreadful.</li>
            <li> The entire week in new york I didn&#x27;t use this mask and I didn&#x27;t break out ONCE!</li>
            <li> The entire week in new york I didn&#x27;t use this mask and I didn&#x27;t break out ONCE!</li>
            <li> /&gt;****Wet entire face with a hot rag (just hold it there for a few seconds and gently press down) before removal to loosen the clay and a warm, wet rag</li>
            <li> skin feels super soft and the pores appear tight.</li>
            <li> skin feels super soft and the pores appear tight.</li>
            <li> Another thing that I was not super thrilled about was how tight it gets on your face as it dries.</li>
            <li> i suggest use when going some place special or a little time before a bath</li>
            <li> I recomend not being cheap and buying Braggs raw organic apple cider to use along with it *</li>
            <li> Starting last year after switching to a new birth control, I really broke out all over my face.</li>
            <li> only do this once a week because my skin is pretty normal and do not want to dry it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m left with incredibly smooth and soft skin and my pores are considerably less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Its sort of a messy clean up as well because you dont want it getting into your drains.</li>
            <li> (so my hair doesn&#x27;t feel dried out and brittle) and leaves my hair looking fuller and so so clean.</li>
            <li> My face felt smooth though dry and the next day it even felt smaller</li>
            <li> It comes in a fine powder, which she mixes into a paste that she applies onto her skin using a small paint brush when using as a mask.  </li>
            <li> Ok, so let me start out stating that this product works, it works ridiculously well.</li>
            <li> I will say this is easier to clean off in the shower as it can get a bit messy for the sink.</li>
            <li> My face seriously has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> It may be slightly messy to clean up</li>
            <li> Too messy to clean up in your home.</li>
            <li> it leaves my skin soft and clean my pores are really small afterwards although the skin is red its very temporary.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve tried other clay masks from my beauty supcription boxes that run for about $35 for less product, this actually works better!</li>
            <li> Once my 20min were up, I went to my bathroom, grabbed a few sensative babywipes and turned on the hot water and gently cleansed off the clay.</li>
            <li> I Have been using the mask for about a month, and have had no deep cyst pimples and the small ones are beginning to look better.</li>
            <li> The first time, I mixed it only with water because I was still waiting for the organic apple cider vinegar to come in the mail.  </li>
            <li> I washed it off before it had all dried completely, but my face had started to tighten, which is a cool feeling.</li>
            <li> I used a washcloth and warm water to rinse my face, and immediately saw where a few of my recent breakouts had reduced in size, and the dry skin which sometimes scabs up around the area of a zit was gone and healed.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a bit of a stretch if you&#x27;re a long time acne sufferer to assume this mask will magically heal you in a few days&#x27; time.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a bit of a stretch if you&#x27;re a long time acne sufferer to assume this mask will magically heal you in a few days&#x27; time.</li>
            <li> Same really red face as the first time, and</li>
            <li> Same really red face as the first time, and</li>
            <li> First value-for-cost is terrific, especially compared to drug-store and department-store competitors.  </li>
            <li> I used it last night for the first time and my skin looks younger and fresher this morning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money and the 1lbs jar should last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I mainly use it to fight acne in 2 different ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Did my first facial last night</li>
            <li> I did, however, spend many long minutes in the shower trying to get the dried stuff out of my hair.</li>
            <li> first I didn&#x27;t get the whole face pulsating thing, just thought as the mask dried</li>
            <li> I mixed it with apple cider vinegar the first time I used it and noticed tighter skin and a big reduction in blackheads!  </li>
            <li> My sister and I are sharing it, and by looking at it, it will last a long time, so definitely worth the money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older my pores have gotten larger.</li>
            <li> in all, this product is only worth the price because of how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I used this product as a facial, I mixed in apple cider vinegar.  </li>
            <li> This is the first deep pore mask that actually does what it says and&lt;br /&gt;I could feel it working.  </li>
            <li> One small tub will last more than a year.</li>
            <li> Since adding this two months ago, I have had maybe two pimples that went away quickly, and my blackheads are way, way less noticeable and fewer.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t feel &#x27;pulsating&#x27; but it definitely was sucking my skin to the point where my eyes and lips looked bigger.</li>
            <li> I use this particular brand to give to my dog, along with topical usage (skin issues, baths, etc.).  </li>
            <li> I use this only when I feel like I&#x27;m breaking out more than usual</li>
            <li> : I recommend mixing it with water in a small skilled bag and then simply applying to skin with hands on skin.</li>
            <li> After the first application her face was definitely smoother and the days following</li>
            <li> you make the mask the first time it does take some time, but if you save the extra from the baggie the next application is quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using just water, the mixture is pretty lumpy and thus more difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> mixed it water since it is my first time using it and planning to use cider vinegar the next time I use it to see if there are any difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the first use I promise you will notice a decrease in redness and irritation and if possibly you will have already gotten smaller pores.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This clay makes your curls pop like nothing else, just add a tsp or so to your favorite conditioner and deep condition as usual.</li>
            <li> My method was pretty simple, just put water and some clay in a plastic bag and rub the bag so the contents are completely mixed all over the surface area of the inside of the bag, turn the bag inside out, and apply.</li>
            <li> My family had been using this product for over 20 years to pull infections out of BIG and small wounds/bites :) we wouldn&#x27;t be without it</li>
            <li> I have mild occasional acne and dry/ combination skin, and just after one use, my pores were noticeably smaller THE NEXT DAY.</li>
            <li> (Im sure it would go on a little smoother but Idc about that as long as my acne is gone!)</li>
            <li> Mainly, I use this once or twice a week as a facial mask.</li>
            <li> Two days later after initial application, I developed a large cystic like acne on my neck near my face.</li>
            <li> Your face might feel a little dry afterwards so be sure to apply face lotion.</li>
            <li> Most of the time I have to take it off before it is completely dry because, it starts to hurt a little bit.</li>
            <li> Your face will get red after use, it wil only last about 30 minutes, but your face will be left clean, so soft and it even removes blackheads!</li>
            <li> This might work for people with little tiny blackheads that are very mild</li>
            <li> was very skeptical when I first heard about it and read so many positive reviews here.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when I first heard about it and read so many positive reviews here.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t dump the clay down your sinks though, many reviewers have mentioned it causes issues and</li>
            <li> Use it at night since if you are pale like me, it leaves your face pretty red right afterwards.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;ve finished applying I IMMEDIATLY scoop out what&#x27;s left and put it in the trash (so the clumps don&#x27;t clog my drain) and wash my little bowl and whatever I used to mix with down the sink making sure to use soap and plenty of hot water.</li>
            <li> I still get some acne, and my 11 year old daughter is getting major acne as puberty begins.  </li>
            <li> I had several really vivid red marks and those have really lighten up through my use of this clay.</li>
            <li> I have always had major skin problems since I was young girl</li>
            <li> mask does pull really hard on your skin, so I strongly advise not to put it anywhere near your eyes.</li>
            <li> My face is so red and tight after using this because I can actually feel my blood being pulled to the surface on top of everything else it draws out.</li>
            <li> The other reviewers are right - Use it with apple cider vinegar and you&#x27;ll see the difference.</li>
            <li> Right now, I can tell you it is unlike any other mask I have EVER put on my skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend keeping a bottle of this in the house for multiple uses.</li>
            <li> My hair was definitely clean and soft after, but the big surprise came later when it was dry.</li>
            <li> We had such high hopes for this clay.</li>
            <li> highly recommend using apple cider vinegar with this vs only water.  </li>
            <li> I mixed this product with apple cider vinegar, I highly recommend using that with it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to use a deep moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> There are clay mask out there that comes with such a high price tag</li>
            <li> Short of using a blender, I am not sure it can be mixed to a smooth, consistent, spreadable texture.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for multiple uses.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this a couple times a week to deep cleansing.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for a facial as well as use in a detox bath (1 cup clay, 2 cups cider vinegar, and 2 cups epsom salts or epsom and</li>
            <li> Feel free to enjoy the paluse feeling as long as the clay surface is still dark green and in chunky pieces.  </li>
            <li> Feel free to enjoy the paluse feeling as long as the clay surface is still dark green and in chunky pieces.  </li>
            <li> Afterward, my face was slightly red but my pores instantly felt smaller and my skin looked VERY VERY CLEAR!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff does not mess around, it truly purges your skin and can be alarming at first.  </li>
            <li> First few times all it did was make my face super dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently pregnant and all the hormones have made a mess of my skin.</li>
            <li> It does Dry up pretty quickly on your face and it can be messy taking it off.</li>
            <li> Most people freak when they break out worse when using a new product.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to make too much of you&#x27;re new to this stuff.</li>
            <li> In fact, I just bought a new jar after having the old one last for 16 years.</li>
            <li> In 3 days my back was clear!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes so little to make up enough for one application, I&#x27;m sure that the one pound jar will last me quite some time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the apple vinegar is totally an acting agent with helping but out of every mask and acne product I have ever used, this is the only thing that has ever shown the fastest results and gotten rid of those mountainous zits in a speedier manner.t&#x27;s still a little puffy</li>
            <li> This does major wonders for my hair, skin, and teeth!</li>
            <li> Spread over clean, dry face, let dry.  </li>
            <li> It really does pulsate, and it really will freeze your face into whatever position you lie in for half an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking apply way less makeup the next day - smooth.</li>
            <li> Anyway I applied it liberally in that area, and also in the eyelid crease and lightly on about the upper half of the eyelid itself.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised, it did dry up fast.</li>
            <li> and it sucks up too much oil, too quickly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely will firm your skin, but is strong.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it on the frequent to know of its true effects, but the first time i did use it, it dried out all my existing pimples!!!</li>
            <li> how much but too much clay makes it too hard and too much water makes it too watery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also not very messy.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oiy skin with very large pores and being 42, I have tried everything to address these issues.</li>
            <li> I took antibiotics, had a special shampoo to wash with and the infection on my upper back would not clear up.</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel SO soft and my pores were noticeably smaller and very clear.</li>
            <li> Product left my skin very sensitive, think twice if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I used it with the Bragg Organic Apple Cider Vinegar, mixing it in a small bowl to a whipped, smooth consistency and keeping it on in a thin layer until all parts were dry (a good time to shave your legs).</li>
            <li> So, I mixed up a half cup of the clay with equal parts aloe vera juice (for best PH level) little by little until it had a pudding-like consistency.</li>
            <li> So the first time I used this , my preteen daughters and I got little salsa bowls and our apple cider vinegar from the kitchen and headed upstairs to the bathroom, I grabbed a older foundation brush</li>
            <li> Love how much my pores have reduced,my blackheads are all but gone and I&#x27;ve not glad a single white head.</li>
            <li> have extremely huge pores, and oil pours out of them excessively.</li>
            <li> This made 3 different skin types soft, shiny, soft, and clear.</li>
            <li> One bottle lasts a long time, its very potent.&lt;br /&gt;--Make</li>
            <li> Which should be the minimum time given for any product to really do their job as it takes a long time for skin cell turnover.ess for some people?</li>
            <li> Which should be the minimum time given for any product to really do their job as it takes a long time for skin cell turnover.</li>
            <li> And I am switching over to foxbrim vitamin C lotion natural moisturizer on my face instead of the bare minerals to see how that works.</li>
            <li> It takes soooooo long and so much water to get it off.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin clean and soft in less than ten minutes.</li>
            <li> Just know how much and how long you wanna keep it on your face.</li>
            <li> It just really really really itches if you leave it on too long.</li>
            <li> so no more free or discounted stuff for me :&amp;lt;</li>
            <li> so even though I generally get it from the manufacturer directly I went ahead and ordered it to have on hand.</li>
            <li> Very drying so don&#x27;t leave on too long.</li>
            <li> I have only had a chance to use this once so far, but I&#x27;m already wondering why in the world I&#x27;ve been paying as much as I have for GlamGlow, Arbonne and other masks that don&#x27;t do nearly as much as this one does in one use.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper to make my own mask out of the same ingredients used in the expensive tubes of clay mask.  </li>
            <li> Apply as much paste as you can on your face and let sit for as long as you can!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Take a small ceramic ramekin (2 inch) and a popsicle stick to stir and smooth out lumps with apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> This and a bottle of apple cider vinegar are more than enough to last for a few months.</li>
            <li> I woke up an hour later barely able to open my mouth because it dried up on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> normally I have to get a facial for it to come out.  </li>
            <li> The directions say redness is normal and should last about 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> The directions say redness is normal and should last about 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I use it as a full facial and shower it off, and other times I mix a minute quantity and just dab it on blemishes -</li>
            <li> I instantly followed up with my normal Ponds moisturising cream.</li>
            <li> I must say, I didn&#x27;t expect anything when I tried this clay, but I definitely saw a difference from what my hair normally does.</li>
            <li> but like it says in 30min will go back to normal..</li>
            <li> I am very much excited to start my first review with AZTEC SECRET INDIAN HEALING CLAY.</li>
            <li> I read that it was normal for your face to be red.</li>
            <li> so its def something to use at night to give your face time to go back to normal color.</li>
            <li> first time I used this I was so excited, but when I saw that it was a powder, I was a bit confused.</li>
            <li> exactly what I expected yay thank you</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know enough about clays to know if that is normal or not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you are back to normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this masque consistently (every two days) and now those scars are a distant memory and those clogged pores are no longer there.</li>
            <li> for my skin to return back to normal.  </li>
            <li> it was back to normal.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing more embarrasing than having red inflamed spots build up on your face as you watch it slowly destroy your confidence and ultimately, your face.</li>
            <li> I use it with organic apple cider vinegar (1/2 tbsp each) and I wash my face with cetaphil normal skin facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> Your face will be red afterwards, it&#x27;s normal, it&#x27;s the blood being pulled to the surface of your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your face will be red afterwards, it&#x27;s normal, it&#x27;s the blood being pulled to the surface of your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I would be back to normal.</li>
            <li> My skin looked pink at first and got progressively redder...</li>
            <li> It was alarming at first, but I&#x27;m use to it now.</li>
            <li> This can be alarming at first, but rest assured that the redness *</li>
            <li> This can be alarming at first, but rest assured that the redness *</li>
            <li> I guess this is normal since this is a deep pore product so it cleans, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I know that it&#x27;s normal for your face to turn red after taking off the mask</li>
            <li> It actually made my skin look &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; opposed to the oily look I normally have.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t cleanse with your normal cleanser after rinsing this off just let it do its job with regular water.</li>
            <li> I use a flat paintbrush to apply the mud and a hot washcloth to remove it twenty minutes later.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I broke out but that was to be expected because of everything it was pulling out of my skin.  </li>
            <li> That evening or the next morning I return to my normal routine.</li>
            <li> It actually looks normal.</li>
            <li> I used this as a full face mask a few times and didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> This morning I only had to put a small amount of BB cream and a very light amount of powder on my face (I am considering looking into home-making natural makeup as my next project).</li>
            <li> The dry powder requires no refrigeration, and will certainly stay fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Afterward my skin felt tight and smooth but, my cheeks are really red and looked almost burn.  </li>
            <li> This product help clean deep into my pores, The reason why I gave it 4 stars is because the only thing I didn&#x27;t like is the smell of the product on your face, especially you have to go out of your way to get Apple Vinegar Cider just for the item to actually work on your face compared to using water.</li>
            <li> skin care routine is very low key -- I use Bioderma and Neutrogena face wipes to take off my make up (only on days that I wear make up), then I use the clarasonic mia and cetaphil daily face wash to clean my skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff helped to slightly, this isn&#x27;t a miracle mask, reduce the appearance and that&#x27;s after the first use!</li>
            <li> I had a little redness afterwards but it went away quickly.</li>
            <li> Sounds like a dumb thing to say, but the directions on the jar are very accurate.</li>
            <li> Lift, Firm, Tighten Facial Skin and Fade Fine Lines - 1.5oz]]</li>
            <li> is becoming less oily.skin never went dry</li>
            <li> and this helps calm my cysts down .</li>
            <li> It took weeks to get it to calm down after using it once.</li>
            <li> I promise it&#x27;s worth driving down to the store to buy apple cider vinegar (I use braggs).</li>
            <li> The first time I used this I noticed how soft my skin was but had a few new breakouts after use.</li>
            <li> However, if you only want to use it on a certain portion of your face and you use it sparingly, you could easily double this usage.</li>
            <li> I usually put this mask on right after I take a hot shower to open up my pores and this product will pulsate and the vinegar will sting you</li>
            <li> I guess ancient Aztecs, fleeing the crushing defeat of Spaniard conquerors, took only the essentials: such as, their Indian clay recipe and a goat for milk, keeping the secret safe for future generations of oily-skinned men such as myself.</li>
            <li> never had \\&quot;trouble\\&quot; skin except large pores &amp; they&#x27;re starting to get smaller -</li>
            <li> This may sound a little gross but this dirt or &amp;#34;clay&amp;#34; literally sucked out the blackheads on my nose &amp; on my face.</li>
            <li> Once it dries, you can gently peel it off a little bit at a time, or scrape it off gently.</li>
            <li> first time I used it I was waiting for the mask to dry completely, which isn&#x27;t necessary-</li>
            <li> If used consistently as directed the skin will be less likely to breakout, but if not, the whole process must happen again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You get THE EXACT same results in the tightening of your pores as you would with the typical method of letting it sit until it&#x27;s all cracked and ready to wash</li>
            <li> You get THE EXACT same results in the tightening of your pores as you would with the typical method of letting it sit until it&#x27;s all cracked and ready to wash</li>
            <li> I have used sodium bentonite for face masks and it&#x27;s really hard to apply as it tends to ball up and not spread easily.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no more acne and the scarring is fading away fast!!!</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s a very THICK mask, it&#x27;s best to just hop in a shower, whereas a thin mask may be washed off at the sink.&lt;br /&gt;6.</li>
            <li> I bought this product simply because nearly every single review was stellar.</li>
            <li> Also, due to the light, powdery nature of the dry product I recommend holding your breath when opening the lid.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I use this and we can see the black heads and other guk rise to the top of our skin in a day or so.  </li>
            <li> the only down side is that it took more than 30 min for the mask to dry.</li>
            <li> I have only used this twice, but judging from other reviews, if it&#x27;s going to work it works quickly, and that was not the case with me.</li>
            <li> It cleaned my face, when it dried I loved the feeling of the hard clay cracking.</li>
            <li> used different clay masks before ranging from very low price to very high.</li>
            <li> So my new objective was to shrink my pores.  </li>
            <li> I deep conditioned after and my hair has new life to it.</li>
            <li> and recently I was in New York for about a week and didn&#x27;t get to use the mask at all.</li>
            <li> and recently I was in New York for about a week and didn&#x27;t get to use the mask at all.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely one of those I can&#x27;t live without.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ever use this during winter months, especially if you live up north.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m hesitant to try new things on my skin, especially on my face.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m hesitant to try new things on my skin, especially on my face.</li>
            <li> Using all of the above has cleared up my skin and are preventing new ones</li>
            <li> A day later I had 4 new blemishes.</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller, acne size is reduced and amount of new acne forming is reduced after using it.</li>
            <li> so you may see new pimple development subsequently</li>
            <li> Makes an incredible face mask when mixed with ACV (don&#x27;t use water, it clumps)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels tight and a little weird when using but worth it!</li>
            <li> I will probably have to use this product a few more times to actually see distinct results because I am currently on antibiotics and using some other facial products.</li>
            <li> pulsating/tightening is really noticeable the longer the mask is on and starts to dry up.  </li>
            <li> Your face really does pulsate once it begins to dry</li>
            <li> My skin is noticably smoother, its helping to dry acne much faster than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> I never thought of it, but it is reducing my scarring by at least 80% - and very, very quickly.</li>
            <li> I never thought of it, but it is reducing my scarring by at least 80% - and very, very quickly.</li>
            <li> I think I probably put too much on because as it started to dry, I looked like a golem that was falling apart.</li>
            <li> I have found cocunut oil has really helped me since my skin is dry from a laser procedure.</li>
            <li> When dry, I put my face under the surface of the water and rub gently with my hands and it comes off in the water.  </li>
            <li> This mask starts to dry fast</li>
            <li> My face is really itchy and I just can&#x27;t wait for it to dry</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin around my t-zone, and the rest of my face is fairly dry.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin glow but also makes it feel dry for a day no matter how much moisturizer I use.</li>
            <li> The idea of dry granules and adding liquid at each use sounded like a promising solution.  </li>
            <li> have oily skin so this really helped dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> This clay mask is the real deal, as the mask began to dry on my face, I could feel the tension and pulling.  </li>
            <li> I always mix this with apple cider vinegar when I use it, and you really will feel your skin pulsate as it starts to dry.</li>
            <li> Gently pat dry your face &amp; apply coconut oil &amp; massage</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a whole lot from this, especially as I&#x27;ve tried what feels like everything for my acne prone skin for the last 15 years.</li>
            <li> I went through a period of acne when I first started using it, but it didn&#x27;t last long...</li>
            <li> My facial muscles felt very relaxed as well as if i did went to a spa and did a deep pore cleansing facial,so i gave another star for that.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> I used it last night and still this morning, my fast is red and burns when I wash it.</li>
            <li> I recently straighten my natural hair (naturally curly) and my hair was severely heat damaged .</li>
            <li> I only kept it on for ten minutes, but this stuff still did so much for me.</li>
            <li> My skin is red for about 30 minutes after, but not a big deal because it doesn&#x27;t hurt or look unusual.  </li>
            <li> Just now getting around to reviewing because I just recently started using it and the one I put based is no longer available so it would be a waste to leave a review on that</li>
            <li> You could definitely get this at your local whole foods store for around $6</li>
            <li> When I apply the clay straight to my face, it makes my face get red, especially as I wash it</li>
            <li> I am 20 years old and still have issues with my skin and am constantly looking for something to clear out and help my conplexion.</li>
            <li> it left my skin soft and clear.</li>
            <li> After I wash it off, my face is a bit red for a few minutes, but extremely smooth.</li>
            <li> Did the facial and definitely felt something, don&#x27;t really know if it works, I&#x27;m not one of those health nuts that will praise the stuff</li>
            <li> I am left with dewy, smooth, firm face.  </li>
            <li> I always remove it within 10 minutes - just 5 isn&#x27;t enough time for it to try much but anymore would leave me very red.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-reduce white heads with proper gentle exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although i don&#x27;t use it everyday like i should, i really enjoy the deep cleansing treatment of this product.  </li>
            <li> I suffered from a massive breakout and had lots of bumps, zits, and scars that left my face very blotchy and red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will take a few more tries to get used to it on my face.  </li>
            <li> So far all i can tell you is my skin is soft, and rather red.</li>
            <li> Bottom line is this mask actually works for pore cleansing and it is really the only product I&#x27;ve used that does.</li>
            <li> to know how much should I put on my face so that the mask won&#x27;t crack within the first few minutes?!</li>
            <li> I picked this up at my local Whole Foods after reading several reviews.</li>
            <li> After my skin feels so soft and not dry at all.</li>
            <li> (you only really need about 1.5 or 2 tbs max) of the powdered Aztec clay in a zip loc bag and then added equal parts Apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> I just recently went out and purchased a pound from a local Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> But how much would you expect from such a low price clay?</li>
            <li> The Aztec Secret has thus far given me more noticeable results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you put it on thick, parts of it are easy to scrape/peel</li>
            <li> I am really glad that I read majority of the good reviews, I had terrible acne and blackhead</li>
            <li> It did feel like my face was totally drawn up when it was drying, kinda weird feeling but good, like it was tightening everything</li>
            <li> My hair is so thick and strong.</li>
            <li> I use it again to help drain out whatever is left (since it pretty much always opens up the pimple after taking the mask off)and then if it&#x27;s still a little puffy or I just want it to scab over and heal even faster, I&#x27;ll use the mixture one</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I rinsed it off, my face was much more tight, closed pores, and felt fresher!</li>
            <li> It can be very, very drying, especially if, like myself, you are also applying topical acne medications like clindamycin and retinoid cream at the same time.</li>
            <li> My skin was very soft and the pores seem smaller.</li>
            <li> Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, and Leven Rose Jojoba Oil, Organic 100% Pure Cold Pressed Unrefined Natural.  </li>
            <li> More is not necessarily better, remember, the clay removes EVERYTHING from your skin - the good and the bad.  </li>
            <li> Lets see how my skin reacts with general usage!</li>
            <li> everytime i broke out,after useing the clay the next day my skin was almost clear!</li>
            <li> Your pores are open and clear!</li>
            <li> My sister was going thru a major hormonal acne phase.</li>
            <li> I have to use it in conjunction with other things; first, I scrub my skin with an exfoliant.</li>
            <li> The blackheads have been loosened and suctioned up enough by the mask that the strips can completely finish the job!</li>
            <li> It deep cleans and makes my skin sooooo soft!</li>
            <li> but after I rinsed it off and all through the next day, my skin felt baby soft!  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m just an impatient person and that&#x27;s a long time for me to not be able to open my mouth or talk.</li>
            <li> Not sure what this stuff is actually doing to my skin, but using it once a week has definitely resulted in fewer zits and better skin tone and texture.  </li>
            <li> First I want to say that, I am not a \\&quot;paid\\&quot; reviewer, as I once also doubted it about the the other reviewers.</li>
            <li> However, the other reviews of this product&#x27;s effectiveness are stellar, and that&#x27;s what convinced me to buy.  </li>
            <li> Testing all kinds of products on my face is a major part of my work, and I&#x27;ve done some hair brained stuff to it.  </li>
            <li> since i&#x27;ve used it, i&#x27;ve seen major improvements in my skin</li>
            <li> Since it was my first time , I only left it only about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t fit my oily skin at all!!</li>
            <li> #34;can&#x27;t move your face at all without splitting it&amp;#34;) and then washing it off (which as other reviewers have noted,</li>
            <li> and I must say that this clay mask works like no other.</li>
            <li> and if you don&#x27;t see major improvements, email me or contact me somehow</li>
            <li> and if you don&#x27;t see major improvements, email me or contact me somehow</li>
            <li> I did not notice a difference after the first, second, third, fourth, or fifth use.</li>
            <li> I have major acne prone skin</li>
            <li> The 4th reason is pretty important to me &amp; those who suffer from something similar or maybe worse.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only done this mud wash twice so far!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only done this mud wash twice so far!  </li>
            <li> NO other product that I am EVER used makes me shine they way this does.  </li>
            <li> I seen a major difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I found the first time I made way too much and made it far too thick.</li>
            <li> I used it every other day at first, and after three uses (about a week,)</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and usually when I wake up in the morning my face is pretty oily, this morning, my face was no where near as oily as it normally is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a blush brush to apply the mixture, I didn&#x27;t want to get it all over my hands</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, was exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I mixed it with a generic brand of apple cider vinegar, and my face got really red and itchy after I rinsed the clay off.</li>
            <li> This product, on the other had, does exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li> First use made my skin extremely itchy.</li>
            <li> I noticed a major improvement in my skin&#x27;s clarity, suppleness and even a firmer tone.  </li>
            <li> The first time I left this on, I left it on for 10 minutes and it essentially burned my skin.</li>
            <li> : if you&#x27;re not careful, you can clog your sink with this!</li>
            <li> : if you&#x27;re not careful, you can clog your sink with this!</li>
            <li> I am a ceramics major, so I know how clay works.</li>
            <li> Left my face really soft!</li>
            <li> Ill try to be more presistant with it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time using this clay was a week ago &amp; the last two times was back to back</li>
            <li> My New Year&#x27;s resolution is to do this mask at least once a week to get the full benefits long-term.</li>
            <li> This product not only came right when I expected it</li>
            <li> I had spent equal parts of the  day on my feet and falling repeated on my right forearm and hip.  </li>
            <li> Once I rinse, I make a concoction of jojoba oil spiked with lavender essential oil to calm it down and this ritual has helped clear up and beautify my complexion.</li>
            <li> spots(the spots apply several times per day at first), let dry for 35 mins and rub of with dry washcloth, or soak of sore areas with wet cool wash cloth.</li>
            <li> skin type is pretty dry - if I don&#x27;t use enough moisturizer it gets oily in efforts to make up for the lack of moisture -</li>
            <li> He ended up wearing it the full 20 minutes and was only complaining of slight itching around his nose.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels really tight and fresh after I used it the 1st time.</li>
            <li> It feels like your skin is being pulled tight, and you cannot smile or move your face.</li>
            <li> As some other reviewers have noted, nothing drastic happened the first week, if anything I felt like I was breaking out more, but after the clay pulled everything out of my face, it calmed down, was smoother, and less oily.</li>
            <li> using [[ASIN:B001I7MVG0 Bragg Apple Cider Vinegar Organic Raw -- 32 fl oz]] (mixed up WAY too much, 1/2 cup of each, maybe even less, would have been MORE than sufficient).  </li>
            <li> No issues with it so far, except the mess (that&#x27;s expected, you&#x27;re basically playing with fine dirt).</li>
            <li> I first noticed this product because of the almost absurd number of great reviews and I was skeptical at first, but after trying it I feel like I might&#x27;ve just jumped on the bandwagon too 😊</li>
            <li> I then wet several soft paper towels with warm water and wiped it off slowly, throwing all of the chunks into the trash.</li>
            <li> vit E. Skin will be a little red ,100% clean.</li>
            <li> and it took my black heads right now also</li>
            <li> I mixed it with raw organic vinegar and it made my face feel so clean and soft.</li>
            <li> while it leaves my face glowing it has a very funky smell, also remember to moisturize after you put it on because it can dry out your skin!</li>
            <li> I have never had cystic acne, but I have always had many black heads and white heads, as well as closed comedones.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this felt any &#x27;tighter&#x27; or &amp;#34;pulsing&amp;#34; than any other I&#x27;ve used and involves more messy preparation.  </li>
            <li> it could be due to the loss of top dead skin</li>
            <li> It is a slightly messy product to use compared to a pre-made mask, but i will say it works better than any other pre-made mask iv used.</li>
            <li> According to some other reviews [ and believe me i read a novel&#x27;s worth before i broke out my ten bucks ], you aren&#x27;t supposed to mix with metal because it&#x27;ll react with the vinegar.</li>
            <li> I used it with few drops of cider vinegar and mix thoroughly and used as masque, better than other items you bought at stores which I tried before I switch to this.</li>
            <li> Dont use as much as the container says (it recommends 1/4 - 1/2 inch thick) and dont be freaked out when your face is super red after washing it off.</li>
            <li> Compared to the other clays I&#x27;ve tried this is the thickest when rinsing off and you must apply a thick layer for the clay to be effective.</li>
            <li> I tempted to buy this due to good reviews; however, my skin broken out after used this product twice.</li>
            <li> Then I get a big serving bowl and fill it will HOT water and use a face cloth to steam the mud loose to where it is easier to wipe off.  </li>
            <li> I waited the full 20 minutes and washed off with warm water and then very cold rinse.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with raw unfiltered ACV and it does bubble up and become smooth.</li>
            <li> It worth in this price, will have little oil spot came out.</li>
            <li> I use Bragg&#x27;s apple cider vinegar and I add more of the clay rather than the half to half ratio</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month already and my skin has gotten better with less black heads and zits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different masks and face packs, including most recently the Shea Moisture African Black Soap cream mask.</li>
            <li> I found the less skin care products I sue, and the less ingredients they have the better my skin looks.</li>
            <li> I found the less skin care products I sue, and the less ingredients they have the better my skin looks.</li>
            <li> Make my face clean and stuff, but it&#x27;s does get kind of annoying when trying to take this stuff off your face, since you can&#x27;t just wash your face in the sink, because it will clog it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only bought 2 before this but will keep doing it because its amazing and very natural, especially when I use raw apple cider vinegar for half the liquid.</li>
            <li> I use two teaspoons of each clay powder and ACV, because I&#x27;ve found that the mask DOES work better if you put it on very thickly.</li>
            <li> My daily skin routine consists of first cleansing with Cetaphil Gentle Face Cleanser, to using Trader Joe&#x27;s Organic Raw Honey as a mask for about 10-15 minutes, and then mixing Apple Cider Vinegar along with the Aztec Clay powder to wear as a mask for about 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li> used organic apple cider vinegar, and I&#x27;m not sure how much of a difference that makes, but I wanted to use pure ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I am a 33-year old Black female with problem skin, and this stuff right here....is a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> Comes in large tub and the powder you mix with water or vinegar will last a long time.</li>
            <li> You have to work so hard to get this on smoothly without putting clumps of clay on your face.</li>
            <li> I am currently deployed and my skin is super dry and was not soft.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and my pores are so tiny that I can barely see them!</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and my pores are so tiny that I can barely see them!</li>
            <li> so I followed the treatment with a full facial steam for 20 minutes and then applied a little chilled aloe vera gel before going to bed.</li>
            <li> Also, I had to pimples that were kind of sore and raw near my lip, and they have dried up and are no longer red.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what is it so special about this product.</li>
            <li> This is the only problem that I&#x27;m having right now, other than that.</li>
            <li> but overall the experience for a high end facial</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone and everyone, and my teenage nieces can&#x27;t wait for our next girls night to try it out!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even need to use the whole little dish, so I popped the lid on and it sealed the moisture very well for the next use!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little messy the first couple of times, but once you learn how to mix it, it&#x27;s not bad (the clumpiness is a pain though).</li>
            <li> I made way too much mask the first time, and it hardly made a dent in the tub of clay</li>
            <li> I have extreme problem areas with acne on my chin, and this product has dried them up right after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I smear it down just below my jaw line so it can get the top of my neck where I get little bumps sometimes.</li>
            <li> My  skin gets super red and tight afterward.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a powder that you have to mix with either RAW Apple Cider or Water (I&#x27;ve heard you can also use Cranberry juice if you have SUPER oily skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and other than the temporary redness afterwards, this is gentle enough for me!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and then searched the internet for other reviews, everything looked positive.</li>
            <li> I am hopeful that continued use will reveal other positive changes to my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certain that this tub will last me a long time!</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like the smell of vinegar in general anyways,</li>
            <li> The clay DID tighten and refine pores in general, however.  </li>
            <li> OILS - I use 2 drops of each oil and generally use 1-2 oils per mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a woman, or I guess for anyone in general having skin issues on the face can lower your self-esteem.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting regular facials to try and clear my skin but to no avail.</li>
            <li> Not only did this clear my skin</li>
            <li> Made my pores smaller but didn&#x27;t really clear up my blackheads.</li>
            <li> I finally saw a dermatologist that helped clear up about 75% of the acne I already had.</li>
            <li> It has cleared up those bumps and had left my skin clear and glowing.</li>
            <li> This clay will clear all your acne, blackheads, white heads, cystic acne, and tighten your pores.</li>
            <li> It definitely helped clear my clogged pores.  </li>
            <li> It definitely seemed to clear up my skin and tighten it.</li>
            <li> My pores are getting smaller &amp; my face is clear of any pimples.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; the next times I simply put on a layer that was not stingy but not thick</li>
            <li> This is a very generous amount for the price and will surely last a long time.</li>
            <li> 100 Facials in 1 bottle (even though the description on the back says about 10-15), keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li> second time I used apple cider vinegar, hoping to clear my blackheads.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to help clear out my pores,  especially in my T-zone.</li>
            <li> It helped clear my skin up after only two masks.</li>
            <li> But by the second week of using this, my face began to clear up.</li>
            <li> After putting it on my blackheads a second time my nose was COMPLETELY clear-</li>
            <li> After putting it on my blackheads a second time my nose was COMPLETELY clear-</li>
            <li> I used this product last week and my face has been clear.</li>
            <li> i pulled through it though and its starting to clear out.</li>
            <li> It has always left my skin smooth and any breakouts disappeared usually within a day.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry about the smell, after you get past the initial gag reflex, it&#x27;s smooth sailin&#x27;.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re seeking clear skin, LOOK NO FURTHER.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s with average skin and never had THIS kind of acne before.</li>
            <li> for my mostly clear skin with some deep clogging on areas like nose and chin, it didn&#x27;t do anything whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Even if my skin would clear from one pimple, another one would spawn shortly afterwards.</li>
            <li> my skin feels so soft after using and my pores look smaller.</li>
            <li> After I gave birth to my first child, my skin erupted in horrible cystic acne that required months of oral and topical antibiotics to treat (I had flawless skin prior to pregnancy, even through my adolescence</li>
            <li> but so far I&#x27;ve only used it on my face.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old son suffered from acne the last 2 years.  </li>
            <li> If you make too much it will mildew so to prevent this put it in a bowl with a lid and store any unused wet product in your freezer.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and it did not leave me red at all!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a burning sensation at all, which I was worried about since I have such sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product since 2/15 (7 days) only skipping once so far</li>
            <li> Then I use a wet face towel to gently wipe along the hairline.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old son has teen acne and once I had him convinced he gave it a try</li>
            <li> I was so surprised to see my shipment left at my front door one day.</li>
            <li> As far as its effectiveness as a facial mask, it does its job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m in my mid twenties, been suffering mild/aggressive acne since my early teens.</li>
            <li> I have only tried the mask once so far.</li>
            <li> I barely have acne.</li>
            <li> and they have reduced in size to where you can barely see them.</li>
            <li> Completely got rid of blackheads and my skin is definitely softer and clearer.</li>
            <li> I bought it it to help get rid of blackheads, which it barely did.</li>
            <li> Then I got in the shower, wet my hair and started squooshing it in, section by section, from root to tip, until my whole head was done.</li>
            <li> next day, my skin was SO soft.</li>
            <li> next day, my skin was SO soft.</li>
            <li> I completely followed the directions (mix equal parts) and added 1/3 cup of the clay to 1/3 cup apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> I could feel this pulsating action and the skin was noticeably different after once</li>
            <li> Nearly 12 hours later my skin is STILL squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve barely put a dent in it</li>
            <li> And this has kept it under control so far, and after about the third time using it, has brought out smoother skin that i have not felt in years.</li>
            <li> and there really isn&#x27;t any different results from my basic facial cleansers.</li>
            <li> that said, I&#x27;ve only used the product once so far (just got it tonight)</li>
            <li> My 9 year old only uses it on her chin, where she is prone to blackheads.  </li>
            <li> Works really well but be careful when you use it.</li>
            <li> Then 2 weeks later, my skin completely dries out and feels like sandpaper after I wash my face.</li>
            <li> My skin is feeling baby soft, but it is still red after 20 minutes of the mask being off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a brown skinned woman early forties who has found that from time to time I need a stronger facial cleaner and this product is it.</li>
            <li> You will still get the same cleaning effect, but your skin will look far nicer afterward.</li>
            <li> You will definitely not regret this modest purchase that will pay off so beautifully!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have barely put a dent into my supple.</li>
            <li> I use bare minerals makeup again and it helps a bit.</li>
            <li> recommend this product for everyone who would like a natural way of deep cleaning your skin.</li>
            <li> I completely forgot I ordered this and pulled it out last month</li>
            <li> Natural Anti-Wrinkle, Facial Lift Skin Care Formula - 1.5oz]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve barely put a dent in it so</li>
            <li> I actually bought this because of the reviews, and so far the product has done its work.</li>
            <li> but wow I can appreciate a deep cleaning on my face since I work in healthcare</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive but the only reaction I have</li>
            <li> Recently I have been researching DIY mud masks, and this product was mentioned frequently.</li>
            <li> Love this product and I recommend it, there is no reason for buying expensive creams to clear your skin, even my 18 year old daughter is using it twice  week</li>
            <li> sometimes the clay falls off before it dries completely (and you go through the product faster, which isn&#x27;t necessary).  </li>
            <li> It is all natural and it&#x27;s the cheapest thing you&#x27;ll find that actually does its job.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t believe this piece of crap got such great ratings unless the company has really changed</li>
            <li> Natural is the ONLY way to go in way of skin care, some people might disagree with my there, but</li>
            <li> Not only has this saved me lots of money, but I have almost completely rid myself of my skin irritations.</li>
            <li> and when I opened it I was not careful</li>
            <li> So as a 22 year old female college student, I break out here and there(usually stress or hormones).</li>
            <li> Really dries out your skin to the point where it drinks up all of your moisturizer, but that&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li> so busy that I forgot about the facial</li>
            <li> , it won&#x27;t rid of them completely since mine are very deep</li>
            <li> but like I said I could definitely feel a difference in how soft my skin was afterwards.</li>
            <li> Only used it once so far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 21 year old male, college student.</li>
            <li> is completely healed by the next day.</li>
            <li> is completely healed by the next day.</li>
            <li> The only mask to use for sensitive, acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that it makes my inflamed acne disappear overnight, but it definitely makes my skin feel really soft.  </li>
            <li> Gently press the wet paper towel against your face with your hands to allow water to seep into the mask.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> Expected a ready to use product.</li>
            <li> I barely ever had acne.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once so far</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a 27 year old, female.</li>
            <li> My skin feels baby soft and it&#x27;s spa quality for a tiny fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, I would recommend you use water, because this will turn your face red.</li>
            <li> This did not irritate my sensitive skin - Very deep cleansing</li>
            <li> Apparently MY face can take the burn</li>
            <li> Makes your skin really soft and definitely clears up pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one to do facials since my skin is so sensitive, but I wanted a product that would give me the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well to start off I am a 24 year old female...</li>
            <li> I did this with 50/50 vinegar and water, and I cannot remember the last time that I had skin this incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li> I was thinking about going to a spa to have a facial to have them professionally removed.</li>
            <li> The clay will get stuck in your drains if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> Too frequent of use will hinder its healing effects, it doesn&#x27;t get proper time to do the healing.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I haven&#x27;t used it enough to be wow&#x27;d.</li>
            <li> Last night I had a breakout near my lip.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a chronic pimple picker, so I got up close and personal with a mirror and examined nearly every pore I could find.  </li>
            <li> Then I took it off with a wet rag and put on a gentle moisturizer</li>
            <li> I leave it on about ten minutes per the labels suggestion for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Because I feel like I could have got this much much sooner than the expected arrival</li>
            <li> In this case you will not waste product or end up making another batch because you didn&#x27;t make enough.  </li>
            <li> and it just doesn&#x27;t have the same WOW factor.</li>
            <li> I barely get oily skin throughout the day anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once and so far</li>
            <li> Tried this from a friends recommendation and felt my pores open up considerably.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smear it all over my face each time, just every third time so far.</li>
            <li> This is very upsetting for me, since I have spent a ton of money trying to get rid of acne, and just got close to succeeding when I decided to try this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 28 yr old female with oily breakout prone skin.</li>
            <li> I wish someone would have told me about this product a lot sooner in my journey to grow natural hair, because I truly feel I would be a lot further along than I am now.</li>
            <li> I actually put jojoba oil in it once a day (and wow my face brightens up)I get up</li>
            <li> As a facial mask, it&#x27;s quite refreshing and leaves you feeling transformed... at least for the short term.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only tried mixing it with water, not apple cider vinegar yet.</li>
            <li> it tightens your face to the point where you can barely speak.  </li>
            <li> However, be careful with too much use.  </li>
            <li> There were barely anymore bumps on my chin</li>
            <li> There were barely anymore bumps on my chin</li>
            <li> my teenage daughter developed some age-related acne, this product worked wonders for her.  </li>
            <li> It was recommended to use with apple cider vinegar, which I did, and not only did it smell out my entire house (and scare my 6yr old son), but it did nothing to clear up my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it on my hair so far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently mixing with ACV and lemon juice to fade an old tattoo.</li>
            <li> But makes it feel soft the following day.</li>
            <li> Have only used it once so far</li>
            <li> As an educated consumer, I am continually on a quest to find natural products/remedies for various things; especially when it comes to skin care as I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve used this item as both a facial mask and on an insect bite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> By this morning, you can barely even see it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed an improvement in my complexion within 24 hours and after three days of use the acne cysts were nearly invisible under makeup (which included a yellow blemish cover stick).</li>
            <li> SO FAR ONLY BOUGHT 1..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming the stresses of a transitioning adult figuring life out finally took a toll on my skin.  </li>
            <li> You can scratch your face if not careful.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used this product twice</li>
            <li> I have only used it a couple times so far</li>
            <li> The first time, I don&#x27;t think I left it on long enough.</li>
            <li> it left my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this only once so far - on my face.</li>
            <li> This product unclogged pores that a professional facial could not.</li>
            <li> However, on my hair (4c natural) I would only recommend using this once a month.</li>
            <li> Also, I used regular old apple cider vinegar but will use organic in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it exfoliates as well as deep cleanses so your skin will be as soft as a baby&#x27;s when you use this</li>
            <li> The burn was similar to a sunburn, and took a couple of days to completely fade.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and red or peeling skin</li>
            <li> B00VSF4T26 Skingenixx Complete Exfoliating Facial Cleanser!]]</li>
            <li> Only used once so far.  </li>
            <li> I am 21 years old, male.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 23 years old and my skin took a beating from teenage acne.</li>
            <li> Has overall helped to brighten my skin and help lighten some old acne scars</li>
            <li> Because of his sensitive skin we&#x27;ll only do this one a week.</li>
            <li> left it on for about 10 minutes, since I have sensitive skin, and washed it off in the shower.</li>
            <li> Very deep cleaning and loving the way my skin has been feeling lately and also how closed</li>
            <li> Left my face red, but the jar says that is normal.  </li>
            <li> But the next day, my face what back to normal (almost as if I hadn&#x27;t even used it).</li>
            <li> And yes, your face will get a bit red, but it lasts for about 10 min for me then back to normal.  </li>
            <li> I used this product maybe everyday for the first week and then every two or three days ever since then(it&#x27;s been almost 2 months so far</li>
            <li> ahead, use this ancient beauty secret and enjoy your glowing skin!</li>
            <li> I also found while applying, trying to add more to thin areas, it kinda removed what I had already put on, smeared it off to the point I could see my skin.  </li>
            <li> (didn&#x27;t make it better or worse).</li>
            <li> I discovered Aztec Secret 10 years ago and was glad to find I could order it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> A thin layer works just as well :)</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ll give it one more try &amp; see if it makes it worse or</li>
            <li> the top was broken so about 1/3 cup was in the b ox</li>
            <li> I applied a really thick layer the first time, and didn&#x27;t see much results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it isss extremely messy but its worth it.</li>
            <li> Do you know if you see worse results before it gets better?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a cool product that I&#x27;ll probably be using for the next few years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not great, it&#x27;s not awful.</li>
            <li> By the time your week is up you notice your skin looking kind of sad</li>
            <li> Yes it is messy but for how well it works, it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I read that it gets worse before it gets better</li>
            <li> OK the worse is over after fanning my face for 30 minute</li>
            <li> Its better to apply it thinly</li>
            <li> If you make a thick layer it&#x27;ll start drying out fast at the edges first, which results in pulling on the skin on the edges.</li>
            <li> id say you should exfoliate after you use this stuff, and it will get worse before it gets better.</li>
            <li> just remember it&#x27;s gotta get worse before it gets better ...</li>
            <li> I have researched and found that these clays can make your skin worse before it gets better because it is drawing out toxins.  </li>
            <li> That was the most frustrating part for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of uncomfortable to have on for me.</li>
            <li> Can be somewhat messy, what what isn&#x27;t that&#x27;s worth doing these days?</li>
            <li> had some hormonal acne that was slowly going away with light glycolic acid peels, but I wanted faster results.</li>
            <li> I can feel it working its secret Magic on my skin.</li>
            <li> Its a bit messy but worth it.</li>
            <li> think take a small finger full and put it on my face and then move it around in a circular motion as this helps to break up the clumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i have more breakouts and my acne scars look much worse.</li>
            <li> Do little bits at a time to get the right consistency.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Around the edge of my face burns a little after I take the mask off but the coconut oil soothes it right out within a minute or so.</li>
            <li> (I get little bumps sometimes from the dry climate and my razor) and it made them completely smooth.</li>
            <li> It is not hard to mix, and isn&#x27;t as messy as it could be (sticks to stuff, but doesn&#x27;t really drip).  </li>
            <li> I had to buy little disposable bowls and spoons to mix this with as it comes in a powder form to be mixed with water and hardens quickly.</li>
            <li> I was a little alarmed to read on the label, not just once but twice, in bold uppercase red font, that you will FEEL YOUR FACE PULSATE</li>
            <li> I really think it comes down to your face and how sensitive your skin is.</li>
            <li> Cannot rinse this down the drain, as it is truly mud, but worth the extra work.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not willing to put in the time to mix carefully and clean up afterwards, stick with a pre-made mask in a tube.</li>
            <li> Exactly what the other reviews said!</li>
            <li> it does dry, tighten (and make it look like your pores are smaller until you shed that dry skin), and deep clean skin.</li>
            <li> it does dry, tighten (and make it look like your pores are smaller until you shed that dry skin), and deep clean skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like magic, it seems to suck the nasty bacteria right out of these huge, cystic zits I WAS getting.</li>
            <li> but it sucks the white heads right out of my face as unusual as that sounds.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much to make a mask so this jar will last a LONG time!</li>
            <li> Went in the doctors office and found out i had stage 4 terminal cancer and only 30 days left to live.  </li>
            <li> I have had a jar for years, as it takes very little and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> it certainly isn&#x27;t torture like other reviewers describe it..</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin and large pores on my face.</li>
            <li> I used half Braggs apple cider vinegar and half water, applying with a brush, and it left my face soft and I was able to extract some white heads and sebaceous filaments after removing it.</li>
            <li> , otherwise it won&#x27;t dry fast enough.)</li>
            <li> But in my opinion Nox is better and less messy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t last the whole time till it gets dry</li>
            <li> it sucks them to the surface for easy removal gross</li>
            <li> and the next day, I had very irritated, itchy dry skin</li>
            <li> The hormonal kind that sucks your confidence into a black hole.</li>
            <li> You can make this up to the consistency you desire; I like it about the consistency of heavy cream, but if you like thinner or thicker, add more or less</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less messy and smells better</li>
            <li> The smell is also super annoying because you are using vinegar on your face, but I didn&#x27;t buy this to smell nice.</li>
            <li> I mean, the price is really cheap, so why not?</li>
            <li> My skin is flawless and I haven&#x27;t used any of my other harsh chemical products, including expensive peter Thomas Roth acne face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes a few times to learn how to get the texture just right.</li>
            <li> I also recommend using this right before a shower, as it is a messy pain to rinse off.</li>
            <li> Several hours after taking the dried mask off, most of the pimples calm down and start receding a little.</li>
            <li> It makes a huge mess using this stuff no matter how careful you try to be</li>
            <li> but now I now I use it every 4 to 5 days and only for ten minutes and it began to clear off my acne instead of breaking out !</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t over dry my skin normally.</li>
            <li> til its all dry (normally around 15 minutes)</li>
            <li> til its all dry (normally around 15 minutes)</li>
            <li> Please be aware of slight bubbles when you add the apple cider vinegar to the clay.</li>
            <li> I had black heads on my nose and even after the first use it pulled all the dirt and grime out.  </li>
            <li> I normally leave it on for 10-15 minutes (until it&#x27;s mostly dry</li>
            <li> mix with straight Bragg&#x27;s ACV (with the mother!), and I prefer a slightly thinner consistency.  </li>
            <li> so tie your hair back but remember it washes off and does not typically leave any stains.</li>
            <li> About me:  Black female, mid 20&#x27;s, mild occurrence of pimples.  </li>
            <li> I could see exactly where the mask was due to the red lines.</li>
            <li> BUT.. THIS product in particular is for everyone and doesn&#x27;t present different, adverse effects on different skin types.</li>
            <li> i tried using it as a hair clarifying masks as many other naturals do, it worked well, but i&#x27;m too lazy to keep up with it</li>
            <li> the first time around, and I do different treatments with other things throughout the week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a total mess, but worth it.</li>
            <li> As the package says, for the first 30 minutes or so after taking this extremely tightening mask off, our faces were red.</li>
            <li> this super fine powder w/o getting clumps in a bowl is really hard, like-REALLY, REALLY HARD.</li>
            <li> it will never dry!</li>
            <li> My skin was toned, no dry patches of scale skin, no horrid break outs!</li>
            <li> I honestly can say that this product works for me , I was a little skeptical at first though.</li>
            <li> and I only need a little bit for my entire face, like 1 tsp full</li>
            <li> My face always feels a bit tight and dry after use, but also clean and exfoliated.  </li>
            <li> Then wait for it to dry, remove with water and feel how tight and clean my skin looks after.</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t completely remove the gunk in your pores (especially in your nose), it&#x27;ll definitely lift it out partially, so just rub the skin gently after you use it</li>
            <li> So in essence, this is not some magical zit-b-gone product, but with a few uses, your face will naturally start to clear because it acts like a magnet and causes the gunk to surface slowly over time.  </li>
            <li> This facial clay does clear pores, but is hard to apply in just one even layer without ending up with a face full of chucks of mud.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this for people with normal skin who are looking for a limited ingredient</li>
            <li> Usually I can just get all the last bits of the mask out of the scoop with my finger, leaving the scoop almost totally clean, then just wipe the chopstick off on a body part to get all the excess off.</li>
            <li> Well, it made the bumps lay down for a few hours (which was exciting at first because I had no idea they&#x27;d pop back up) and it kinda \\&quot;hid\\</li>
            <li> (my face was too tight to crack a smile) because I had a picture of a vacuum sucking the air out of a space bag) when I looked in the mirror</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll clean my face and hardly works</li>
            <li> Everything that&#x27;s been said regarding the extreme suction, and pulsating face, etc, is absolutely correct.</li>
            <li> I also have hyperpigmentation issues and noticed that this clay doesn&#x27;t really help at all with any scarring but the other clays do.</li>
            <li> recipes are endless, but this is a miracle product, it really does wonders to the skin just after 1 application, try it out!&lt;br</li>
            <li> But as for the product, I like, I really hope it gets rid of my blackhead&#x27;s , the other pic is a close up of my nose.</li>
            <li> I have used other high end masks and this surpasses them all-Great buy!</li>
            <li> It was not as stingy as some of the other reviews said, but it had a very tightening effect.</li>
            <li> Other than that it doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot.</li>
            <li> One star off for how hard it is to clean up.</li>
            <li> Maybe after some prolonged use, I&#x27;ll see a long lasting effect on this front; but what it does do instantly is completely shrink your pores to the point of them being nearly non</li>
            <li> The first time around I used water and it was a lumpy mess.</li>
            <li> Read all the reviews and was so excited to try this on my skin which has been breaking out lately.</li>
            <li> However, if your acne is extreme, the real solution is the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Like any other clay face mask really.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other stuff for the face before like Mint Julep but the mud really works.</li>
            <li> On my other daughter who doesn&#x27;t have much acne, it seemed to irritate her skin a bit.  </li>
            <li> Then I put it on with an old flat foundation brush.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff - Its very cooling as it dries, and tightens up as it dries almost at an alarming rate!  </li>
            <li> Leave it on long enough to feel your skin really tighten, pores look smaller after washing off.</li>
            <li> I was getting a lot of them like 6-7 very close to each other.</li>
            <li> I tried various acne medications with little success.  </li>
            <li> and I plan to use and purchase this mask for as long as I am alive!</li>
            <li> super inexpensive and will last forever considering you only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> The deep cleaning leaves my face glowing and smooth and I have hardly had any breakouts since I have started using this a month ago</li>
            <li> It gets extremely tight and can get somewhat hot.</li>
            <li> It gets extremely tight and can get somewhat hot.</li>
            <li> i feel so refreshed after using this product, leaves the skin so soft and smooth, and kind of red for a little bit, but not too bad with my skin.</li>
            <li> The mixture comes out nice and creamy using half vinegar and half water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to other reviews, before I ever opened the container</li>
            <li> The Healing Clay was better than all the other much more expensive anti-acne type products that I had wasted my money on before trying this.</li>
            <li> I have used it to dry up new baby&#x27;s umbilical cords.  </li>
            <li> I use it with apple cider vinegar (the smell is not great but the results are worth it!!).</li>
            <li> Makes a mess in the tub, but it&#x27;s fairly easy to rinse down the drain</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling so fresh and new, and my blemishes slowly started fading away.</li>
            <li> It does get very very tight as it dries, and its a fun at home spa treatment you can do by yourself, or with your friends.</li>
            <li> I thought it was too cheap to be good, but boy was I WRONG!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so shocked at how great this product is in just the short time that I had</li>
            <li> was surprised because I&#x27;m so used to masks stinging my face, but it was VERY soothing.. and as it dried I could feel the &amp;#34;pulsating&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This stuff really helped clear a few problem spot on my face.</li>
            <li> My blackheads have seriously diminished and my skin feels soft and clean, like I&#x27;ve never felt in my entire life.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have terrible acne, but hoped this could give me a great deep clean occasionally, so</li>
            <li> Pimples are less inflamed, less red, and it even seems that it helps with post blemish hyperpigmentation (those lovely spots that linger after a pimple- varying shades of brown, red, purple etc</li>
            <li> Not only did it clear my blackheads and tightened my pores in one week&#x27;s use, it also brightened my skin, and makes me look 10 years younger!</li>
            <li> Much easier, and as long as it&#x27;s covered in an air-tight container it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I am currently &amp;#34;Team Natural&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m always looking for &#x27;natural&#x27; products to add to my daily routine.  </li>
            <li> Use a soft paper tower or bunch of facial tissues to remove the mask and wash face after what&#x27;s left.</li>
            <li> As an African American with natural hair, I use this as a hair mask.</li>
            <li> What I did was soak a wash cloth and press it against my face until the mask was all wet again, then I used the same wash cloth to gently buff the clay off.</li>
            <li> What I did was soak a wash cloth and press it against my face until the mask was all wet again, then I used the same wash cloth to gently buff the clay off.</li>
            <li> and there, I really wanted something to shrink my giant, be careful not to fall into one of them, pores.</li>
            <li> Wholesome product that&#x27;s natural, and actually works as a once in a while, quality facial.</li>
            <li> Just enough for complete coverage and not enough for it to be caked on and dripping</li>
            <li> Just enough for complete coverage and not enough for it to be caked on and dripping</li>
            <li> but I used it on my hair once and it completely dried out my normally straight and silky hair and made them completely unmanageable.</li>
            <li> yep, all of that worked for a couple hours then back to the old giant pores.</li>
            <li> ; I&#x27;m a 25 yr old female, been suffering from Type 2 - Moderate Acne ever since puberty</li>
            <li> After one use, my pores appeared smaller and left my skin soft, not dry feeling.  </li>
            <li> I am 27 years old and have been suffering from moderate to servere acne since a teen.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I was somehow allergic to a component or if my sometimes sensitive skin overreacted,  or if perhaps it dried my skin out too much.</li>
            <li> Since my adult acne has worsen in the last 5 months, this was my last effort before accutane.</li>
            <li> (I have African American natural hair)</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I tried the mask, since my skin is so sensitive I mixed the clay with equal portions of aloe vera and water.</li>
            <li> What I really noticed was how firm and soft</li>
            <li> (Product reviewer: Female, 22 years old, long-term moderate</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it takes a decent amount of time to dry, but it works quite well on my oily skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but my pores are smaller and my skin feels soft.</li>
            <li> my pores are much smaller and i only used it one time so far.</li>
            <li> I use organic apple cider vinegar to mix for an extra kick and I use the mask every night, but if you have sensitive skin, start off using water to mix it and only using it twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I left it on for about 20 minutes and not only was my face extreme;y soft, but my pores were the smallest I&#x27;ve ever seen them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely never gotten such an immediate smoothing and softening affect from a mask before, so I like it so far.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still not completely dry.</li>
            <li> This does not dry your skin out nor break out.</li>
            <li> In order to make this mask clay powder into true clay, I suggest starting with two to three tablespoons of water and adding a small amount of powder, and then mixing.  </li>
            <li> However, it says to apply 1/4-1/2 in layer, I find a thin coating is more than enough</li>
            <li> It actually made my acne scars worse and standout more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, do try it if you know your skin isn&#x27;t sensitive, and even if you hate it, you only spent 10 dollars at most :)</li>
            <li> Mixed it well in a glass bowl W/chopsticks and applied a smooth, thick layer to my face.</li>
            <li> stuff worked miracles for the first two weeks, the zits I would get on my forehead throughout the day were completely eliminated; and I have tried everything to get rid of them in the past, literally everything.</li>
            <li> I mixed this mask with warm water, I was unable to get a pudding like consistency</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I was going to need since my skin is not dry</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay Deep Pore Cleansing Mask.  </li>
            <li> Even if it&#x27;s not dry yet, it&#x27;s still working.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to smile and/or laugh when your face is tight like an Aztec goddess.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t feel really hateful towards the product because before my purchase, I read both positive and negative reviews on Amazon and reread them before finally deciding to try the mask.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive, to the point where acne cleaners dry it out until it cracks and anything moisturizing makes me break out.</li>
            <li> Most of it will break up into small particles again and go down the drain,</li>
            <li> The fact it has such a rich history makes you feel a deep appreciation for the past and the knowledge they obtained.</li>
            <li> It also smells a little funny once you mix it with water.</li>
            <li> Moderate would be one or two major sections (my two cheeks).</li>
            <li> But for some reason I still would get major breakouts on my left cheek.</li>
            <li> In 2 weeks (daily for 20 min), this clay cleared MAJOR acne.</li>
            <li> Sorry Amazon I love your company and order stuff from you literally every other day,  but my first loyalty is to fellow consumers.  </li>
            <li> And if I do, it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m in major need of a deep cleansing!</li>
            <li> I mixed it with bragg&#x27;s applecider vinegar and about a 1/2 table spoon of olive oil, it took me about 15min to apply and I left on an additional 10min after that and after entire process of rinsing it out my hair, my curls where so soft and defined!</li>
            <li> so I was a little worried at first.</li>
            <li> Also, be prepared for your skin to break out a little bit when you first start using it.</li>
            <li> Its going to smell a little funny.</li>
            <li> I rinsed it off and my skin was slightly red but nothing major.</li>
            <li> You do break out a little at first</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used this long enough to tell you if it&#x27;s gonna clear up acne, but it&#x27;s definitely kept new big breakouts from happening.</li>
            <li> kind of a mess to work with and seriously dries out your skin</li>
            <li> I have spent a ton of money on high end masks over the years.  </li>
            <li> Your face will get tomato red if you are pale but it is well worth</li>
            <li> I had a few large pimples that either shrunk or came to a head with continued use, it dried out my existing bumps, and has brought so many black heads to the surface so that they can be removed.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend putting large chunks for cakey pieces of the mask down the drain.</li>
            <li> * only put a small amount into ziplock bag, add water, and mix that way.. its easier, can be used later, and stays clean..</li>
            <li> Be careful not to leave it on too long, or it may dry out your skin and cause some mild irritation.</li>
            <li> You can make it as strong or weak as you like (by mixing it with water, apple cider vinegar, or a combination of both).</li>
            <li> I mixed a little apple cider vinegar as it instructs and created the paste and applied to my dry clean face.</li>
            <li> A few hours later, the pores relaxed a little bit, but still better than it was originally&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face has been looking a little tired and dragged since I have been full time working and full time schooling.</li>
            <li> It was a little messy to mix together, but once it was applied to my face, it felt good &amp; dried</li>
            <li> Looking like Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer for a half hour afterwards is a small price to pay. :)</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be rather dry in spots but overall, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s normal.  </li>
            <li> I found it really hard to get a smooth paste, I mixed and mixed, and still had clumps</li>
            <li> I could tell my face was a little dry, so I put on a mild face moisturizer...</li>
            <li> I could tell my face was a little dry, so I put on a mild face moisturizer...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t do that, unless you just want to have a very large quantity of mud to keep in a sealed container for the next few months.  </li>
            <li> I am a 24 year old male who doesnt take the best or the worst care of his skin.</li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s really working on my dark spots.</li>
            <li> my face hasn&#x27;t been this clear in a long time.</li>
            <li> I generally wake up 30 minutes later to my face pulsating and my skin being pulled tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I have very oily dark skin</li>
            <li> I have minor blackheads that I&#x27;ve wanted to clear up for a while.</li>
            <li> by far beats any other Clear n clear/ Neutrogena/</li>
            <li> So I have this problem with dark area on my neck, no matter how much I scrub</li>
            <li> I wish I could have found this product years ago instead of struggling with various other over the counter(some very pricey) products</li>
            <li> It somehow shrinks the acne bumps to a very manageable size and it will disappear within a couple days - this is a big improvement over other things I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Other clay masks i have used before were riddled with perfumes and cost so much for a tiny amount.</li>
            <li> I am very fond of this product, and will definitely use it each week and in case of any other changes will update the review.</li>
            <li> As soon as I started using this religiously, my face cleared dramatically and I barely have any acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m barely on like my third week</li>
            <li> I mixed them in a ceramic bowl with a plastic spoon because apparently you shouldn&#x27;t use anything metal with this clay as it messes with the ions or something in the benzonite?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Apparently it is helpful as a deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I was in a panic as my face completely broke out five days before I saw my long distance boyfriend.  </li>
            <li> I only have a few pesky light pink scars on my cheek.</li>
            <li> It had no strange smells</li>
            <li> but apparently it works for my back acne.</li>
            <li> Had the jar for several months and barely put a dent in the usage.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s kinda a long process for as busy as I am.</li>
            <li> After using this for the first time I felt that it dried my face.</li>
            <li> Although it is pretty messy.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought this mask was too drying and too harsh and made me break out.</li>
            <li> It was messy at first</li>
            <li> First, its so messy.</li>
            <li> At first, my face broke out, but it cleared up in a few days.</li>
            <li> To see the result you need to be patient because the first time I used it all I saw was dried skin flaked up.  </li>
            <li> I used it on some fresh mosquito bites for about 20 mins and the redness and itching was gone, and the bite was nothing but a small dot.</li>
            <li> At first I used this 3x days in a row and it really dried up my skin.</li>
            <li> expect a miracle after the first use, it takes a few applications to start seeing results.</li>
            <li> Using hot water is a waste of your time, it will be clumpy.</li>
            <li> After using this a few times now, my overall skin tone has improved and my face feels more supple and firm.</li>
            <li> Scared myself the first time because the person in the mirror was green.</li>
            <li> So yes, you will break out for the first few days.</li>
            <li> I did notice a few blackheads that were &#x27;pulled&#x27; to the surface and at first I thought the clay had deposited them</li>
            <li> I noticed that within the first few weeks of using the clay, my skin tone started evening out</li>
            <li> I have a full face sunburn afterwards for at least an hour or two.</li>
            <li> used it about 3 x a week for the first few weeks</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t be alarmed the first few times you use them.</li>
            <li> it dried out my face a bit the first couple of times I used it</li>
            <li> It is okay for a face mask, the first time I felt nothing but the uncomfortable tightening from the drying clay, second and third time I felt a little tingle, but I am not sure it made a huge difference if anything after the last time I used it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of difficult getting the right consistency and hard to get it even on the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was really shocked at how clean and light my skin felt.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was really shocked at how clean and light my skin felt.</li>
            <li> I have huge pores and tons of black heads, and I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable reduction in black heads on my nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li> Things like proactive and clean and clear just made it worse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It sounds like a lot, but it has really cut down on my skin regimen and the cost.</li>
            <li> Really tones down a breakout.  </li>
            <li> First it started to tingle a little bit, then my entire T-zone was tingling</li>
            <li> The first time I use clay mixed with water and apply on my face and neck, you can feel a little bit burn on my face.</li>
            <li> I use Bragg vinegar and usually start with a 1:1 ratio and add a little bit more clay.</li>
            <li> I do think that for such a simple mud mask compared to the major brand GLO, this is a no brainer.</li>
            <li> I was a little freaked the first time I used this because my face was as red as a strawberry when I washed it off, but as promised, it went away within 30-45 min.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend people with delicate skin to put on the mask evenly when applying it to your whole face.</li>
            <li> For those saying they had a reaction, it IS very basic and can be harsh, so it&#x27;s probably worth testing on a small area first.</li>
            <li> Doing this, I gently massaged my face, and magically black heads and white heads that I had not previously seen (prior to putting the mask on) were starting to surface.  </li>
            <li> I think it is kind of hard to get all the lumps of the powder out when mixing the stuff though, but I mix it with water, so I&#x27;m not sure if that makes a difference.  </li>
            <li> I use it at least twice a day religiously and never use any other moisturizer any more.</li>
            <li> People pay big bucks for similar treatments in a spa and I am not aware of another product that gives you so much clay for this price.</li>
            <li> Really brings the blood flow  to your face and makes you glow for the next several hours (after the extreme redness wears off after 20mins).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it pretty much as needed, usually every other day.</li>
            <li> I use half the first night and the other half stays fresh in the zip lock.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ve never really been one for new experiences.</li>
            <li> It does take a while to dry, and leaves you a little red after removal, so make sure you have some down time before applying.</li>
            <li> At first it wasn&#x27;t doing anything and after a minute when it started drying the pulsating feeling began ,when it dried my face was so tight I looked like I had too much filler injected</li>
            <li> I usually use it at night, right before bed, scoop out some and mix it with apple cider vinegar and apply to face.</li>
            <li> I was pretty badly bruised and she insisted that I try the magic clay.  </li>
            <li> My face feels ridiculous, and all the pores are clean.</li>
            <li> I am dry and clear.</li>
            <li> I have bought expensive sulfur masks in the past and this is a great alternative.</li>
            <li> I dont normally get a pulsing sensation, and maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong, but I enjoy it</li>
            <li> the record I have 40 year old combination skin, sometimes it seems oily and dry all at once.</li>
            <li> Has really helped the look and condition of my skin to be smoother and have less breakouts and blackheads.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t need a whole lot - and always err on the side of less.</li>
            <li> But didn&#x27;t do much for my pimples or black heads</li>
            <li> a miracle moisturizer for my sensitive, sometimes dry face.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> maybe I&#x27;ll try with water and see if that is less Intense.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really smell it when its a powder, but with water it smells like dirt (just slightly).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really peel black heads off like a nose strip, but it brings forth all that gunk to the surface of your skin and as I washed my face</li>
            <li> And wait for it to dry completely.</li>
            <li> I had noticeable black heads before I started using this product and now my skin is much clearer.</li>
            <li> Use it once a week because it can dry your skin if you have sensitive skin like me</li>
            <li> I let it dry completely then washed it off in the shower.</li>
            <li> It does dry your skin considerably</li>
            <li> ( I let it dry completely before rinsing)&lt;br</li>
            <li> (mask fully dry) and immediately had glowing skin - and I&#x27;m 51 years old.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this if you have sensitive skin or dry skin.</li>
            <li> I brought it for my naturally curly and dry hair.</li>
            <li> I still think I need to use a pore strip to really pull out the black heads</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend that people with dry or sensitive skin use ACV with this mask.</li>
            <li> seems to help me long enough for me to have clear skin again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this about 10 times since purchasing, I&#x27;ve definitely seen an improvement in my skin pigmentation and my skin is generally softer overall.</li>
            <li> I layered it on thickly (likely too thickly), then worried since it dried like veritable concrete that it might not come off, but it did, quite easily.  </li>
            <li> I layered it on thickly (likely too thickly), then worried since it dried like veritable concrete that it might not come off, but it did, quite easily.  </li>
            <li> Once it was creamy again, I continued to wipe it off with paper towels and finally with a washcloth when there was barely any left..</li>
            <li> Regular, practically religious, soft washing and daily application of Benzoil Peroxide has been the only, proven, and doctor-endorsed method of keeping my skin regular.</li>
            <li> Apparently if you simply use water, the pH remains the same.</li>
            <li> my skin is not sensitive) and left it feeling soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am a 27 year old African American woman who has had and still has trouble with acne and enlarged pores and this stuff really gets in and gives you a deep cleaning!</li>
            <li> When i put it on thin it was easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> I would say after your first few times, maybe once every 2.5 weeks will be enough.</li>
            <li> I would say after your first few times, maybe once every 2.5 weeks will be enough.</li>
            <li> Gets pretty messy, especially when washing it off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest something gentler if you have sensitive skin, or even normal skin, because it just seemed too harsh.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time and it does make your skin very red and causes some burning after you take off the mask, but that goes away after a few hours.</li>
            <li> and it comes off easily when placed on thin</li>
            <li> The first time I mixed it with Green Tea, but it was SO lumpy.</li>
            <li> Thin layer, leave on your face 20-30 minutes max, and hop in the shower to rinse off because it does not wipe away easily like prepackaged masks from the drugstore.</li>
            <li> It took some time to see a difference, but the difference is definitely worth it over the small differences that daily face scrubs do.</li>
            <li> The first time using this product was a bit of a learning experience for me, and messy, but the second time is a charm!</li>
            <li> Just got this in the mail a few days ago and used it for the first time last night.</li>
            <li> The first few times I mixed it with water and had a lot of clumps in it.</li>
            <li> For a beginner which I am, I didn&#x27;t like it because I felt like it was too strong for me, and it felt a bit irritating like my face was on fire and around my hair edges were a bit itchy.</li>
            <li> It is rather thick and quick drying.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with a super thick layer.</li>
            <li> I have cystic pimples, black head, LARGE pores and tiny hormonal pimples.</li>
            <li> however I always suffered of large pores and black dots on my face especially on my nose and forhead.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried at first because my back was red (as stated in the product).  </li>
            <li> A very natural and inexpensive product, just be careful not to clog up your drains when washing it off.</li>
            <li> It really does get deep down in your pores.</li>
            <li> You really can feel the mask PULSATING against your skin, drawing out whatever lurks deep down in there.</li>
            <li> I actually buy it at the Whole Foods down the street</li>
            <li> Really gets down into those pores for a deep cleaning.</li>
            <li> The mask really gets deep down into the pores.</li>
            <li> It is easy to make a big mess if you&#x27;re not careful, and I caution against dry clay going down your sink drain-</li>
            <li> but my skin glows after I am done and my black heads are nearly gone!!!</li>
            <li> After some tries, I figured out that it&#x27;s best to put on a THIN layer rather than a thick layer because the mask will take too long to dry.</li>
            <li> This clay doesn&#x27;t have any positive beneficial values to my skin after a few use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I would say that the whole experience with waiting for the mask to dry was a bit scary weird (more due to first experience) but not bad as after washing my face</li>
            <li> I was happy and disappointed at the same time when I found this product offered at my local health food store for $6.99, but that may not be the case for everyone.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel  any burning sensation as I normally do with with other mud masks.</li>
            <li> I make sure to put extra water in the container to keep it from drying out in the cabinet, and it seems to be doing well (for the past few months)</li>
            <li> far as complaints about clogging your drains, I probably don&#x27;t use it enough for that to happen, but to take the side of caution I always wash it off slowly with hot water and follow it with a dash a drain cleaner in the sink/shower.</li>
            <li> First off, I personally find the suggestion that you apply it in a layer 1/4 to 1/2 inch think to be FAR too thick.</li>
            <li> Over the span of a year or 2, I spent hundreds of dollars on different products (and I tried each for a few months to give it a true trial)...</li>
            <li> Overall I would say that the whole experience with waiting for the mask to dry was a bit scary weird (more due to first experience) but not bad as after washing my face</li>
            <li> so I applied the product right away when I received it which was around june 8, and I have been knowing some results since I been using it on my face has been clearing out no more of those red dots it cleared out on my face....</li>
            <li> It got a little tight after 20 minutes, but your skin feels so so smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> If you use it again the next day or day after it will help dry them out and keep the skin clear.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, acne-prone skin that is just starting to age, and is dry almost all the time.  </li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t want clay to dry all the way on your face...as it gets harder to remove.  </li>
            <li> After using this concoction, I have noticed smaller pores, moisturized (neither oily nor dry) skin, and it is quite soft.</li>
            <li> Your face feels really dry afterwards and gets really red, but will wear off after 5 to 10 minutes and then feel really soft.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with the recommended all natural apple cider vinegar, applied it, and let it on until dry.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this product, my face had some extremely dry patches (could have been burnt), but after the clay, my face feels even and soft all the way around.</li>
            <li> It also works well on dry skin to smooth out some unevenness and get all that junk out of your pores, but I would recommend using a thick moisturizer afterwards in that case.</li>
            <li> and it does make your skin feel very restricted and tight</li>
            <li> I mix/store this in a 2 oz hinged plastic jar, so when I make too much its still sealed air tight.</li>
            <li> Yes, its creates a bit of itching, and pulsating since it really pulls the skin tight, when drying.</li>
            <li> Cleans pores really well and skin feels tight and rejuvenated afterwards.</li>
            <li> My skin wasn&#x27;t red afterward (some other users reported this) but my skin is SO SOFT!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I wrote the review a little over a month ago, and if you read my entire review and understood the whole acne minor/moderate/sever stage level thing, let me just proudly say that I am now a Moderate Level 1 and haven&#x27;t had any severe or crazy breakouts at all!</li>

            <li> /&gt;Thirdly, the clay will get very hard, but once you wash it off, it does leave your face really smooth.</li>
            <li> it was very cheap purchase, won&#x27;t feel sorry throwing it out</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time last night, and I got all those same things... the pulsating, the cold-hot feel... then, it felt like it was totally stretching my skin as it dried.</li>
            <li> I tried 3 days after an application and my face felt almost raw and hot.</li>
            <li> the first time I used it I used 2 tbsp clay and 2 tbsp raw acv</li>
            <li> My acne isn&#x27;t completely gone, and I&#x27;m still getting a few new ones, but compared to before they&#x27;re smaller and easier to hide.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get any major breakouts but any small (or large) pimple</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get any major breakouts but any small (or large) pimple</li>
            <li> It gets VERY tight, but does wonders for your skin if you use it on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li> &amp; I only used a little on areas where I have large pores (cheeks, forehead) &amp; where I had a pimple (under my neck &amp; by my ear)</li>
            <li> My skin is tight and clear!!!  </li>
            <li> The only downside to this is that it makes an absolute mess when you&#x27;re removing it.</li>
            <li> less mess to clean up in the end.  </li>
            <li> being so dry is completely healed, AFTER TWO BACK TO BACK USES!</li>
            <li> The apple cider vinegar will burn slightly and leaves the skin red for at least 30 - 45 minutes however the apple cider vinegar seems to work better.</li>
            <li> A thin layer works just fine.</li>
            <li> It also works well on dry skin to smooth out some unevenness and get all that junk out of your pores, but I would recommend using a thick moisturizer afterwards in that case.ow key</li>
            <li> I found a review that said to only put a thin layer on your face and let it completely dry and that you would be able to SEE the blackheads that were pulled out of your skin in the mask.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a very long way so store in a cool dry place.</li>
            <li> If you are somebody who is applying this clay purely for the removal of dead skin, then be my guest and mix ACV with it.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of large pores, whiteheads, blackheads, and a few pimples-</li>
            <li> I have very dry sensitive skin and every now</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product mixed with raw apple cider vinegar it made my face break out</li>
            <li> It gets a little intense while I wear it.</li>
            <li> There was a little tightening but not as intense as I thought it would be, almost unnoticable tightening.</li>
            <li> Leave skin really soft,a little redness..</li>
            <li> and I like how you can make as little or as much as you want.</li>
            <li> /&gt;[I don&#x27;t really measure, I kinda just add a little of everything]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although it stings for a few seconds while drying, it left my skin feeling so soft and clear!</li>
            <li> I really like how little ingredients are in it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too much clay for me,</li>
            <li> and that was a little too much,</li>
            <li> I would recommend this mask to anyone who has some minor skin issues, as I don&#x27;t know how it would work on major skin problems.  </li>
            <li> It could be due to the altitude where I live.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this with other new products I&#x27;m trying for my combination skin.</li>
            <li> w/ low porosity, slightly thin, and fine strands (</li>
            <li> It is kind of hard to wash off your face because it does get really hard</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to remove but overall pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> junk?&lt;br /&gt;-I mixed 6 tablespoons of clay with equal parts of raw apple cider vinegar, it made too much!  </li>
            <li> When I was a teenager starting to develop oily skin and large pores on my nose an esthetician working a beauty counter at a mega store in Mexico introduced me to a green clay mask that worked wonders on my skin.</li>
            <li> It works really well but can cause your face to look a little red after.</li>
            <li> You do NOT need as much as it says on the back, a little does the trick.</li>
            <li> it hard to take off, but its worth it.</li>
            <li> talkng will be hard and when you look at youself in the mirror, you might try to laugh but your face will feel frozen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure you don&#x27;t have to go out anywhere for at least 45 min though because you will be red for a little while after use.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think it would be enough but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I first closed the sink drain, put my large zip loc bag over my sink drain and then using wet wipes I added small amounts of water to it and then scrapped off the clay onto the sink.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like it does much to my skin other than dry it out</li>
            <li> I can really say what it does other than dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I try using this once a week, but it is kind of annoying to clean up because I don&#x27;t let it go down the drain for clogging purposes...</li>
            <li> There are some active compounds in it and it can be strong so don&#x27;t apply it to very delicate or sensitive skin before testing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it took a little longer to “cool down”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it took a little longer to “cool down”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mix equal parts of clay &amp; raw apple cider vinegar (it gives off a fizzy &amp; slightly bubbly sound &amp; reaction).&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn me or anything(though it did burn one of my friends with bad acne, but I think that was a good sign.)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my skin when using this product, good or bad.</li>
            <li> Some good, some bad.</li>
            <li> The smell isn’t good or bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and its absolutely amazing for people who have blackheads and dirty pores.</li>
            <li> which is both good and bad.</li>
            <li> His thing lasts since u are recommended not to do it too often because it removes good and bad dirt and oil.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of the good and bad reviews but ultimately decided to get it because, for the price, I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> Bentonite is a miracle in itself, the yerba prima liquid bentonite is a great tasteless detox for those who have issues with heavy metals, toxins, excess sodium and stuff like that.</li>
            <li> I even made my boyfriend who suffers from acne try this product and his face looked more radiant and clear after just one use.</li>
            <li> My skin is still moisturized the whole day, and the cold weather used to cause lines to come back no matter what anti-aging product I used, but the bel essence keeps me as line free in the winter as I am in the summer.  </li>
            <li> your skin will absorb it and it will be silly smooth without clogging because jojoba is the closest to natural sebum in the skin</li>
            <li> My mother suffers from many allergies, and her skin is sensitive to everything (it seems).  </li>
            <li> I really hate the idea of using all the paper towels we own just to wipe it off, and I don&#x27;t like the idea of using a bath towel (since that goes in the washing machine, and who knows how  much that&#x27;ll clog up the machine).  </li>
            <li> I had a huge mess the first couple of tries at cleaning up the tools I used as it gets very hard to blend the second you add water.  </li>
            <li> A few months ago, I became DETERMINED to have clear skin for my wedding this Spring!!!</li>
            <li> It felt as any other ordinary face mask,  my face did feel clean afterwards</li>
            <li> Seriously this clay pulls, draws and your face really does pulsate WOW!  </li>
            <li> It takes a while to find the right amt to get the desired consistency, but it&#x27;s not too hard.  </li>
            <li> And I mean STUCK, once this dries you need to go ahead and wash it off because any movements you make may possibly hurt (especially if you laugh).</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this clay, based on previous reviews.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for anyone with breakouts or black heads.</li>
            <li> And it only lasts for the first few minutes while the clay is starting to dry.</li>
            <li> Really cleanses the face and literally has black heads hanging out after you wash off the clay!</li>
            <li> I started doing spot treaemts with this instead of full facials because of how uncomfortable it was when your whole face began to dry.</li>
            <li> I also put it on pretty thick and let it dry completely before removing.</li>
            <li> results seems to clear up everything it broke out the night before and brings out new ones that have been small bottom line</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY reccommend this for anyone with oily/acne prone skin or any one with aging skin that wants to feel tight and firm.</li>
            <li> My black heads are almost completely gone after ONE USE!!</li>
            <li> Use a washcloth to get it off when it&#x27;s dry as it&#x27;s harder to take off than a normal clay mask.</li>
            <li> My skin was totally dried out within 5 minutes of my first use, so I started moisturizing within a minute or two of rising it off and patting dry.</li>
            <li> totally dried out within 5 minutes of my first use, so I started moisturizing within a minute or two of rising it off and patting dry.</li>
            <li> It sucks the gunk right out of your face, and you can really feel it sucking (what an odd feeling)!</li>
            <li> Sucks your face right in.  </li>
            <li> Sucks the oil right up.</li>
            <li> I did notice a decrease in how oily my face was along with using olay&#x27;s oil minimizing toner and using african black soap but this one negative really outweighs the positive...</li>
            <li> I was hesitant for her to use straight apple cider vinegar on her young skin, so we used half distilled water and half ACV.  </li>
            <li> For comparison&#x27;s sake: I have normal to slightly oily skin.</li>
            <li> Which is enough to show improvements in a lot of people that don&#x27;t clean their skin properly, or just use a poor soap.</li>
            <li> Just go see a dermatologist.ich is enough to show improvements in a lot of people that don&#x27;t clean their skin properly, or just use a poor soap.</li>
            <li> This is like a vacuum cleaner for your face.</li>
            <li> I mean after all there is no such things as a miracle mask, right?</li>
            <li> I hate face masks, but I love this Aztec clay mask!!  </li>
            <li> but when I did, my poors were noticeable smaller and my skin still felt just as tight as when the mask was on, but with normal muscular mobility.</li>
            <li> i mixed it with 1 part of raw cider vinegar and 2 parts of water (cider vinegar irritates my face to much) and it has work wonders</li>
            <li> I had the horrible initial breakouts the first few weeks, as expected, but it did greatly help clear up the major zits.</li>
            <li> Seems just as advertised, this is the classic green facial mud.</li>
            <li> but I put a decent layer on for 15 minutes (should&#x27;ve left it on a few minutes longer)</li>
            <li> I do not find the smell bad at all, just different then what I am used to from more normal products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get many pimples, but I usually get one or two incredibly painful, huge cystic nodules</li>
            <li> little goes a long way with this stuff, really.</li>
            <li> I just wet it a little bit first</li>
            <li> it does get a little red after washing it off but it soon fades, maybe i just have real sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shelling out money on expensive facial products, lotions, derma roller, clairsonic, peels, and pretty much everything else in between.  </li>
            <li> Other factors affect my sensitive breakouts and this mask does not CURE anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive and want to give it a try, use water instead of vinegar and start off leaving it on for 10 minutes; other skin types can leave it on for longer periods.  </li>
            <li> (you only need a small bit of this stuff and we mixed a bit too much).  </li>
            <li> I mixed it up in a plastic bowl with a stainless steel spoon (only now reading that I should have used a plastic spoon?!) and went with a small amount of clay and just started adding water until I had a somewhat soupy mixture.  </li>
            <li> My 49 year old skin loves this stuff every other week</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any acne there except some old red and dark marks and this got rid of them by 3rd week.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the combo of mixing this with anything other than water, but my skin completely loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> I think I applied too much of the clay (a little bit goes a LONG way here) and waited the time listed on the jar.  </li>
            <li> Based on my results so far, I would suggest you try doing it everyday/every other day until you see the results you want</li>
            <li> The other reviews said for sensitive skin, mix with water, so thats what I did.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I am cleansing my body with natural and organics foods and supplements.</li>
            <li> You can actually feel it pulling out the inpurities off your skin when left on long enough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not a peel-off facial and will not magically clear up any facial acne in one use, but it definitely helps defend my skin from impurities.</li>
            <li> It fizzes a little, so make sure your bowl is big enough when you mix; it can be a little messy.</li>
            <li> This does leave your skin a little red after but that&#x27;s totally normal and goes away after it&#x27;s rinsed off.</li>
            <li> Then a few hours later, I am back to normal.</li>
            <li> ( I ran out of apple cider vinegar but am excited to use it) and applied a thin even coat on my face.</li>
            <li> not bad, but a little trouble t</li>
            <li> and application was a little messy, but not bad at all.</li>
            <li> Also the price on here is a bit high, I found it cheaper on vitashop and it only took a few days to reach my doorstep.</li>
            <li> I mean you can see the results right after you use it.</li>
            <li> You can use a moisturizer, but I highly recommend oil before moisturizer - just a little bit.</li>
            <li> My pores are so much smaller, and my black heads are almost completely gone!</li>
            <li> My pores are so much smaller, and my black heads are almost completely gone!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it consistently enough to see results like everyone else claims, as it can be pretty hard to get off without using the shower or sink.</li>
            <li> I did a mask using raw organic apple cider vinegar and felt my face pulsing so much, I looked in the mirror to see if it was moving.</li>
            <li> use this product by mixing it with Bragg&#x27;s raw unfiltered apple cider vinegar, which I picked up at Whole Foods where I also bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin has been absolutely horrid since I moved to Oregon, I mean hybrid dry-oily skin that consistently breaks out and is uneven.</li>
            <li> When I washed it off I was shocked to find that my skin was extremely tight and had turned a bright red color near all the edges where I put the mask.</li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;ve read not to use your fingers when removing black heads, I didn&#x27;t even have to squeeze at all and the black heads came right out.</li>
            <li> seen dramatic results after day 3 using apple cider vinegar as toner and medicated moisturizer and no make up.. fantastic results</li>
            <li> when done I went to dry my feet and noticed that my foot felt soft yet when I rubbed my hand on my foot alllllllll of this dry skin just started literally falling off!</li>
            <li> the next morning the entire thing was dry, and today is the third day, it&#x27;s just a scar now.</li>
            <li> I use it, I will mix it with apple vinegar, apply thin layer on the skin, and wait for 20 minutes, I clean my face.</li>
            <li> The after effects are definitely the goal which has been accomplished, though I&#x27;m not sure about blackheads (reason for the 4 stars)</li>
            <li> The after effects are definitely the goal which has been accomplished, though I&#x27;m not sure about blackheads (reason for the 4 stars)</li>
            <li> The next day, as my face recovered (and broke out as usual) look at my skin under daylight, under fluorescent work lights, nothing has really changed.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend - old or young (well, teenager at least), male or female.  </li>
            <li> You can really feel your face pulling, which is a weird feeling at first</li>
            <li> A little really goes a long way!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve spent so much money at regular department stores on products that have never even gave me slight the results Aztec did.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend likes to go slightly thinner by adding a tiny bit more vinegar to thin out</li>
            <li> Use the ACV to mix it and don&#x27;t make too much because you just end up wasting it, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> But I left it on for too long the last time, resulted in severe hives!</li>
            <li> I cannot wait to see how long this product will last me with regular use.</li>
            <li> as I would think one would need to do a minor facial scrub maybe the day afterwards (or maybe up to 6 hours later) to get them out while they are still &#x27;loosen&#x27; from the mask</li>
            <li> as I would think one would need to do a minor facial scrub maybe the day afterwards (or maybe up to 6 hours later) to get them out while they are still &#x27;loosen&#x27; from the mask</li>
            <li> The clay is pretty messy and I am worried that it will plug up my sinks</li>
            <li> In a few days, his normal color came back.</li>
            <li> it just wait for your face to the back to normal and then use a heavy moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have even applied a thin layer of the product underneath my eyes because of their dark pigmentation, and the effect of this was more than amazing!&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first I mixed it to thick, and clogged the sink.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got highly sensitive or reactive skin, it may be too aggressive a mask for your skin; but for normal to oily to acneic, or thick sun damaged skin, this mask will do the trick.  </li>
            <li> My teenagers and I use it, and while you need to start slow, I have noticed a big difference in the acne in both my kids when they use it consistently.</li>
            <li> I have always had large pores, excessively oily skin and acne.</li>
            <li> I usually mix up a large amount.</li>
            <li> No more break-outs or large pores.</li>
            <li> I can also see little black dots of what is hopefully dirt and grime from my pores popping up on the mask, which is exciting...</li>
            <li> The smell can be a little intense as your putting it on your face, but let it completely dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It definitely does clean, half of my pores (nose/cheek area)all but disappeared, the other half were</li>
            <li> Left my skin feeling soft &amp; also helped with the redness of acne &amp; made the swelling go down.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t put this stuff down the drain, you have to get the mask wet and then gently rub it off so it can fall into a bowl.</li>
            <li> I have very, very sensitive skin, so my face is a little red for a half-hour after.</li>
            <li> Sucks LITERALLY everything out of your pores, and you will feel your face pulsing while it is drying, because it is very intense.</li>
            <li> I typically get anywhere from 1 to 4 pimples a day and so far today -NONE!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not extraordinary, but it&#x27;s not ordinary either.</li>
            <li> It is a bit hard to mix and the clay powder will spill upon first opening.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> I used it with water the first 2-3 times but found with water was a bit hard to apply so</li>
            <li> but unlike some of the other reviewers mine was gone when I finished gawking and ogling and touching the soft skin left behind by the mask and actually dried my face.</li>

            <li> One of my children has had a pretty hard time with acne.  </li>
            <li> A couple of drops of tea tree oil quickly stop pimples from getting any larger and helps dry them out in 1/3 of the time it usually takes.&lt;br /&gt;NEEM - Neem oil is known to be anti-viral, anti-bacterial, and anti-inflammatory among other properties.  </li>
            <li> a plus.\\&quot; Personally, my skin is dry and does not benefit from using this product as a facial often.</li>
            <li> a plus.\\&quot; Personally, my skin is dry and does not benefit from using this product as a facial often.</li>
            <li> Its easy to apply, easier to remove (can still be a bit difficult at times), does not clog the drain and can be had at a local drug store if you cannot wait for it to be shipped through amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well it works for pimple pimples because I&#x27;ve been taking Pantothenic Acid pills that have been the only thing actually getting rid of my can (which I highly recommend!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Stuff really pulls and is kinda messy and hard to get off your face but really works</li>
            <li> I only gave 4 stars because I don&#x27;t think it helps acne too much but definitely gets rid of that dull skin for a brighter refreshed me 😊</li>
            <li> stated in other reviews, it is NOT necessary to use a super thick layer of the product.</li>
            <li> and I know it&#x27;s hard not to be skeptical when it seems like people only have good things to say,</li>
            <li> it did seem to clean my pores a little, but no better than any product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> So I learned to calm my crazy obsession for fast results, and actually listen to my skin.</li>
            <li> Before trying this one, I was in doxycycline 100mg, and I&#x27;m not sure if that really helped me.</li>
            <li> and i was anxious to see if this mask really helprd to reduce them.well</li>
            <li> I am on week 3 of this product, using it at least twice a week (first week 3 times).</li>
            <li> (No more than a teaspoon in your mask though, you could burn or irritate your skin with too much)</li>
            <li> It has cleared up my face so much in the past three months.</li>
            <li> Next time I plan to use cold water, because I&#x27;ll bet the lifting effects will be even more pronounced, and may last longer that way.  </li>

            <li> , some of the dark acne spots had lightened if not gone away completely.</li>
            <li> i should of read the negative comments first.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure why since it isn&#x27;t really</li>

            <li> not sure if they&#x27;re really acne</li>
            <li> I have darkish skin, not really dark, just tan dark, and once I wipe off the mask, even my face gets red.</li>
            <li> Her skin is flat.</li>
            <li> I may have left it on too long, so</li>
            <li> I may have left it on too long, so</li>
            <li> Long story short, give this a chance!</li>
            <li> Long story short</li>
            <li> TOO... will last a long while.</li>
            <li> and this will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have had maybe two blemishes since this mask yanked all the stuff out of my pores....and those blemishes were not as severe and didn&#x27;t last nearly as long as they used</li>
            <li> This clay jar will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be recommending and be a long time user of this product.</li>
            <li> being said, I&#x27;ve had troublesome pimples and blackheads and those massive geysers embedded in my skin for as long as I could remember.</li>
            <li> A pound of this stuff last a long time.</li>
            <li> I actually leave it on for as long as I can stand it.  </li>
            <li> I actually leave it on for as long as I can stand it.  </li>
            <li> It definitely gives that pulling/tugging sensation as it dries, and I leave it on as long as I can manage (about 10-15 minutes).</li>
            <li> AND IT WILL LAST YOU FOR A LONG TIME .</li>
            <li> Prior to using this masque, I had some minor acne scars that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of and clogged pores by the side of my chin.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this quantity will last a really long time.</li>
            <li> Your skin might experience some redness, but it doesn&#x27;t last long in my case or when I used it on clients.</li>
            <li> Minor, Moderate, Severe.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use it regularly and change my review if I see a difference long term.</li>
            <li> I know that this tub will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> This product will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I do not have acne prone skin; however, I still experience minor facial mishaps--a pimple here, a zit there, etc.</li>
            <li> This tub will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> , I saw people complaining that this clay is a greenish grey color, which they took to be \\&quot;impure\\&quot; because it wasn&#x27;t white (racists!)</li>
            <li> , I saw people complaining that this clay is a greenish grey color, which they took to be \\&quot;impure\\&quot; because it wasn&#x27;t white (racists!)</li>
            <li> Only if it didn&#x27;t take so long to mix with water.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot of it in a jar so it will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my teenage daughter having long time acne problems.</li>
            <li> This will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I look forward to a weekly mask, this should last a really long time.</li>
            <li> Try it, this product will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gonna last me a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do be prepared for the pulling sensation because you can definitely feel it and it will probably start to hurt after a bit if you leave the mask on too long (which I have done and regretted).</li>
            <li> This container will last a really long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product to help aid in those breakouts which will aid in the scars following those breakouts in the long run.</li>
            <li> This container lasts a long time - you really only need a tablespoon for each mask.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also a lot of product so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I can tell this jar will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Leaving it on for as long as possible does not work with this product!</li>
            <li> do see this product lasting a long time</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I like the product--I think there is a lot of the clay inside the jar to last a long time.</li>
            <li> 4)is going to last sooooo long.</li>
            <li> and I can tell the container I bought will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> which is normal after a few minutes it went away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> then I need for a pretty thick mask plus my butt.</li>
            <li> , I put mine on in two or three layers so it was pretty thick, she maybe did 1.5 layers.  </li>
            <li> and they range from just under the skin irritating pimples to full blown cystic nightmares.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty damn thick (TWSS).</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m always a little hesitant to try something new...</li>
            <li> My skin is a bit sensitive, so I only leave it on for about 5-7 minutes, basically until it dries and starts to get a tight, itchy feeling.</li>
            <li> Hard to get off unless you wet it first!</li>
            <li> Feels crazy when it dries, it&#x27;s a cool rush !!</li>
            <li> Is your skin dry with an intense T Zone or just plain oily?</li>
            <li> The first day I used a half and half mixture of water and ACV.</li>
            <li> So if you have normal, dry or just slightly oily skin, I would start out with just water for the mix, and maybe try the vinegar.  </li>
            <li> This product left my face red, inflamed and dry for 3 days!</li>
            <li> To start off I get black heads on my nose and my skin is normal to dry</li>
            <li> First, you seriously may want to consider doing this before you take a shower - I&#x27;ll tell you why later in the review.  </li>
            <li> I tried mixing it with half water and half lemon juice at first because I was waiting for my ACV.</li>
            <li> I continued to use it 3x a week for about 6 weeks hoping to clear out my pores and bring my acne down.</li>
            <li> so I took a big bowl of hot water and a rag and cleaned my face off after it dried than flushed the water down the toilet.</li>
            <li> Do not let them down the sink directly.</li>
            <li> I do two apps on the days my face seems super dull, other than that I use this 1-2 times a week.</li>
            <li> Felt great during and right after using, but then caused horrible break-out a few days after.</li>
            <li> then after the red faded away, my fact didn&#x27;t look any  different, though it felt very dry, even using a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I used as little as possible and then wiped my face with a soft towel to get any excess oil off.</li>
            <li> I left it on long enough to completely dry.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product once, so it is a little early for me to form an opinion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little messy but well worth it.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but now I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Normally skin may be red for a few minutes after rinsing, but the noticeable glow comes alive a few minutes after your skin has settled.</li>
            <li> I myself don&#x27;t really feel a tingly sensation other than the sensation I feel as it dries (which is typical for any type of mud/clay mask).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I mean, 100% gone, no sign they were ever there in the first place, and I&#x27;ve had those for YEARS.</li>
            <li> Will last you a long time!</li>
            <li> You have to try it for yourself to understand exactly what I mean.</li>
            <li> It will last you a long time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also a skincare junkie and have bought/tried several other masks but ultimately come back to this one.</li>
            <li> sad but true!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s a great base for adding oils or other ingredients to address specific skin problems.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, as I said, it did improve my skin when I used it consistently, by which I mean about three times a week.</li>
            <li> I mixed with water for the first few days and the result was a clumpy, watery mess</li>
            <li> Your skin feels so &#x27;new&#x27; after this mask removes that layer of dead skin.  </li>
            <li> This may come in handy for bee stings and other insect bites, and nettle stings and other similar skin irritations that can happen further away from home base - where I am keeping a supply of this clay in stock.feel the positive results of having this clay sit on his oily skin for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> One jar will last a very long time and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> and it should last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> My pores are so much smaller and suddenly not a single black head left on my face.</li>
            <li> After waiting for the redness to go away I knew I was in love with this product, I have bad adult acne and acne scars and this clay evened out my skin color and took away my acne.</li>
            <li> If you have bad acne, instead of purchasing Proactive, try this bentonite clay instead, it deep cleans pores and prevents acne, it also make an effective alternative shampoo.</li>
            <li> In hopes to clear up black heads but to my surprise after one use my Psoriasis</li>
            <li> I typically have clear skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is delicate but there can be more delicate skin types.</li>
            <li> Pimples were starting to dry up.</li>
            <li> To use this product it comes dry in powder form, you add some to a bowl with water but the product is smoother if it has a day to sit mixed with the water.</li>
            <li> Next, after patting my face dry, I mix the clay with the apple cider and spread it on my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sitting here, writing this review, while waiting for my third application of this mask to dry.  </li>
            <li> It took the redness out of his skin and started to dry up the blemishes the very next day.</li>
            <li> However, I find it difficult to mix a smooth paste and am always left with paste mixed with various clumps that are near impossible to smooth out.</li>
            <li> It is mixed either with vinegar or water until it is a paste then spread on one&#x27;s face and allowed to dry.</li>
            <li> Then once you are done pat your face dry with a towel and look at your face, woah it&#x27;s red.</li>
            <li> I pat dry my face and add my daily moisturizer</li>
            <li> pimples dry, whiteheads, what white heads and my pores where gone as well.  </li>
            <li> Also helped with dry skin on foot, though did not last.  </li>
            <li> I put on enough that it will be dry after 20-30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Overall i would recommend this product, but not to anyone will DRY skin.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with the apple cider vinegar, put it on and let it dry.</li>
            <li> I leave it on about 20 minutes (enough time to dry).  </li>
            <li> After I washed it off, there was two red rings around my eyes because it was so dry.</li>
            <li> Works well, but  difficult to get it mixed into a smooth clay.</li>
            <li> My skin is a weird combo of being oily and yet drying out relatively easily.  </li>
            <li> If you try to pull it off before the clay is dry, then only the gauze will pull off and the clay will remain on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> all the products only agitated it more, which was infuriating.</li>
            <li> or once every two weeks, especially if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> After two treatments in a week I had several bumps dry up</li>
            <li> my black heads were almost completely gone</li>
            <li> my black heads were almost completely gone</li>
            <li> My skin got red and dry after using it</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time because u use just a small portion of the powder to mix with water or vinegar to apply to your whole face.</li>
            <li> i am a Chinese, my skin had been dry since i came america.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my skin but slightly decrease a pimple and make my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I mix equal portions of this with apple cider vinegar and apply it on face and neck, and then wash it off after 20 mins or when dry.</li>
            <li> It appears to dry out those pesky problem pimples as well as soothe erupting pimples and cystic acne (though to a slightly lesser degree).</li>
            <li> I thought it would dry out my skin, but surprisingly enough, it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The only thing it seemed to do was dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> It is a back to basics approach to skin care, providing a soothing way to deep clean skin, without a lot of  expensive extras.</li>
            <li> the try to scrub/wash it off as fast as possible cuz it kinda sucks.</li>
            <li> Try to let it dry as much as possible.  </li>
            <li> Made the mud, let it dry, washed it off and never looked back.</li>
            <li> It also has healed old acne scars and makes my skin less oily.</li>
            <li> , I use the Cetafil regular face wash and pat my skin dry.  </li>
            <li> Been using once a week, and I expect this jar to last me at least a whole year.</li>
            <li> Wow I brought mud online, thought free mud on Craiglist was crazy.</li>
            <li> my hair started to feel immensely dry, so I went to the mhm website and read the comments to see if someone else had the same problem.</li>
            <li> and it was impossible to shape it into a nice, spreadable paste.</li>
            <li> Only used it a few times so far.  </li>
            <li> Plus it last for a long, long time for the price.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s light/not heavy on the skin; mine is sensitive so this is a big plus for me.  </li>
            <li> More expensive than expected.</li>
            <li> After about six tries, it hasn&#x27;t totally cleared up my face, but it&#x27;s gotten further than anything else!</li>
            <li> I may try it again for the next few nights to see if it will completely clear up my face, even though  I remember reading somewhere</li>
            <li> I may try it again for the next few nights to see if it will completely clear up my face, even though  I remember reading somewhere</li>
            <li> Also, this comes in a tub that will last a long long time.</li>
            <li> I gave myself a facial today and used water to mix instead of apple cider vinegar and the drawing and tightening effects were the same except that my face was not as pink as when I used the ACV.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for 2 days so far and the few pimples I had are gone, some of them where cystic.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with blackheads and clogged pores and I have only used the mask 3 times, thus far.</li>
            <li> Nothing worked and I was thinking I&#x27;d have to go on acutane for a second round as an adult (I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s).  </li>
            <li> Its too harsh for me but the teenage son uses it frequently.  </li>
            <li> I left it on for 30 minutes and it hadn&#x27;t dried out completely.</li>
            <li> If you take half a teaspoon of this clay powder, you will actually have enough mixture to use on your entire face (and maybe neck too - depending on how tiny your face</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quite a few people mentioned that this mask was kind of \\&quot;uncomfortable\\&quot;, or not for the faint of heart.</li>
            <li> When I removed it my face was pink, but no pores were visible and a few pimples were ready to be popped.</li>
            <li> This is the really messy part if you are applying to more than just your face as it will leave behind lots of clay.&lt;br /&gt;To</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine that thick of a mask being necessary, or very possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does cake heavily and is kind of tiresome to remove.</li>
            <li> I suggest you mix this clay mask in nice and thick and apply it on your skin generously thin.</li>
            <li> Thanks god, I did not pay more than $10 for this crap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true but that&#x27;s the reason I hate it, because it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> am a little skeptic right now but will update the results after few uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a little trouble deciding on the consistency and don&#x27;t think I got it right yet.</li>
            <li> My face feels so clean and tight!!!!</li>
            <li> I know everyone has different skin and it may work for other people in different ways, but with my sensitive skin, it&#x27;s not worth the trouble.ke</li>
            <li> but I believe that its harsh on my skin since i have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> says that a single pound of this can make up to 10-15 facial masks.</li>
            <li> I would advise if u are only making it for a single use, then use maybe a 1/4 tsp and add as you go.</li>
            <li> Every single time I use this I wake up with a bunch of tiny itchy pimples, not like anything I&#x27;ve ever had before.</li>
            <li> even 1000&#x27;s on stuff that doesn&#x27;t work or works for only a limited time frame.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but my face doesn&#x27;t have a single zit on it currently.</li>
            <li> Skin has several layers, the epidermis is basically 25-30 layers of dry dead skin, so you can imagine how long it takes for new skin to turn over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can feel it working hard without the usual chemicals and fragrances that can easily irritate or burn my skin.</li>
            <li> I took the time to read all the review bf I purchased (negative and positive).  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve read the negative reviews on here and the positive ones</li>
            <li> Also, my acne is the huge, under the skin, painful welt type acne around my mouth and nose with occasional &#x27;normal&#x27; pimples in the T-Zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my forehead was a mess and it looks almost clear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a complete mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a complete mess.</li>
            <li> (apparently it has other uses too like for your feet and body wraps!).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also had a big cystic acne on my chin, and usually it take 2-3 days for one like that to get soft and get a white head.</li>
            <li> The other day, my grandmother and I came across one of those natural stores that sold herbal capsules, smudge sticks and other such homeopathic remedies..</li>
            <li> Mixed it with apple cider, small amount of botanics clay mask (only because I had some here) and WOW</li>
            <li> SKIN AND HAIR WENT THRU TERRIBLE THINGS, AND HAS FINALLY GOTTEN BACK TO A BEAUTIFUL PLACE.&lt;br /&gt;KEEP</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times so far!</li>
            <li> it is incredibly annoying to apply -- unless you take the time to mix it in a baggie, it kind of clumps and doesn&#x27;t dissolve properly in water, so u end up with stange lumps all over you face, then some bare patches where it didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Mixed a batch in a small tupperware container used it for months until it was gone then made a new one.</li>
            <li> Bear in mind that everyone&#x27;s different, I tend to have crepey, loose skin</li>
            <li> However I have had to back off a little from using it as often since it will dry my skin out if used to frequently.</li>
            <li> I try to leave it on as long as possible, but often take it off before it is completely dry.</li>
            <li> Probably the only drawback for me is how long I have to wait for it to dry..</li>
            <li> and it worked just the same without the long dry time.  </li>
            <li> and I never really had any infection, just slight swelling, which is a normal reaction to a trauma.&lt;br /&gt;Many</li>
            <li> Yes it leaves the skin a bit red and with larger pores, THAT eventually shrink back down and the redness leaves.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so tight that it will surprise you, and then your pores will be so minimized and clear that it will surprise you too.  </li>
            <li> This truly works to get your skin clear and pores tight.</li>
            <li> Made my face so soft and tight.</li>
            <li> My skin felt so tight and soft that I couldn&#x27;t believe it was mine.</li>
            <li> When you apply it your skin gets tight and when you wash it off it feels so soft.</li>
            <li> But be careful, don&#x27;t let it on your face for more time tat recommended, can be very irritating.</li>
            <li> I really do like it but its very lumpy and its very frustrating.</li>
            <li> so this product will last a very long time!  </li>
            <li> this stuff will last me a very long time!  </li>
            <li> to use.&lt;br /&gt;Pulls all the funk out of your pores - good stuff!&lt;br /&gt;Pulls so tight on my face that it gets a little uncomfortable though.</li>
            <li> seriously i have had acne and this cleared my acne so much!</li>
            <li> Even better, it&#x27;s much less expensive than just about any facial mask product on the market.  </li>
            <li> and I have dealt with facial skin issues for years due to the type and amount of twice daily taken medications.</li>
            <li> Today they are not only significantly smaller, but also much less red and tender.</li>
            <li> I hate the smell of the apple cider vinegar but other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> The reason those OTHER products react differently on different skin types is because those are all products that contain chemicals, and different ones at that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really excited about this product, after trying several expensive alternatives.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this because I have bought so much other stuff in which did not work, but I love the way my skin feels after an application of this.</li>
            <li> I mixed with apple cider vinegar and tried applying daily to weekly to every other day, nada.</li>
            <li> I have been using this clay from my local apothecary, and recently switched to Amazon due to rice inflation.</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry skin, the occasional blemish, and the usual BLAH skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this clay due to the fact, that I had a possible infection after a stingray hit in to my left foot.</li>
            <li> I used it religiously for 2 months (facial every two weeks) and saw no noticeable difference other than lots of dryness in my cheeks.</li>
            <li> While the last was drying (I just used the powder and mixed with water, I know you can mix it with other solutions)</li>
            <li> The effect it had on my face was just the same effect I had with the other facial clay masks</li>
            <li> After doing my routine for a couple of weeks my nose and cheeks had little to no black heads!</li>
            <li> Each time it left my face feeling very dry.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and doing that made some spots on my face feel raw and made it red.</li>
            <li> like if you have little cysts with the clear gunk that just keeps oozing....</li>
            <li> The thinner layer on my neck got itchy because of the vinegar (which if you didn&#x27;t know is a natural antibacterial and therefore can burn a little anyway...)  </li>
            <li> I have little doubt that if I continue to use this product my acne and skin problems will disappear completely.</li>
            <li> The little bumps on my face that tells me I&#x27;m near a breakout were gone after using the mask.</li>
            <li> I do love how my skin feels after the treatment and the only negative is the messy mess of taking off the clay after it&#x27;s hardened!</li>
            <li> The other times I have used it (total of 3 times so far), I combined the clay with some water, a splash of ACV, some tea tree oil and Vitamin C capsule (broken apart), and I really like that combination.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit of a mess mixing and a real mess when applying to the face, but it&#x27;s so worth it.  </li>
            <li> bit of background on my skin type; it is generally considered combination and is breakout prone, however I sway to only slightly oily and slightly dry.</li>
            <li> It fractures in little pieces that are stuck to your face as the mask shrinks and the skin tries to regain its normal shape.</li>
            <li> Use it the night before a date, or a party, or some other social event, etc, once you&#x27;ve figured out how it works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They say to expect 30 minutes of redness, but I had to wait a little over an hour before my skin returned to a normal, not so alarming, color.  </li>
            <li> They say to expect 30 minutes of redness, but I had to wait a little over an hour before my skin returned to a normal, not so alarming, color.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to wipe off, so I would have a warm/steamed towel ready to soften it up once you want to remove it.</li>
            <li> washing off is hard because it is real mud</li>
            <li> , I want to provide my little experience in working with this product as first few times</li>
            <li> Kinda hard to mix with water because it gets clumpy fast and doesn&#x27;t spread well.</li>
            <li> Apply with your index and middle fingers into a thin layer once it&#x27;s an opaque green tinge is fine (not translucent)&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 36, with regular (but not cystic) acne, large, colors pores, oily skin within a few hours of washing, and a few scars.</li>
            <li> Yes, your skin will look red afterwards (but my skin always looks red), after a little while that will go away, and I think it has reduced my redness overall.  </li>
            <li> (It is pretty difficult to mix and get to a consistent texture, just work it around a little bit).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have little white bumps all over now and a few cyst like bumps (both of which unusual for my skin).</li>
            <li> Just a little history about my skin, I&#x27;m african american woman who suffered from acne as a teen</li>
            <li> but my experiments with raw Clay is a new thing.</li>
            <li> I had previously tried other natural remedies but this is the only product that helped stop the itchy feeling and heal the mosquito bites.</li>
            <li> You do look like an alligator as the facial starts to dry and crack due to facial movements.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of essential oils and natural alternatives, but I&#x27;m having a hard time with this clay.</li>
            <li> were a couple of lazy weeks that I really didn&#x27;t use this regularly but after getting more of the painful acne, I really tried hard to do it every 2 days.</li>
            <li> were a couple of lazy weeks that I really didn&#x27;t use this regularly but after getting more of the painful acne, I really tried hard to do it every 2 days.</li>
            <li> I break out bad a lot and using this once a week has had amazing results.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of dead skin after bad sun burn and leaves skin nice and soft..</li>
            <li> You really feel how this just sucks everything  out of your pores, your face starts pulsating...</li>
            <li> In my mind, cheap &#x3D; lousy.</li>
            <li> you can really feel your face pulsating as it sucks out all the toxins.</li>
            <li> My complaint is that no matter how much I mix, no matter what combination of powder, water and vinegar</li>
            <li> and I gotta say it&#x27;s pretty crazy how much of a difference you can see immediately after removing it.</li>
            <li> please feel free to advise if I am doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> Not too sound like I&#x27;m bragging or anything, but it&#x27;s difficult for me to try a product</li>
            <li> I was afraid of infection and decided to do research and found that balancing the ph of your skin is extremely important to the healing process and it led me to this jar of gold!</li>
            <li> I found when you apply it on cold it will grip on your face and apply much more evenly.</li>
            <li> I am almost out and desperately need some more.</li>
            <li> When people say it &amp;#34;sucks out&amp;#34; blackheads, you can really see those suckers--</li>
            <li> I mostly got it for my son who suffers from acne pores and face redness</li>
            <li> Just note that it is difficult to get smooth</li>
            <li> I have tried MULTIPLE products such as Proactive, Clearasil, Neutrogena, Avon, you name it and most of them only worked for a week or two and then my face would go back to normal or even become worst; at times I acquired some scars.</li>
            <li> I will make an update to this if it seems to clear up my acne in a few months.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using it no more than twice per week, and only once per week if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> In a few days your skin will be clear.</li>
            <li> In a few days your skin will be clear.</li>
            <li> As far as I was concerned, all of the above was a small price to pay for the result.</li>
            <li> As far as I was concerned, all of the above was a small price to pay for the result.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple mask and by far there is no better mask out there.</li>
            <li> It clears up my complexion and makes my skin have an even tone for about a day long.</li>
            <li> My eyes looked stretched out like Droopy Dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> I took it off and I looked grey for a while.</li>
            <li> So far, it hasn&#x27;t been messy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this may be a long review...</li>
            <li> I leave it on for as long as I want or can take.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy to come off but it leaves your skin feeling buttery soft and it pulls the impurities out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried scrubs, strips, masks, lotions, and they&#x27;ve usually only helped minimally.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to hear about this product.  </li>
            <li> I used the Derma Roller for 2 months straight, once a week on my face and it got rid of 90% of the left behind red marks.</li>
            <li> You might want to reconsider if you have sensitive skin because this thing is heavy duty.</li>
            <li> yes if you leave it on to long it will burn but you have to follow directions</li>
            <li> My skin is considered combination/oily and not sensitive at all</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s strange that my skin is reacting this way to 100% calcium bentonite clay, as the label claims.</li>
            <li> The next morning at 6 when I went to wet my face</li>
            <li> and it lasts long.</li>
            <li> Nothing has ever given me any noticeable long term benefits.  </li>
            <li> Anyways, I&#x27;ve probably used it 50 times since I got it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> BTW my skin is not sensitive.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it took so long for me to find out about this product.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with skin issues for a long time (I have combination/oily skin).</li>
            <li> Oh, and it lasts a long time too.  </li>
            <li> I lather it all over my face and keep it on until it dries or as long as I can stand it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to find it</li>
            <li> I am 32 and for as long as I can remember</li>
            <li> My skin was pink for about 30 minutes after the shower, and I waited before I attempted to apply my make up, so figure in some extra time if you are on a schedule.</li>
            <li> My blackheads on my nose have lessened but are not completely gone, so do not get the impression that it will just suck them all out.</li>
            <li> My only warning is to be careful</li>
            <li> cos my hair felt strange by day 3 post wash.</li>
            <li> My cats gave me strange long looks.</li>
            <li> when using is that my skin is red for about an hour afterward which is to be expected.</li>
            <li> It lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used this a few times</li>
            <li> I just spent 20 minutes with the mask (mixed with the vinegar) on my face</li>
            <li> she gave me a long explanation of what this was for and how well it worked for her ...</li>
            <li> I never had to deal with teenage acne and I have minimal signs of aging.</li>
            <li> it was pulling all the nasty stuff from my pores :) but definitely make sure you&#x27;re using face moisturizer after so your skin doesn&#x27;t get dried out!.</li>
            <li> No change expected in that short time.</li>
            <li> Im sure i did something wrong but only a few blackheads were gone.</li>
            <li> It took 5 to ten minutes for the pink areas to disappear from my skin.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll end up with clay balls, no matter how long you mix it.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave it on for too long or your face will feel like it is being ripped apart.</li>
            <li> My family is in shock after suffering with me for 8 long years.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know this for years, but one day we were talking long distance, and she told me she had ulcerative colitis and was having a flare-up that showed no sign of abating after 10 days.  </li>
            <li> always see how long I can keep this stuff on;</li>
            <li> there are a long list of reasons why skin will erupt and look bad.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> and I heard you shouldn&#x27;t leave this on for too long or use it too often if you do.</li>
            <li> So even though this might seem a bit long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with milia for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> And this bottle lasts a long time</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too harsh, and it is natural.  </li>
            <li> After you apply, let it set for around 15-30 mins, depending on how long you can take.</li>
            <li> and I keep it on as long as I can...</li>
            <li> My acne has dried up completely.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is a harmful effect as much as a minor</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is a harmful effect as much as a minor</li>
            <li> Since my goal is to tighten my pores evenly (especially the face center, or nose area)</li>
            <li> One caveat is not to leave it on too long.</li>
            <li> They are expected to last around 3 months.</li>
            <li> I use the pink clay facial sponge for my face cleaning.</li>
            <li> They are expected to last around 3 months.</li>
            <li> I use the pink clay facial sponge for my face cleaning.</li>
            <li> It goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from acne for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so upsetting because I wanted this product for so long</li>
            <li> It will help but not completely erase</li>
            <li> use a mini plastic ziploc bag to grab the dirt (about a tablespoon) and mix it with the apple cider vinegar (enough to just get it wet).</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t leave it on too long or it starts to get reallyyyyy itchy.</li>
            <li> (I have combination skin that is definitely not sensitive).  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference so far besides having to hide out for a few days &amp; feeling my skin feel like sandpaper</li>
            <li> I use the product once a breakout begins, it does not completely remove the acne, however, it does stop irritation.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a mask for a long time for my sensative</li>
            <li> This jar goes a long long way, which is another plus.  </li>
            <li> as expected, my face was red afterword for like 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To end this exceedingly long review, if you use this product, pay attention to your skin, not recommended times.</li>
            <li> To end this exceedingly long review, if you use this product, pay attention to your skin, not recommended times.</li>
            <li> I did not know this, but the clay is powder, as in baby powder-type consistency, so be careful when you open it</li>
            <li> I will use until gone but will take me a long time there is a lot of product so if it does work for you</li>
            <li> Its gonna smell strange if you arent used to ACV</li>
            <li> It tingled and made my face red, which was to be expected.</li>
            <li> I will be using this for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have long been a fan of charcoal masks and now of the clay.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin,large pores and uneven skin tone, I used this mask 2x a week</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne and blackheads for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> I usually wet it in sections and go back and wipe it off once it&#x27;s easier.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this clay long, but it&#x27;s working wonders.</li>
            <li> My blackheads were almost (not completely) gone.</li>
            <li> I left it on for about 20-30 mins and be careful because some of it might fall off when it dries up.</li>
            <li> Knowing my skin is sensitive, I took the risk of doing the mask almost everyday.</li>
            <li> It tightened up my pores and helps control my minor breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I wash my face off into an empty bucket and then toss the used clay and water outside)</li>
            <li> And be careful when you rinse it off... could possibly clog your drains.</li>
            <li> and my skin has been the clearest it&#x27;s been in a long time.</li>
            <li> I would not hesitate to buy this again but it will be a really long time before I need to do that.</li>
            <li> How long can you keep it up?</li>
            <li> I will buy this product as long as they continue to sell it.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t feel like it was a complete waste of time, either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> can burn your face if you leave it on too long.</li>
            <li> I wonder how long it would take this time.onths in case someone is reading my review.        </li>
            <li> I wonder how long it would take this time.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results.</li>
            <li> so I took wet paper towels and it took me over 10 minutes to scoop it off of my face, throw it away and finally just wash the rest of it off in the sink.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strange sensation, but I guess it&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> so we do not leave it on long.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product last week, I have done only three masks, and already, these stubborn, cystic bumps that have been embarrassing me and haunting me for the past 10 years have disappeared, and I&#x27;m starting to see the red marks go away as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional</li>
            <li> Water, however, takes a long time to get that cream-like/batter-like mixture.</li>
            <li> P.S. dont leave it on toooo long</li>
            <li> It felt strange while washing it off, but afterwards..</li>
            <li> I wish I could be one of the success stories, but unfortunately this immediately broke my skin out in tiny pimples across my forehead and then larger bumps on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t notice any long term improvements and</li>
            <li> My face is not completely clear yet</li>
            <li> I said, my face is not clear JUST yet.</li>
            <li> I said, my face is not clear JUST yet.</li>
            <li> It was so gross yet so cool (weird acne fetish)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t freak out if your skin seems worse after the first time - give it a second try!</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t have any real long term issues other than this plus your normal issues that crop up, so not sure how it would work on actual cystic or red acne blemishes).</li>
            <li> I was skeptical I&#x27;ll be honest, but I bought it ( who can say no at this price) and tried it and HOLY MACKERAL - this stuff.. its like from some alien world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While it does not clear up the acne it altogether.</li>
            <li> As many with the same condition know balancing Seb Derm and acne problems is very difficult.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry if after the first few times if you might get a few pimples</li>
            <li> Just a note, use a cleaned out sour cream or cottage cheese container to mix it in and any extra use the next day.  </li>
            <li> Besides, being messy and inconvenient, it simply wasn&#x27;t effective for me.</li>
            <li> However, it comes out really lumpy and thick at that ratio.</li>
            <li> I will say be careful to get exact parts of the clay and vinegar because otherwise it&#x27;s too thick.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t take a thick layer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how this would cause my drains to clog as I do not cover my whole body in a thick layer.</li>
            <li> Also, If you put it on as thick as it suggests, it takes that much time to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but just my whole face seems to be slowly filling up with pimple like bumps.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Today when I used it, I applied a thick layer because I accidentally made way too much.</li>
            <li> I see this jar lasting me a very long time!!</li>
            <li> I suggest putting down a newspaper or paper towels and gently peeling it off in small pieces onto that, and then rinsing off - only the residue - in the sink or shower.</li>
            <li> It can also be a little irritating because it is SO STRONG.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t really dry, but I can feel it starting to become dryer than normal, but, I&#x27;ve been hitting this mask hard</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t really dry, but I can feel it starting to become dryer than normal, but, I&#x27;ve been hitting this mask hard</li>
            <li> Super messy and hard to mix</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ll try it again next time, it definitely minimizes waste and you can save what you didn&#x27;t use for later and it won&#x27;t dry out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Take wet paper towels and gently open and place on your face, with your headed slightly tilted back, so that the entire towel is covering your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will only take a table spoon of the product and a few drops of apple cider vinegar mix it till its the right consistence (not too runny or too thick) and leave it on my face for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> it completely removed whatever it was, leaving a small portion of clear but slightly discolored skin where whatever that was had been on his face.  </li>
            <li> As it dries, your face gets pulled really tight and it really does throb/pulsate a little bit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tasteless, so it&#x27;s easy to brush with, and not at all gritty.</li>
            <li> It did leave my face incredibly red and dry after using but I expected that.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t take a Xanax and drink half a bottle of wine while you&#x27;re waiting, or your pores will feel like the Spanish conquistadors came 500 years in the future to conquer your face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I started to notice some red, itchy blotches all over my face less than 24 hours later.</li>
            <li> I only left it on less than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> a lot less red the next morning.</li>
            <li> just mixed about 1.5 teaspoons of the powder with about half an ounce of Bragg&#x27;s apple cider vinegar and applied an even coat to my face, until the entire surface was a greenish gray color.</li>
            <li> It sucked EVERYTHING out of my pores but for the next 2 weeks my skin was extremely rough and dry.</li>
            <li> , it will not be as harsh on dry or sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> You really only need to mix about a teaspoon and a half with some apple cider vinegar or water, and that will cover your entire face.</li>
            <li> When my skin goes back to being less acne-filled, I will give this another go, but on a smaller part of my face - the chin or something.</li>
            <li> The only thing is the apple cyder vinager, the face turns red for an half of hour and feels burns</li>
            <li> However..those with dry and or sensitive skin should moisturize heavily after and use sparingly..can be a bit drying</li>
            <li> For me it only takes one and a half spoonful of the product and equal amounts of liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel this method is so much easier and less messy</li>
            <li> It does the job, but I would have to say that the next time I order it I will go back to my previous brand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, after several uses, my pores are smaller, acne is less of an issue, and the blackheads on my nose are gone.</li>
            <li> I have some red pimples on my face, which remains as is, but the black acnes are gone and my pores are smaller.</li>
            <li> I put a small amount on my wrist and a small amount on the area below the earlobe (I had three pimples there, so I luckily tested it out on how it worked on pimples as well).</li>
            <li> I mean I have a whole bottle of dirt</li>
            <li> and I mean ALWAYS test a patch of skin before applying over your whole face.</li>
            <li> I mean, they seemed to really know their stuff, so</li>
            <li> I mean, they seemed to really know their stuff, so</li>
            <li> ( I mean REALLY cleans it out)</li>
            <li> ( I mean REALLY cleans it out)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be using this for a long, long time!</li>
            <li> I put my first application on waayy too thick and after pacing in front of a mirror for like 45 min I decided to take it off out of annoyance because only half of it seemed sort of dry.</li>
            <li> The mask dries new pimples out, usually just overnight, so they can start to heal and go away faster.</li>
            <li> #2: So I broke out a bit on forehead and got 1 new small pimple on cheek.</li>
            <li> Get a small bowl and a new foundation applicator brush, and some apply cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> I hope this review helped someone or anyone dealing with a scalp fungus, psoriasis, or just plain old dandruff, &amp; product buildup.  </li>
            <li> I hope this review helped someone or anyone dealing with a scalp fungus, psoriasis, or just plain old dandruff, &amp; product buildup.  </li>
            <li> I put this secret stuff on right when i got home and when i rinsed it off and waited 5 minutes</li>
            <li> Once the clay starts to dry your face will feel very tight and maybe a bit itchy in some places, but this is not excessive or unbearable.</li>
            <li> This product is unpredictable, but generally I like it.</li>
            <li> Though its effects are confounded by the other products I use, so I&#x27;m not exactly sure who&#x27;s the real hero.</li>
            <li> skin is dry, it is not sensitive, and I am not acne-prone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other big brand moisturizers, but they don&#x27;t have long term results.  </li>
            <li> I have been diagnosed with a minor case of &amp;#34;Psoriasis&amp;#34; which has been flaking off and dry in some spots.  </li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s smaller pores and extremely less acne on my face (only the occasional breakouts due to exam stress and hormonal breakouts,</li>
            <li> clay is clean clumps with just water dries slowly if put on too thick haven&#x27;t used it with vinegar definitely noticeable difference after just one use</li>
            <li> Since you only need a little bit, I can see this tub lasting a really long time.</li>
            <li> Especially for such a low price, I definitely recommend at least giving this a try.</li>
            <li> After spending hundreds of dollars on facial cleansing products I have finally found the one, I have never experience this much cleanliness on face before I have purchase the Mary Kate facial kit for over $50 and it was so useless.</li>
            <li> is how I prepared and used this product: I mixed this powdered clay with water (I didn&#x27;t have the recommended apple cider vinegar on hand); I stirred it into a thin non-clumpy paste the consistency of more like almost-mayonnaise; and then I layered each bite and the surrounding red colored skin with a creamy, lotion-like thin coat.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for black head removal, this may not be the right product...at least it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> The only part of the product use description that was true is that it certainly made my face red--like I had a bad sunburn--for about a half hour afterward...</li>
            <li> I mix the dirt (clay) with a little water, enough to spread a thick layer on my face, and I put it in a small plastic bowl and keep it in my bathroom for easy use.</li>
            <li> From proactive, clean &amp; clear, Clearasil, sulfur bars, spent thousands of dollars at dermatologists, home remedies, I mean everything!!!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used it, and what the jar doesn&#x27;t say is that you only need VERY little clay if you&#x27;re just putting this on your face - probably no more than a tablespoon.</li>
            <li> The product gets very messy when using it and it’s hard to clean.</li>
            <li> I love that it pretty much sucks up all the bad stuff from your skin.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting this for so long!</li>
            <li> Once we received this mask, she used this product mixed with apple cider vinegar as advise by other buyers.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use any other acne/cleansing products for the day you use this as your skin will burn (you&#x27;ve removed a layer of your skin by using this, so especially no chemical exfoliates for that day!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> all 3 of us will be using this for a long time!</li>
            <li> My face will be temporarily red for about 30 minutes which is something I have never seen with other face masks.</li>
            <li> It lasts a veryyyy long time!</li>
            <li> Toxins, Impurities, Metals, &amp; Other Contaminants from the Body (used both internally &amp; externally for these purposes)&lt;br /&gt;-Can sooth muscle damage, bruises, cuts &amp; wounds.&lt;br /&gt;-Astringent &amp; Antibacterial Properties</li>
            <li> started using the mask every other day, moisturizing well with Clinique&#x27;s dramatically different moisturizing gel after every use.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite beauty secret item!!!&lt;br /&gt;thanks!!</li>
            <li> This comes with a lot of clay so can be used for a long time!</li>
            <li> but I only used 3 times and had to hold of for a bit due to getting my eyebrows feathered.</li>
            <li> This product lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does exaclty what it says, as long as you read the directions it will work!</li>
            <li> Just takes a little, I left on for 20 minutes and my face was very red somewhat like a sunburn, it went away after about 20 minutes, but kinda freaked me out.  </li>
            <li> For the first time I was skeptical after reading the instructions, so I left it on for only 8 min.</li>
            <li> I wish I had a long time ago!  </li>
            <li> Not that different than other clay masks I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> was cleaning my closet out not too long ago and saw the jar and thought, why not!</li>
            <li> After I wiped it off, my face was a little red but only for maybe 15-20 mins.</li>
            <li> Will comment again just to keep other potential buyers updated.</li>
            <li> My face was a little red after but it went away around the hour later mark.  </li>
            <li> My face wasn&#x27;t really red at all like other people described.  </li>
            <li> My face wasn&#x27;t really red at all like other people described.  </li>
            <li> Smells a little weird, but not terrible.</li>
            <li> Pair this with Apple Cider Vinegar, I don&#x27;t think it would give the same results with water or any other liquid you would use.</li>
            <li> You should definitely moisturizer after using it like the other reviews mention.</li>
            <li> WHY DID I TAKE SO LONG TO BUY THIS !</li>
            <li> I know everyone has different skin and it may work for other people in different ways, but with my sensitive skin, it&#x27;s not worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s been teaching me to mix it with egg yolk, yoghurt, milk, and other stuff for different skin problems.</li>
            <li> My face has tiny breakouts due to a detox I was doing and this cleared my face the day after.</li>
            <li> Dab onto the unaffected (yet!)</li>
            <li> It does turn your skin a little red after using it, but it definitely helps improve skin tone/clarity and helps refresh your complexion.</li>
            <li> People get braces and go through other various stages during this time</li>
            <li> And the quantity lasts a LONG time!</li>
            <li> The only thing is, around each time I use it, my face breaks out with cystic acne, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s from this mask or some other factors.</li>
            <li> There will still be a little powdery residue left, but you can actually just brush that off or rinse off.  </li>
            <li> There are other clays that will do the same, but why pay more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does smell pretty awful when mixed with the vinegar, but gets better as it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> How I lived so long without it, I&#x27;ll never know!</li>
            <li> So this is going to go a long way!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Simply buy apple cider vinegar (I use Bragg&#x27;s) and mix equal parts healing clay in a plastic cup or other plastic device of your choice.</li>
            <li> It works well mixed with other ingredients (activated charcoal, turmeric, etc), or by itself with some apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel the pusating that were in other reviews, but my skin was noticiably different after washing the mask off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every other day for 30 minutes and am already seeing my nose pores smaller.</li>
            <li> Only thing is - you might breakout a little bit because its actually lifting all the junk out.</li>
            <li> It needs to be left on for a while, and I leave it on for about an hour -- although you can probably take it off after 20 minutes or so, and you can do other things in the meantime.</li>
            <li> Another well known product has this same ingredient, but it also has a lot of other &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; that would always make my eyes burn.  </li>
            <li> Used countless other stuff that did work much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have recently added greek yogurt and a little bit of honey to the mask</li>
            <li> The next day I was loaded with red dots, little pimples all around &amp; under my eyes,on my cheeks &amp; chin.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, it does leave your skin really red after</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, it does leave your skin really red after</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve made my pores look a little smaller possibly, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> Why did I wait so long to try this!???</li>
            <li> NOT ANY DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER CLAY MASK.  </li>
            <li> The pulsating sensation is pretty weird, but enjoyable in a weird way.</li>
            <li> I have used other masks such as GlamGlow to try to combat this issue</li>
            <li> Looking back at hundreds of dollars spent on some treatment or cream &amp; this 7$ clay out-preforms them all!</li>
            <li> This lasts for so long!</li>
            <li> I works as any other facial mask.</li>
            <li> so different Everyone is curious!</li>
            <li> The other reviewers may have different skin than mine...</li>
            <li> Listen to the other reviews which say the same thing!!</li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long!  </li>
            <li> Also, I only put a little bit of clay since I only want to use it once.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave it on too long!</li>
            <li> I am hooked on this product and will use it as long as I can get it from now on!</li>
            <li> No more major red bumps.</li>
            <li> A thin layer works just as well :)is to use raw and unfiltered honey!</li>
            <li> started getting shorter, and less deep, after a month, instead of two deep, straight lines across my forehead, I had one barely there line and the other was a shorter, broken line.  </li>
            <li> Of course it doesn&#x27;t last very long, ha ha but for a little while you look 20 years younger.</li>
            <li> At first I was really skeptical, after having tried drugstore &amp;#34;clay masks&amp;#34; that did nothing and trying a similar dry powder clay that totally aggravated and messed up my skin.</li>
            <li> but I can definitely see people with sensitive skin wanting to use a little less.</li>
            <li> My skin feels super soft and it wasn&#x27;t even that expensive!</li>
            <li> It was kind of hard, since the end is just shy of the circumference of an ant&#x27;s head, but it got the job done.</li>
            <li> I developed some millia (those hard white bumps) on my face.</li>
            <li> Let me first say I have a very hard time finding something to use on my skin that does not cause problems.  </li>
            <li> A very strange face mask.  </li>
            <li> It feels very strange on the face...</li>
            <li> , IT TAKE A VERY LONG TIME</li>
            <li> THIS IS GOING TO BE A VERY LONG REVIEW</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I use it with apple cider vinegar and the jar has lasted me a very long time.</li>
            <li> &amp; I will use this stuff for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this mask very long</li>
            <li> And it took very long to mix it.</li>
            <li> I did research on this product and they say to use raw acv and non-metallic utensils since metal with the ingredient with the clay won&#x27;t cause a complete mixture and adding oils can ruin the PH levels that are for the treatment of your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken steroids prescribed by my dermatologist, anti fungal treatments, switched to raw milk and all natural skin and makeup products but nothing helped.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the mud gets a little weird just sitting there after a few days, but all you have to do is add a bit more water and stir and voila!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look bad, most think it&#x27;s a beauty mark, but I know different.  </li>
            <li> Also, is it bad that I used this for 3 days in a row or should I only be using it twice a week to see better results?  </li>
            <li> Wanted it to work so bad especially because so many ppl sing</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of walking really fast and the cold air really enhanced the tightening/drying of the mask</li>
            <li> Your face begins to pulse as it starts to dry</li>
            <li> Helped dry acne.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t over dry your skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely dry there.  </li>
            <li> 45 minutes, it&#x27;s finally dry.  </li>
            <li> and my face has oily t-zone, but dry cheek area which doesn&#x27;t explain the acne on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t over dry for me, but I do have oily skin and things</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin you may want to moisturize after.</li>
            <li> I apply it and let it sit on my face until it&#x27;s almost completely dry.</li>
            <li> INSTENSE when it&#x27;s drying and also leaves your skin extremely dry if not followed up with coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Then I slather it on and let it dry until it feels like my face is going to crack apart.</li>
            <li> I also spot treat my acne soon after with my 10% benzyl peroxide cream and this is helping to dry up the pimples faster..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Leave one for 30 minutes - or until it&#x27;s dry - and wash</li>
            <li> /&gt;i decided to put some lotion on my face and when i was patting my face dry</li>
            <li> I leave it on for about an hour (until it&#x27;s totally dry)</li>
            <li> Wait the 15 minutes until dry, mist my forehead liberally with water and then wipe off the product, then misting/wiping my nose</li>
            <li> When I pat it dry and felt my face again, my skin felt like velvet fabric or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I let it dry and continued and washed my face off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had problem skin, specifically dry and oily, with intermittent acne.</li>
            <li> Too oily, too dry.  </li>
            <li> i also try and let it dry all the way.</li>
            <li> time I do it, the mask stays on my face(sometimes body too) for 10-15 mins until dry</li>
            <li> I use it once a week as i have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Pat dry and apply lots of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> What this clay does is absorbs the toxins out of the skin, as a result leaves you with dry</li>
            <li> If you have &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; to dry skin, I would not use this product.  </li>
            <li> Waited for 10-12 minutes for it to dry.</li>
            <li> So clean it out extra carefully around your nose to avoid awkward public situations.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your face will then begin to tighten as the clay mask begins to dry.</li>
            <li> My face wasn&#x27;t dry or irritated at all.</li>
            <li> You can feel your face pulsating as this clay starts to dry on it.  </li>
            <li> I then put it on my face with a concealer brush and wait 20 minutes for it to dry on my face.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait for it to dry</li>
            <li> The thicker it is, the longer it takes to dry</li>
            <li> My skin was extremely dry after using this product.</li>
            <li> After I pat my face dry</li>
            <li> I let it dry for 35 mint&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I do recommend applying a face moisturizer after, your skin can feel a bit dry.</li>
            <li> so I took it off, which was even more painful if you do not use enough water.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit to dry</li>
            <li> You might want to pat your face dry as opposed to rubbing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You might want to pat your face dry as opposed to rubbing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it took FOREVER to dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a mask that didn&#x27;t leave my face dry.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> skin will be dry when you are done whether or not you have dry or oily skin, so moisturize after.  </li>
            <li> Vinegar will dry your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second.  </li>
            <li> And it does leave your skin dry afterwards, but nothing moisturizer can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is from my anti-aging lotion getting sucked into my dry pores.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it is from my anti-aging lotion getting sucked into my dry pores.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept mine on between 25 to 35 minutes when I felt it completely dry.  </li>
            <li> I like to wait until it&#x27;s almost completely dry to remove</li>
            <li> type of skin is that overly dry but oily type</li>
            <li> You need to put some of the dry clay into a bowl and mix it with some apple cider vinegar, and water.</li>
            <li> it helped dry up all my acne</li>
            <li> By the way i have dry skin and use to have lot of blackheads etc.</li>
            <li> To alleviate the dry sensation, I apply a mixture of olive oil and coconut oil afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin, she has dry skin, so this review is for both skin</li>
            <li> of us found that our skin was dry when we washed the clay off.  </li>
            <li> Even oily skin will be dry, and for oily skin, this can be a problem.  </li>
            <li> What sells me on both the Indian Clay and the Bel Essence is that it works just as well on both dry and oily skin.  </li>
            <li> What sells me on both the Indian Clay and the Bel Essence is that it works just as well on both dry and oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I peeled the dry mask off of my nose, and could see my blackheads coming with it, like you would in a Biore pore strip.</li>
            <li> Did not pull out any oil or blackheads, took forever to dry,</li>
            <li> warning though, when used with apple cider it WILL dry your skin.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t even dry, although I do follow up with some lotion after using the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Putting it on the rest of my face caused some dry patchy areas.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use vinegar with it if your face is dry.</li>
            <li> It does tighten once the mask starts to dry.</li>
            <li> She loves using it as a mask to dry out oily pores</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I rinse off and pat dry my face</li>
            <li> My skin was so dry and irritated before I used it.</li>
            <li> When you mix the apple cider vinegar with the dry clay, the mixture bubbles almost like when you mix vinegar and baking soda.</li>
            <li> I did not like the product because it may dry skin and cause redness and peeling me</li>
            <li> It falls off the face while you are waiting for it to dry.  </li>
            <li> My blackheads and dry skin spots were gone with one use.  </li>
            <li> TO DRY DEPENDING</li>
            <li> and it won&#x27;t dry evenly.  </li>
            <li> Leave it on until almost dry.</li>
            <li> I use Retin A and boy, do I have dry skin at times.</li>
            <li> and this gets dry</li>
            <li> Unless you have terribly dry skin (add some glycerin to your mask, it will help DRAMATICALLY)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it takes longer to dry.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t recommend to people with dry skin.</li>
            <li> It will take FOREVER for the clay to dry itself out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to start using this again in the spring and summer because my face is already dry from the winter months.</li>
            <li> It would inflame and dry the skin, which immediately would shrink pores and reduce oil output.</li>
            <li> It made my skin dry.</li>
            <li> Any leftover will dry into flaky clumps.  </li>
            <li> , my face is dry and my moms is oily, I guess it all depends on your skin type.</li>
            <li> The jar says about 10 minutes, but it took longer for it to dry and tighten/tingle, so it was closer to 15...</li>
            <li> : dry, hormonally-acne-prone skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mix it with bragg apple cider vinegar, apply and wait 20-30 minutes until it is almost completely dry.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping this would dry them out, but</li>
            <li> It made my skin slightly dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not apply a 1/4 inch to 1/2 inch to face because it will take forever to dry.</li>
            <li> May dry out skin, use in moderation-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problematic skin since forever- oily skin, serious blackheads, really stubborn acne of all sorts, scarring etc.</li>
            <li> It takes about 30 minutes to dry</li>

            <li> - Oatmeal is well-known for its moisturizing properties so if you have dry skin adding some oatmeal flour is a helpful addition.  </li>
            <li> I paint it on with a brush and let it completely dry.</li>
            <li> Would not use on dry skin.</li>
            <li> once it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> I use it to cleanse my skin, dry out pimples, and as a soothing mask.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and thought it would be drying.</li>
            <li> So as a result of the meds, my skin has been looking a bit dry</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> I also use witch hazel toner and my skin still isn&#x27;t dry.  </li>
            <li> I think my skin was product a lot of oils because my skin never went dry</li>
            <li> Take a while to dry.</li>
            <li> But I could see how if your skin was dry to start with, it might be a problem.  </li>
            <li> I pat my skin dry and immediately moisturize.</li>
            <li> Then I smear it on my face and let it dry.</li>
            <li> but my face didn&#x27;t seem dry.</li>
            <li> I immediately patted my face dry</li>
            <li> I did feel like I was being pampered at the spa while waiting for it to dry</li>
            <li> You use it once and it will tighten you skin and dry out your acne.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t attest to overly oily or dry skin or breakouts.</li>
            <li> I was so dry after</li>
            <li> my skin felt so dry &amp; hurt for days.</li>
            <li> When I used this on my nose it didn&#x27;t dry it out at all</li>
            <li> so this product didn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> TO DRY TO USE IT.</li>
            <li> , you can really tell that it&#x27;s doing a serious job of clearing out your pores.  </li>
            <li> I waited about 20-30 minutes (until it was dry)</li>
            <li> I ignored the reviews saying to use apple cider vinegar because i had dry skin.</li>
            <li> and I leave it on till it&#x27;s dry.  </li>
            <li> I was worried that it would dry out my skin</li>
            <li> My skin is problematic in the combination sense - it can be oily and/or dry.</li>
            <li> So in actuality you don&#x27;t need much dry mix and ACV.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.</li>
            <li> Also, the thicker it is, the longer it takes to dry (and if you&#x27;re waiting too long for it to dry, you might leave it on your face too long and cause irritation) and the harder it is to remove.</li>
            <li> It can dry out your skin (but moisturizer will fix it!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> takes forever to dry on your face.</li>
            <li> Missy to use and has tendency to dry out the skin</li>
            <li> Let it dry and wash it off.</li>
            <li> dry your pores out.  </li>
            <li> Let it sit and dry...</li>
            <li> This chin acne was so painful and every time one would almost go away 5 more bigger nodules would form under my skin.</li>
            <li> Skin may feel dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> While waiting it to dry</li>
            <li> Time to completely dry was over 30 minutes .</li>
            <li> I applied it on my face and let it dry for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Anyway, my neck area never did completely dry</li>
            <li> (so I assumed it was \\&quot;dry enough\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> once you let it dry.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, do not use it.</li>
            <li> I have never in my life experienced such a horrible break out.</li>
            <li> or it would dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> It can dry you skin.</li>
            <li> And it will dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> Your face will be dry after using this.</li>
            <li> So with my 3 teaspoon application and waiting for the clay to dry</li>
            <li> My tzone is oily and my chin is usually dry.</li>
            <li> and you can feel it working when it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> This did nothing, but dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I leave clay mask on for 10 mins or until dry, then wipe off with aperture towel.  </li>
            <li> Let it dry all the way.</li>
            <li> Once you put it on and let it dry you can feel your face tighten up</li>
            <li> The skin was getting dry</li>
            <li> My skin always feeling dry after using it.</li>
            <li> I rinse and apply Vaseline to my skin because it will dry you out.</li>
            <li> but the mask does dry out your skin a lot after use.</li>
            <li> I would like to start off by saying I have dry skin</li>
            <li> Once the mask becomes dry, you&#x27;ll have to use water to moisten it again.</li>
            <li> Using ACV to mix, the mask gives a pulsating feeling when it starts to dry and pulls gunk out of pores.</li>
            <li> let dry for 20 minutes or so, jump in the shower n</li>
            <li> i put lotion with sunscreen after, it does dry skin a little...but it works.</li>
            <li> I put a plastic cap over my hair so that the clay wouldn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> and it starts to really dry and hurt.  </li>
            <li> You could seriously build a house with this stuff it hardens that much</li>
            <li> I would say stick to this when your face Is dry or for your winter face</li>
            <li> I noticed the sensation as the product started to dry.</li>
            <li> the clay dry til its hard,perfectly cleeaaann.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a chalky dry substance you have to mix with water.</li>
            <li> I apply the mask at night for 15 minutes, wash it off and then apply it to any acne or hyperpigmentation spots that I have and let it dry overnight.</li>
            <li> waited for the mask to completely dry, my face felt distorted</li>
            <li> It is the tightest face mask I&#x27;ve ever used and helps dry out my oily skin.  </li>
            <li> Does dry out your skin a bit</li>
            <li> The mask will arrive as a dry mix.</li>
            <li> Take a dry paper towel and line the inside of the sink to catch falling mask</li>
            <li> My pores are diminished, and my face has this weird clean feeling I&#x27;ve never felt before.</li>
            <li> When seeing that, I thought this really does grab all of the junk that my cleanser and makeup remover towel leaves behind on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used the back of the wooden spoon to shellac my face and neck and put some of the leftover on a trouble spot on my leg which has been showing signs of KP.</li>
            <li> The big pimples that I had got a bit bigger, and were gone within a few days.</li>
            <li> I only have a few zits left</li>
            <li> Prior using this product i cleanse my face with my everyday facial wash.</li>
            <li> your face maybe red afterwards, but only for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Not too thin or it&#x27;ll dry too fast and won&#x27;t pull enough out.</li>
            <li> I will sometimes use.a few drops of various essential oils with the mask depending on my skin&#x27;s needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use Kiehl&#x27;s Midnight Recovery Serum afterward to ensure I get enough moisture back into my face, but with a lighter touch than a heavy cream.</li>
            <li> It dried out my usually oily/sensitive skin the first week.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but I figured for the low price it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> My sole purpose for using this mask was to get rid of all the dead skin which accumulates on my face because I&#x27;m on topical acne meds</li>
            <li> I use it everyday on my cheeks, which is my problem area , and maybe a few times a week on my whole face.</li>
            <li> Face is only temporarily red for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I also would like to add that I don&#x27;t know why so many people have made it seem like applying or removing the mask is messy or difficult.</li>
            <li> I mixed a few drops of lavender essential oil into the mix</li>
            <li> I only had the clay on for a few minutes, went to sleep, and woke up with it a third of the size.</li>
            <li> and I got my color back a few minutes later.</li>
            <li> But my 40 something face felt like a baby&#x27;s bottom after one 20 minute application, with visibly clearer skin and the glow I&#x27;d been missing for the last several months.</li>
            <li> My main complaint is that there was no warnings on this product.</li>
            <li> Only con is that your face will smell like smelly gym socks only while you have the mask on and its messy...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually into buying a bunch of creams and facials(mostly because they are expensive and hardly do anything), but this is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Second, I recommend using thick layer of clay mask, and wash it before it completely dries.  </li>
            <li> Second, I recommend using thick layer of clay mask, and wash it before it completely dries.  </li>
            <li> It works better if you use a thin layer, don&#x27;t make it so thick when you mix it with the cider.</li>
            <li> Being a powder you need to mix the appropriate parts, otherwise it will be too thick or too thin.</li>
            <li> When people tell you it gets tight, it REALLY gets tight!</li>
            <li> It was already opened, not new product.</li>
            <li> My face is clearer no new breakout thank the heavens.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I mixed it with water, it clumped so bad it was hard to put on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the same makeup for the last ten years (bare minerals), The same makeup remover for the last 6 years (ponds cold cream), even the same toothpaste!</li>
            <li> These last couple of years I waged a losing battle against these small under the skin bumps due to adult Rosacea.</li>
            <li> Be careful when you open it because its powder will shift and when you open it, it can be a mess.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seriously took away nearly ALL my blackheads!!!</li>
            <li> My large pores have decreased in size, so much so that they are now hardly visible..</li>
            <li> , I first use a few of those pre-moistened facial cleaning cloths to get the bulk of it off my face, and that solves that problem - it doesn&#x27;t worry me to waste a few cloths this way.  </li>
            <li> I used my Toilettree face brush and black soap to gently scrub them all away and then rinsed with ice cold water to close my pores back up, followed by witch hazel cucumber toner to calm my face down.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to see how this would work on my back since I suffer from back acne, deep, nasty clogged pores, and very oily skin.</li>
            <li> You have to let this dry completely, and it&#x27;s a little difficult to remove, but totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> And you won&#x27;t have to throw out a single bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i cant see a single pore.</li>
            <li> and I use Noxema acne solution pads ever single day (morning and night)</li>
            <li> Every single time.</li>
            <li> I bought about every single product known to man for my face.</li>
            <li> I used it two days in a row and every single blemish I had disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it two days in a row and every single blemish I had disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After numerous trips to a top dermatologist, prescription lotions and antibiotics that made him feel sick he decided to try something else.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this to try to prevent the breakout I get once ever month &amp; to clear some of the dark marks I have from previous pimples I have popped.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t let it dry completely because professionals say it&#x27;s not ok to do it.</li>
            <li> I usually buy it from Whole Foods, but this is slightly cheaper</li>
            <li> did not find this product hard to use OR hard to clean up.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately i still have dark spots and acne scars on my chin (why we don&#x27;t pop pimples) but those are so easy to cover with makeup.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately i still have dark spots and acne scars on my chin (why we don&#x27;t pop pimples) but those are so easy to cover with makeup.</li>
            <li> The only draw back is that it is not exactly easy to use.</li>
            <li> I did have some little whiteheads come in the first few days I used it, but I expected that based off the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a variety of other products that have been much more expensive with half the results.</li>
            <li> I have small pimples on my face and this product has helped to clear it up.</li>
            <li> Takes forever to dry and it makes my face really dry!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re the &#x27;average&#x27; oily-skinned person, then I&#x27;d recommend starting using it once a week, evaluate, then</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the mask doesn&#x27;t seem to help with dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally do not have acne</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of the extra thickness of the mask, it was harder and messier to get off than other masks.  </li>
            <li> , since I&#x27;ve had acne since I was in my teens (I&#x27;m 30 now), I have a lot of dark scars on my face, especially on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> and although I did see a difference in my skin, I&#x27;m not sure its completely because of the clay.  </li>
            <li> It lighten&#x27;s the dark spots and brings the white heads to the service.</li>
            <li> I do not use it in a regular regimen, but on average about once a week because I also do derma rolling and exfoliation</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m afraid my skin might be a bit sensitive for such an intense treatment).  </li>
            <li> And, my face have only  dark marks on my chin and cheeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to bet you&#x27;ve bought worse stuff than this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to bet you&#x27;ve bought worse stuff than this.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of this and thought it might be just a hippie trend, but my skin looked better after just one use.  </li>
            <li> So in essence without having to scrub but instead just barely rubbing my foot all the dead skin came off.</li>
            <li> Whenever I feel a pimple coming on I either apply this to my entire face or as a spot treatment and the next day the pimple is either significantly decreased or gone completely.</li>
            <li> and it had hardened in some areas, but not others (even though the layer was pretty thin).  </li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing the Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay.</li>
            <li> I guess you could use it every day if you wanted to - as long as you use an oil to fill in those empty pores once it&#x27;s off your skin.</li>
            <li> When you keep it on for a long time it will tighten your face into the center and you will feel pulsing on your face.</li>
            <li> This may come in handy for bee stings and other insect bites, and nettle stings and other similar skin irritations that can happen further away from home base - where I am keeping a supply of this clay in stock.</li>
            <li> At worse, it is sensitive and red for the night if you&#x27;ve  been regularly exfoliating all week.</li>
            <li> 1/4-1/2\\&quot; thick but just layer  it on a littler thicker than a normal mask</li>
            <li> During the first use I was a little freaked out because when it dries, the clay can get really hard</li>
            <li> I had less dryness around my nose area, which was great because usually clay masks dry my face out so bad my face will itch for days after using one.  </li>
            <li> I had less dryness around my nose area, which was great because usually clay masks dry my face out so bad my face will itch for days after using one.  </li>
            <li> I also have very dry skin &amp; wanted something to try to even it out as even lotion does help the dry skin on my face.</li>
            <li> This clay mask is a powder that requires either raw apple cider vinegar or water to be mixed with it prior to application.</li>
            <li> I mixed the clay with raw apple cider vinegar and left it on for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Just dusts over her foundation with a makeup brush like any loose powder.</li>
            <li> This is then mixed with equal parts of organic raw apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li> I do love this mask, however it does get very tight and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve left it longer but won&#x27;t do it again since it left my face a little red for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I mix it with apple cider vinegar and let it dry on my face (when no one else is home) and the next day my skin is less oily and visibly smoother.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite the fact that the packaging was completely broken upon arrival, I salvaged about half of the contents and Amazon was quick to give me a refund.</li>
            <li> Yes your face is red afterwards, but it calms down soon after.</li>
            <li> I mixed it to a thicker consistency and sat down with a cup of tea.  </li>
            <li> Eventually I&#x27;ll be back down to once weekly</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry about the mud running down the drain, the mud tends to stick to the tub just enough to the point</li>
            <li> and I have down graded from the amount it suggests because there was so much left over</li>
            <li> If using in a bath, mix 1 1/2 cups with enough water and vinegar to break it down to a liquid.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is rinsing off the mask and trying not to let it go down the drain.</li>
            <li> This minimizes the amount that goes down the drain when do a final rinse with water.  </li>
            <li> only downside is getting the consistency of the mask down</li>
            <li> I have tried plenty of products only to be let down.</li>
            <li> This product had been sitting on my wishlist for some time before I finally broke down and purchased it.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wash it down your drain because it will definitely clog it up!</li>
            <li> ( it was drawing all the deep down poisons from my skin)</li>
            <li> And it lasts a long time!!</li>
            <li> It took a few times for me to kinda get the right texture for the clay because i was afraid of using too much water.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, if you don&#x27;t use all of the mask you can store it in a container for next time.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way, this will last forever!</li>
            <li> You only need a little to go a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so this will last us forever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mess to make and apply, it&#x27;s a mess to have on your face as it can take up to 2 hours to dry completely</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mess to make and apply, it&#x27;s a mess to have on your face as it can take up to 2 hours to dry completely</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so the jar is going to last a while.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with the way I mix it so this 1 pound container will last me for quite a while.</li>
            <li> It only got worse as I graduated high school and began college.</li>
            <li> , nearly one month later, my face is at the worst it has ever been -- none of the initial acne has improved, and in addition to that, there are so many additional pimples on my face that I can&#x27;t even count then anymore.</li>
            <li> I use about half a tablespoon or even a little less for my whole face.</li>
            <li> Its pretty messy and hard to remove</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m pretty nervous about it, my face is trapped in some rock hard aztec mud</li>
            <li> All of the pink skin was now a normal color, it wasn&#x27;t as sore to the touch and the hardness underneath was not as hard.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure that your toner does not contain any sort of Alcohol or other potentially irritating ingredients; remember, it&#x27;s staying on your face for at least 15 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just make sure that your toner does not contain any sort of Alcohol or other potentially irritating ingredients; remember, it&#x27;s staying on your face for at least 15 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got it as a present a few months ago, and even though I only use it once or twice every other week, it&#x27;s done wonders.</li>
            <li> but none worked as fast or as hard as this one!</li>
            <li> It took a VERY long time to wash all of the clay off my face when I did get it wet.</li>
            <li> Having irritated skin is the worst, especially when you can&#x27;t control it, knowing that I can make this mask and &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; a rash or irritation is amazing!</li>
            <li> Even on those I use it as a spot treatment with apple cider vinegar just to dry them up and poof!</li>
            <li> so i switched to cold water, the stuff washed off fairly easy, but the burning and pricking keeps on coming even after the stuff is washed off.  </li>
            <li> I leave it on until it&#x27;s dry and by then I am itching to take it off!</li>
            <li> Almost all of the redness is gone and my face doesnt feel dry at all!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it to anyone with acne or even just stubborn black heads...</li>
            <li> Everyones skin is different so only use a small amount to check for reactions or sensitivity.</li>
            <li> (next time ill use a whisk to stir it, it gets pretty lumpy!)and</li>
            <li> I have always had oily skin that caused multiple black heads and acne which would always leave discoloration and hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> I think I use about a teaspoon or less and an equal portion water/vinegar</li>
            <li> It will cause purging the first few times you use or at least for me it did.  </li>
            <li> It takes away the white heads and the black heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m several years past my teenage bad-skin era.  </li>
            <li> I usually only mix 2 tablespoons of clay with 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar and usually have some left over.</li>
            <li> , I mixed half a cup.  </li>
            <li> Not sure with water but when mixed with Apple cider vinegar you definitely feel a tightness as it dries.</li>
            <li> Only about half a tablespoon of product.</li>
            <li> I usually jump in the shower to wet my face and remove it completely.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I paid less than ten dollars for this clay and let me tell you now.</li>
            <li> We are definitely looking forward to trying it again and will keep an eye on the &#x27;benefits&#x27; of doing it over a period of time and report back if anything is out of the ordinary.</li>
            <li> Use it overnight on pimples and it should be less red and swollen</li>
            <li> I use half an hour of that for my facial scrub and mask.</li>
            <li> It can be harsh though if left on too long.</li>
            <li> Pimples, zits, black heads, big pores, you name it.</li>
            <li> The clay works but be careful if you have oily skin because it can take up to an hour for the clay to dry.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed that my skin tone has evened out and is less red.  </li>
            <li> Works in clearing the skin and especially the black heads</li>
            <li> have slight acne problems and the next morning with the Soap</li>
            <li> My skin appeared less oily and actually felt as though it had been detoxed.</li>
            <li> Woods Black Soap with shea butter as a facial cleanser and body wash&lt;br /&gt;Witch</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what went wrong, but my skin did not look or feel better after using the mask.</li>
            <li> I think I could be a salesperson for this product, it&#x27;s the blue ribbon baby of facial masks, and I&#x27;ve used quite a few!</li>
            <li> So I have alot of black and white heads and pimples and when I do this mask with the apple cider vinegar and feel it pulsate</li>
            <li> clay is pretty drying - and it was uncomfortably itchy, and left my skin splotchy and red, but that faded after a half hour or so.</li>
            <li> My skin was less red.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m prone to comedonal acne which is white heads and black heads that can turn cystic.</li>
            <li> I feel the acne areas are less red the morning after I use the clay.  </li>
            <li> Be prepare to :::::minimize the appearance of pores, get rid of black heads, white heads, tighten skin, skin feels smoother and brighter.</li>
            <li> I have moderate acne breakouts and black heads/oily skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it was a big enough difference to go through the pain again</li>
            <li> Try a small amount on a small area first.</li>
            <li> Since this is only my 2nd time, I&#x27;m not sure of what the benefits to my skin will be.</li>
            <li> and yep, my face stayed red for about half hour, like a sunburn.</li>
            <li> My face was red for two days, but my black heads were gone.</li>
            <li> This mask feels really odd while it&#x27;s on you face, and it definitely pulsates, as they say it will.</li>
            <li> my pores are smaller, i have less oily TZone</li>
            <li> but my personal purge was about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve tried using it as a hair mask, and it leaves my hair really dry and feels really rough.</li>
            <li> This needs to be mixed with water, only takes a small amount.</li>
            <li> I still get a small random pimple here and there, its not a miracle worker but better than any acne cleanser I ever used.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t even gone through half of the actual product.</li>
            <li> Oh and all my blackheads that usually come back after a day haven&#x27;t come back.</li>
            <li> Unable to place the adequate comment on this product which I still haven&#x27;t  used.</li>
            <li> After trying this a few times, I purchased a sulfur cooling mask made by Peter Thomas Roth and loved it (see: [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> My skin was a little dry after the 2nd time of use, but I compensated that with some face lotion.</li>
            <li> So far the BEST!!!&lt;br /&gt;Better than many other expensive mask on the market.&lt;br /&gt;The secret is when you mix it w the apple cide vinager..</li>
            <li> You really need very little to make a thick mask that covers your entire face.  </li>
            <li> I also have cystic like acne popping up on the side of my face and it is still very dry like sandpaper today.</li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t forget to moisturize after the clay b/c it will leave your face very dry.</li>
            <li> but my t zone is very dry</li>
            <li> have very dry skin</li>
            <li> it will make your skin very dry.</li>
            <li> After you wash it off, your face becomes very dry.  </li>
            <li> This stuff will make your skin very dry.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this like you seriously can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> never felt refreshed when I used it there was always a very dry feeling and</li>
            <li> My hair is 3C and very dry.  </li>
            <li> I use the apple cider with it and the only thing that I don&#x27;t like about it is the mess with mixing it.</li>
            <li> , ans create a lot of mess at home, finally I gave it up.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s such a mess</li>
            <li> I can especially tell around my nose where I used to see tiny dark spots of oil trapped under my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was a bit of a mess, so I suggest using a facial stick and bowl rather than a bag</li>
            <li> I mix the clay with water in a paper bowl with a plastic spoon, which you almost have to do if you don&#x27;t want to deal with a giant mess.  </li>
            <li> In other words, you may have Minor acne but may be on level 1, 2, or 3.</li>
            <li> (let me hasten to add that all my pores are not full of gunk (!)</li>
            <li> Not true and probably not possible.</li>
            <li> The only aspect I didn&#x27;t like was the mess.  </li>
            <li> It does tighten up rather intensely, you can feel the pulsating in your face (at least I can!), and it can get itchy.  </li>
            <li> so this review is long over due.</li>
            <li> , so I&#x27;ve tried numerous ways of taking it off (wipes, washcloth) and it still makes a mess when I take it off.</li>
            <li> It does not mix when following the instructions and leaves a mess everywhere.</li>
            <li> As a novice home maker of things (soap, toothpaste, deodorant, shampoo, conditioner and other beauty products) I&#x27;ve found this to go a long way and works as reputed.</li>
            <li> The mess that comes with using this product with the cider vinegar makes it a big chore to use it.</li>
            <li> I already suffer from occasional acne but with not being able to use my normal products and all the hormones my face has been HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> It could be just due to my skin changing or leaving it on for too long.</li>
            <li> I mixed it incorrectly the first few times...to thin...</li>
            <li> About a tablespoon of the stuff will make an entire, thick, face mask, so I can see this lasting a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Just wet the mask and when it&#x27;s loose rub in circular motions with the washcloth</li>
            <li> Just wet the mask and when it&#x27;s loose rub in circular motions with the washcloth</li>
            <li> I tried this mask and it hurt a little when it drys, you can&#x27;t really move your face and it takes about an hour to fully dry a medium thick layer.</li>
            <li> that way it doesn&#x27;t dry out your entire face and focuses on those trouble areas.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I am using this everyday because it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin or make it red.</li>
            <li> noticed results in less than a week of regular use, using apple cider vinegar at a roughly 2:1 ratio.</li>
            <li> The acid is what makes it pull tight, and the ACV I bought was only 5% acidity.</li>
            <li> At five minutes, the mask was so tight I couldn’t move my lips, only my eyes had mobility.</li>
            <li> It was so tight that I could actually feel my blood vessels pulsating.</li>
            <li> I think the &amp;#34;tingly feeling&amp;#34; people were talking about you would get with any mask as it hardens - your face feels tight, feels different.</li>
            <li> gentle when removing this though it does get very hard to take off so</li>
            <li> If you can bare the pain of taking it off get a wash rag and dunk it in raw Apple cinder vinegar or water to get it off.</li>
            <li> , the container could not look any more ghetto; a crappy label that seems printed off an inkjet printer at the library with an Aztec pyramid clearly taken from a coloring book belonging to a little kid.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the idiot proof directions, painted my face green/gray with the stuff and chilled, just as promised as it started to dry out</li>
            <li> made my skin very soft and no more blackheads!</li>
            <li> Needless to say I had a huge mess.</li>
            <li> I use my with water and not the apple cider vinegar, it does give a slight irritation but barely once you can bare it for at least 10 mins and then wash it off.</li>
            <li> tried applying a thin layer the next day, and WOW!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I try to rinse off equal parts in all 4 of our sinks, just to distribute the mess evenly.</li>
            <li> I spread a very thin layer on, just enough to work, not thick enough to crack and fall off.</li>
            <li> This facial mask is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a slight issue with acne (pimples, blackheads, and some dark spots) and it definitely works to help rid your face of any redness, dark spots, and acne contributors.</li>
            <li> you only need enough to cover your skin, no super thick layers necessary.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s a little freaky how red your face will be for</li>
            <li> It wound up being a little short of a time for me</li>
            <li> I mixed  with the spoon until all the little clumps were gone</li>
            <li> By the way, I left it on for a little over 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Water alone did not work for me, but you can combine a little water and apple cider vinegar and the clay will dissolve properly.</li>
            <li> Skin will be a little red after use but goes a away with in a hour.</li>
            <li> I mixed up a little solution of the clay and vinegar and applied.  </li>
            <li> next day though, I broke out a little bit on my forehead and my nose, but that was just because the mask was pulling out the impurities.</li>
            <li> I use vinegar rather than water with it and it leaves my face a little red for a bit</li>
            <li> and you only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> I put it on then wash the spoon and hands while rinsing the little bit left in the bowl.</li>
            <li> However, I have noticed that my face looks somewhat healthier, maybe a little glowy, and younger.  </li>
            <li> However, I have noticed that my face looks somewhat healthier, maybe a little glowy, and younger.  </li>
            <li> It does get a little red for about 30 minutes, and I apply lotion to remoisturize, but it works like a charm!</li>
            <li> I had a little red mountain forming on my face yesterday.</li>
            <li> I use it for me and also my teen age son who has a little acne.  </li>
            <li> I mixed it with a little almond oil and apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> I mixed with ASV and a little honey.</li>
            <li> I even used a little on my teenage daughter face with her acne</li>
            <li> Your face may be a little red and irritated afterwards but moisturizer will take care of you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this along with a Fenugreek mask I learned from FarahDhukai on youtube and this little routine just might be the BIG MAC!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update on how this has worked for my face a little later on.</li>
            <li> The only downside is the redness you get after for a little bit</li>
            <li> This mask will probably make your face red for a little while after use...</li>
            <li> so irrated me for a little while but went away shortly after.</li>
            <li> Face is a little red after, but goes away</li>
            <li> It has cleared up my skin, made my pores smaller and took care of a little patch of eczema I was having.</li>
            <li> my left eye got a little swollen and it did hurt a bit...</li>
            <li> I did feel a little bit of itchiness later on with some bites, because the paste wore off.</li>
            <li> I get the occasional breakout and since using this once a week I have had not a breakout except just one little itty bitty pimple.</li>
            <li> but I decided to use the grapeseed oil when I finished, and my face was just a little red.</li>
            <li> Would recommend using at night rather than before your day as skin may be a little red for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Your face will be somewhat red for a little while (and the jar tells you this).  </li>
            <li> Your face will be somewhat red for a little while (and the jar tells you this).  </li>
            <li> I suggest using it at night as it does make my face red for a little while after I wash it off.</li>
            <li> I was starting to break out on my chin the other day and all I had to do was make a small mixture, apply it to my chin, leave for 20 minutes and repeat the next day and BAM!</li>
            <li> Also it makes your face a little red for about an hour.</li>
            <li> Little bit is definitely enough.</li>
            <li> It did tingle a little bit and left redness for about 4 minutes after removal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought clays similar to this that were not lumpy at all and a little easier to mix.  </li>
            <li> Only thing I found a little off was the directions.</li>
            <li> One thing that I don&#x27;t like is that my face stings and I get little red welts on my face after using this product however</li>
            <li> It takes so little and this jar will last me for ages.  </li>
            <li> and then I just rub a little maracuja or argon oil on the red areas</li>
            <li> I anticipate the jar will last me a year, that&#x27;s how little is used to make mask.</li>
            <li> Areas were a little red and blotchy but it goes away after about an hour.</li>
            <li> After rinsing, my skin is a little red, but that goes away after awhile.</li>
            <li> I use it at night because it can leave my face a little red.</li>
            <li> I mix all the ingredients together in a little plastic baggy, massage it all around, and scoop out the necessary amount from there.</li>
            <li> I tossed my proactiv and all the other chemical crap in the trash today and made sure I got on here to write a review...which I barely ever do.</li>

            <li> You can pour the muddy water down the toilet and it won&#x27;t clog your pipes ..</li>
            <li> I poured it down the toilet.  </li>
            <li> This right here gets the job done hands down!!!!!</li>
            <li> Slowly but surely no more new pimple!!!</li>
            <li> Skin was a little bit red but not very noticeable.  </li>
            <li> used this on my face every other day, but now I try to do it every three days since it does dry out the skin quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I have food allergies and digestive issues which makes it hard to keep your face clear.</li>
            <li> My face is a bit on the dry side (was extremely oily before mask)</li>
            <li> 2. cut open a pill of acetaminophen and wet it with a little water to create an acetaminophen paste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little messy to work with, but I use it about once a week to help clear up my face.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long, long way.  </li>
            <li> I also had a little pimple, it dried it out and today its gone completely.</li>
            <li> but a little goes a long way and it lasts a long time using it about once a week...</li>
            <li> I looked in the mirror when it was done drying and laughed hysterically at myself because it dried so tight that my eyes were open as far as they could go</li>
            <li> The other ones were smaller and less swollen.  </li>
            <li> The other ones were smaller and less swollen.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that doesn&#x27;t work for me is it doesn&#x27;t extract my black heads like other people</li>
            <li> (so some parts don&#x27;t dry while other parts still stay wet).</li>
            <li> I have purchased super expensive serums and other face products and nothing has worked.</li>
            <li> Milia are those hard, white bumps on your face that won&#x27;t go away - they are not acne, they&#x27;re clogged pores layers deep in your skin.  </li>
            <li> I could hardly belive to see that my pores on the nose got smaller, really really smaller.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time convincing her to take it, but she was just desperate enough to try it.  </li>
            <li> raw, organic ACV.)&lt;br /&gt;She recommends to not let it dry to an uncomfortable level where it irritates your skin too much; skin is sensitive so you shouldn&#x27;t be roughly scrubbing your face to remove the mask.  </li>
            <li> See a picture of how bad my acne WAS :-)</li>
            <li> It smells bad and it&#x27;s harder to get off than most face masks.</li>
            <li> I figured maybe some people just always have huge dirty pores.</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews on this bad boy and decided to give it a go, because it&#x27;s worth a shot, especially since it&#x27;s only $5.49.</li>
            <li> but it has a nasty smell you smell like vinger lol</li>
            <li> you, I used some cheap plastic bowl that probably held chicken fried rice at some point -</li>
            <li> I am wondering if I am meant t let it dry totally, but slatheriing on 1/4 inch and not leaving it on more than 20 minutes seems impossible!</li>
            <li> this crap is amazing.</li>
            <li> Struggling with acne since my late teens (now in my mid-20&#x27;s) this product mixed with apple cider vinegar has been one of the only things to relieve my acne.</li>
            <li> and I look at least ten years younger!  </li>
            <li> I have to leave it on at least 20 minutes before I feel the \\&quot;pulsating\\&quot; action.</li>
            <li> I am 34, female and lately I have been noticing larger pores around my nose which I hate.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Every time I feel like my skin is getting nasty, or starting to break out more than I control, I mix some of this with some ACV and water, leave it on for 5-10 like it says on the back, and in the next few days my skin goes back to</li>
            <li> My skin is almost 100% clear now, and it seems to be helping with fade the hyper pigmented scars left behind.</li>
            <li> I stupidly used it 5 more times thinking it was just getting the gunk out as another reviewer said but nope, sorry, no product is worth a burning face that only results in pimples.</li>
            <li> This really does go deep into the pores, HOWEVER it can be a tad bit uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It is all natural product, so it does not have a negative impact on my skin.</li>
            <li> This small jar will last a really really long time.</li>
            <li> The acid in the vinegar acts like a mini peel and will leave your face pink for about an hour after use, so I wouldn&#x27;t use it just before going out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only used a few times but noticed results immediately.</li>
            <li> so this was particularly rough for me).</li>
            <li> , it seemed to have shrunk the few pimples i have on my face and my pores and actually smaller.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d have to say my face really has decreased in the number of acne I have..</li>
            <li> Ive spent hundreds in acne products..</li>
            <li> so I expected that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li> so I expected that.  </li>
            <li> I wet a cloth and wipe it off my face.</li>
            <li> Then just mix your paste and leave it on for about 15 minutes and then either wipe it off with a wet wash cloth or just water.&lt;br /&gt;For someone who has literally tried EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li> I used a wet paper towel because I didn&#x27;t want to ruin my washcloths.  </li>
            <li> It arrived a lot sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> You should only use a few tablespoons of it</li>
            <li> and I wanted to be careful.</li>
            <li> Set the wet washcloth aside in order to take off the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used it for two nights and it has already healed the breakouts that I had and the redness is minimal.</li>
            <li> My red spots are fading, everyday I see a difference.</li>
            <li> My red spots are fading, everyday I see a difference.</li>
            <li> it was slightly pink, so I did some things around the house and waited a while before I looked again...</li>
            <li> Then you can wipe it off with a wet washcloth.</li>
            <li> Now I use it with egg white ( I save a few drops from my breakfast eggs)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experimented with a few different clays to try to solve my acne issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried French Green clay and Lerosett (rhassoul clay), and this bentonite clay.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with organic apple cider vinegar and once it dried, I rinsed it off and now my skin is noticeably clearer.</li>
            <li> I have blackheads deep with the skin, I am going to use this every few days to see how it is.</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL TRAVELING WITH THIS MASK.  </li>
            <li> I never really felt the pulsing?</li>
            <li> Throughout the next few days, I noticed that my nose did not get as oily as the rest of my skin did.</li>
            <li> Btw i have a few pimples and a tons of red marks .</li>
            <li> One thing I will say, however, is that it can be a bit messy mixing the clay powder if you don&#x27;t have the proper tools.</li>
            <li> Partially flip the sandwich bag inside out on your hand, like a glove.  </li>
            <li> This is in additional to cleanser/moisturizer 2x daily + exfoliating every few days</li>
            <li> The mask helped diminish the the acne that my daughter had on her face (the pimples were visibly smaller and dried out once she removed the mask).  </li>
            <li> I had a thyroidectomy a few years ago and ic been struggling with hair loss, constant change in my hair texture.</li>
            <li> A total waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> It is too much trouble to take it to the post office to send it back anyway.</li>
            <li> Use wet towel to remove it will plug your drain if you dont.</li>
            <li> Simply wet the washcloth with water and pat on the mask to moisten.</li>
            <li> It maybe mental, but it feels like it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> But you do need to be careful with this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I think one needs to be careful not to plug up a drain ...</li>
            <li> I left it on until it dried and</li>
            <li> so be careful.  </li>
            <li> I left the jar in my closet and didn&#x27;t think of it again for a few months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to get this product for a few months and I finally ordered it!</li>
            <li> I use it with water, so maybe the results aren&#x27;t like I expected</li>
            <li> it only takes a few spoonfuls to mix up a mask, and this is a bargain for this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit harder to spread on  </li>
            <li> There is something very soothing about hiding behind all that mud.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Within that time I could actually feel my face tighten as the clay dried and started feeling a tingle after about 10 mins.  </li>
            <li> careful using this around your eyebrows and hairline.</li>
            <li> P.S only use water when you mix it, the vinegar will be too harsh on your skin.</li>
            <li> I had a few break outs on my face and back.  </li>
            <li> Besides the burning sensation after the mask is off and for the next few days until the skin heals, there is acne.</li>
            <li> I find it rather uncomfortable, but the results are well worth it.</li>
            <li> I wipe it off with a wet cloth which is a scratchy feeling.</li>
            <li> Hi everybody, I never really write reviews, but in this case I feel I have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel the pulsating advertised, but I believe I used too much apple cider vinegar and made the mask too thin.</li>
            <li> I mix it up in a closed quart zipped baggie, turn that baby inside out and use the bag as my applicator.</li>
            <li> I save the glass bowl with its remaining residue for the next treatment, so as not to waste any of it.  </li>
            <li> Curious to try this on bug bites in the summer.</li>
            <li> Only had a few days</li>
            <li> that point, I patted it wet with some paper towels.</li>
            <li> Yes, it leaves a red mark all over face(almost like sunburn), but it goes away after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different clays and this one impresses me.</li>
            <li> Apple cider vinegar smells as repulsive as vinegar is expected to when you being mixing and applying it.</li>
            <li> I used this on my face and had absolutely no peeling.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;eh not really...</li>
            <li> I swear I look a few years younger the day after use!  </li>
            <li> no real acne</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done Beauty trade shows at the Javitz Center in Manhattan, NY too</li>
            <li> I put this on briefly for a few minutes on my face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably one of the few guys out there that will actually admit to using a face mask, let alone post it online with a picture..</li>
            <li> Either way it didn&#x27;t make anything worse and they ship you a massive amount relative to what you will actually use.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin &amp; use thin layer as a rinse after washing with cetaphil cleanser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent doing acne</li>
            <li> a final note, for some of you applying the mask every night may be too harsh.</li>
            <li> a final note, for some of you applying the mask every night may be too harsh.</li>
            <li> I imagine that&#x27;s how it would feel if you slather wet cement on your face, it will tighten your skin up.  </li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t as pink, after 40 mins.</li>
            <li> be careful when you&#x27;re washing it off as it can hurt if you rush it.</li>
            <li> I have only used this a few times</li>
            <li> Please be careful with this product.</li>
            <li> Wet the paper towel and lay it on your face.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> I just started using this product a few days ago (a total of two times) and I can already see the difference.</li>
            <li> Money well spent</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like there was no real cleansing agents or salicylic acid in the Walmart knockoff.</li>
            <li> I simultaneously made the switch back to Neutrogena and started using the healing clay 1x a day everyday for 1 week.</li>
            <li> Lesson here is be careful if you want to use this to help with acne.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t perform miracles, but that&#x27;s not what I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely uncomfortable, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I really am not exaggerating.</li>
            <li> I however found my face looking alarmingly red and beginning to burn for a few minutes afterward, and the witch hazel was not as soothing as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> It pulsates and my body tries to flow blood into the area the clay is tearing apart.</li>
            <li> Then I put jojoba oil on my face then got ice from the freezer and closed my pores.</li>
            <li> and it smells like wet clay</li>
            <li> I never really understood when people said that this mask makes your face vibrate</li>
            <li> After a month I have a few pimples left over, but nothing to the extent of what it was when I started.</li>
            <li> I foamed and made a whipped, wet, frothy mixture.  </li>
            <li> Too nervous about what the next few days will bring!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update in a couple of days if I have any breakouts associated with this.  </li>
            <li> Too nervous about what the next few days will bring!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update in a couple of days if I have any breakouts associated with this.  </li>
            <li> Rough patchy skin, gone.  </li>
            <li> Have only been using a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Product works as expected.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s way too sticky, messy, and I find the it only takes off what&#x27;s on the surface-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not extremely intense but manageable.</li>
            <li> At one point I time I&#x27;ve even spent close to 3000 combined on my face by doing the treatments of photodynamic therapy.</li>
            <li> I bought this item a few months back and have waited to write a review.</li>
            <li> I wet my face and whipe it off with wet paper towels, and then wash my face.  </li>
            <li> but then only every few days.</li>
            <li> After a few treatments I noticed the pores on my nose getting smaller.</li>
            <li> Think carefully before using this product as it my not work for you.  </li>
            <li> I think go do a few chores like the dishes or starting laundry.</li>
            <li> to removing it: Take a paper towel wet</li>
            <li> Ive tried everything under the sun and the healing masks has finally cured my acne trouble.</li>
            <li> only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is the trouble I have to go through to make the mask.</li>
            <li> I purchased facial wipes that I could throw away after wiping it off because the mud can be messy.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times</li>
            <li> I left it on for just over 10 mins until it mostly dried.</li>
            <li> You can actually see the dirt trapped in the residue of the mask when rinsing your face.</li>
            <li> and I have been constantly seeing dead skin all over my face and coming off on my towels.</li>
            <li> I just put some of the dust in my palm, made it wet with water, and slapped it on my face.</li>
            <li> Shower makes it easier too but harder to control the caking of clay in the drain</li>
            <li> it was not what i expected it is a powder</li>
            <li> I was sitting partially in front of a fan on my bed, and kept waiting for the pulsating everyone was talking about.  </li>
            <li> But a few hours later, I took a shower</li>
            <li> When you take into account a tube of something fancy at sephora will run you close to $40, there&#x27;s really no contest.</li>
            <li> I mix up a tiny batch in the palm of my hand when I have just a few isolated pimples or areas that need some help.  </li>
            <li> I used it for the next few days and there is no doubt that the clay helped my bruises heal</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have chronic acne, but I always have a few spots of pimples, especially on my chin and forehead.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a bit of a messy process to mix up the clay and apply it all over your chest, shoulders, back, and face</li>
            <li> I have a few acne scars from my earlier years</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re debating whether to get this or not, I HIGHLY recommend this!</li>
            <li> I decided to make a simple tooth powder where I don&#x27;t have to deal with ingredients I can&#x27;t pronounce let alone understand and got a few recipes off the Internet.</li>
            <li> It does draw the skin and turn it red for a few minutes (maybe an hour) after you rinse it off.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting white clay and got green.</li>
            <li> The few times I did use the product, I definitely felt it working.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I went to get a facial a few months ago</li>
            <li> They are usually harsh on my skin or just do not simply work.</li>
            <li> Total waste</li>
            <li> but I expected that because others said that would happen because the mask is pulling all the gunk out of your skin.</li>
            <li> I just use a paper towel and wet it, then let it soak on my face and get the mask wet.</li>
            <li> Then I wipe it off, with another wet papertowel, works like a charm.</li>
            <li> This mask cleaned deep into my pores and was not too harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> I would be careful with frequency of use.  </li>
            <li> I wish I didn&#x27;t experience the trouble with it, so I could&#x27;ve continued and possibly have seen results.</li>
            <li> Finally, I heated a hand towel with tap water and just pressed it to my face for a few seconds (like they do in a spa)</li>
            <li> and it came way sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> Ummm,,,this is a heavy duty facial mask.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> Do not male a latge batch because the additive mix is vinager and it will begin to mold after a few days.</li>
            <li> TAKE NOTE: Be really careful how you wash the mask off your face.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to use it too often</li>
            <li> My Mom tries it with the apple cider &amp; she was GLOWING.  </li>
            <li> Same results and not as messy.</li>
            <li> I get minimal breakouts but every breakout is brought on by something (cycle, sleeping on others beds, etc).</li>
            <li> With that said, I definitely saw a difference after using it a few times in terms of how my skin looked and felt.</li>
            <li> It did hurt a bit as it tightened and pulsed but not much.</li>
            <li> The mask tingles when wet</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it&#x27;s messy and takes a while to prepare the mask but no pain</li>
            <li> I received my product a few weeks ago and have been using it almost daily since.  </li>
            <li> It made my break out all over my forehead and my skin was red and irritated for a few days.</li>
            <li> But be careful because</li>
            <li> but it definitely squeezes oil and dead cells/dirt out of sebaceous gland.</li>
            <li> I never really paid attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> I expected this because it is detoxifying.</li>
            <li> I expected this because it is detoxifying.</li>
            <li> I was careful to not put this in the drain and used wet paper towels to remove.</li>
            <li> I was not worried since that was expected.</li>
            <li> The clay looks like guacamole when wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d wet tissues to wipe it off for fear that it might clog my shower drain.</li>
            <li> Regular masques are too harsh and drying.</li>
            <li> I left the product on until it was dried and had a cracked appearance.  </li>
            <li> Once the clay was softened I wipped the clay away with the wet</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s really not a lot needed if you&#x27;re just applying on the face, which is all I need) is not a problem, then I say go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the end I had to use a wet washcloth to wipe everything off</li>
            <li> Then my hair gets wet trying to get it out of my hair, and I never can get it all out of my hair, so then my hair dries</li>
            <li> It definitely does something, but it&#x27;s a bit too harsh for my taste.</li>
            <li> Makes your face red for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> I spent some time in the hospital, and I came out with some clogged pores.</li>
            <li> but that is expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a skincare addict and have purchased/attempted a few different mud masks at the end of the day</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of money</li>
            <li> This product is not the easiest to remove and does leave your face tender and pink</li>
            <li> Water can used too, but it&#x27;s lumpy and harder to use.  </li>
            <li> Take 2 paper towels and thoroughly wet.</li>
            <li> It feels a bit weird while it&#x27;s on, but it&#x27;s worth the results.</li>
            <li> Also, they would come back withhin a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mixed about 2 tablespoons up with an equal amount of apple cider vinegar, to make a thick paste.  </li>
            <li> I had been looking for years for something else to finish off the rest and do something about the old pox scars still left behind.</li>
            <li> To remove, I wet a washcloth and applied that to my face for a few minutes, splashed water on my face several times, then alternated both until it was all removed.</li>
            <li> Then I use and old makeup brush to dip into the powder and slowly mix into the water to make the desired consistency.</li>
            <li> Put a small amount where your pores are the problem, a thin layer is all you need, then use your hair dryer on cool until it dries, wait another 5 minutes then wash off.</li>

            <li> You only need about 4 tblspn mixed with water or apple cider vinegar (I use ACV) and mix it into a thick paste -</li>
            <li> mask feels thick and it doesn&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t dissolve completely with the water.</li>
            <li> Mix it with apple cider vinegar in a plastic bowl (not metal), a little goes a long way, apply it thickly and wait for it to dry completely</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re going to want to avoid any of the clay going down your drain, it WILL clog it, and it is not fun trying to get solid clay out of your plumbing.</li>
            <li> and wow it made me sweat like crazy, good detox especially when sick.</li>
            <li> After letting this dry completely, it was pretty painful to get off my face, even when it was wet</li>
            <li> no more white heads, black heads, or red bumps!!!!</li>
            <li> I used water the first time because I was afraid the vinegar would be too harsh for my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My only issue, and it&#x27;s a small issue; is that it did somewhat dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve used it three times in the past week and a half.</li>
            <li> I mean, like - 30 years old and still using over the counter acne products - been on meds for acne- changed my diet - done it all.</li>
            <li> Wow, my face is other since i use the Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay Deep Pore Cleansing....</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried a super thick layer (I was bored) and a super thin application.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and after using the mask I notice that it makes my skin a little dry.</li>
            <li> It tends to be a little difficult to get off the face, but that&#x27;s clay for you, and the result is a squeaky clean face.</li>
            <li> But I would never lead someone to beleive that this will cure all ailments over night; and certainly not in twenty minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product works, plain and simple.  </li>
            <li> Not smart</li>
            <li> Weird right.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will say though, that this stuff does get incredibly tight when it&#x27;s almost dry on my face and makes my face red for a little while after I take it off.</li>
            <li> You are trying to re-wet and moisten back up this clay - not easy.  </li>
            <li> You are trying to re-wet and moisten back up this clay - not easy.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;re talking - concealer all day long to hide the hyper-pigmentation, acne, black heads, scarring.</li>
            <li> It felt odd while it was on, especially when it started to dry, and I&#x27;d suggest maybe not putting on quite so heavy</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used only about three spoonfuls of product, which is easily not even 1/6 the container.</li>
            <li> Mixed with vinegar it really pulls crap out of pores (mainly the nose).</li>
            <li> As usual, it left my face raw, red, and extremely dry.</li>
            <li> It was so tight, I barely moved my face once it dried, not wanting to crack it.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews suggesting mixing it in a sandwich bag, that would definitely cut down on the mess but it seems too wasteful for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;You will end up with a clumpy, gross, nasty mess that will not be pleasant and leave you cursing the name of clay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m cleaning my glasses 1-2 times daily, significantly less than my previous 10</li>
            <li> The second time around I used half vinegar, half water.</li>
            <li> I USE ALL THE TIME AND FEEL LITLE HOT AND HARD CAUSE IS DOING HARD CLEANING IN MI FACE.</li>
            <li> The only two areas are my cheeks which as I mentioned were pretty bad from all the years of acne prior.</li>
            <li> The only two areas are my cheeks which as I mentioned were pretty bad from all the years of acne prior.</li>
            <li> I have recently developed bad adult acne; the kind with about 100 tiny pimples that give your face a horrible texture in addition to regular larger pimples here and there.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, it was extremely painful and left my face red (like all the reviewers have mentioned).</li>
            <li> Be careful not to let it stay on your face for to long as it will burn a little afterwards.</li>
            <li> but I expected that from all the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> A little bit also goes a long way, so be careful when you are separating it out to mix.</li>
            <li> Tightening is expected for every other clay mask, so it is not anything special.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like other people said it does clog drains so be careful</li>
            <li> I purchased this item about 2-3 weeks ago and have been using it every other day roughly on my face.</li>
            <li> I have had moderate (40-50 pimples at a time) acne for 2-3 years now, I tried 2 or 3 of the off the shelf acne products with little to no success.</li>
            <li> It burns a little, and if you have sensitive skin I would reconsider finding something less harsh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to wash off, but that is only a minor qualm.</li>
            <li> Even if you&#x27;re on a tight budget and you think that 10-ish dollars is a bit pricey for 1 pound, it lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> Even if you&#x27;re on a tight budget and you think that 10-ish dollars is a bit pricey for 1 pound, it lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I found this to be extremely drying,  especially when mixed with Braggs ACV (which my face generally tolerates well as a toner)</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t found any raw locally.</li>
            <li> I mixed the clay with Braggs raw apple cider vinegar both times.</li>
            <li> I used this with raw apple cider vinegar and applied it to my entire face.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with raw organic apple cider vinegar and saw immediate results.</li>
            <li> poured in an equal part of Raw Cider and the clay began to fizz</li>
            <li> w/the same amount of raw apple cider vinegar from Trader Joe&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The directions say, &amp;#34;Mix Clay with equal parts of raw apple cider vinegar and/or water.</li>
            <li> I mixed mine with raw apple cider vinegar instead of water and applied to my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I have really big pores so when someone told me that this product [in mixture with raw apple cider] cleans them out and shrinks pore size, I jumped on it.</li>
            <li> This product does not go bad so by the time I run out of the clay powder, it has been a full two of using the regular sized</li>
            <li> Not for anyone seriously trying to clear up.</li>
            <li> However if you have really huge pores and oily skin like me, you will definitely be disappointed on the third day after using the Aztec Clay/Apple Cider mixture.</li>
            <li> It took about a half hour to dry.</li>
            <li> (use a wooden spoon) to slather on my face and neck and leave for 15 minutes (longer is NOT better, it is harder to get off).  </li>
            <li> I only had blackheads on my nose, whiteheads on my chin &amp; few dark spots here and there.</li>
            <li> It seriously helps with acne, and I have terribly sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li> I have oily and sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve struggled with acne for the past few years.</li>
            <li> well within days of using this product my blemishes have began to clear up and the marks left behind by previous breakouts are getting lighter.</li>
            <li> because it totally made every little bump or blemish deminish!</li>
            <li> Yeah, my skin does get a little red once I wash it off, but that goes away after an hour or so (sometimes less).</li>
            <li> i had to use half a water bottle with a little water but same .</li>

            <li> Sometimes, but not every time, I will use Weleda Almond facial cream or Cetaphil daily moisturizer, but usually I just use a cotton pad and raw apple cider vinegar as a toner on my face.</li>

            <li> , we now have a thin layer of grey, green clay coating over everything in the house (mainly the computer desk).</li>
            <li> I have a few healing cysts, but I haven&#x27;t had any new ones for at least a week.</li>
            <li> And this jar should last me a very long time, a year at least, maybe two or three.</li>
            <li> just a little dirty but not dirty enough to wash again.</li>
            <li> I took one of those very little plastic dishes that you would use for salad dressing, added the clay and water, and mixed it up.</li>
            <li> also, you only need a very little bit.</li>
            <li> When I woke up the next morning I somehow felt my forehead during the day (near my hairline, where it was burning and itching) I have ten to twelve very painful very sore blister/boil like acne.</li>
            <li> It gets really tight on your face and your face will appear a little red after</li>
            <li> it does get extremely tight on the skin and leaves me a little red for about 20 min after</li>
            <li> Only complaint I have is my skin feels kinda dry after</li>
            <li> Probably should have made less because there was a lot left over which I then threw out and wasted.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with water per the instructions (you can also use apple cider vinegar), applied a moderately thick layer to my face and let dry.</li>
            <li> The pink clay helps with dry skin and uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> The pink clay helps with dry skin and uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> Like all masks, if you apply it liberally, will feel tight when they dry up.</li>
            <li> if you look like an ape while waiting for the mask to dry, it pulls your skin so tight, it almost disfigures it until you rinse it off.</li>
            <li> but it felt really tight when it was dry.</li>
            <li> but it made my skin feel WAY too dry and tight once i rinsed it off...</li>
            <li> I let it dry about 10-15 minutes or until it feels uncomfortably tight before washing it off.</li>
            <li> I read that you should avoid washing it down the drain, but I found it pretty impossible not too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately afterwards, my skin is the expected irritated red and dry</li>
            <li> Not good if you have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Has the other benefits though.</li>
            <li> I have repeatedly tried to reach the manufacturer of this product as I can&#x27;t get it to mix properly due to an inventory tag being placed OVER the instructions - At this point would prefer to return this product since I can&#x27;t use it as directed.</li>
            <li> (as other reviewers said it would.)  </li>
            <li> I saw that there were some blackheads and tons of other pore clogging debris on the surface.  </li>
            <li> If I have any other effects I will post them</li>
            <li> If I have any other effects I will post them</li>
            <li> When you first put it on its a bit scary but it works wonders.</li>
            <li> Little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> Ive read all the other reviews and followed what they did</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it every other night for the past week, and it has accelerated my non-healing pimples into smaller, manageable, HEALING PIMPLES.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every other night for the past week, and it has accelerated my non-healing pimples into smaller, manageable, HEALING PIMPLES.</li>
            <li> but any other face masks after coming across this</li>
            <li> anyway i wouldnt recommend this to any other buyer.</li>
            <li> I get small ones and even the big ingrown ones that itch and Hurt even when you don&#x27;t touch it.  </li>
            <li> At first I felt like something was wrong.</li>
            <li> My face also became extremely itchy which I thought was so weird because that did not happen the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> According to other reviews and the description, it&#x27;s because all the blood rushes to your face and the impurities are coming out of your skin.</li>
            <li> I did notice my skin was tighter after using this, but I have not seen much other results.  </li>
            <li> I would buy again once I have no more left.</li>
            <li> I recommend using only a small amount and putting apple cider vinegar, it helps the sting go away.</li>
            <li> I apply the mask every other day.</li>
            <li> I would say that this compared to the other clays is the harshest on my skin.</li>
            <li> I mixed them together in a small Ziploc baggie and applied it.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it in my hair yet but in due time.  </li>
            <li> i felt the pulsating but just like my other mud mask.</li>
            <li> Everything works for other people who swear they didn’t think it would work for them</li>
            <li> I also have a few pimples (I have minor acne around my chin/cheeks) and they were no more puffiness or white heads peeking out.</li>
            <li> It is NOT a magical acne cure for me, however it definitely is helping that situation by cleaning out my pores.  </li>
            <li> for the review of the product itself, I can&#x27;t attest to that as well as the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> I will also say that other magnesium - containing products have been compatible with me.</li>
            <li> I use it about every other day or every 2 days.</li>
            <li> I have seen other people suggest mixing the clay with apple cider vinegar so as to prevent harming the skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this several times and it seems like it is all still there a small tablespoon of clay and a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and</li>
            <li> plus it didnt rip a hole through my wallet, like some of the other masks i have tried in the past and recent years.....</li>
            <li> This jar will last me a few years!</li>
            <li> it is just like any other facepack.</li>
            <li> have been using this mask, every other day (25 minutes), for about 2 weeks now</li>
            <li> I mixed small amounts with water and applied it on my skin.</li>
            <li> cheek bone area due to not washing off my bronzer thoroughly.</li>
            <li> After using this product every other day for a week my acne cleared up.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t give exact measurements and doesn&#x27;t come with a measuring spoon</li>
            <li> I have known about this product but mainly as a facial for the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> Over the past week I learned that it can be used on the hair but really internally which is a miracle to me in what I am researching.</li>
            <li> Does not clear blackheads as well as others and it&#x27;s messy because it&#x27;s not premixed.  </li>
            <li> Also, it sticks to the skin and only comes off in small flakes, so I feel like I am scratching my face off over the trash can to remove.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t over due it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t do other home remedy</li>
            <li> Nothing worked like using this product every other night, then backing off to twice a week.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use any other face products anymore.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that if I have any possible acne, this mask usually helps to bring it to the surface.</li>
            <li> It can also be used to filler your water.....plus a host of other uses.</li>
            <li> now know what other people are talking about with the burning sensation.  </li>
            <li> now know what other people are talking about with the burning sensation.  </li>
            <li> Just read the other reviews on here for this product, and trust me this stuff works.</li>
            <li> At end of day, once a week:  Mix 2 tsp clay with 2 tsp apple cider vinegar, mix into a paste with a small rubber spatula in a tiny bowl.  </li>
            <li> My daughter on the other hand was trying to peel it off</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost everything in the book, clinique, stuff from target and other..</li>
            <li> I use it every other day, somedays</li>
            <li> I combine the powder with apple cider vinegar and other days</li>
            <li> I mixed it myself in a small container 2tbsp of the clay and Apple Cider Vinegar.</li>
            <li> I will definitely report results with photos after a few weeks as I am an amazon freak!</li>
            <li> I hope it continues to do as I&#x27;ve read it has done with other people.</li>
            <li> I simply mix a small batch and share it with my daughters.</li>
            <li> I usually put it on (back and face), let it dry-ish, and rinse in the shower.</li>
            <li> After a month of using both, the small lines around my eyes and on my upper lip were Gone</li>
            <li> Other options would be water</li>
            <li> It has caused a small initial breakout</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t judge for insect bites or those other</li>
            <li> Not sure about the actual removal of acne and scarring</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been mixing 1TBS ACV to 1TBS of the clay in a small zip lock bag and it&#x27;s enough for 2 masks.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day, i leave it on for about 20 minutes, and I mix the clay with Apple Cider Vinegar.</li>
            <li> After use I understand the &amp;#34;really clean&amp;#34; feel the other reviews referred to.</li>
            <li> I have used several clay masks in the past, but the others can&#x27;t hold up  a torch to this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First we mix up equal parts apple cider vinegar and the healing clay in to a small Pyrex container the night before application.</li>
            <li> However, other people I know say they swear by it.</li>
            <li> I then decided to apply it to my upper back on the infection site figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt, and medical treatment had failed for a year.</li>
            <li> I usually mix enough for two or three applications in a Tupperware container.</li>
            <li> I usually wait about ten minutes before putting anything else on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using other products to help with the deeper toned areas) or just wanting a softer and smoother appearance to their skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> all my life, like every other acne sufferer I have tried any and every acne remedy known to man.</li>
            <li> I may give it a try some other time...</li>
            <li> However, I am not able to use it as a facial.</li>
            <li> but it did not bring out blocked pores like it did for some other people.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other clay masks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other clay masks</li>
            <li> I started using it once a week, but now I am using it every other day and my acne is almost gone.</li>
            <li> After two years of failed attempts I was getting married.  </li>
            <li> i put the mask on every other day an hour before i take a shower(i</li>
            <li> I use the mask every other night now.  </li>
            <li> and I use this product every other day</li>
            <li> Next, just take your scoop and gather a small amount from the clay jar.</li>
            <li> Healing other skin conditions with this works well too.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find that my blackheads were lifted out like it works with other people.  </li>
            <li> It was just like every other mud mask I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> To me, this product is like any other mud mask on the market.</li>
            <li> I have breakouts on my cheeks due to hormones and this mask speeds up the process of extraction.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews I decided to mix with Bragg&#x27;s ACV.</li>
            <li> However being that I did My research going in I fully expected all of that!  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no more white tips on them.</li>
            <li> It dries skin, which will temporarily reduce the size of pores and for some people reduce lines, for other people, create lines.</li>
            <li> It dries skin, which will temporarily reduce the size of pores and for some people reduce lines, for other people, create lines.</li>
            <li> Other people basically said that this was a miracle mask in their reviews.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re afraid to use oil like i was, just try a small section of your face where you can hide it if you break out like near your ear ;)</li>
            <li> Not sure of their results since they don&#x27;t use it regularly enough yet.  </li>
            <li> Will continue to use on my acne prone and oily skin every other night until I die.</li>
            <li> Due to it being mud</li>
            <li> Apple cider vinegar doesn&#x27;t work with it because the alkaline in the mud and the acid in the vinegar neutralize each other, like baking soda and vinegar.</li>
            <li> I use this product about once a week or every other week.</li>
            <li> I will see what other products this company has to offer.  </li>
            <li> I use it either every night, or every other night and</li>
            <li> of the other reviewers mentions putting it in a zip-lock type bag and</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems other people like it a lot though.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I was greatly disappointed, mostly because everyone raved about it.</li>
            <li> so I tried, and I am not buying any other face mask but this</li>
            <li> agree with other reviewers about the burning sensation.</li>
            <li> You only have to use a small amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m presuming that it is due to the pulling of the clay as it dries...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m presuming that it is due to the pulling of the clay as it dries...</li>
            <li> But I think that is to be expected since it is clay!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mask four times now, using it every other day.</li>
            <li> If you are debating upon buying this and notice a lot of people saying how it clears pimples that is if you doing this every other day.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, definitely mix this in a small snack zip lock bag.  </li>
            <li> Follow up with toner and moisturizer (I use bio oil or help oil) afterwards, usually in the middle of the week to prevent stress-induced breakouts.</li>
            <li> Other than that.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s strictly this mask because I never have this issue with any other mask I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Somewhat disappointed and will continue to shop for a better mud mask.</li>
            <li> It is way cheaper than all of the other stuff I&#x27;ve tried, so I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have extremely oily skin.</li>
            <li> Note: there may be other clay powders like this that may work just as well too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> This lotion paste helped heal this bite faster than the other bites because I used this product immediately on it.</li>
            <li> However, I can imagine using this powdered clay in other ways.</li>
            <li> However, I can imagine using this powdered clay in other ways.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has other uses--some people make poultices out of the clay to sooth sprains or bruises.</li>
            <li> Maybe I will use it for other things.</li>
            <li> Like all other reviews.</li>
            <li> I used this with apple vinegar as well as other suggested.</li>
            <li> but I still got the same breakout as usual</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this, as well as glam glow, and some other products.</li>
            <li> Whenever I have had a break out due to stress, menstruation, diet, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it as a foot soak, face mask, on poison ivy, and on other rashes.</li>
            <li> the other reviews is that it hurts a lot as it tightens.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using it every other day.</li>
            <li> Weird sensation at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other premixed masks</li>
            <li> I like to do my mask at night because it usually makes my skin red for like 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna stick with it, along with using coconut oil to moisturize, and drinking plenty of water because no product will work unless you do other things to help it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I looked into this clay because I was looking into other Ayurveda treatments for other things.  </li>
            <li> Recently I also learned that you can also mix tea tree oil (though I usually leave out the apple cider vinegar when I do this and just use water) into it to help treat acne</li>
            <li> I had been experiencing a troublesome acne breakout due to hormone replacement therapy ( I am over 50 and post-menopausal).</li>
            <li> when clay mask breaks into small bits then you will definitely have problem taking it off.  </li>
            <li> Excessive rubbing will make your face red.  </li>
            <li> when clay mask breaks into small bits then you will definitely have problem taking it off.  </li>
            <li> Excessive rubbing will make your face red.  </li>
            <li> but am glad I didn&#x27;t chicken out!  </li>
            <li> Not to mention other family members who have tried it after hearing about it and purchasing it for themselves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about how well it worked for pulling impurities but definitely have softer and brighter skin.</li>
            <li> I do recommend this product to other customers.</li>
            <li> and I must say that I recognized that benefits of this clay (along with other ingredients) on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it every other day and it has caused cystic acne on my jawline.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every other day since and my skin has been improving.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 30 years and it works for acne, boils, and other skin ailments.  </li>
            <li> Now I have extremely oily skin</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical of all the praising reviews</li>
            <li> The description mentions cultures other than the Aztecs.  </li>
            <li> When I first used it I will admit I was extremely uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I recommend putting a small amount into a container with equal amounts water and letting it sit.</li>
            <li> one other tip for kids/parents with this condition is to treat acne &amp;#34;sores&amp;#34; as wounds.  </li>
            <li> I plan to use it ever other day until my acne on my cheeks decrease some.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this mask a shot before investing hundreds in the other product.  </li>
            <li> This morning when I woke up, my pores were still tiny and even with the gel on my face, my skin didn&#x27;t feel oily like it usually does when I wake up.</li>
            <li> And the price can&#x27;t be beat when you compare to other beauty products.  </li>
            <li> I use about every other day on average.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I should note the other things I&#x27;m doing to conquer the ongoing acne:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> Also look up its other uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try it every other night and see if I notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The small jar should last for months, maybe even a year depending on usage and can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I want to help other people struggling with there complexion</li>
            <li> (1) wash face as usual (2) exfoliate with one part olive oil and one part white sugar (3)</li>
            <li> but it should go away soon according to other reviews.</li>
            <li> I only did a small portion just to see the difference.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this will be a regular in my routine.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s due to this because I&#x27;ve been breaking out on my chest also</li>
            <li> but at this point I&#x27;m too lazy to figure out what I&#x27;m actually supposed to do</li>
            <li> Since I am using such a small amount</li>
            <li> Mud masks are never pretty</li>
            <li> Along a million other yukky ingridients.</li>
            <li> I did not have any small red bumps or a rash or any other side effects as some have stated in their review.</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY CLUMPY,</li>
            <li> It does leave my face a little red but it goes away after a little while.</li>
            <li> this product has over other clay masks is that it comes in a powder form so you can control</li>
            <li> I use it about every other night or a couple times a week.</li>
            <li> However, I wouldn&#x27;t say it got rid of a lot of my pimples like some of the other reviews stated.</li>
            <li> I try to use it every other day at night after washing my facing and removing make-up.</li>
            <li> It helped my skin but it can leave it red for a few hours!</li>
            <li> Dermatologist couldn&#x27;t give me anything that would remedy my extreme acne.  </li>
            <li> However, I put virgin olive oil in it the other</li>
            <li> Other than that, it seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about using this as shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I missed the fact that you need to buy other product to make this work.</li>
            <li> Never again will I use any other product for my face.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and from what they wrote u bought this.</li>
            <li> Then it started to itch a bit, but I figured it was due to it drying.  </li>
            <li> Using roller once a month and during the time between each month just apply this mask every other week.  </li>
            <li> but it was almost like awkward twitches, not bad at all.</li>
            <li> But, my face pulsates after a few minutes and my skin became so tight that I definitely could not leave it on longer than 20 min.</li>
            <li> I mix it in a little sandwich baggy which is less messy, I apply a relatively thick layer to my face and neck and leave it on for at least an hour (usually about an hour and a half) to make sure it&#x27;s completely dry.</li>
            <li> I have a very dry skin and never had any issues with black head.</li>
            <li> My skin was dry but nothing a little lotion couldn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> Mix with a little apple cider vinegar, apply to face/skin and let dry.</li>
            <li> It could get a little dry</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little difference, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to someone who has dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using disposable paper towels that are wet to get it off because I do not want it to go down the sink &#x3D; clogged drain.</li>
            <li> I get a large bowl, rinse with that and toss the dirty water outside.</li>
            <li> have very oily skin and large pores that I absolutely hate...</li>
            <li> I make up smaller amounts in a little jar to have on hand for a few days.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that my face dried up a little after using it.</li>
            <li> I have to learn to stay in the bathroom until it&#x27;s totally dry!!!</li>
            <li> And after washing my face and letting it dry, my pimples shrunk down dramatically!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t need to scrub hard to get it off your face, resist that urge and just be slow and gentle..</li>
            <li> your face will be a little red for about half an hour after you wash it off but that will fade!  </li>
            <li> and I did get a little bit of red bumps on the thinner layers of my skin like under my eyes and a little bit down my neck.</li>
            <li> the morning after a previous night&#x27;s application, my skin is always, without fail, smoother, clearer, and most importantly: hardly oily at all!</li>
            <li> Minor acne would be a small area like chin or just nose, or no major breakouts but a few pimples here</li>
            <li> Despite the bad smell of the vinegar, I found it easy to mix and apply.</li>
            <li> It leaves the face so soft and you can really feel the product pull all the bad stuff out.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s impossible to get it into a smooth consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not suffered an issue with it because I was careful, but it is impossible to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It just makes it impossible to feel comfortable being in front of people.</li>
            <li> For Bad acne Use everyday for most results that&#x27;s what I did</li>
            <li> I tried to use this instead of pro active</li>
            <li> Essentially, it cant be mixed any worse than me!&lt;br</li>
            <li> After it is completely dry and it&#x27;s time to take it off, just dunk your face in the water for a few seconds (5-10) and begin using your hands to scrub it off.</li>
            <li> These include: KP, Acne, dry skin, uneven tone etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since the product is not overly expensive and works well, it is worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> It does burn/itch initially and your face is red after , but it was nothing too irritating .</li>
            <li> I was shocked to feel how strong it felt once I put it on.  </li>
            <li> This is a messy dry powder you mix with either water of vinegar.</li>
            <li> let it stay on until completely dry, ( a lite shade of green), appox 45 mins.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It left red blotches on my skin that went away but seemed to stress my skin out unnecessarily.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Drying any active pimples</li>
            <li> This has not caused me any breakouts when using and it&#x27;s almost guaranteed to kill some pimples that are active on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely harsh and leaves your skin looking as dry as the Sanara.  </li>
            <li> I like mixing in tea tree oil, aloe vera juice, apple cider vinegar and active charcoal, for my face.</li>
            <li> I also like using the mud for my hair, adding coconut mana and not adding the active charcoal.</li>
            <li> After my hormones started righting themselves after my kids were born, I was gifted a nasty bout of adult acne.  </li>
            <li> To wash off after it has dried I take a wet washcloth and wet an area before scrubbing.</li>
            <li> Mix it up with apple cider vinegar (it says you can also use water, but it&#x27;s a waste of the product to use it - doesn&#x27;t mix properly/react with the dry clay) and slather it on your face (or</li>
            <li> i use the mask two or three times a week and follow it with a few drops of jojoba oil because it does dry my skin.</li>
            <li> also gave my reluctant spouse a thin lotion-like layer facial with this same product.</li>
            <li> This is so messy to use and it takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> Seriously, it will dry some out and make some come to the surface and its gross</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from acne for the last few years, and I&#x27;d wake up sometimes and look at my face and would feel like crying.</li>
            <li> It was a pain to get off my face after it dried, then all it did was dry out my skin and irritate it.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use too frequent or you will be left off with angry skin.</li>
            <li> if messy because it&#x27;s dry clay</li>
            <li> I spent probably thousands of dollars to no avail, and it seemed either a product would make my face even worse, or only help slightly or for a short period of time.</li>
            <li> and like a miracle, they went away but only to come back worse when I get off of that antibiotic.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to take the same medicine again since it only made the problem worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also had uneven skin tone with dry spots.</li>
            <li> , I had gotten over most of my acne but still occasional zits that left a nasty black mark.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The layer was thin, mainly because I mixed it thin...not the 1/2 in thick</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way, so you may have this for years!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t add any peppermint or other flavoring and just use it plain mixed with a few ingredients</li>
            <li> My first paste mixing was very poor.</li>
            <li> I have done it on occasion twice in the same week and it did leave my face a little pink... but those tough break outs finally disappeared when nothing else would help.</li>
            <li> Next time I know just to wait a little longer - or maybe use a little less product from the start.</li>
            <li> This stuff will dry like cement and make it hard to move your face if you leave it on too long.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to try it based on all of the positive reviews, but I was really skeptical as to whether or not the reviews were legit.</li>
            <li> Despite all the positive reviews, I was still skeptical when it came to something that worked on my skin.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and it can be a bit of a mess but one reviewer had the right idea in saying to put it on in very thin layers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Afterwards I was extremely red because I am very pale.  </li>
            <li> My skin was back to how I had looked previously with very little, if any improvement.</li>
            <li> Your face will start pulsating and if there&#x27;s nasty stuff under your skin, you&#x27;ll break out a little at first, but for me, it was only like that the first two times.</li>
            <li> first timers, this may feel weird, especially if you&#x27;re not used to getting facials, but give it at least 15 minutes on your skin.</li>
            <li> If you apply it that thick it takes forever to dry and it is just down right hard to apply that thick.  </li>
            <li> but if you already have oily skin it won&#x27;t be a bad thing I follow with age defying skin clearing serum which brings moisture right back into my skin and keeps it even.</li>
            <li> Also I noticed this pulls facial hair out with it, not sure if that&#x27;s just an odd coincidence or not.</li>
            <li> I put a rather thick layer on and it did not take that long to dry.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Filled with Negative Ions (which bind to bad positive ions like certain bacterias and cancel them out)</li>
            <li> It takes away the dry patches on my cheeks and unclogs the pores on my nose, so I don&#x27;t see the little black dots there anymore.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s dry, it looks like all these fleas have come and died on my face- little black specks everywhere.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re doing this over the sink I recommend not washing it down the drain, as some have said in other reviews.</li>
            <li> I mix half water and half apple cider vinegar (you&#x27;ll get used to the smell) and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Make a little wet spot.</li>
            <li> If you put on a lot of this mask--however, it will be a little harder to take off.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little clumpy when it gets rinsed off, but it&#x27;s not much of a drain clogger.</li>
            <li> I slowly wipe away the mud from sections and then pat dry with the dry hand towel.</li>
            <li> I wake up with my other half every morning at 5:30am to get him out the door by 6:30am -</li>
            <li> Forewarning: increases oxygen flow to the skin, so my face was extremely flushed for half the day.</li>
            <li> In the other words, the toxins of the mosquito bite were neutralized by immediately using this clay, and as a result this helped heal this mosquito bite faster than the previously untreated or clayless bites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Other than that I have noticed my blackheads going away as well  as my oil productions seems to be less.</li>
            <li> My pores are way smaller, I hardly ever break out now</li>
            <li> i was a little skeptical at first</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t mix it well enough because i got clumps that were hard to spread.</li>
            <li> The only thing I could find to complain about is that sometimes it is hard to mix without getting lumps.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Third, even though I use a small amount, I sometimes end up with a little left over.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Third, even though I use a small amount, I sometimes end up with a little left over.  </li>
            <li> My face is a little red after I rinse it off but for no more than an hour...</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this and the first couple of times I used it, I used water to mix, and it didn&#x27;t work so well</li>
            <li> Face turning red because the clay bits are so hard to take off?</li>
            <li> Face turning red because the clay bits are so hard to take off?</li>
            <li> Left in on for about 20 mins it was kinda hard to take off</li>
            <li> The tingly sensation feels a little weird at first</li>
            <li> You only need a little!!</li>
            <li> A little messy and inconvenient to mix and prepare, since you can&#x27;t use metal materials, but I still enjoy this product and the results I get from using it.</li>
            <li> : A very little can actually go a long way with this product.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I am a licensed cosmologist, and unfortunately through the every day use of harsh chemicals found in everyday products, I developed a major allergy.</li>
            <li> I will admit taking it off was difficult, and i would run hot water down the drain for a while after, so that it doesn&#x27;t clog your drain!</li>
            <li> When the clay starts to dry my face gets very tight and begins to pulsate.</li>
            <li> i was struggling badly with HUGE pores on my face and blackheads in my nose and chin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it works with bad acne, that problem was cured mostly by another product years ago</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m how dark they are.</li>
            <li> faint redness is expected and normal, so don&#x27;t worry.</li>
            <li> He even complained that I didn&#x27;t put enough under his eyes</li>
            <li> but it seems like you average clay mask.</li>
            <li> Dont leave it for too long, or you will find urself having all the gunk pulled out...leading to a small pimple somewhere.  </li>
            <li> Helped with dark spots from acne.</li>
            <li> I have found that if I use it regularly (for me that&#x27;s at least 2x week)</li>
            <li> I have suffered with acne for the last 15+ years and although I get a few small blemishes here</li>
            <li> I usually buy the big container of this as I use it for a few things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i usually am preferential to mud masks or french green clay.</li>
            <li> but it did help the dark circles under my eyes a bit.</li>
            <li> Clears up acne and scars, gives a glow and takes away dark circles.</li>
            <li> The labeling is a bit vague on how much you need to use to mix.</li>
            <li> FADING OF MY DARK SPOTS.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s difficult for me to say whether or not it&#x27;s really helping with my acne.  </li>
            <li> leaves your face a bit red, but exfoliates and sucks out all sorts of things I don&#x27;t want in my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;OH also, DO NOT LAUGH while this mask is drying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;OH also, DO NOT LAUGH while this mask is drying.</li>
            <li> at which point the pulsing of the mask can be uncomfortable, but when I peel it off I&#x27;m amazed at how much gunk</li>
            <li> Get sucked into the hoopla of fake reviews, that spawn real reviews from people moved by the power of suggestion, and the need to defend their purchase.</li>
            <li> Oh and one last thing this product sucks.</li>
            <li> I expect this tub to last me at least a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I realized those suckers were deep in my pores and needed to be lifted to the surface.</li>
            <li> As someone who struggles with oily combination skin, I felt like this mask was too astringent and drying, which is weird because my skin produces so much sebum.</li>
            <li> Maybe it just wasn&#x27;t the product for my skin, which is actually kinda delicate.</li>
            <li> tried showering it off but same problem - this sucker clogs the drain, sink, shower anything.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I have to say about this clay mask is it itches my face while it dries.</li>
            <li> and I didnt notice my dark marks diminishing.</li>
            <li> Before using this I would even get white heads throughout the day, so I would have to constantly check my face each time I would use the bathroom to see if there was a disgusting puss filled zit on my face</li>
            <li> My nose pores are dark. .</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that its a nightmare to was off.</li>
            <li> I read a recipe in a book that mixing this with Hydrogen Peroxide would help with acne and dark marks.</li>
            <li> Let it be known that its not a comfortable feeling, and it freaked me out at first, but you get used to it - and start to even like it ( weird I know ).&lt;br</li>
            <li> My solution is to use Ambi or Cape Fear Lighting cream on the dark spots at night.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say necessarily</li>
            <li> definitely feel the pulsing sensation after a few minutes (I usually leave my mask on for 25-30 mins).</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this really.</li>
            <li> I had dark acne scars which are now gone</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t want to go on antibiotic again, this is pretty much my only way out to keep my painful acne under control</li>
            <li> Second negative experience.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not worth all the hype.</li>
            <li> again-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a dark spot (I picked a pimple)😩 and it wasn&#x27;t going away</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know that you have to mix it with water yourself which is my only negative.</li>
            <li> and I think that might be wrong, but when I get it to work it really works.</li>
            <li> The Taj Mahal in India is being restored slowly to its former glory to take away the grime built up with the ages by applying this clay to it and scrubbing away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, I forced my husband to use this and it made his skin very red.</li>
            <li> So far i am completely addicted to using it</li>
            <li> My face was all red from trying to wash off a thick layer</li>
            <li> Repeat until it is thick enough for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It can also be used with baking soda if you&#x27;re suffering from acne, or with sour cream to help fade blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a soft bristled toothbrush from the dollar store (couldn&#x27;t find a brush), and brush a thin layer on my skin.</li>
            <li> Rather than try to measure out the amount of clay and apple cider and vinegar with a spoon, simply pour desired amount of clay and SLOWLY add ACV and mix with each pour until desired consistency is reached.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s just thick enough that I can&#x27;t see my skin through it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I boil water in a tea kettle, put it in a bowl, and slowly add clay (whisking constantly) until it is like butter-cream frosting.  </li>
            <li> Just mix 2 teaspoons with some water enough for a thick paste.</li>
            <li> I am a smoker, so I apply extra thick layer around mouth and nose area.  </li>
            <li> it just a bit and put it on your face/ tao some water and wet the dried up mask,</li>
            <li> The only thing I will say is that DO NOT make it too thick.</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t think it is possible to apply it as thick as they recommend.</li>
            <li> i was skeptical but its not that expensive considering the money i have spent on many products that didnt work</li>
            <li> I use the equal parts clay and apple cider vinegar and make it somewhat thick and let it sit on my face until the pulsating stops ..</li>
            <li> Aside from being wasteful, I doubt it would even be possible to layer it on that thick.</li>
            <li> However, after using it a few times, I have seen no real improvement in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face still gets oily by the end of the day, which is annoying, but I should probably try using the mask more often.</li>
            <li> I just dab a thick layer of clay &amp; teeny tiny bit of water over it and let it sit for 20-30 min.</li>
            <li> Ehhh it does its job and is what they advertise it to be, but it&#x27;s annoying to make and wish it were more of a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> What I would expected from a green clay.  </li>
            <li> how soft my skin felt immediately after, but I wouldn&#x27;t dare use it again, as my face literally looks 10x worse now with all of these pimples.</li>
            <li> I have trouble sometimes using it because it clumps up, and there are no real instructions on how to mix it.</li>
            <li> This comes in part from the fact that you do not want to wash it down the sink, which is a definite negative when compared to chemical masks, which you can wash off.</li>
            <li> The awful pick marks/scabs are finally healing, my acne purged the first few days due to the mask pulling out the toxins and dirt, and now my blackheads and deep pimples are finally going away.</li>

            <li> Not a very comfortable feeling</li>
            <li> About the time I reached 13, obviously because of puberty and the typical growing phases, I was one of the unlucky ones plagued with pretty bad acne.</li>
            <li> Smell from apple cider vinegar is a little unpleasant but the results are completely worth it!</li>
            <li> For dry skin, I recommend mixing with vinegar diluted with some water and a very little oil (I add [[ASIN:B007VEPVZC</li>
            <li> but wow is it uncomfortable when it starts to dry.</li>
            <li> It gets really hard on your face and starts cracking, soon all you&#x27;ll have is a big mess to take off of your face.</li>
            <li> After doing this, I wondered how/if it would ever dry because it was so thick and wet, but it does.  </li>
            <li> if you have dry skin or sensitive skin, I would NOT use this unless you want a weird scaley rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> DO NOT let the clay go down your drain as that can cause buildup.</li>
            <li> It can be used as a toner once it is watered down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 8 weeks now and it keeps my oiliness down without overdrying.</li>
            <li> I had flashbacks of my chemistry teacher saying don&#x27;t mix bleach and ammonia if you don&#x27;t want to die, so I set the bowl down and moved away until it stopped fizzing.  </li>
            <li> The redness will go down with time.</li>
            <li> The redness will go down with time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not let the clay go down the drain if you decide to pick off the clay.</li>
            <li> (I hold the honors for being the youngest patient MY dermatologist ever prescribed it to, bow down).</li>
            <li> and I still have the bumps, the redness settled down</li>
            <li> products when you go down the shiny makeup and skin care isle.</li>
            <li> Do not let this product go down your drain it will clog it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m looking down at it</li>
            <li> My face is stuck in the down position.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t flow down.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have chunks of clay going down your drain.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just one tip if you&#x27;re rinsing the mask off in your sink: after awhile, all that clay going down the drain will clog it, so</li>
            <li> I read up, down, sideways, and backwards before buying this.</li>
            <li> Now I need to master ways to remove the mask from my face without the product going down my drain and risking a clog.  </li>
            <li> I recommend laying down and watching TV with it on where you don&#x27;t need to move your face alot.</li>
            <li> I worry about rinsing the excess down the sink as it may harden and cause clogged pipes.</li>
            <li> Also don&#x27;t put it down the drain.</li>
            <li> DO NOT wash down the sink.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let that put you down.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t let this acne put you down.. and 2)</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve got it down now.</li>
            <li> When it came time to rinse off, I used a bowl because I did not want this going down my sink since it is mud.  </li>
            <li> If there are breakouts - it calms it down and even remove.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t want to rinse a lot down the drain.</li>
            <li> Follow the instruction I added 1part clay 1part ACV, it fizzle and then died down.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let chunks go down your drain</li>
            <li> If this product does the trick, I&#x27;ll update and say hands down, it works on this problem.</li>
            <li> and you cannot wash it Down the sink.</li>
            <li> Your face will be a bit red-looking for ~15 minutes after, but it calms down.</li>
            <li> I also have used it as a mask - face all the way down to my collar bone.  </li>
            <li> Within 1/2 minute, the swelling was down and the itch gone..</li>
            <li> The down bringer?</li>
            <li> , I would not recommend washing this off in the shower or rinsing it down the sink.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t force any of the pieces down.</li>
            <li> incase any chunks of clay go down the drain).  </li>
            <li> The breakout went down a lot and the redness was gone.</li>
            <li> because, I thought this stuff cleaned your face down inside the pours and everything.</li>
            <li> I have cut down to about every 3 days to see if this is just the &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34; stage.</li>
            <li> If I emptied the remainder down the sink, my husband&#x27;s agreeable attitude to using this would go down the sink as well…once he unclogged the sink pipes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mud, so going down the drain is a no-no.</li>
            <li> DO NOT rinse this down your drain, I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking</li>
            <li> If it clogs your drains though, just pour some vinegar down the drain.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can feel the mask making its way down cleaning the pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am down to 6 or 7 pimples</li>
            <li> and I remove with baby wipes so that it doesn&#x27;t go down and clog my drain.</li>
            <li> to get off (can&#x27;t let this thing down the drain)&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> People were freaking me out about washing it down the drain</li>
            <li> and then my skin calms down.</li>
            <li> red:-0(&lt;br /&gt;Thank goodness it calmed down as I was going out that evening.  </li>
            <li> I mix it with Bragg&#x27;s but need to get the ratio down.  </li>
            <li> I had already taken a shower and I was paranoid about getting clay clumps down the drain and clogging it up.</li>
            <li> my pimples have gone down since using it</li>
            <li> husband would die if he knew I rinsed it down the drain.</li>
            <li> Other masks cannot even compare!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously, this mask IS a face changer with the intensity of feel, like what other reviewers say, and it worked for me!</li>
            <li> Such a waste of time and money!!</li>
            <li> One other thing: You must moisterize!</li>
            <li> I mean red and burning!</li>
            <li> Never gonnna use any other mask!</li>
            <li> My forehead and sides of my face get extremely itchy though!</li>
            <li> No thanks!!  </li>
            <li> I have used it every other day for 2 weeks and have noticed a change!</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t have Apple Cider Vinegar or any other oil) and it was soooo moisturizing!</li>
            <li> That little bit of skin by your temples needs to stretch to accommodate to the other skin around it (forehead and cheeks)</li>
            <li> Helps dry up small blemishes.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount of clay and mix it with hydrogen peroxide  and let it sit on my face until dry.</li>
            <li> The 4th use I noticed the dark spots are less visable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Throughout the day, I had no new breakouts, and my skin did not become excessively oily.  </li>
            <li> And I was starting to get a little desperate because my normal serums have not been working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only complaint your face will be tight after you rinse, but moisturize, and no break out.</li>
            <li> It is kind of a weird, uncomfortable sensation, but it&#x27;s not too bad and the results are well worth the 30 seconds of discomfort while I remove</li>
            <li> I wiped it down with a paper towel and to my shock the residue was made up of black and metallic particles - it looked like glitter.</li>
            <li> the inflammation of incoming pimples, especially those ones that are large painful ones&lt;br</li>
            <li> nothing significant for my skin (I get ugly pimples sometimes and have oily skin all the time</li>
            <li> I thought the mess, the clogging of my drain and mud everywhere was not worth the results.</li>
            <li> It is a bit messy, but I expected it to be; after all, it is clay!  </li>
            <li> My advice is start in small amounts and work your way up, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is messy though compared to my other masks.</li>
            <li> Application is a little messy as expected..</li>
            <li> A little cold, but it was fun.</li>
            <li> so I collect most of the clay to throw out now, which can be a little annoying.</li>
            <li> I then take my index finger of the other hand and &amp;#34;tap&amp;#34; the clay mixture onto the trouble spots.  </li>
            <li> and it never ever has dried out my face like other masks that have fragrance or chemicals .</li>
            <li> The actual tube is very small for the price that is why it gets 4 stars</li>
            <li> As a person who has dealt with acne for years and have used just about every product out there including the expensive brands I can not believe something that cost so little worked so well and so fast.</li>
            <li> I suggest putting a few drops of tea tree oil or some other oil in with the ACV mixture to lessen the odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (It is a little difficult to remove but there is nothing that can really be done about that</li>
            <li> Oh, few other tips.</li>
            <li> Oh, few other tips.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now you do have to be very careful when opening the container and when dispensing the product because power goes EVERYWHERE!  </li>
            <li> I only have very few !</li>
            <li> When I rinsed, I let it run down the sink but it very small pieces, not large chunks, and it took me FOREVER to get off, felt like it took as long as I let it sit on my face!  </li>
            <li> Have used it a good amount of times I find it tough to apply and hate mixing it.</li>
            <li> still it got hard and harder and basically started to kinda pull (never really felt</li>
            <li> I purchase off of Amazon just about weekly for everyday deals and also the hard to find items that your local CVS or Walgreens might not cover.</li>
            <li> Let it dry completely at least every other time you use it.</li>
            <li> so be very careful when utilizing this as it can get quite messy.</li>
            <li> What a mess, don&#x27;t let it go down</li>
            <li> Too bad though because it did make my face feel squeaky clean after I washed it off.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I would say about this clay is it really made me face itch while it was on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how this product could create such a bad reaction if it is really just bentonite clay and ACV.</li>
            <li> It smells bad with the apple cider vinegar, and makes your face red after the use, but it really works.</li>
            <li> The bad part is that it left the rest of my skin really</li>
            <li> The bad part is that it left the rest of my skin really</li>
            <li> as for the bad reviews I think those people are just putting too much faith in one topical product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped lessen them, although her results aren&#x27;t so dramatic as my 11 year old&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I just put a mask on for about half and hour</li>
            <li> I mix half water and vinegar with the clay.</li>
            <li> I mix black or apple cider vinegar with my clay.</li>
            <li> You can feel your skin tightening, and slight tingling too.</li>
            <li> I do use it once every two week to help with softening black heads.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you...if you ever want to know what it&#x27;s like to have a black hole on your face then</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m prone to black heads.</li>
            <li> and my skin is less oily then ever before.</li>
            <li> I then leave it on for half an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only negative is when applying it can get messy.</li>
            <li> Face feels less oily after use.</li>
            <li> think half of the appeal is the way it feels on my skin as its drying.</li>
            <li> Yet, my acne was still slightly there.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, you do not need a half inch thickness for your face, or whatever thickness the package recommends.</li>
            <li> I felt the itching and slight burning of the skin on my eyebrow area, chin, and outer regions of my face.</li>
            <li> but I was still shocked at how red my whole face was.</li>
            <li> So as always I read volumes of reviews-I&#x27;m your typical skeptic and a straight-shooter when it comes to telling it like it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a slight pinkish color which lasted maybe 30 minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Blackheads on my looked like they were half pulled out</li>
            <li> I figured, for less than $10, why not?  </li>
            <li> to use: for every teaspoon of powder is half a teaspoon of water/apple cider vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product on my face, I do feel a slight tingle as it is drying..</li>
            <li> Have had it on less than 10 minutes</li>
            <li> Although after three weeks of using it, I can&#x27;t say that my pores are less visible, in fact, they look quite noticeable...</li>
            <li> I started with once a week and saw slight improvement in my acne.</li>
            <li> I use this once or twice a week typically after a Salicylic Peel (also purched on amazon 15$)  </li>
            <li> You do get a slight redness after removal of the mask</li>
            <li> , I have a Panasonic black head remover</li>
            <li> This stuff kicks some black head butt.</li>
            <li> I have way less breakouts</li>
            <li> It will give you some redness on your skin, but that will disappear in half an hour as the instruction says.</li>
            <li> I would have definitely put a five star rating because the clay was magic on reducing the size and redness of the pimples on my chest but the worst part of using this clay is taking it off.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of scars which end up accumulating black heads and it just looks terrible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never noticed my black heads disappearing but will say that my face was glowing after use.</li>
            <li> Also, the less you use, the less it will clog your drains.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s looking less and less irritated.</li>
            <li> I will say while the mask is on, it feels as though you have a black hole on your face.</li>
            <li> but I do have some black heads on my T zone.</li>
            <li> I use half vinegar and half water.</li>
            <li> , I had went downstairs and my facial movements were still so mine dried to a thick mask</li>

            <li> It takes like 15 minutes to mix with water, but if you have something like apple cider vinegar, it takes less than 3 minutes, and the consistency is even smoother, and it spreads way way easier.</li>

            <li> I had almost given up hope about 5 minutes in, but then my face started to heat up slightly and pulsate.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I hadn&#x27;t heard of this product previously</li>
            <li> and maybe I notice slightly brighter skin...</li>
            <li> I use much less than the directions say to use so</li>
            <li> When I take the clay mask off, the pimple is noticeably reduced in size -- and therefore much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a difference in less than an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In about 30 minutes or less, my skin looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still will get the odd pimple</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I have problem skin, I&#x27;m a black woman,</li>
            <li> *slightly* smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am getting black heads in places I&#x27;ve never had them before, which makes me slightly nervous.  </li>
            <li> but it goes away after about 1 hour or less.</li>
            <li> Then I use a big wide paintbrush to apply a thin layer all over my face then wait for it to try</li>
            <li> It does slightly tingle</li>
            <li> Well if you&#x27;re reading this I am guessing you are in the position where I was less than a week ago.</li>
            <li> do this clay mask about once every week and a half.</li>
            <li> I use it with apple cider vinegar and will try it with water to see if it is less drying.</li>
            <li> Less Oily.</li>
            <li> I find my face produce slightly less sebum throughout the day on the day after I use this clay.  </li>
            <li> This could be result of face being less</li>
            <li> i use i need to add the water not very easy to use.</li>
            <li> my blackheads are less visible and makes my skin smoother.</li>
            <li> kinda clumpy if you mix just with water, but with apple cider vinegar/water it bubbles and is less clumpy.</li>
            <li> My make up slides on smoother, and i&#x27;ve been using way less concealer than I used to.</li>
            <li> My make up slides on smoother, and i&#x27;ve been using way less concealer than I used to.</li>
            <li> So I do half vinegar and half water</li>
            <li> It did remove the black heads from my nose buy</li>
            <li> When I took it off, the black heads on my nose were gone and my face looked cleaner.</li>
            <li> Using a plastic bag makes it easier to mix than using a spoon, and is also a lot less cleanup.  </li>
            <li> i recommend this to anyone who has acne of black head</li>
            <li> With less ingredients as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Gets rid of black heads</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll still have black heads after using this</li>
            <li> Tightens up face and helps minimize pores *slightly</li>
            <li> There are no quick fixes, it&#x27;s a process so be patient.</li>
            <li> and my pores are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> There was less black heads around my wife&#x27;s nose</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that I seem to be breaking out less.</li>
            <li> pulsating effect is invigorating.&lt;br /&gt;Fewer black heads.  </li>
            <li> It takes less than a minute to get it off this way)</li>
            <li> BUT AFTER A WEEK YOU WILL HAVE 50% LESS</li>
            <li> In less than 5 min, my face was already tightened up</li>
            <li> I got this and was less than amazed with the results.</li>
            <li> and I had less breakouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed less breakouts and when they do come this helps get rid of them quicker .</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a problem with red irritated skin from trying to scrape off a thick layer of dried clay.</li>
            <li> guess it took about 2 and a half months to use up that one pound jar for me).There</li>
            <li> guess it took about 2 and a half months to use up that one pound jar for me).There</li>
            <li> I use it in a BPA-free plastic dredge that I found on amazon for less than four dollars.</li>
            <li> and I have not used even used half of the container.</li>
            <li> I notice that my skin way is less oily throughout the day, even on days where I haven&#x27;t used a mask for 3 days.</li>
            <li> When they say \\&quot;black hole\\</li>
            <li> I could feel slight pulling</li>
            <li> Definitely less pain that your dermatologist inflicts.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re a black person with an oily forehead</li>
            <li> Seriously it will irritate your skin and cause massive inflammation.  </li>
            <li> I wash my face with Black Soap</li>
            <li> My face is SO much less oily and my pores are minimizing.  </li>
            <li> well and resulted in clogging my sink drain because the clumps where small enough to make it past the sink stop but collected somewhere in the pipe.</li>
            <li> Helps with prevention of black heads.</li>
            <li> spoon (or less) of vitamin c crystals</li>
            <li> and im already at the half point of the 1 pound tub.</li>
            <li> * like it works and leaves me with slightly improved skin</li>
            <li> I just tried this today could not get a half inch on it on my face</li>
            <li> I got this product to help with black heads.</li>
            <li> Fold towel in half, massage, repeat.</li>
            <li> Fold towel in half again, massage, repeat.</li>
            <li> It was oddly of soothing, like a massage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still I have made up a paste with water and a little plain yogurt (be careful,</li>
            <li> I recommend a small dose of moisturize of your choice - my skin always felt a little dry after I took off the clay mask.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything; from those little painful tools, exfoliating scrubs, those black head strips, proactive, other medications, to numerous home remedies - I could never get rid of the blackheads on my nose (oily skin, mainly nose).</li>
            <li> I have purchased expensive high end clay mask that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pale and my face was very pink for about 45 minutes afterwards.</li>
            <li> The last 2 times I used it were terrible, it pulled my skin downward &amp; the &amp;#34;pulsating&amp;#34; feeling felt more like unbearable irritating spikes in my pores, I could barely keep it on my face</li>
            <li> I also used the tip, by making it in Baggie (less mess).  </li>
            <li> and it has been less mess.</li>
            <li> and I prefer to do it this way as it makes less of a mess in my opinion.</li>
            <li> cracks and flakes off and makes a mess as i mentioned previously, you&#x27;ll need to confine yourself to the bathroom while you wait for it to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid if you skin is a little sensitive or red immediately afterwards, this will dissipate in 20 to 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> The scab I had on my face became so small as the mask removed all of the dead dry skin around it.</li>
            <li> seriously it feels like all the crap is being lifted out of my skin for a fresh new start......</li>
            <li> Within just a few days of using this product I felt a crazy bodily change and went back to the doctors office to find out I didn&#x27;t have a single cancer cell in my body.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve occasionally used it several days in a row, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any bad effects on my skin, (quite the opposite</li>
            <li> this stuff is pretty crazy.</li>
            <li> so if there was a mess it would be contained.  </li>
            <li> I can say that while it may be weird and uncomfortable, the results are worth every second.</li>
            <li> However, expect a minor flare up - clay tightens your pores and sucks out the oil that way, so it draws impurities to the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After sometime, i felt that i was sweating on my forehead.i was a bit surprised coz its dead cold outside and the heaters would not make you perspire.</li>
            <li> : Normal, prone to blackheads, clogged pores, &amp; random breakouts&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try again, but definitely not as a full face mask.</li>
            <li> The one thing bother me is every time I made a mess using it.</li>
            <li> I do recommend this to everyone...as long as you can stand the icky</li>
            <li> If you mix it with water (hot or cold - it doesn&#x27;t make a difference)</li>
            <li> First off I was desperate for an acne medication.</li>
            <li> The paste come out lumpy using hot or cold water.  </li>
            <li> I made up a small amount (using water vs. ACV) that had the mud consistency and placed it on the sore and surrounding pink area of infection.  </li>
            <li> It took me a while to stop making  a mess with the powder.</li>
            <li> stuff makes a mess</li>
            <li> Its a mess.</li>
            <li> so it takes some scrubbing and makes a mess.</li>
            <li> No one has mentioned the way it sticks to the sink/tub, makes a mess.</li>
            <li> My overall experience with this product just was not good.</li>
            <li> this stuff is a mess to work with.</li>
            <li> I usually end up leaving it on for around 20 minutes and then use a wet paper towel to remoisten the product and then to help buff it off my skin.</li>
            <li> I must say I was afraid at first to apply it on that area of my face</li>
            <li> If you put it on thick, it will start to hurt your skin due to it tightening to be careful.</li>
            <li> In the beginning (in my early teens) stages I tried the basic Neutrogena, Clean&amp;Clear, basic drugstore crap.</li>
            <li> My skin is very delicate and sensitive, always has been, this makes using creams or other abrasive skin care products hard.</li>
            <li> My friend uses a little less than the recommended amount and also adds about 5-10 drops of the oil, and finds that it has a softening effect on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scaring was hidden by a little makeup</li>
            <li> I  noticed my skin got a little less oily</li>
            <li> (the package said this could happen) but it went down in a few hours.  </li>
            <li> Extremely messy, I use a basin so it doesn&#x27;t go down drain and clog.</li>
            <li> my acne is immediately being shrank down and dried out.</li>
            <li> and then I put raw honey the other 2-3 days.  </li>
            <li> but I felt my face tingle and get tight.</li>
            <li> and I didn’t expect it to be so tight.</li>
            <li> CAN’T TALK OMG SO TIGHT.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel tight and smoother after you take it off.</li>
            <li> and it wa extemely tight</li>
            <li> it dries it is extremely tight, I didn&#x27;t want to talk or move my mouth at all.&lt;br /&gt;After washing it off</li>
            <li> It does make your face feel tight and itchy but</li>
            <li> must say this product gets extremely tight and can crack off.</li>
            <li> It dries so tight, I can feel it working.</li>
            <li> So the mask got really tight on my face.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel tight and refreshed.</li>
            <li> your skin gets really tight and it pulses on you face.</li>
            <li> Feels really tight when the stuff dries.  </li>
            <li> My skin just seemed tight and happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I leave it on for about 25 mins and your face gets tight as others have mentioned.</li>
            <li> My face tingled and got really tight.</li>
            <li> After 20 minutes you can&#x27;t talk because it is soooo tight.</li>
            <li> When you put this mask on you feel your face pulsating and getting tight, nothing I&#x27;ve ever felt before in a face mask.</li>
            <li> Pulls so tightly that after rinsing my skin thinks it&#x27;s a teenager again.</li>
            <li> AS your your face is getting tight.</li>
            <li> My skin is tight and my complexion is evening out.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It makes your face extremely tight and The smell is iffy if you use vinegar (I use organic apple cider vinegar)</li>
            <li> It started getting uncomfortably tight</li>
            <li> You can literally feel your face pulsating and getting tight.  </li>
            <li> Slather this concoction on, and in 15-20 minutes, the masque becomes almost frighteningly tight, leaving your face in a stone-like grimace while it tackles your unruly pores and whips them into submission.</li>
            <li> What it did was tightened my face up so tight</li>
            <li> Clay draws up so tight</li>
            <li> You cannot hardly talk when it is dry.  </li>
            <li> does it dry up hard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a mask dry so hard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is messy, as others have mentioned - DO NOT RINSE IN SINK - a little down the drain isn&#x27;t an issue</li>
            <li> So, even though I still have my acne this stuff has done other things that actually make my acne less dramatic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sill unable to recover from this breakout and still have scaring and new acne occurring.</li>
            <li> This is very difficult for me to get it to the right texture that you think it should be to apply it to your face.</li>
            <li> It actually gets so hard that you can feel your heartbeat in your face!</li>
            <li> My skin felt a little tight</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s makes your skin a little tight, but</li>
            <li> Regardless of how I mix it, it always takes at least 30 minutes to dry</li>
            <li> and then I even had to use moisturizer because it dried my skin slightly.</li>
            <li> I apply it fairly thick and wait for it to dry, which can take quite a while.  </li>
            <li> Use of a konjac sponge helped make the rinse off quicker and less messy.</li>
            <li> It takes about 15 or 20 minutes to dry depending on how thickly it is applied.  </li>
            <li> At first, I was appalled that someone called me out in public for the bumps in my skin..</li>
            <li> When I first received it, I mixed it as directed but with water, because I hate the smell of vinegar.</li>
            <li> Not too thick or it won&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put it as thick as they specify on the jar because it would take forever to dry.</li>
            <li> Makes it way less oily for a few days.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine what a thick layer would need to dry.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s much less waste.</li>
            <li> It was also less greasy for a few days, which is nice!&lt;br /&gt;However, when you mix it, DO NOT USE ANY METAL TOOLS.</li>
            <li> (less wait too because I&#x27;m impatient).</li>
            <li> Had a few black head on my nose</li>
            <li> My pimples were hardened and dried up, less irritated.</li>
            <li> my skin very nicely is a little on the ruff side, so if your skin is sentitive slowly remove the product couple of minutes before is completely dry</li>
            <li> I have to keep 1hr for thick coating and 40 mins for single layer.</li>
            <li> A little bit got into my drain</li>
            <li> almost the point of a little pain, but</li>
            <li> It used to come in little pieces in plastic bags when I was growing up</li>
            <li> At 40 minutes it is itching a little around my neck.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a little muddy around my face</li>
            <li> so I think I&#x27;ll wait a little longer.</li>
            <li> It took a little while to get it off.  </li>
            <li> It hurt a little in some parts but not screaming pain.  </li>
            <li> I used a little olive oil after washing it off.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, dribble just a little in.</li>
            <li> and if I move it even a LITTLE, it&#x27;ll stiffen my face up.</li>
            <li> I washed my face with face wash afterwards too and applied a little bit of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> if anything if its too little you can always mix up more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I preferred to get mine a little thicker than pudding.  </li>
            <li> But it took a little bit of time.</li>
            <li> I mix my clay with a little water and a little apple cider vinegar, then apply to my hair and allow it to set for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Just need a little bit and mix with water.</li>
            <li> Yeah it works a little</li>
            <li> As a man, it&#x27;s a little embarassing to be walking around with a mask on your face.</li>
            <li> I put a little lotion on my face after the shower and took a glance in the mirror...</li>
            <li> Just wish it was a little easier to mix up and remove.</li>
            <li> That made me a little nervous about trying it.</li>
            <li> It also got a little bit tingly torwards the end</li>
            <li> I also noticed that after rinsing the product I felt I had little cuts on my face.</li>
            <li> There was a little redness.</li>
            <li> i have little bumps i cant get rid of, trust</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little cumbersome to use</li>
            <li> because I have heard the clay mask drys up your face a little.</li>
            <li> there is a little redness after using this mask but that just means that its doing its job....</li>
            <li> I do get a little bumps here</li>
            <li> I wish I find a product for my hormonal chin acne due to pcos :/</li>
            <li> It burns a little for me but nothing to cry about.</li>
            <li> I use it in a mixture, but it can be used alone with a little water to cleanse.</li>
            <li> but after I use it I feel that my face looks cleaner, and a little brighter</li>
            <li> whatever little agitation I felt.</li>
            <li> I used it on my teenager and pre-teen too and it cleared up the little pimples they had.</li>
            <li> anything it did feel a little bit cleaner after use, but that is nothing to warrant another</li>
            <li> guess I should mention I dolled my little brother up</li>
            <li> guess I should mention I dolled my little brother up</li>
            <li> I use a little glass bowl, dump it in, vinegar, mix.</li>
            <li> and there (resist the urge to scratch or use a toothpick to satisfy little urges).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First I must say it was little disconcerting to hear the sizzle when mixing this with apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li> Dries a little slower than i was hoping too.</li>
            <li> though that could be due to the witch hazel I use, not sure)</li>
            <li> I make it in batches and store it in my fridge, and the mixture does absorb some of the liquids after it sits for a little bit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leave it on your face until you feel the pulsating, and then leave it on a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> Then washed my face but applied a little to the pimple and slept with it overnight.</li>
            <li> A little goes along way.</li>
            <li> It came off in pieces so it took me a little longer</li>
            <li> A little bit also makes it easier to get off your skin when it dries</li>
            <li> but the result is not friendly for pipes.</li>
            <li> After my little ordeal, I tried another member&#x27;s suggestion of using a sandwich ziploc bag to kneed the mixture together.</li>
            <li> i take it off when it&#x27;s still a little damp.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i apply a little coco butter or shea butter on my face after washing it off.</li>
            <li> Sometimes a little, sometimes a lot.</li>
            <li> A little drying.</li>
            <li> For anyone who is considering purchasing the clay, you will not be disappointed, it is worth it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little steep</li>
            <li> I make a little paste out of this and put it on for about 1/2 hour.</li>
            <li> You have to work with the clay a little, adding water here and there.</li>
            <li> Takes a little practice to get the preferred consistency.  </li>
            <li> I also add a little bit of aloe vera gel from my plant.  </li>
            <li> This is a little known use, and it is not on the jar label.  </li>
            <li> I add a little lavendar oil and soak for 20 - 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> A little is all you need.</li>
            <li> Each time, you have to squish it up a bit in case some little clumps formed</li>
            <li> Each time, you have to squish it up a bit in case some little clumps formed</li>
            <li> I did try the plastic baggy trick that another reviewer mentioned, which did make it a little easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little clay goes a loooong way.</li>
            <li> - it freaked me out a little</li>
            <li> I also like that you can mix as much or as little as you need.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical to buy this, but wow!</li>
            <li> bought Terramin Clay because it was advertised that the \\&quot;astronauts\\&quot; ate a little every day for minerals, while in space..Don&#x27;t believe the hype..</li>
            <li> You have to mix the mask yourself which can be a little tricky.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit skeptical because of some reviews, but don&#x27;t knock it till you try it!</li>
            <li> It gave me a little redness afterward</li>
            <li> my skin is a little oily ..</li>
            <li> but my skin still remained a little greasy.</li>
            <li> but my skin still remained a little greasy.</li>
            <li> After 5 minutes, it started to make my face itch a little.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Knowing the amount of product to use on one face takes a little trail and error.</li>
            <li> Can feel a little burning sensation sometimes when I use, but not always.</li>
            <li> I mix this with a little apple cider vinegar and apply it as directed 1-2 times every 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> It took me days &amp; days to get rid of the spots,they had little whiteheads in them.</li>
            <li> I washed it off just a little sooner than I could have.  </li>
            <li> Doing a little Botox?  </li>
            <li> &amp; I have had little to no acne since using it.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous trying this.  </li>
            <li> I just feel a little bit smoother</li>
            <li> I mixed it with Apple Cider Vinegar, I was afraid to put it on my face but after a thin layer I felt it working so fast!</li>
            <li> So I bought this, a little bowl and brush and some apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> This product help with my face with a little time and patient.</li>
            <li> I could see little dots throughout the mask where dirt and oil had been pulled out of my skin.</li>
            <li> I use vinegar &amp; a little water</li>
            <li> After I rinse off the mask, I apply a little bit of Argan oil, which also seems to be helping my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mix the powder with a little water until it is a paste.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and have a little acne</li>
            <li> I had little to no blemishes.  </li>
            <li> I use a little Vaseline on my face immediately after the mask.</li>
            <li> After reviewing the reviews I was still a little hesitant to try this...</li>
            <li> As it seems to work, my acne worsened a little bit after the times I used it.</li>
            <li> That little fact doesn&#x27;t stop me from using it however.</li>
            <li> I was a little scared of the pulsating part</li>
            <li> then thru a little bit out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda messy so maybe purchase a mixing bowl with applicator brush to eliminate too much of a mess.</li>
            <li> Your water/vinegar will have evenly distributed itself by then in the clay, and you should have little to no chunks.</li>
            <li> a little moisturizer can&#x27;t fix.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It made my skin a little itchy.</li>
            <li> u put a little bit of it over the pimple</li>
            <li> Not sure what I expected, it&#x27;s a mask!</li>
            <li> There was a little dryness</li>
            <li> but when I tried a little bit on my skin and rinsed I could see the difference</li>
            <li> I mix with a little apple cider vinegar and apply all over my face.</li>
            <li> I like to sprinkle a little in my hair when it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> some people may not even brake out at all, some a little and some a lot.</li>
            <li> I also add little water to help dilute.</li>
            <li> Got hooked a little over a month ago, and now use it about 2 times per week...</li>
            <li> I add a little drop of tea tree oil, or peppermint oil</li>
            <li> or you will end up with a little redness in your checks.</li>
            <li> I had a little redness after which the directions worned you about.</li>
            <li> They come with the little bowl, brush, mixer tool, and measuring spoons.</li>
            <li> This is the part that gets a little tricky for me.  </li>
            <li> It has made my face a lot smoother and has evened out my tone a little also.</li>
            <li> I just wished cleaning it off was a little easier.</li>
            <li> a little cumbersome to use but seems to work well.</li>
            <li> One reviewer said it was no better than any other clay mask she used</li>
            <li> but the result is not friendly for pipes</li>
            <li> The oils do take a little while to absorb</li>
            <li> I felt a little tingling sensation, probably from the added stuff</li>
            <li> My skin is a little sensative.</li>
            <li> my skin looks different--it&#x27;s got a little shine and glow to it.</li>
            <li> I pour a little bit of BRAGG Apple Cider Vinegar in a teacup, pour a little bit of the clay, and mix it with my index finger.</li>
            <li> Little by little the mask will come off.</li>
            <li> it burned and itch a little at the beginning then gradually stopped</li>
            <li> My face felt softer and I did have a little redness</li>
            <li> So the powder should be a little alkaline.</li>
            <li> I kept it on for about an hour or so (as long as I could stand it) because it became so hard and tight!</li>
            <li> Sadly the results do not last very long.</li>
            <li> It was that tight when it dried up.</li>
            <li> When it dried, my skin got REALLY tight, but it didn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li> clay tightens your face and it&#x27;s very hard to make any facial expressions</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin really red and irritated, and very hard to wash off, I recommend taking a shirt off when washing off to avoid drenching your shirt a bit</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any negative reactions to the product like some have, and my skin is usually very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have a terrible back acne problem for over 10 years, and have pretty much gave up on it because I&#x27;m tired of spending 100&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been using it to counteract some medicinal side-effects (i.e dry skin &amp; washed out complexion) as well as to calm my acne when it gets really bad.  </li>
            <li> It freaked me out the first time I used it because my face looked like I had a bad sunburn after I washed it off, but as the other reviewers have said, it fades within an hour.</li>
            <li> I broke out pretty badly (shows how all the other products never got the gunk out of my skin)..</li>
            <li> I broke out pretty badly (shows how all the other products never got the gunk out of my skin)..</li>
            <li> serious skin irritation&lt;br /&gt;+Lasts a long time and is inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;+It&#x27;s pampering</li>
            <li> I used it with apple cider and felt no sensations as the mask dried other than the usual feeling like my face is turning into a statue.</li>
            <li> You will feel it a little heavy, but it will go away.</li>
            <li> You will feel it a little heavy, but it will go away.</li>
            <li> then it got a little itchy as it dried.  </li>
            <li> I would mix this earth with a little cucumber juice (grate a cucumber and squeeze through a cheesecloth) and a few drops of honey and apply it as a mask.</li>
            <li> It mixes up green, it fizzed a little in the bowl.  </li>
            <li> Can get a little messy</li>
            <li> This clay is a little too harsh for using on my hair or skin alone.  </li>
            <li> A little messy</li>
            <li> It was alright, just a little messy.</li>
            <li> Washing it off is a little messy</li>
            <li> Had a little redness after removing it, however it disappeared in a few hours.</li>
            <li> I also sat facing a box fan for a little while and both my face and neck dried uniformly.</li>
            <li> However, after a few uses I noticed little difference in my clogged pores.  </li>
            <li> It is a little messy to take off.</li>
            <li> let it get down your drain!</li>
            <li> For someone who has up and down skin conditions, it is heaven to hear this!</li>
            <li> You do not want this mud going down our drains for you will clog them!</li>
            <li> clay-- DO NOT PUT ANY OF THE CLAY DOWN THE DRAIN!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get worse till about high school, but again high school is a time when we all go through improvements so having acne is not as bad.</li>
            <li> Once mixed, it&#x27;s very thick.</li>
            <li> Please be careful if you have combination skin and are prone to whiteheads and rosacea!!!</li>
            <li> never understood what other reviewers meant when they said it will pull on your skin and makes a dramatical difference.&lt;br /&gt;It works!!</li>
            <li> As soon as i added it to the clay, it started to bubble a little bit but mixed thourougly.i put the mask on and was wondering if it was thin in consistency.</li>
            <li> My facial acne is not the worse, but I figured I need to do a little more&lt;</li>
            <li> It definitely pulls on your face and tightens up quite a bit.. which can get a little irritating.</li>
            <li> but it makes my skin a little too red but still non-itchy or irritating.  </li>
            <li> After letting my face air dry, I take a very small amount (about 1/8 of a teaspoon) of the Coconut Oil and mix it with 1-2 drops of the Jojoba Oil and rub all over my face.  </li>
            <li> The main thing about the clay is you can&#x27;t rinse it down the drain for fear of clogging plumbing (warning on label) which means it&#x27;s inconvenient to use.</li>
            <li> Wife said: it was too hard to put on and was uncomfortable and didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> those that say this is hard to wipe off, you are not applying it thick enough.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s never 100% clear, especially during that time of the month when I would suffer a bad breakout.</li>
            <li> I also get really bad break outs on  my back, chest and shoulders and have fixed that with a soap from Japan that contains this clay.</li>
            <li> Oh my skin is crazy sensetive and it only stays red for the 30 minutes</li>
            <li> I am the one with sensitive skin, so I was shocked it did not affect me in that way, only him.</li>
            <li> My entire family suffers from acne and pores so big you can see from afar.</li>
            <li> bought it back in December 2014  and have tried it several times all with disappointing results...</li>
            <li> Had difficult white closed comedones on my forehead...</li>
            <li> I looked in the mirror &amp; my pores looked like they were getting larger, washed off immediately &amp; a crazy rash devolved on my back.</li>
            <li> it also dried up my zits</li>
            <li> The mask takes of all of the dead skins and helps fix the damaged ones.</li>
            <li> The mask takes of all of the dead skins and helps fix the damaged ones.</li>
            <li> its so messy.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a bit messy to mix up</li>
            <li> You can feel this mask working after few minutes of putting it on with the tightening of your skin.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t waste any of it.</li>
            <li> Not \\&quot;dried</li>
            <li> Am I supposed to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> i waited till all my mask dried up.it</li>
            <li> A bit messy.  </li>
            <li> it hasn&#x27;t dried out my skin but must have pulled out the fungus that causes Psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> I am using it with some yogurt and honey or yogurt, seaweed powder and a few drops of vinegar as a face mask.  </li>
            <li> For about 2.5-3 hrs when it completely dried depends on the weather is when I pull off the mask piece by piece over a paper towel laid over the sink(to toss in trash).  </li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s messy, I would recommend this to anyone with problem skin.</li>
            <li> The mask dried up acne I had on my face in just one use.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really messy though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We both measured equal amounts of Clay powder and Apple Cider Vinegar then began mixing the paste.&lt;br /&gt;The paste can be as thin as you want it.  </li>
            <li> and I could feel it tightening as it dried.  </li>
            <li> Dark spots are diminishing and small blackhead that I had is gone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Of course, I don&#x27;t use this everyday (just twice a week), but I feel like my skin is either used to it now</li>
            <li> I tried to press through and the itching did stop after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Then, a few days after that, they were GONE.</li>
            <li> : I read in the reviews here that a lot of people had trouble taking the mask off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sold on Amazon as well if you have some scars left behind you need to take care of.  </li>
            <li> It is messy and a pain to mix.</li>
            <li> I have to say its quite messy in the beginning</li>
            <li> If you already aren&#x27;t using a cleanser, a toner, and a moisturizer with sun protection everyday</li>
            <li> I also like to add a few drops of Melaleuca AKA Tea Tree Oil to help with my acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I do this everyday.</li>
            <li> not working ,dont waste your money  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t seem to need it everyday now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it a few times and can already notice a drastic change in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I went and bought this from a vitamin store after reading a few things about it.</li>
            <li> are few options that you can try:&lt;br /&gt;**Every</li>
            <li> Can be a bit messy.</li>
            <li> What do you use?&amp;#34; and I simply tell its Aztec Secret.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something i could use on my face that wasn&#x27;t harsh to my skin.</li>
            <li> so I made trying this secret clay to be my big plan for the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few reviews mentioned using a make-up brush (makes sense</li>
            <li> A few reviews mentioned using a make-up brush (makes sense</li>
            <li> We only used a thin layer.</li>
            <li> No big secret here aside from</li>
            <li> I am using lemon juice, green tea, yogurt, milk, water, orange juice, coconut milk, coconut oil and castor oil.</li>
            <li> I try to use this mask everyday.</li>
            <li> When I put the solution on my face, it stung a bit but didn&#x27;t seem too harsh</li>
            <li> After washing the mask off, my blackheads seemed to loosen and my face was glowing for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> use this for a clay detox bath a few nights a week...</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I decided to try lemon juice</li>
            <li> Yet never experienced such results like this.</li>
            <li> You literally bought a jar of dirt off Amazon; don&#x27;t waste it.  </li>
            <li> Dried, this stuff looks like boogers.  </li>
            <li> so I stopped using it everyday sometimes 2 or 3 days a week sometimes not even a week or whatnot.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it is messy.</li>
            <li> May be a few try.  </li>
            <li> I like to mix this with apple vinegar and a few drops of tea tree oil (which also helps buffer the vinegar smell).</li>
            <li> I let it dried for 15 mins before washing it off.</li>
            <li> Once I rinse my face, I do have to apply a heavy moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> However, be warned that it is MESSY and that the apple cider vinegar may be required.</li>
            <li> So I had gotten this from amazon some time ago but after a few uses it had caused my skin to break out.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday, when I wash my face.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times with apple cider vinegar, but it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> When it dried it seemed to just crack and fall off my face.</li>
            <li> I ended up using Proactiv, which helped for a few years but eventually stopped working.  </li>
            <li> but I was still missing that one piece of the skincare puzzle to bring it all together.  </li>
            <li> of warning:  This did bring quite a few pimples to the surface.  </li>
            <li> I gave myself a 2 week window in which I allowed the mask to suck all the gunk out without thinking the mask itself was actually causing my skin to become worse.  </li>
            <li> Friggin messy , its so messy and stinky</li>
            <li> It got here within a few days</li>
            <li> With a thin layer you can actually see the effect of the oils getting drawn from your pores into the clay.  </li>
            <li> Based on the reviews I read about Aztec Secret - Indian Healing Clay, I purchased it and definitely feel I scored quite a bargain.</li>
            <li> I only put a thin layer on and it still works for me.</li>
            <li> I would give this product five stars, but there are a few issues I have with it that should be addressed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I add a few drops of lavender or tea tree oil to my mask &amp; store any leftover in the fridge for up to a week.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I will use this everyday for a week and update my review.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Within two minutes it had already dried</li>
            <li> but I did order this on amazon a few years ago.</li>
            <li> and I just took an old plastic paintbrush - you know, the ones you get for a dollar in an unnamed packaging - and used the end to mix because the bristles are held by this weird metal bracelet.</li>
            <li> in green</li>
            <li> in green</li>
            <li> It is messy in terms of cleaning up after using it and getting it off your face.</li>
            <li> Also, beware, it can get messy.</li>
            <li> It is a messy product.</li>
            <li> I took the advice given here and put on a heavy moisturizer.</li>

            <li> but it was a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I plan on doing this again in a few days, and I&#x27;m going to leave on for about 30 minutes this time.</li>
            <li> I received my Bentonite Clay a few days after I ordered.</li>
            <li> here&#x27;s my everyday routine.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a few months now and because I don&#x27;t use it that often</li>
            <li> However, you should know that rinsing it off can get messy.</li>
            <li> It tightens my pore without drying and it isn&#x27;t harsh.</li>
            <li> After a few months, I&#x27;m doing this between 3-4 times a month depending on my activity.  </li>
            <li> They were killed for their &amp;#34;secret&amp;#34; healing clay.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few things to note on usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it everyday...</li>
            <li> I use it on my face, neck, shoulders, and chest to slough off all dead skin cells and make skin glow.  </li>
            <li> but I realize that this stuff is heavy duty</li>
            <li> Seems gimmicky.</li>
            <li> I put it on my neck because with hormonal acne, I get a few breakouts under my neck and jawline.</li>
            <li> Not for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this review in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I would give this product 5 stars, but it is a bit messy.</li>
            <li> Mixing with Apple Cider Vinegar seems to kill blemishes and red spots that would&#x27;ve gotten worse or lasted longer.</li>
            <li> and it was being wasted.</li>
            <li> I got oily skin and use makeup everyday</li>
            <li> It can be a bit messy to apply and mix, but I don&#x27;t mind with the results I get.  </li>
            <li> It arrived unusable all the powder was in the box in the bag wasted money.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s messy.</li>
            <li> There are people out there who don&#x27;t have proper vision, hearing, or worse disabilities.</li>
            <li> That won&#x27;t go in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> That won&#x27;t go in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Applying is a tad messy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read it could pull toxins out of your body and one shouldn&#x27;t touch anything left behind in the tub after the water drains.</li>
            <li> it does get messy but if you find ways around it you can avoid that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought it a few months ago but had been waiting for the summer to try it out on my vacation.  </li>
            <li> product is too messy.</li>
            <li> hope this may help a few people.</li>
            <li> you have to mix and apply which can be messy</li>
            <li> and I can see the few problematic pores here</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even talk after it dried.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even talk after it dried.  </li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t look bumpy anymore, all I have now are a few healing scabs and a few fading acne scars.</li>
            <li> The downside is the clay is messy to use and messy to take off.</li>
            <li> but honestly, this stuff is insane.</li>
            <li> My back started getting worse...  </li>
            <li> I still had a few pimples here</li>
            <li> It is a messy product, it helped my skin heal a bit.</li>
            <li> but the discomfort subsided as the clay dried.</li>
            <li> After removal, I follow up with a green tea moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Put</li>
            <li> It would&#x27;ve saved me a lot of trouble.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday</li>
            <li> It initially makes it seem like acne is getting worse, but don&#x27;t let that fool you.</li>
            <li> It stopped her diarrhea dead in its tracks.  </li>
            <li> this stuff is dirt, so it gets messy if you dont use zip locks.</li>
            <li> After quite a few trial and error, I&#x27;ve found a few things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> few of friends also use it to wash the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you have wasted a ton of money on products that seem to not be doing anything, I would advise you to try this one out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product a few times</li>
            <li> this probably sounds like somewhat a cocky review.</li>
            <li> and here I am a few times after using the mask and</li>
            <li> That would be within a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy and it&#x27;a annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My Dad, as far as I can remember, always had a weird fungus on his scalp.  </li>
            <li> After I took out my blackheads I washed my face with a face towel and dried my face.</li>
            <li> In a few days, they were dried up and my face started clearing up.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin and have used a few times.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve exhausted all possible options in an effort to rid my skin of this ailment.</li>
            <li> Since I started using it my acnes are few to none.</li>
            <li> DID shrink my pores... for a few hours...</li>
            <li> I does give a pulsating sensation for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> too harsh</li>
            <li> too harsh</li>
            <li> I add activated charcoal and a few drops of lavender oil.</li>
            <li> others have noted, this stuff can be messy to remove.  </li>
            <li> The apple cider vinegar caused it to bubble and fizz releasing gas and kapow, messy bathroom sink and mirror.</li>
            <li> used this after cleansing with Adovia Dead Sea Body and Face Soap Bar.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a few tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mix it with water and a few drops of tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> Still...worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars because it is messy.</li>
            <li> I do not use this everyday though-just 1-2 times per week does the trick.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Even though I don&#x27;t wearing makeup it felt like I was wearing heavy foundation or something before.</li>
            <li> Even though I don&#x27;t wearing makeup it felt like I was wearing heavy foundation or something before.</li>
            <li> I am a firm believer in the healing power of healing clay (bentonite clay).  </li>
            <li> I have been using it everyday.</li>
            <li> Sometimes if I feel my face needs it ill use it as night until the clay dries up completely even after the 20 minutes they tell you to leave it for.</li>
            <li> I do it every few days before bed and then put on a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> After a few days I started to break out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve eliminated heavy conditioners in my shower routine.</li>
            <li> use this a few times a week.</li>
            <li> I started doing it everyday</li>
            <li> I used it for a bath - which was kinda messy.  </li>
            <li> My problem area is my chin, and the zits there are all dried up now, it literally sucked it</li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with an organic moisturizer because otherwise my skin would be extremely dried out after using it.</li>
            <li> I also have an uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> Not one to needlessly waste anything I&#x27;ve purchased</li>
            <li> I use this when my skin is chapped from harsh winter weather.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Charcoal - Activated charcoal takes the purifying qualities of this mask and bumps it up a few dozen notches.  </li>
            <li> Charcoal - Activated charcoal takes the purifying qualities of this mask and bumps it up a few dozen notches.  </li>
            <li> All it is is green clay powder.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommend this to me &amp; since I have severe acne, she told me to use it everyday until my acne clears up &amp; then twice a week after.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times a week.  </li>
            <li> All of the noticeable dead skin was gone after I washed this mask off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product almost everyday for a week.</li>
            <li> I received this a few days ago and have used it twice.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait awhile before I reviewed this, to give myself some time to use it a few times.</li>
            <li> Wish this stuff wasn&#x27;t so messy</li>
            <li> Way too harsh for tender skin.  </li>
            <li> and it gets to messy</li>
            <li> Of course he sees me almost everyday</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv, a bunch of Nuetrogena &amp; Clearisil products, Garnier, any of the big name brands out their I&#x27;ve tried, and they&#x27;ve either made my skin worse or done nothing for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy and I don&#x27;t feel it goes on as well.</li>
            <li> is that?\\&quot; that my face almost looked distorted after it dried.</li>
            <li> I realize I am no great engineer, but I&#x27;m no stranger to mixing materials (modeling clays, paints, etc.), and I have yet to get a &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; batch of this stuff mixed.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll need to use it everyday</li>
            <li> , however, I would break out this stuff and mix it with some Bragg&#x27;s and leave it on until it dried all the way through.</li>
            <li> , I have uneven tone from sun damage</li>
            <li> I still have a few blackheads here and there, but my skin looks clearer and smoother than I ever seen it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the ugliest green and stinky, but you can feel it tighten your skin and pull out dirt.</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s not a miracle cure by any means, but after using it for a couple of months - about twice a week (or so, sometimes once), there has been a noticeable decrease in breakouts and acne scars are at least minimally diminished.</li>
            <li> I received this item a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> Messy</li>
            <li> After just a few day&#x27;s of using this my skin is way softer and clearer.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and once the mask starts feeling uncomfortable</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and once the mask starts feeling uncomfortable</li>
            <li> It is green.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times myself</li>
            <li> Although I saw a few that had stated that it dried out their face, made them breakout, etc.</li>
            <li> Definitely messy, so I ended up showering that night too.</li>
            <li> They say a few times a week</li>
            <li> Try out a few times a week and see how your skin responds.  </li>
            <li> It dried out my acne and has shrunk my pores.</li>
            <li> The one star is for the lack of labeling it green.</li>
            <li> So I cannot say anything yet about the clay itself, but I do not want to make green deodorant with it.</li>
            <li> My face felt a lot smoother, but then it dried out and peeled.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Plants use the minerals and trace elements in it to grow, it clouds water for a few days tho.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> price made me wait skip this product a few times</li>
            <li> it was to harsh on my face at all.</li>
            <li> Especially after your skin has been over exposed and looks tired, try it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this masque for a few (9) days now, &amp; the pimples are on the run...</li>
            <li> but the process can get messy.</li>
            <li> It pulled out the plugs and dried up his face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product a few times.</li>
            <li> When I start to get the telltale &amp;#34;pulsating&amp;#34; sensation, I wipe it off with a few damp paper towels and put them in the trash can.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> oh the trouble to put on and take off.  </li>
            <li> And it also does get messy, even with the towel placement.</li>
            <li> i am 26-old man and tried this for few times and i can see the results after that.</li>
            <li> and it never fully dried before I washed it off</li>
            <li> Even thought my blemishes were dried out, I immediately seen specks of acne scars that appeared within two days.</li>
            <li> I will update in a few months to see if my acne has improved.</li>
            <li> I did notice some redness, and a few welts on my nose and on my chin.</li>
            <li> and I can practically peel off the dried clay with my fingers</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my pore size, but then again I don&#x27;t use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Also it decreased my pimple size and redness on my left cheek.</li>
            <li> A few pimples popped up on my forehead</li>
            <li> so well I have to stop myself from trying to use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Can get messy since it is powdered clay in the container.</li>
            <li> Be prepared to mix it for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> : Messy.</li>
            <li> few tips:&lt;br</li>
            <li> stuff can be MESSY.</li>

            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s easiest to rinse this out in the shower since it gets messy.</li>
            <li> I also had a few pimples that surfaced to a head in places around my cheeks that I didn&#x27;t even know were there.</li>
            <li> And it dried off my pimple</li>
            <li> I use it with organic Apple Cider Vinegar a few times a week.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I applied it a bit too thickly, but still, I had to scrub roughly and with a wash cloth for a while to get it all off my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That being said, it is messy though.</li>
            <li> of warning though, I used this in the bathtub (not in the shower) and wiped up the clay residue left behind after the water drained with paper towels.</li>
            <li> received the healing clay and braggs apple cider vinegar a few days ago</li>
            <li> Well, everyday the number of males (and females) that follow me around to bathe in the aura of my exfoliated face increases.</li>
            <li> bit harsh for winter though</li>
            <li> and a few over my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I let it on for  about20 mins until it dried it  </li>
            <li> was a lil  itchy as it dried  in some parts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months</li>
            <li> I must be missing something here because I don&#x27;t get all the hype.</li>
            <li> messy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of the reviews and maybe I&#x27;m missing something</li>
            <li> It only made my anxiety and face picking worse...</li>
            <li> A few pointers...1.</li>
            <li> I have been using it everyday for over a week now</li>
            <li> I have been using it everyday for over a week now</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product and have already told a few friends about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> another item I bought to help skin and still have not used it  because I think it will be messy</li>
            <li> Cleared up my skin in a few days and a lot of people noticed.</li>
            <li> I knew I had a few that I wanted to draw out</li>
            <li> i used it everyday for a week and</li>
            <li> Topical medications from the dermatologist made my skin so much worse.</li>
            <li> I gave up the harsh medications and decided to use gentle/natural face products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not trough my 5th lbs and 2nd bottle of vinegar, and i apply it almost every day before going to bed unless i&#x27;m too tired to go trough</li>
            <li> this part is messy but it&#x27;s a shower.</li>
            <li> It gets rid of any dead skin and impurities and tightens my skin.</li>
            <li> I mixed the clay fairly thin and apply it on and around my nose and chin and rinse it off in the shower after it dries.</li>
            <li> I mix this with water and use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> i just wish it was not so messy.  </li>
            <li> then STILL you might walk around with some green patches that you missed.</li>
            <li> just dried up my skin.</li>
            <li> , my blackheads, my skin tone or texture, it did nothing except dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> I do notice the difference when I use it every 2 days or every 3 days(or even when I skip a few days).</li>
            <li> and I thought that actually dried out my skin a bit</li>
            <li> and it felt quite harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> and I thought that actually dried out my skin a bit</li>
            <li> and it felt quite harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> forward a few years, I started hearing rave reviews on this product.</li>
            <li> I debated for a few weeks regarding whether or not to buy this item.</li>
            <li> a bit messy to mix with water.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I do this everyday</li>
            <li> Messy, but seems to work well.</li>
            <li> Yes, the smell of the vinegar is harsh, but you get used to it after seeing your results.</li>
            <li> It is harsh for everyday use but depending on your skin type, you could get away with once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> But anyway, I used water &amp; a few drops of tea tree oil to mix my mask.</li>
            <li> The faint redness was completely gone by morning.</li>
            <li> threw it away and got some level 9 green cream and my forehead</li>
            <li> Messy.</li>
            <li> The last time, I used it was 2 weeks ago, and I stopped it after my skin is getting worse using this product.</li>
            <li> but it goes away in a few minutes after washing.</li>
            <li> Anyway, you can feel the difference using for few times..</li>
            <li> I used it once, and it made my current acne worse, I redness on my face that would not go away</li>
            <li> A few pros/cons though....</li>
            <li> It seems to keep the oiliness away for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given this product a few weeks</li>
            <li> My skin becomes noticeably clearer for a few days after use.</li>
            <li> Got this clay mask on the recommendation of a few friends who had used it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mask a few months ago</li>
            <li> I used to use this almost everyday till the pimples are gone now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few months,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a messy cleanup</li>
            <li> if anything I get worse acne the next day.  </li>
            <li> Too messy</li>

            <li> Add a few drops of aloe vera gel to my mask and tea tre oil</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit messy</li>
            <li> A few days ago I bought apple cider vinegar, and I tried to mix it with the vinegar today.</li>
            <li> Product arrived with seal broken, no inner seal, and product clearly missing from container.</li>
            <li> : Slather up your whole body with a thin solution of Aztec secret and apple cider vinegar.  </li>
            <li> messy, messy, messy and</li>
            <li> Simply put: any claims that this just pulls in toxins is scientifically false.</li>
            <li> The evil black head actually came out after a little coaxing which is a miracle because normally I have to get a facial for it to come out.  </li>
            <li> My face was a little stiff feeling&lt;</li>
            <li> I tried very expensive products to get rid of my acne, but my skin reacted very badly to salicylic acid (broke me out even more), benzoyl peroxide (very drying!)</li>
            <li> The long and cold New England winters drive my sensitive skin crazy</li>
            <li> it keeps the price way down, I&#x27;m not paying for the shipping of the heavy water!</li>
            <li> have very oily skin that is sensitive and prone to acne (blackheads, whiteheads, and very painful cystic acne).</li>
            <li> Also, it can be painful if you let it dry to long, especially if you apply a thinner layer towards the outer edges of your face/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22 with slight acne, theres always a few small bumps.  </li>
            <li> Then I got lazy and quit, because the mess is just such a hassle, but now my acne&#x27;s gotten a bit worse.  </li>
            <li> Then I got lazy and quit, because the mess is just such a hassle, but now my acne&#x27;s gotten a bit worse.  </li>
            <li> I found it to be very messy and everyone says not to put it down the drain</li>
            <li> (Not to mention, my pores are less noticeable!</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a miracle cure all, this stuff has done wonders for shrinking my pores and getting rid of black heads!  </li>
            <li> Four and a Half stars!</li>
            <li> Usually it takes 2-3 days for bites to look the way it does in less than 24 hours when using the clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this almost every night for the past week on my face, neck and chest for a half hour.</li>
            <li> and I can use less of the clay!</li>
            <li> I have not experienced some of the problems other users have commented on about clogging their sinks.  </li>
            <li> I found a helpful website about other uses for this clay and the foot detox, as weird as I thought it was, actually made me feel better-who knew!</li>
            <li> As I learned the hard way, do not let the little dried pieces go down the sink, as it will get clogged.</li>
            <li> This product says that it is clay and it is, so when you mix with the apple cider, please put on a thin layer, not thick because if you put it on to thick like I did, you will have a hard time washing it off.</li>
            <li> My husband had a sore on his knee that was infected, it was surrounded by very pink skin and it was hard underneath.  </li>
            <li> Every time I get a breakout, a rash or a bug bite, I sprinkle a little of the powder into the lid of the container and swirl it around with either some water, some aloe vera juice, or apple cider vinegar, and apply it to my skin with either a finger tip or a small fan brush and it soaks up the problem in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I was honestly not even going to write a review because my praise is just going to get lost among the other 4,000 reviews on this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit of a pain and a mess mixing it up every time you want to use a mask, so I just make a small batch and stick it in a jar in my fridge to use when I need to.  </li>
            <li> the other reviewer complained that it wrinkled her face - that didn&#x27;t happen to me...</li>
            <li> I struggle with the occasional blemish here and there but the past few months my skin suffered from poor diet and stress.</li>
            <li> I have had annoying acne over the last 7 years, my forehead would never clear up entirely.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slowly bringing up and out all my other whiteheads.  </li>
            <li> Especially after a long day at work, I felt like my skin would look horrible and ready to be washed.</li>
            <li> It was a bit awkward at first because you can hardly move your face...</li>
            <li> just with the plain water my face was squeaking-</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t find plain rosewater</li>
            <li> When you mix this with water your face will freeze and become so stiff.</li>
            <li> I mix the clay with a couple of drips of Braggs ACV, or even just plain water.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it as a face mask with both Bragg&#x27;s ACV and just plain water.</li>
            <li> the raw apple cider vinegar, just order them together and don&#x27;t waste your time without it.</li>
            <li> I add 1 cup to a bath from time to time and use a few tablespoons with organic raw apple cider vinegar as a face mask (instructions on label).</li>
            <li> always go overboard when I first get a new skincare product, and it happened to backfire really terribly in this case.</li>
            <li> I have seen a dramatic difference in my skin using the mask in combination with a regular skin program.</li>
            <li> So, you might have some bad breakouts after the first few masks, since it brings all that gunk to the surface.</li>
            <li> I saw a dramatic difference after only one use.</li>
            <li> Feels weird and cool, sometimes uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> all you have to do is mix a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and a small amount of clay mixed to a thin paste...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 21 years old and its like I hit teenage puberty again :(</li>
            <li> Very slight redness.</li>
            <li> I usually apply a thin layer since a thicker layer takes forever to wash off and it gives me similar results.</li>
            <li> I also spritz a bit of Heritage Rosewater spray into the mixture to help tame my redness.</li>
            <li> but it worked on the few little spots I get!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit difficult to rinse back off (pay attention to other reviews that recommend rinsing in the kitchen sink!)</li>
            <li> I usually buy those little packs of masks hanging on the end of the makeup isle in Walmart.</li>
            <li> Same goes for if you are for example a Moderate acne sufferer but a level 3, you may not be so bad to the point of being a Severe acne sufferer, but in the Moderate stage you are still worse than others.</li>
            <li> I make mine a little on the thin side, but still thick enough &amp;#34;so</li>
            <li> I broke down and bought this as well as some Apple Cider Vinegar, the raw mother!</li>
            <li> Despite this and having a strict cleansing and make-up regime I have continued to be plagued with black heads, weird white heads living beneath my skin, too-frequent pimples, and of course the scarring and hyperpigmentation from the cysts.</li>
            <li> But not the harsh and irritating type of dry.</li>
            <li> I use the organic raw apple cider vinegar, but I&#x27;ve used plain water too.</li>
            <li> and it makes your skin really tight!</li>
            <li> Face tight!  </li>
            <li> thats when things start to feel really tight!</li>
            <li> Our faces became tight and began to pulsate!</li>
            <li> Makes  your face really  tight!</li>
            <li> Really tight!.</li>
            <li> My face feels really tight and I can&#x27;t move it!</li>
            <li> It was so intense, I did feel sick and had to lay down for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> This stuff right here cut down my rosacea, skin-peeling, those under-the-skin acne-bumps that are annoying as hell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time I didn&#x27;t have too bad of a reaction.</li>
            <li> This broke me out pretty bad.</li>
            <li> I over shot badly the first time, so ended up wasting quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I just did the mask for the first time, having a slightly bad nose and a couple of pimples on my cheek.</li>
            <li> I had pretty bad blackheads on both of my cheeks and the clay</li>
            <li> I am 21 and still have pretty bad acne along the hollows of my cheeks and along my forehead.</li>
            <li> made me break out pretty bad.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my first time buying the clay mask on amazon, but I&#x27;ve been using it for two years now and never had an bad experiences with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my first time buying the clay mask on amazon, but I&#x27;ve been using it for two years now and never had an bad experiences with it.</li>
            <li> I am in the midst of a pretty bad breakout, and</li>
            <li> I had pretty bad acne and this reeeeaalllyyy helped in the process of clearing my skin up.</li>
            <li> My skin first itched really badly</li>
            <li> First off, I want to point out all the people who gave bad reviews.</li>
            <li> read all the reviews before I purchased the product, I thought it would really help, but it was all the way around, it actually brings all the bad stuff to the surface, but that&#x27;s all, it doesn&#x27;t eliminate it!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it was so burny and painful</li>
            <li> , is that it was pretty painful for me to remove the mask.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was completely shocked how much my skin was glowing!  </li>
            <li> took me long than 30 minutes coz of the thin consistency.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews and especially not in so much detail, but this stuff helped me, so why not share the experience and hopefully help someone else...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered Magick Botanicals Coso Green Clay again which I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay, is not food grade, and for external use only.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay, is not food grade, and for external use only.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so relaxing that I usually fall asleep within a few minutes of application.</li>
            <li> I finally found something that helped my annoying, adult acne!</li>
            <li> You also do get a bit of redness around your face, but once you wash the clay off it&#x27;s usually gone after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Still skeptical, I tried the mask for a third time, this time only putting on thin layer.</li>
            <li> Your skin can become an angry red mess.  </li>
            <li> For the past few months I was suffering from cystic acne on my chin</li>
            <li> A day or two after using this I did break out with a few small bumps</li>
            <li> this stuff is hard, thick and dry!</li>
            <li> The past few months have been horible.</li>
            <li> It makes your face feel tight and you can really tell that it&#x27;s sucking bad toxins out of your skin.</li>
            <li> Once a week I give myself a clay facial, as the clay is drying it pulls the face really tight and it feels somewhat uncomfortable</li>
            <li> So normally when I get a bad break out and it takes a few weeks to get rid of it, this stuff always brings that down to a week tops.</li>
            <li> It can be a little bit messy and hard to mix sometimes</li>
            <li> I can feel the oil being sucked out, because as this clay dries it gets tight, if you leave it on too long it gets tight and itchy and really uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it can be VERY mess and clogs drains</li>
            <li> Truth be told, this one is a little uncomfortable, especially if you leave it on longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually have this small silicone bowl and a brush to mix them and the little measuring spoons of course.</li>
            <li> And as a result, I hardly felt the need to scratch it - therefore I damaged my skin less.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was hard to mix, but I think that I put less water and it turned out to be clumpy</li>
            <li> People posting reviews and saying &amp;#34;not a miracle product&amp;#34; are just impatient and comparable to people that live a sedentary lifestyle and get mad when they aren&#x27;t skinny after working out twice.</li>
            <li> If it says use raw apple cider vinegar and/or water, then get RAW acv and/or water.</li>
            <li> I mix it 1/1 with raw apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> I just use any apple cider vinegar not just raw apple cider one.</li>
            <li> The trick is to use the product with RAW apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> I used Braggs Raw Apple Cider Vinegar from the Vitamin Shoppe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I immediately tried it with raw apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> being said, I also purchased this with the Bragg raw Apple Cider from Amazon and was also pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it with the Braggs raw apple cider vinegar and water.</li>
            <li> i switch to raw apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li> I use it with the raw apple cider vinegar,  </li>
            <li> You can either use raw apple cider vinegar or water OR both</li>
            <li> I mix it with Raw unfilitered apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> I had a mixture of the clay and raw organic Apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> and I use it with raw Apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> I use it with raw unrefined apple cider vinegar with &amp;#34;the mother&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> , I did not have raw AC vinegar</li>
            <li> I used organic raw apple cider vinegar as suggested.</li>
            <li> I used this with raw apple cider vinegar in hopes it would get rid of my blackheads, but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been mixing the mask with raw organic apple cider vinegar as the directions suggest.</li>
            <li> the formula I do: 1 tablespoon clay mix 1 tablespoon RAW Apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> Used with organic raw apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> I used raw apple cider vinegar and</li>
            <li> raw</li>
            <li> got mine today still waiting on the raw acv</li>
            <li> and I use this with raw apple cider vinegar.  </li>
            <li> This stuff coupled with the raw apple cider vinegar is a god send.</li>
            <li> I use it with Bragg&#x27;s raw apple cider vinegar.  </li>
            <li> Use with raw apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> mix a spoonful of clay powder with a spoonful of raw, unfiltered apple cider vinegar in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t try it again, but I decided to buy raw ACV (Bragg Brand--</li>
            <li> I mix it with raw apple cider vinegar.  </li>
            <li> I then switched to leaving it on for a maximum of 5 minutes but it still leaves my skin feeling raw.</li>

            <li> I use it with the Bragg Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar.</li>
            <li> Use raw apple cider vinegar to mix with the clay.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyone who tries this and still has bad skin must have other physical issues going on.</li>
            <li> It does feel like you face is burning and the clay as it dries gets very tight on your face.</li>
            <li> It does feel very tight and pulsate as it claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, it got very tight.</li>
            <li> , your skin becomes very tight.  </li>
            <li> Any time I&#x27;ve added too little water and tried to add more, it clumps very badly and its totally ridiculous, impossible to deal with and it will make you want to throw the whole unused jar</li>
            <li> , what works for me may not work for you and not necessarily means it&#x27;s a bad product, it only means; you have to try something else.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I mixed it with apple cider vinegar, the smell was so bad and spread to the entire room;</li>
            <li> Deep, red, painful acne appearing all over the face.</li>
            <li> And even though I read that your face may be red after you remove it, I was still shocked to see how red!!</li>
            <li> My only problem is that it&#x27;s extremely messy and a difficult texture.</li>
            <li> So I was so frustrated after trying even more expensive cleansers and creams and medicines that all promised to help.  </li>
            <li> I was getting painful cystic acne especially on the left side.</li>
            <li> Washing it off is a little uncomfortable because it&#x27;s so rock hard by the end of the 20 mins...and it leaves your face a little red...</li>
            <li> You do not have to glop it on half an inch thick for it to work.</li>
            <li> I have used mask after mask looking for something to help me with my confused skin, oily at the cheeks and forehead but dry at the nose.</li>
            <li> A thin solution will dry faster and not overzap your skin.  </li>
            <li> Mix the clay with some water to make a thin paste then let it dry up.</li>
            <li> My advice would be to apply a thin layer (1/8\\&quot; or so) so that it would dry quicker and enable pulsing.</li>
            <li> super annoying.</li>
            <li> since I got it a couple weeks ago, followed by a rub down with jojoba oil and have had no more breakouts!</li>
            <li> I realize the lumps don&#x27;t interfere with the effectiveness, but they just irritated me (probably because I am a little OCD!)</li>
            <li> and I can tell it does halp a little bit !</li>
            <li> I just used a little bit of my roommate&#x27;s tub of this and let me tell you that you need to try this stuff!</li>
            <li> I live in a highly polluted and humid city that is terrible for my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dries to hard and tight that it sort of feels</li>
            <li> this is the least amount of mess.</li>
            <li> I have used other clay masks and have not experienced severe itching although I did experience a little when it began to tighten.  </li>
            <li> I was initially very skeptical about trying something like this because I&#x27;m your typical 30+ year old man.</li>
            <li> A little hard to mix.</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to mix it up</li>
            <li> and it is a little hard to mix the powder everagely.for the effection</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to mix into a creamy paste with just water.</li>
            <li> A Minor acne sufferer with a level 3 may have worse acne than a minor level 1 and 2, but not as bad as one who would be listed in the Moderate acne stage.</li>
            <li> I mean seriously I could put loose change in some of them.</li>
            <li> The next morning my skin felt tight and clean but my cheeks looked like it&#x27;s been sunburned, or healing from a bad bad bruising incident.  </li>
            <li> for my pores, I have large pores and I have scars from a bad trip to dermotologist.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60 and live where it&#x27;s very cold and very dry.  </li>
            <li> You will smell a little bit like vinegar for a while (or at least I think so, and I think maybe this is just a teeny bit of residual masque in my hairline?).  </li>

            <li> I had very little acne but broke out on my chin and jaw with blackheads.</li>
            <li> VERY little in the morning</li>
            <li> very little is required to create a mask.</li>
            <li> I had very little redness -gone in 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I used the apple cider vinegar and made it a little thick.</li>
            <li> One day, I noticed that I started getting very little pimple or some sort on my forehead.</li>
            <li> It has seriously calmed down my raging acne.</li>
            <li> --it gets super dry, eczema, rashes, the worst.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t just wash it off your face and down the drain because it will seriously clog your drain</li>
            <li> No more secret indian healing clay for this chick.o have cystic like acne popping up on the side of my face and it is still very dry like sandpaper today.</li>
            <li> my face felt less oily, and less full with nasty gunk.</li>
            <li> it dried hard and cracked all over..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall-good product; just messy and hard to get off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s messy and Hard to get off</li>
            <li> I got this for detox and cleansing but its so messy its hard to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The green hard crusty one that you mix yourself.  </li>
            <li> But since I&#x27;ve popped open my Aztec Clay, no more oily skin and no more enlarged pores!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like I was expecting a miracle product, but at the very least, I was expecting at least minor improvements over the course of a month.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little uncomfortable once the drying starts.</li>
            <li> Whenever I get an unpleasant and always unexpected pimple, I put a little of this on as a spot treatment mixed with some apple cider vinegar and it brings it to a head without fail.</li>
            <li> I am 25 and a really don&#x27;t get any bad breakouts.</li>
            <li> although, i dont really have bad skin</li>
            <li> it really shows how bad my acne has been.</li>
            <li> it really shows how bad my acne has been.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too bad, I get zits every once and awhile, the real problem is the acne scars.</li>
            <li> and i suffer from bad acne this really helps like in the 1st week</li>
            <li> I took before and after pictures and was shocked at how much my blemishes had improved after one use.</li>
            <li> im not sure</li>
            <li> I walked past a mirror and caught a glimpse of myself and was startled.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the hype is about with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I tried this for the past three months</li>
            <li> Although I never made a clay mask before I also bought the homemade clay small mix bowl.</li>
            <li> I used my usual mint julep  </li>
            <li> a bunch at once and put the remainder in a small Tupperware.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll finish it up, but not sure I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Go ahead and buy a small bottle.</li>
            <li> I usually just watch a show on netflix while doing it.</li>
            <li> but I get lazy and it time consuming to mix it with the Apple cider vinger.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> not sure just used it once.</li>
            <li> So if you are reading this, put a small plate/bowl under it to avoid waste/spillage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dried the pimples up!</li>
            <li> but now I&#x27;m a firm believer !</li>
            <li> my acne has not magically vanished.&lt;br /&gt;I think its misleading to tell people that you will see an automatic change in your skin.</li>
            <li> Too Harsh!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure if this helps or hurts.</li>
            <li> This usually appears around my jaw line to the end of where my ear ends.</li>
            <li> I used a small spoonful of clay with a small amount of apple cider vinegar and then water.</li>
            <li> will try to update this post as often as possible to let you all know if I am seeing any progress being made with my troubled skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s NOT MAGIC.</li>
            <li> It was a bit difficult to get off and it did leave my skin quite red afterwards</li>
            <li> However, even after extractions, they are never able to get all of the dirt out of my pores.</li>
            <li> I could almost feel my acne getting dried up!</li>
            <li> Wrong proportion will influence the ph of the final paste you end up with.</li>
            <li> “This is the usual case.</li>
            <li> And I started to get small bumps all over my cheeks which I never had acne before.</li>
            <li> My pores, which can usually be seen from space, were invisible.</li>
            <li> Being the skeptic that I am I anxiously awaited for the arrival of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purging my oily skin with this mask for the past 10 years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used Earth Therapeutics Cleansing Strips afterwards that I had also ordered off Amazon, but I&#x27;m not sure if they were as helpful as this clay.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the item left me with bumps all over my face.  </li>
            <li> the small amount of leftover in the bowl</li>
            <li> My usual routine hasn&#x27;t been working as well as I&#x27;d like, so I&#x27;ve been scouting the internet for newer products to try using.</li>
            <li> I usually have cystic hormonal acne on my cheeks and neck.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old, whose hormones are crazy in this stage of her life, uses this mask twice a week.  </li>
            <li> Since I too tend to have cystic acne, I immediately mix a small amount of the clay/water and place on the problem area.</li>
            <li> Yes I am that lazy.</li>
            <li> Try a small amount, and use oil to mix it instead of water.</li>
            <li> Once the clay dries you will feel small pulsations as it is pulling toxins out of your skin.</li>
            <li> Unbelievably so.</li>
            <li> i feel like i just got a facial at an expensive and over priced salon....</li>
            <li> Usually those pore strips leave something to be desired for me.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it work.</li>
            <li> I was honestly pretty disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it even works for what it is intended for since I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes.</li>
            <li> I usually get cystic pimples on my temples, hairline, chin, or side of my nose.</li>
            <li> Okay this stuff gave me the worst allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> but I sure have terrible skin)</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if anyone is going to read this one, but for a face mask &amp;</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not an overnight miracle &amp; I&#x27;ve been using it for the past month now.</li>
            <li> Looks small</li>
            <li> I have recommended this to a few people already!</li>
            <li> This is not your usual mask.  </li>
            <li> I cannot believe how well this thing works, I usually don&#x27;t write any reviews but this product deserves it.</li>
            <li> and...it&#x27;s only $10, how could you go WRONG?</li>
            <li> and I looked like an alien from out of space).  </li>
            <li> and I usually end up running to the bathroom to rinse it off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> So; I have been using this every morning for the past 5 days now.</li>
            <li> For Anyone Insecure About Their Facial Features.</li>
            <li> I suggest a zippy and usually add 3 times the amount of water to the amount of clay.</li>
            <li> It does bring impurities to the surface so some may experience a breakout, but I&#x27;d say not many people will.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The &#x27;pulling&#x27; sensation they mention in the description is actually sort of uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> next time do not put a label on the english instructions. :(</li>
            <li> I mix the product with apple cidar vinegar and a small amount of water.  </li>
            <li> , I usually try to cover up but the sun still has had adverse effects on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t be disappointed if it doesn&#x27;t work the first time.</li>
            <li> I am going to attempt to use a small portion of each after reading the reviews but my tip to the seller... put your advertising stickers</li>
            <li> My daughter has been picking her skin for past 6 years, even though she has no acne.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t usually get pimples on my forehead.</li>
            <li> usually use the mask two times a week and leave it on for 10 - 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have also tried the home made remedies with ur usual kitchen ingredients.</li>
            <li> im not sure if it works as well with water, but you can try it out for yourself).</li>
            <li> Absolutely unbelievable, puffiness and droop GONE.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband had something weird and very gross looking on his face.  </li>
            <li> , I usually use it every 3-4 days depending on how my skin feels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling skin issues for the past two years.</li>
            <li> When she past away I did not know where to get it.</li>
            <li> Next time ill order 10 lbs.</li>
            <li> However, after 2 months, my faith was crushed and I realized it was still getting worse (not even leveling).</li>
            <li> usually 20-40 min.</li>
            <li> :/  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about this yet.  </li>
            <li> I am using this as a tooth powder along with a few drops of OraWellnes!</li>
            <li> I finally found an expensive product that works (Elemis Cellular Recovery Skin Capsules.)  </li>
            <li> not sure</li>
            <li> I have had blackheads for 5 years and was not able to take them out.</li>
            <li> I switched out with willard water and still not impressed by the clay deep cleansing my pores.</li>
            <li> stuff is messy though!  </li>
            <li> used it once and it cleared up my face within a few days!</li>
            <li> But, as I&#x27;ve said, my mind has yet to be blown by it :/</li>
            <li> I also noticed two small pimples on my chin</li>
            <li> I bought it for my consistent acne use and haven&#x27;t been disappointed.</li>
            <li> But it still gives me allergic reactions, so I usually have to take medicines before using it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure about it healing acne.</li>
            <li> I usually use 1 tablespoon of the clay mix, and 2 tablespoons of the apple cider vinegar, and there is still leftovers.</li>
            <li> I usually wash my face before, put it on for 10-15 mins &amp; then use a toner after I wash it off.</li>
            <li> In the past I used the Queen Helen mint julep mask, but this stuff tightens x10.</li>
            <li> I tested it on a small area of my face before I used it</li>
            <li> It seems like it works, but it is too inconvenient to use frequently.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure how well it will work for your acne; but</li>
            <li> I like it as it call to mix with vinegar in a small dish.</li>
            <li> I watched a few YouTube video tutorials on how to mix it/apply it and let me tell you, it was helpful!</li>
            <li> Wish i could use it everyday!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t mind buying from 3rd parties as long as it&#x27;s processed and delivered by Amazon, of course my item arrived as described and on time.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, don&#x27;t be shocked</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, for at least a few hours aftyer using this</li>
            <li> but i do recoment for you to use small amounts since it will be a lot for your face and also using a moisturizer after you take it off since it can be drying for your face</li>
            <li> this powder substance is so messy!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been the only thing to help reduce the random breakouts I get.</li>
            <li> It does get messy and you have to lay it on thick</li>
            <li> Not really sure why everyone loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> so I leave it no more than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I usually use avacodo oil as moisturizer.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not really sure how i feel. .</li>
            <li> and I get small breakouts with the weather changing, or before my period.</li>
            <li> prompt delivery, as usual by Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Usually 25-30 min then rinse .</li>
            <li> I purchased this initially because I suddenly sprouted terrible acne on my chest, shoulders, and back.</li>
            <li> My husband had terrible back acne and asks me to scratch his back daily.</li>
            <li> I use a bit of non alcoholic mouthwash after to kill any taste and make my breath minty</li>
            <li> I switched to a tea-tree based cleaner (with a small silicone scrubbing pad for exfoliation) from The Body Shop, every evening.</li>
            <li> I usually do it twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get small acne,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it the past 3 nights</li>
            <li> /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t dreadful, but it&#x27;s not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it is doing</li>
            <li> I usually follow up with acne lotion.</li>
            <li> I felt a small amount of pulsing , not tingling .</li>
            <li> Antibiotic cream can also be used as &amp;#34;spot treatment&amp;#34; after ordinary face washing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i attempted to mix it with water in a small bowl, then apply it to my face and let it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;why</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it almost every day for the past 10 days</li>
            <li> (( I used it 3 times for the past two weeks,  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used this product twice in the past week</li>
            <li> no more whiteheads but...</li>
            <li> not satisfied with results.</li>
            <li> I would recomend mixing the product with apple cider vinegar and in a small sandwhich bag.</li>
            <li> The blackheads on my nose have reduced and the breakouts on my chin dried up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a ton of expensive face masks, but now I only buy Indian healing clay!</li>
            <li> I was constantly anxious about my skin.</li>
            <li> Then like 5 minutes later my face was completely unable to move at all.</li>
            <li> Only thing is it will draw out all your underneath pimples \\&quot;impurities\\&quot; at first.but ill</li>
            <li> The zit disappears in 1-2 days rather than the usual 4-5 days.</li>
            <li> My pores are thankfully small already</li>
            <li> My face has seemed uneven in tone lately, blotchy, and was breaking out.</li>
            <li> i usually mix it with water</li>
            <li> I have noticed some reduction in the depth and redness of my hormonal cyctic acne scars and I did not break out as I usually would this</li>
            <li> I do get small ones every now and</li>
            <li> I do get small ones every now and</li>
            <li> I mix mine with organic apple vinegar in a small bowl.</li>
            <li> , I bought it and anxiously waited for my mud miracle to arrive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unbelievable product.  </li>
            <li> It can be a hassle to make and sometimes I just get too lazy to mix it and skip some weeks.</li>
            <li> My small pimples under my chin went away...</li>
            <li> Maani, I am also a college student - female, 19, minor level 3 acne, frustrated.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it will display my email or not,</li>
            <li> I checked it after 20 minutes and removed a small area.</li>
            <li> no more chemicals on my face</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used it once a week for the past 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I usually like to use this healing clay on my days off.</li>
            <li> :S</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> (i usually wash my face during this time).</li>
            <li> /&gt;ATTENTION: This product it MESSY!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used plenty of mud masks in the past, and even ones that are tingly.</li>
            <li> After the mask I usually put on some hydrating mask.</li>
            <li> i usually use queen Helene as my mask.</li>
            <li> A small tub of this stuff has lasted me 3 weeks now</li>
            <li> : Messy!</li>
            <li> sensation, I have small blackheads on my nose</li>
            <li> So, I decided not to waste money and treat my skin myself and fortunatelly I got results!</li>
            <li> It is sometimes difficult to remove and you have to be careful that the remnants do not go down the sink.</li>
            <li> I am a 27 year old female who still gets pimples, but once I become super stressed I break out horribly and get cystic acne that is of course painful.</li>
            <li> I was afraid he was going to get upset since essential oils gives off a slight burning feeling</li>
            <li> What I do is either mix it with apple cider vinegar or plain water into a thick paste.</li>
            <li> It is also very messy to put on and take off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very messy when making the mixture because you have to mix powder with liquid</li>
            <li> It is very messy, but cleans up well.  </li>
            <li> I also have a very uneven skin tone and an oily face.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness for that because this stuff is clay &amp; very messy.</li>
            <li> but, its very messy to mix.</li>
            <li> It is very messy</li>
            <li> Like it, but its very messy.</li>
            <li> I mixed the clay powder with apple cider vinegar as directed and applied a very thin layer to my face.</li>
            <li> It is very messy.  </li>
            <li> But very messy.</li>
            <li> They helped only temporarily and I&#x27;m very tired of all this.</li>
            <li> product is affordable and less expensive than all the other acne treatment products I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> I know, it sounds weird and unpasturized and will it go bad, but no, you are fine.  </li>
            <li> It did not work and made a real mess anywhere you use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit confused by the extreme reviews for this product.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I had to get used to was that it pulls your skin so tight as it dries that it&#x27;s a little painful.</li>
            <li> So I recommend this, particularly if you have bad skin.</li>
            <li> I have been realizing that the blackheads on my nose and chin were getting worse, and my face always felt dirty, no matter how much I cleaned it.</li>
            <li> I did lot of research about bentonite clay and figured it out that calcium based bentonite is for internal use and sodium base bentonite is for external use</li>
            <li> I use a small ceramic bowl, add about a tablespoon of the powder and slowly add small amounts of water while stirring.</li>
            <li> Seriously this stuff does not do anything, I used it a few times and threw it in the garbage.</li>
            <li> It is a bit difficult to rinse off and messy if you are not being careful</li>
            <li> so I would go crazy and try products such as this one, everyday.</li>
            <li> the absolute worst break out in my entire life.</li>
            <li> but I had about 5 active pimples that I refused to pop because they&#x27;d end up four times worse</li>
            <li> I am so sad, for some weird reason this makes my face break our really bad,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Turns out it is a serious heavy metal detox in the body.  </li>
            <li> It even almost fully healed an acne wound I had on my left cheek from where I stupidly picked at a zit last week.</li>
            <li> and they never really bother me since they just came and went but these painful ones were totally different.</li>
            <li> When I use this at night, I find that any active acne has significantly decreased in size and redness by morning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rinsing off the product is much more difficult than the product I was comparing it to and was annoyingly stubborn.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dry skin that is insanely flaky, so after I clean the mask off I just apply a thick coat of Look, No X Ma! cream.  </li>
            <li> Also, it is very hard to mix to a smoothe paste, and on the last time that I used it I resorted to a hand mixer, thinking that I might be missing something by mixing wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad acne since my freshman year of high school.</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously like a black hole for the face!</li>
            <li> It is NOT easy!</li>
            <li> My only real complaint is how hard it is to take off!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t blame this clay for my failure on that endeavor, but it DOES turn your armpits green, at least while you&#x27;re wearing it.</li>
            <li> My younger sister who suffers from horrible acne started using it, I&#x27;m hoping she has the same positive experience that I&#x27;ve had from using this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have bad skin, normal blemish-free face.</li>
            <li> I have normal to oily skin, my pores before using this weren&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t miss the flavoring/sweeteners as artificial sweeteners generally used</li>
            <li> mask dried and pulled our skin so taut that we were literally unable to speak to each other within 10 min.</li>
            <li> It was longer than this one, really &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> would have given this product 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t itch so much :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather thick, I usually put it on in the morning before I shower.</li>
            <li> I take my Olay cleansing brush, add a small amount of water, and slowly remove the rest of the mask, then I wrap up the plastic bag, throw it away and nothing has clogged my drain.</li>
            <li> I have PCOS and have horrible hormonal acne, you know the kind that is giant painful oil bumps that never pop?</li>
            <li> I take a small mixing bowl and measure out a few spoons of the mask and a small teaspoon of Bragg&#x27;s Apple Cider Vinegar &amp; a tad bit of water, I mix it all up until I get a thicker consistensy ( I prefer a thicker mask then a thin layer ).  </li>
            <li> It is very messy and hard to come off.</li>
            <li> Maybe it would work for others, but I have black heads and white heads that are impossible to get rid of.  </li>
            <li> While in treatment, I was tired and looked run down.</li>
            <li> I put a THIN layer on my face and sat down to watch tv.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be torn down by the poor ratings...</li>
            <li> This past Sunday, I woke up covered (and I mean COVERED) with a rash + pimples all over my face.  </li>
            <li> but when I breakout it gets pretty bad and irritating.</li>
            <li> Although I was skeptical and feared it would irritate or dry out my skin, I gave it a try.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does feel kinda weird when it starts to dry</li>
            <li> You have to rinse this off with a wash cloth because near to impossible to get off.</li>
            <li> sometimes the dry clay just clot and makes it difficult to apply on the face.</li>
            <li> (so there are clumps, which makes it difficult to spread on your skin) and it will dry out your skin</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s crazy and would never dry.</li>
            <li> When I get one of those painful, bad pimples in the middle of my forehead, I heat up my face with hot water, mix 2 spoonfuls of this with apple cider vinegar, and dab it onto my face.</li>
            <li> my skin has not reacted like when I&#x27;ve used other masks in the past-which would be getting heavy breakouts due to \\&quot;bringing up the bad stuff\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Store masks are harsh and have lots of unknown crap in it that is not natural.</li>
            <li> Soon as i got this stuff and my raw apple cider vinegar, BAM!</li>
            <li> Less than ten dollars, not that bad, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the rundown</li>
            <li> Having used premixed clay masks for years, I always became frustrated with how they would dry up over time, some seemed to harder as soon as the lid was taken off</li>
            <li> So super messy that its disgusting to use.</li>
            <li> I usually leave it on for 20 minutes - not longer, because the ACV can irritate the skin and cause serious damage, as well.</li>
            <li> We all know how hard blackheads are to get rid of.</li>
            <li> hard to use, clumpy, powder everywhere</li>
            <li> It was clumpy and hard to use.</li>
            <li> but I do have acne spots from being hard headed and popping them ...</li>
            <li> This stuff is extremely hard to get off like that.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s hard to say -</li>
            <li> The mask was hard.</li>
            <li> My mom is a tom boy in a way, so its hard to sell her on any beauty product, where as I will rub pig blood on my face if you told me it would work...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had nasty white heads and black heads since middle school.</li>
            <li> Males - this mask is hard to take off, if you are patient then go for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use a glass bowl to mix and wash out the remaining product before it gets too hard.</li>
            <li> It is slippery and at times hard to work with.</li>
            <li> :  Because it&#x27;s powdered clay, it&#x27;s hard to mix.  </li>
            <li> It is REALLY hard to get out of your eyebrows and hairline.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Taking it off wasn&#x27;t too hard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Taking it off wasn&#x27;t too hard.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s so hard to mix it with water.  </li>
            <li> but I hardly read the directions</li>
            <li> The consistency is hard to master, but I&#x27;ll get it eventually.</li>
            <li> but they told me that they have a hard time keeping it in stock.  </li>
            <li> It a bit hard to describe.</li>
            <li> so I hardly ever wear makeup.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to remove the mask  -</li>
            <li> They suggest a consistency on the jar, but it&#x27;s so hard to know what they&#x27;re talking about.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit hard to mix, it likes to be chunky.</li>
            <li> However, I feel it does make face look dull for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> and if you rub too hard it could lead to a abrasion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to mix.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe the sensation.</li>
            <li> hard to apply on face.</li>
            <li> try applying water to your face for a bit before taking it off so that you don&#x27;t have to scrub too hard.</li>
            <li> I cant believe how hard the mask gets on your face -</li>
            <li> The mixing part is a little tedious and the smell of the apple cider vinegar gets a little getting used to, but that&#x27;s why it states you can use water as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hard to tell because I didn&#x27;t do before/after photos.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it with the apple cider vinegar yet but it formed a hard mask that pulled my skin and was a bit itchy towards the end of it.</li>
            <li> an oil to the mixture if it&#x27;s overdrying or too hard to take off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Metal makes the clay clump up and makes it hard to apply to your face.</li>
            <li> This has to be caused by this face-mask since I hardly ever got zits around my mouth before</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to resist.</li>
            <li> It was hard to get it to not be clumpy but that didn&#x27;t seem to be a problem.</li>
            <li> It helps with any pimples or dull skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a hard time taking it off at all.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time keeping it out of my hair -- another reason to avoid using this mask before going out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this mask whenever I feel like my skin is dull or when I am breaking out and it has done wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li> While it does work with water, it&#x27;s clumpy and hard to mix.</li>
            <li> You can crush an aspirin into the mask as well for hard to heal acne.</li>
            <li> You can crush an aspirin into the mask as well for hard to heal acne.</li>
            <li> Wash after 15 minutes or it will be really hard to wash off as it hardens and might need to scrape off with your nails.</li>
            <li> I also found that it is really hard to mix something without metal being involved.</li>
            <li> It gets ridiculously hard and has done TONS for my acne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to truly rate this product, because it did not stop the blackheads from coming.</li>
            <li> and I always end up getting some in my hair no matter how hard I try not to.  </li>
            <li> Hard to mix on put evenly on your face.</li>
            <li> The instructions say you can use water or vinegar, I chose water and had a hard time mixing and getting rid of the clumps.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just really hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> it drys hard -like</li>
            <li> hardly use it</li>
            <li> It is a little frustrating to use because it doesn&#x27;t come in a ready-to-use mask form.</li>
            <li> Some stuff worked a little, others made it worse.</li>
            <li> Mixing is a little unappealing because I like no fuss cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who suffers from Acne!</li>
            <li> My face got a little red afterwards but not too bad...</li>
            <li> It is nothing bad; it just looks like you got a little sun, no big deal.  </li>
            <li> It is nothing bad; it just looks like you got a little sun, no big deal.  </li>
            <li> It does leave my face a little red for 20-30 minutes afterward, but not too bad</li>
            <li> Only bad because it hurts a little, like it&#x27;s pulling your face.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint about it is that it dries ROCK hard</li>
            <li> , It is really hard to find it around, at least here in VA.</li>
            <li> , i decided to tough it out this time though and leave it on my face for an entire 15 mins, i fanned my face with a piece of paper to relieve the uncomfortable itching sensation.</li>
            <li> I am sometimes a little red the next day but nothing terrible.</li>
            <li> All I&#x27;ve said so far is how bad I was at using the clay.</li>
            <li> My friend who has bad acne used it for a week and his face began to clear up</li>
            <li> I have really bad adult acne that cinsists of blackheads, whiteheads, and cystic acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for nearly a month and continued using it because I thought, hey, maybe it&#x27;s just lifting all the bad stuff and cleansing blah blah blah</li>
            <li> Huge, horrible pimples that weren&#x27;t there before</li>
            <li> I have always had really bad blackheads on my nose and chin and this has cleared my skin completely.</li>
            <li> I would say at least try it</li>
            <li> Exfoliate once a week for delicate skin.</li>
            <li> Exfoliate once a week for delicate skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 30s and suffer from cystic acne, scars, and skin discoloration...</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my sister after staying up late reading lots of reviews.</li>
            <li> and I leave it on for at least an hour.</li>
            <li> Over the years iv spent hundreds on failed products ranging from proactiv all the way too Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder.</li>
            <li> the clay, as disgusting as this may sound, but hey, isn&#x27;t this why we&#x27;re all here?</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m not one for writing reviews.</li>
            <li> (water doesn&#x27;t work as well) and apply to my skin at least once a week.</li>
            <li> &amp; I mix at least 10-12 uses in it rather than do it every time I want to use it.</li>
            <li> My younger cousin that suffers from acne has used it and has noticed her breakouts decreasing.</li>
            <li> and she hasn&#x27;t gotten any negative reaction</li>
            <li> It really sucks on my face and pulses.</li>
            <li> Some items have helped temporarily or reduced their appearance under makeup, at least until everything is washed off.</li>
            <li> My cheeks are inflamed and honestly I do not like the bumps feeling &amp; redness on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling a lot with my skin lately.</li>
            <li> I put it on his face last night and he said it was crazy because it started draining after he took it off</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s as if it&#x27;s squeezing my face and letting all my dirt and oils and icky stuff into the clay so it can harden</li>
            <li> At least it feels like it.</li>
            <li> but I try to use it at least 5-6 days a week.</li>
            <li> The apple cider vinegar recommended in reviewed smelled nasty, burned, and didn&#x27;t work any better or worse.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been breaking out like crazy recently, and saw this on my recommended list, and after reading the reviews, I decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> When i finally got it on my face it itched like crazy.</li>
            <li> All I would advise is to give it at least 2 weeks to see what type of results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost 5 years at least on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> To maintain the look on my skin I needed to do it at least twice a week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to start saying it \\&quot;sucks everything from your pores!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it is something that happens overnight (at least not for me) from just doing the mask but a combination of activities in conjunction with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it is something that happens overnight (at least not for me) from just doing the mask but a combination of activities in conjunction with this.    </li>
            <li> Especially for women who&#x27;s skin has gone crazy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to start cutting back now.</li>
            <li> Ive spent a lot if money on expensive products that I was hoping to get these results from and they dont come close to this one.</li>
            <li> Thinking about your skin pulsating (at least to me) is feeling like your face is being massaged, not feeling like your skin is burning</li>
            <li> This mask REALY gets in there and SUCKS out everything, so please do not over use.</li>
            <li> This mask REALY gets in there and SUCKS out everything, so please do not over use.</li>
            <li> if you want the tingling effect, you must apply it on immediately after mixing the vinegar and clay--at least for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also swear its extracting properties have saved me from a root canal, or have at least allowed me to postpone it, when I mix it with a bit of coconut oil and massage the sore tooth.</li>
            <li> But this is by far the WORST mid mask I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Going back to the sensitive skin issue, I cannot use anything that isn&#x27;t hypoallergenic, I get awful rashes.</li>
            <li> but lately I&#x27;ve been showing signs of  aging.  </li>
            <li> I would get a few whiteheads and ugly red, swollen pimples.</li>
            <li> I got mine in the mail Saturday to use to detox my arm pits before starting on my Soapwalla Vegan deodorant to avoid the horrible irritation that the majority of people get with the natural stuff.</li>
            <li> , you can just use one of those suckers to mix this mask in.</li>
            <li> At least, I hope it&#x27;s the mask.</li>
            <li> It really isn&#x27;t necessary when it&#x27;s cold.</li>
            <li> At least it is for me!So</li>
            <li> This product sucks doesn&#x27;t do a damn thing</li>
            <li> I use this product at least once a week</li>
            <li> It sucks all the oil off from your skin</li>
            <li> I gave 2 stars because I do at least appreciate the simplicity of the product.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s and still struggle with acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently wearing the mask just because I&#x27;m insanely desperate.</li>
            <li> this stuff sucks my butt.</li>
            <li> I use this at least once a week</li>
            <li> you know this clay sucks up radiation?</li>
            <li> I am in my late 30s/</li>
            <li> It sucks your face off while it&#x27;s drying</li>
            <li> and yes, I would say all those reviews that keep using the word \\&quot;pulsing\\&quot; is just weird and probably not real.</li>
            <li> My skin sucks it up like a sponge.</li>
            <li> Sucks all the oils out</li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s a lot of lumps in it and really sucks.</li>
            <li> This stuff really sucks out all the impurities &amp; oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20s</li>
            <li> Helps smooth scars (I have awful rolling scars)&lt;br</li>
            <li> sucks all the gunk out of my pores.  </li>
            <li> I use it at least 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> This stuff sucks any and all moisture out of your face when it is drying.</li>
            <li> When all traces of mud are removed, do a final splash with cold water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I could never get it fully under control; I would always have at least one problem</li>
            <li> It definitely tightens your skin like crazy</li>
            <li> At least it didn&#x27;t irritate my face.</li>
            <li> I have to be REALLY careful with the products I put on my face because some can cause a weird rash/dry skin reaction and some can break me out</li>
            <li> I mix it with Apple Cider Vinegar and use it at least once a week.</li>
            <li> Sucks</li>
            <li> Avoid delicate skin around the eyes and areas over your temples.</li>
            <li> I just eyeballed about 3 Tbs of dirt, added water slowly, mixing with a butter knife until it made a paste.</li>
            <li> and about a 1/4 inch thick.</li>
            <li> It is cumbersome to wash off; maybe I&#x27;m using too thick of a layer?  </li>
            <li> It is a bit gloppy and takes some work to get it on your skin as thick as they advise.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s like a thick mousse.</li>
            <li> Do you know how thick it is?.</li>
            <li> Do you know how thick it is?.</li>
            <li> I make a thick paste and apply it thickly on my face.</li>
            <li> In the beginning, I tried wetting my hands and slowly peeling off the chunks.</li>
            <li> Never any thick spots of clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We placed it on our face and played a board game while it dried.</li>
            <li> The one thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is that when you attempt to wash it off it is sooooo thick and has clogged up my drain.</li>
            <li> Add water because the honey/clay mix will be thick.    </li>
            <li> Since using this mask I&#x27;ve noticed that the scar is slowly reducing in size and appearance.  </li>
            <li> The directions say to apply the mask 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick.  </li>
            <li> I applied it really thick as instructed.</li>
            <li> Fist thick mask</li>
            <li> /&gt;Random thoughts/tips:&lt;br /&gt;*You don&#x27;t need to apply a thick layer</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t make it too thick and pastey, though.  </li>
            <li> but once I got out the shower and stepped in front of the mirror I could see my curls slowly returning.</li>
            <li> Makes a thick paste.</li>
            <li> I like to put mine on thick.</li>
            <li> I disagree with the advice to put it on thickly though.  </li>
            <li> If you put it on too thick it just falls off your face.</li>
            <li> if that&#x27;s the case, you probably applied a thick amount to your face.  </li>
            <li> I apply a layer about 1/8 of an inch thick and that is plenty.</li>
            <li> Apply it so you can&#x27;t see your skin underneath the clay, but not so thick that it&#x27;ll fall off</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want a thick layer on my face</li>
            <li> DO NOT APPLY IT THICK.</li>
            <li> After my face fully dries she&#x27;s applies a thick Mask to the both of us</li>
            <li> Also it does not need to be as thick as they recommend.</li>
            <li> HOW THICK YOU MAKE IT.  </li>
            <li> Some people have difficulty removing this as it&#x27;s really thick.</li>
            <li> And applying a thick layer means that when it dries, it will pull off in one piece.  </li>
            <li> Too thick</li>
            <li> Slowly wipe your face with the paper towel.</li>
            <li> on a thick layer of the clay.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you make it really thick</li>
            <li> Everyone says to apply a thick amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been slowly switching all my chemical laden products into &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; products.</li>
            <li> so I basically packed it on thickly.  </li>
            <li> I do NOT understand why the directions indicate applying it 1/4\\&quot;-1/2\\&quot; thick.  </li>
            <li> I leave it on thick because I like the feeling of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit stubborn and also clogged my sink drain once because it&#x27;s so thick</li>
            <li> It may be slowly helping</li>
            <li> ; to 1/2&amp;#34; thick.  </li>
            <li> Just put the clay in a quart size jar, add 2 cups water, shake it, and wait 24-48 hours, and it will be the consistency of a thick pudding.</li>
            <li> adding water slowly until it&#x27;s a thick but spreadable consistency (a bit like thick peanut butter).  </li>
            <li> I use about 2 tbp because I lay my mask as thick as possible.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> - I still have scars but this is slowly helping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Only thing I would recommend is going slow at the combination of liquid to powder...</li>
            <li> So in conclusion I would recommend this product, just start slow and see how your skin reacts to it.</li>
            <li> When I put it on, I was a bit doubtful, but it really does feel like it&#x27;s pulling in your skin.</li>
            <li> so I used a thick layer like the container</li>
            <li> I do it really thick and let it sit for like 40 minutes.</li>
            <li> Anarchy is slowly unfolding through the city.</li>
            <li> The instructions also say to apply this mask 1/4 inch thick-</li>
            <li> I use about 3 teaspoons of this stuff per application (the bottle says to coat your face with ¼ - ½ in of this stuff, I found that to be a waste and quite unnecessary.</li>
            <li> I added the mixture to my face until it was about 1/2 inch thick on my face.</li>
            <li> I see that it says to put it on 1/4 inch thick.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t experience any &amp;#34;pulsating&amp;#34;, but I apply a thinner/runnier mask on my skin than a thick layer...</li>
            <li> It has to be a thick consistency to not get everywhere though.</li>
            <li> I tried it for a few months and noticed my skin getting worse.  </li>
            <li> When I Shower, I get a hand towel and slowly press on my face, and rinse the towel.</li>
            <li> This will take a while, depending on how thick of an application you did.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Slowly press each section of your face so the moisture transfers to your face.</li>
            <li> Then slowly massage one section at a time to remove the mask.</li>
            <li> It can be a little sloppy if you are in a rush.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, if I&#x27;m too lazy to wait for the mask to dry, I use my blow dryer on a cold setting to speed up the process.  </li>
            <li> My blackheads/pores did not get smaller (and I have reviewed other products which have), my whiteheads got worse, and the cystic acne was still painful and inflamed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t feel the pulsing it claims, perhaps I mixing it wrong?!</li>
            <li> and I mean EVERYTHING - out of your skin that you want gone.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any blackheads no more!</li>
            <li> do I mean by that?</li>
            <li> And by &amp;#34;any changes &amp;#34; I mean NON, ZERO,</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s literally mud.</li>
            <li> If theres no \\&quot;junk\\&quot; in my pores, i hope that will mean reduced</li>
            <li> Its way cheaper then any other expensive mask.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The mask does pulsate/pull on the skin but other than that it isn&#x27;t uncomfortable at all.  </li>
            <li> And I mean THE QUICKER IT DRIES.</li>
            <li> And I mean THE QUICKER IT DRIES.</li>
            <li> you know what I mean, ladies.</li>
            <li> I mean Im</li>
            <li> I usually dont write reviews but this product deserves it!</li>
            <li> When people say this stuff takes everything out of your skin, they mean it.</li>
            <li> I tried masks, lemons, honey, yogurt, I mean you name it</li>
            <li> Used as directed, so not sure what happened!</li>
            <li> And I mean it.</li>
            <li> I mean I wear a mask for 10-15 minutes and then rinse it off.</li>
            <li> I mean I blot at noon</li>
            <li> I mean I read reviews where people said that their faces throbbed</li>
            <li> When they say, &amp;#34;feel your face pulse&amp;#34; they mean it....</li>
            <li> This mask is unbelievable!  </li>
            <li> Way To Messy!!</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!  </li>
            <li> I MEAN</li>
            <li> Nothing else has worked other than expensive extraction sessions at the spa.  </li>
            <li> I mean, you have to pile on a lot of this stuff to get the desired result.</li>
            <li> would mean waiting for 4 months.</li>
            <li> it causes burns if u dont dilute I mean BURN.</li>
            <li> tried using it with Apple cider vinegar but sadly, it still doesn&#x27;t seem to be clearing my face like all other reviewers.</li>
            <li> it wouldn&#x27;t look oily and ill continue to use this for 3-4 days and any other day I feel like I want to give myself a spa day.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is very messy and a little difficult to mix</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have like bad acne problems just a few minor break outs every once in a while.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this stuff sucks works immediately to remove a substantial layer of dirt for healthier looking skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very annoying to clean off after applying on the face</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about it is it&#x27;s really hard to get off if you put it on too thick.</li>
            <li> After I rinsed it off my face was quite red (as the instructions say can happen) but it hurt pretty bad like I had a horrible sunburn, it lasted about a half an hour.</li>
            <li> No more secret indian healing clay for this chick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also had dozens of very small bumps on my forehead for years.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the hype behind this product :/</li>
            <li> I am in my 30&#x27;s with relatively oily skin that is prone to hormonal breakouts which are very difficult to control b/c</li>
            <li> Then it got very uncomfortable about 5 min later.</li>
            <li> (Beware, though: the smell of the ACV is a bit gag-worthy, but a very small price to pay for the results.)</li>
            <li> It got ride of my very small bumps on my face.</li>
            <li> but they are very small.</li>
            <li> VERY MESSY!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical on this product because of the low price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the mask works average, but it is difficult to apply and also to rinse it off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very messy when washing it off!</li>
            <li> 1 Teaspoon of the Aztec Clay &amp; 1 teaspoon of apple vinegar or water and mix in a very small bowl with your finger.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very messy to prepare!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t broke out bad in the past year due to using raw honey as a face wash.</li>
            <li> Use Apple cider vinegar to mix it, if you use water it&#x27;ll clump and be difficult to mix/wash down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I put it on once a week when i can remember ahhaa, but it really really smells like nasty ahaha because of the appl cider vinegar and two careful where you wash it off!!!</li>
            <li> As it dries, you feel like your face in hardening and being pulled in, and it really IS hardening (and at this point it is SORT of uncomfortable but nothing bad at all).  </li>
            <li> Not only was it nearly impossible, but it hurt too.</li>
            <li> I mixed it kinda of thin because I was afraid of the clogging of my sink after I read the reviews.</li>
            <li> Like, seriously?</li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> Ps- seriously heed the warning about redness-</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be too serious though.</li>
            <li> for some serious acne treatment creams go royalcosmetics.net</li>
            <li> I have seriously tried everything.</li>
            <li> AND YOU WILL FEEL THE TENSE ON YOUR FACE WHEN YOU APPLY IT .</li>
            <li> Not to mention WAY less expensive.</li>
            <li> It is painful in a weird sort of way and you really have to scrub to get it off</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll need to do some serious cleanup after.</li>
            <li> My before pics are ridiculous-</li>
            <li> Week 2 came around and seriously my skin recovered and took the quickest 180 turn, even from how severe week 1 was.</li>
            <li> My before pics are ridiculous-</li>
            <li> Week 2 came around and seriously my skin recovered and took the quickest 180 turn, even from how severe week 1 was.</li>
            <li> Mine is not that serious.</li>
            <li> after using expensive proactive for years and still dealing with acne this mask cleared my skin up in less than a month</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have acne per se, but my pores are ridiculous and still show with makeup or powder.</li>
            <li> Seriously I have had acne all my life</li>
            <li> The results are subtle but there and accumulative with time.&lt;br /&gt;Still reading?</li>
            <li> This is seriously *</li>
            <li> Seriously, I was sitting here looking at my skin the mirror for a while and thought \\&quot;time to write my review!\\</li>
            <li> It is low cost because no celebrity has claimed it and put their name on it and charged you an outrageous price for what is essentially dirt.</li>
            <li> Gradually, I could start seeing a difference in the apes tense of my pores.</li>
            <li> I am serious.  </li>
            <li> I am serious.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Just try it, seriously.</li>
            <li> I bought this jar of dirt while black out drunk.</li>
            <li> I understand bringing stuff up to the surface, I&#x27;ve worked in the beauty industry for 15 years, but this is just ridiculous for me.</li>
            <li> I took my son to a dermatologist for his acne and was recommended medication that has serious side effects (mood change, suicidal thoughts) and a 20+ page &amp;#34;hold harmless&amp;#34; contract.  </li>
            <li> It extracts and sucks out all the disgusting dirt and residue in my face and leaves me with a purified fresh face...</li>
            <li> if you have menopause or PMS seriously look this stuff up.</li>
            <li> if you have menopause or PMS seriously look this stuff up.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate on buying this seriously just get it.</li>
            <li> I had serious cystic acne at the time, and it seemed like it was soothed</li>
            <li> but this was seriously</li>
            <li> in terms of feelings, it seriously pulls your face.</li>
            <li> This stuff is serious.</li>
            <li> Serious cleanin going on</li>
            <li> Seriously pulls all the gunk out of your skin.</li>
            <li> Yeah, it is a bit messy and a little uncomfortable as it is drying but that just means it is working!</li>
            <li> The water and clay creates a clumpy and mess of a mask to put on that is difficult to spread.</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s difficult to take someone seriously with atrocious grammar, &amp; no common sense</li>
            <li> It got really hard and was making my face very tight, almost uncomfortably so</li>
            <li> but what a mess mixing it up !!!</li>
            <li> after 20 minutes of the mask sucking my face off, (a little uncomfortable, but thats how you know its working)</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I got this product, but within not even a week my pores shrunk just a tad bit.</li>
            <li> Was a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> Although a little frightening while on, this mask does what it promises to do.  </li>
            <li> I am a little bit skeptical of the 1 star reviews.</li>
            <li> Feels a little weird, but it does tell you that you will feel your skin pulsating.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it&#x27;s a little difficult to get off</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was a little bit skeptical with the instructions of how it makes your skin pulsate, but I figured I&#x27;d try it because of the price.</li>
            <li> But seriously guys I never even write reviews, I just had to share that with people struggling with pimples and an overall bad complexion.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this product especially after reading the bad results.</li>
            <li> It is also very helpful for bee stings, slivers, or hard to poke pimples- make a thick paste and leave it on overnight, by morning it will have removed the nasty.</li>
            <li> Anyway, inevitably i ran through plenty of brush and had a bad break out on my face.</li>
            <li> I continued to have bad cystic acne the entire time.</li>
            <li> THE SMELL OF THE VINEGAR IS THE ONLY BAD THING</li>
            <li> The ONLY bad thing I have to say about this is it is clumpy when you mix with water to make a mask.  </li>
            <li> i have bad acne on my chin only.  </li>
            <li> I took it internally without a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> I think the bad reviews are from those who didn&#x27;t add enough water.</li>
            <li> I left it on for about 15 -20 minutes on my nose, which caused it to peel badly.</li>
            <li> Simply put, I have bad skin.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend for bad skin days.</li>
            <li> but if you have bad acne use it daily please note yes it will brake you out</li>
            <li> I read some of the bad reviews -everyone&#x27;s skin is different!</li>
            <li> The only bad side is that you have to add apple cider vinegar and water to it.</li>
            <li> I have been breaking out badly for the last week</li>
            <li> I’m not really good at winging it with measurements.</li>
            <li> At least it didn&#x27;t make my skin worse -</li>
            <li> It is quite messy and can be difficult to get off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say it was a waste of money for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had a random few break outs this week.</li>
            <li> very red and painful.</li>
            <li> I also read in a review to try it with oil not good just crumbles every where.</li>
            <li> Have not experienced anything negative after a month of using the product.  </li>
            <li> everytime I use it as I know I am not putting any weird harsh chemicals on my skin when using it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Also, after using this for a few months my sister discovered it at home and is addicted to using it too!</li>
            <li> not nearly as good as some of these review say it is.</li>
            <li> After about 3 weeks of doing that, I finally got rid of those painful ones about 90%.</li>
            <li> After about 3 weeks of doing that, I finally got rid of those painful ones about 90%.</li>
            <li> Messy, difficult to remove and need to have vinegar on hand.</li>
            <li> Mix mixture with any liquid for your choice - can mix as thick as you would like or as thin as you would like.</li>
            <li> means that it&#x27;s busy sucking out all the crap from your pores.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> use a thin layer (rather than the thick layer they recommend).</li>
            <li> Also I hate the smell of vinegar so sitting there with it near my nose for a while</li>
            <li> you can make it thick or thin paste, it depends on how you like it.</li>
            <li> Hated my pore size &amp; the constant black heads.</li>
            <li> The clay has helped immensely in keeping it at bay - a treatment once a week, since it is a bit time consuming to mix it up, let it dry, and then remove it, but I haven&#x27;t had any of those awful underground takes-two-weeks-to-surface pimples since I&#x27;ve started using the clay.</li>
            <li> But as the other reviewers have stated it will clog your drain, it makes your face crazy itchy while it&#x27;s drying</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to wash of my hands!</li>
            <li> As this stuff dries it draws on the skin so hard it felt like my sinus cavity might be pulled through my pores!</li>
            <li> But small price to pay for the miracle of no more acne!!!</li>
            <li> If you have ever been an unfortunate victim of such thing, you know that it is very , very painful.</li>
            <li> I am a long time bad acne sufferer (I&#x27;m talking nodular and cystic type of acne).</li>
            <li> This totally and utterly disappointed me.</li>
            <li> However, after about 1.5 hours after I had rinsed it off, my pores appeared the same size as before I even applied it, which disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Well to say the least, it was somewhat jaw dropping!</li>
            <li> AT LEAST 2X A WEEK !</li>
            <li> I use it in a detoxifying bath when I start feeling ill, and usually whatever illness</li>
            <li> Realize that there are different types of acne (blackhead/whitehead/papules/pustular/nodular/cystic), and maybe those with nodular and cystic type like me won&#x27;t benefit from this clay :(</li>
            <li> At least it is for me!</li>
            <li> As anyone with closed comedones knows, they are very difficult to get rid of.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also point out that I&#x27;m lazy, and did not want to bother with the complicated mixing.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed to find out the clay needs to be mixed with vinegar and water.</li>
            <li> Once the mask dries (and my taunt face looks like some creepy alien creature ala Star Trek)</li>
            <li> I do think that the 1/4-1/2&amp;#34; application suggestion is a bit absurd I just use a small layer</li>
            <li> This product sucks!</li>
            <li> Not for the delicate flower!</li>
            <li> It smelled nasty and went on pretty clumpy</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did not remove any acne for me whatsoever, with continued use (about 1 or 2 times a week no more)</li>
            <li> THICK!</li>
            <li> THICK!</li>
            <li> I apply it think but not quite 1/4 inch thick but it is plenty!</li>
            <li> I used this stuff, showered (it is crazy getting this stuff off) and sat down to watch our nightly shows.</li>
            <li> Bought and took to Jamaica for MR because her face was having a very hard time with acne</li>
            <li> clay dries very hard</li>
            <li> It is very hard to get off, but I don&#x27;t mind, because it works so well.  </li>
            <li> This clay clumps and is very hard to make a paste.</li>
            <li> mud is very, very hard to get off of my face.  </li>
            <li> However, is it very hard to remove after you use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to rinse off, and my face felt itchy and irritated after I was done.</li>
            <li> Very hard to take off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very hard to mix and put on your face evenly.  </li>
            <li> When it comes time to wash it off, it is very hard to do without mud getting all over your bathroom (or wherever you choose to apply it).</li>
            <li> The mask is very hard to wash off and clogged my skin.</li>
            <li> it just dry it our really bad.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m feeling a bit less crazy.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical this product would have any effect on the acne on my skin but believe me and the other reviewers</li>
            <li> I can see where people get the &#x27;black hole&#x27; thing, but it&#x27;s honestly NOT that bad.  </li>
            <li> i wear mine for an hour, cuz i have tough skin</li>
            <li> i have tough skin and wear it with the apple cinder vinegar.</li>
            <li> Although it is a bit tough to get everything off.</li>
            <li> The sensation of the clay &amp; apple cider vinegar is weird - pulsating, sucking sensations and it dries very stiff.</li>
            <li> I used to use a very thick</li>
            <li> This is very thick mudd</li>
            <li> It says to do a very thick layer</li>
            <li> ( washing it off is the worst, i placed paper towels in the sink to catch the large clumps of clay to prevent clogging my sink).</li>
            <li> Even though it stinks a little, I would suggest mixing with Apple Cider Vinegar, per the instructions, and not water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do use the organic apple cider vinegar, it stinks a little when you put it on</li>
            <li> It helped my acne a little, but nothing crazy.</li>
            <li> It is messy and little annoying to wash off face</li>
            <li> so it is a bit uncomfortable and hard to take off.</li>
            <li> I never really had bad acne).</li>
            <li> smell is really not that bad.  </li>
            <li> I really never had bad acne</li>
            <li> For the last few months, I&#x27;ve had insanely stubborn acne on my chin.</li>
            <li> I noticed my freckles have decreased and my skin has become softer.</li>
            <li> Then I applied a thin layer over my washed face.  </li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s ground and sold in a jar by Aztec Secret.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So now that you now about the secret stuff don&#x27;t tell anyone else</li>
            <li> If you are an acne sufferer, do not use it unless you want to make your face worse.</li>
            <li> - I was concerned that it might start burning, irritating, etc.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t look tired</li>
            <li> I hate and like at the same time the pulsating feeling you get when the mask is drying.</li>
            <li> Also, i put a thin layer on my thighs 5 minutes before a shower</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for any of my issues, in fact it made my skin worse.</li>
            <li> I must say that I like the feeling when the mask dries up &amp; I have not experienced any side effects or discomfort.</li>
            <li> I had just suffered a mammoth breakout, worse than I&#x27;ve had in months.</li>
            <li> I had just suffered a mammoth breakout, worse than I&#x27;ve had in months.</li>
            <li> No longer do I have to go through the humiliating process of unhealthy skin.</li>
            <li> This just made things way worse.</li>
            <li> A thin layer will do.</li>

            <li> This &#x27;Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay&#x27; is phenomenal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The actual product I don&#x27;t hate it</li>
            <li> Put the Aztec Secret healing clay on it</li>
            <li> Not great feeling when it&#x27;s on</li>
            <li> A thin layer does the trick, and it stays on your face even after it dries.  </li>

            <li> I swear by aztec secret clay-</li>
            <li> If you strip the oil from your skin, your skin will start over producing oil, so you end up making your oily skin problem worse.  </li>
            <li> Now I know why the Aztec Indian civilization has gone extinct.</li>
            <li> If you mix it with the apple cider vinegar, it mixes very well, but you have to deal with the disgusting smell of vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No matter how thick/thin you put it on, it still hurts to wash off (though it hurts worse if you put it on thin..</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t cake a ton on just used a thin layer</li>
            <li> DO NOT scratch or pull at any acne or scars because it could make them worse trying to get rid of the product.</li>
            <li> it was making my acne worse</li>
            <li> The real test is how it helps my skin during PMS when my breakouts are the worst.</li>
            <li> It seemed like every year from the day I crossed paths with acne, it just got worse and worse.</li>
            <li> Every day I used Aztec Secret.  </li>
            <li> Felt like it made it worse.</li>
            <li> But I found that it would make my condition worse.</li>
            <li> A thin layer is all you need, you&#x27;re wasting product if you use the recommended amount</li>
            <li> It seems like a farce.</li>
            <li> You put on a thin layer and leave it one for 20 mins.</li>
            <li> so I kept it on and the pain got worse</li>
            <li> I accidentally got some on the thin skin under my eye,  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been using proactive for about a year and they aren&#x27;t getting worse, but aren&#x27;t going away, either.  </li>
            <li> I tried every rip off cleaner/clenser/toner known to man, nothing ever held up, always end up breaking out worse.</li>
            <li> I mix with ACV as directed and put on a thin layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it made my acne worse.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s praises but ultimately a big jar of powdered crap.</li>
            <li> I advice this indian secret.</li>
            <li> (it causes redness on thin skin parts).</li>
            <li> it just made my skin worse.</li>
            <li> My acne is anywhere from white heads to those annoying under the skin pimples...</li>
            <li> I hate facial masks.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my skin worse, but it didn&#x27;t improve it either.</li>
            <li> It really feels like all the nasty gunk is being pulled out of your pores  </li>
            <li> , a thin mask made it pulse and tighten like the label describes.  </li>
            <li> as soon as I could -- I immediately coated it with a thin layer of this lotion paste too.</li>
            <li> i noticed it works well with a thin layer</li>
            <li> This will make it worse.</li>
            <li> It has decreased my breakouts making them almost nonexistent.</li>
            <li> but at the same time it&#x27;s sucking out all the crap from your pores.</li>
            <li> it broke me out even worse.</li>
            <li> (search for Aztec Secret, Indian Healing Clay)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if I were to rate my acne from 1-10 (10 being the absolute worst)</li>
            <li> This thing sucks the life out of my skin but not the blackheads, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now 26 and extremely tired of the merry-go-round of products..</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t be buying this product again but not because it&#x27;s not a great product.</li>
            <li> but it made it so much worse.</li>
            <li> Lo and behold the secret to a cleaner and brighter face.</li>
            <li> and I found Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not experienced dryness at all.</li>
            <li> Also, the tub says to put on 1/4&amp;#34;- 1/2&amp;#34; of clay, but all the reviews/tutorials I&#x27;ve read apply a thin layer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found that while using this product my acne has decreased and my skin doesn&#x27;t get as oily during the day.</li>
            <li> i found Aztec secret</li>
            <li> and I apply a thin layer.</li>
            <li> It also decreased the amount of blackhead and shrunk my pore size.</li>
            <li> and i hadn&#x27;t badly broken out for quite a while, BEFORE I bought this product...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this mask regiment.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it will get worse before it gets</li>
            <li> I mised the Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay with Bragg&#x27;s Apple Cider</li>
            <li> One spoonful of Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay, one spoonful of apple cider vinegar, and just a splash of water.</li>
            <li> My chin breakout gets worse when I don&#x27;t use it as often as I should.</li>
            <li> Does leave behind some redness so don&#x27;t do this if you&#x27;re planning to leave the house within an hour or two.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A thin layer is sufficient.</li>
            <li> Glowing skin means cleaning pores and that what Aztec secret Indian healing does.</li>
            <li> It made my skin worse.</li>
            <li> It is thick to mix, difficult to spread on, and you will be like the Egyptian stone mummy while it sits on your face.</li>
            <li> I will try it again and use a thin layer</li>
            <li> and nah I am worse off</li>
            <li> If u have an acne problem it will make it worse</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see whats the secret about this product.</li>
            <li> well i&#x27;ve been using it for almost two weeks (with apple cider vinegar) and my skin looks much worse than before i started it.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work with my acne, and made it worse..</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> say, just a thin layer</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve seen terrible and if i don&#x27;t get this under control it will be there VERY soon)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get to try it because the seal was broken.  </li>
            <li> I use it 4 times a week and have hardly broken out since.</li>
            <li> I was tired of it and then put it away.</li>
            <li> it gets REALLY tight, almost to the point of uncomfortable on your skin!</li>
            <li> A little uncomfortable as it dries, but then so is ALL clay-based masks!</li>
            <li> to 1/2 to the face or other area) then remove it without clogging your bathroom, it is very painful and messy.</li>
            <li> I did not have any burning or other bad side effects.</li>
            <li> It can seriously clog up your drains!</li>
            <li> Seriously you guys, I have never used a product like this!</li>
            <li> Serious cleanser!</li>
            <li> seriously this stuff is a life saver!</li>
            <li> This stuff seriously works wonders on the face!</li>
            <li> Seriously, try it!</li>
            <li> And I put mine in a small ziplock bag and flip it inside out to apply to my face so my hands and sink won&#x27;t get too dirty.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars except it is very messy, and I was afraid to wash it off in the shower for fear it would clog my pipes.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 1 month now and have seen a dramatic change in my skin.</li>
            <li> We are continuing with masks every 2-3 days and are continuing to see dramatic improvements.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t notice any dramatic improvement of my condition.</li>
            <li> You will see a dramatic difference in your skin appearance immediately after it is rinsed off.</li>
            <li> I have used it once a week for about a month now and have seen dramatic changes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The dramatic &#x27;feel you skin pulsate&#x27; headline in the jar: I literally felt a heartbeat like sensation through my face as it cleared and shrunk my pores.</li>
            <li> but I thought I was being dramatic.</li>
            <li> I have horrible persistent acne (I&#x27;m in my late twenties), and I&#x27;ve been doing this mask about twice a week, mixed with apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> and I used it at least ten times, but it just breaks me out terribly!</li>
            <li> When you dab this stuff on your face and let it dry after fifteen minutes you can feel the crap being sucked out of your pores.</li>
            <li> The stresses of life hit me real hard the beginning of the year</li>
            <li> It dries real hard.  </li>
            <li> Plus I don&#x27;t have time to mess with it and give myself an ugly scar</li>
            <li> and i have not had a big ugly zit since ive been using it!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed because I was hoping it would clear up some acne and help reduce my breakouts</li>
            <li> Your face gets so tight that it almost feels painful</li>
            <li> I expect that using a little bit on a bad zit would work well.</li>
            <li> The worst issue about my acne is that I also have serious hyperpigmentation from all the years prior.</li>
            <li> I would also be shocked if it dried my skin out since I have truly greasy skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an alternative to icky baby powders that use artificial ingredients</li>
            <li> Sadly, it maybe made it worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with the Aztec secret Indian healing Clay.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, using it made me break out worse.</li>
            <li> Not worth it... :(</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the container seal had been broken already so it had been opened before it was delivered.  </li>
            <li> have sensitive, acne-prone skin and use a regimen of apple cider vinegar whenever I&#x27;m having a bad breakout (it works wonders!), but never did I think of using it as part of a mask!  </li>
            <li> And frustrating cause it stays clumpy sometimes which makes it difficult for application.</li>
            <li> &quot; it really is no joke, you can literally feel it pulling the crap out of your skin.</li>
            <li> My teenage son has suffered with very painful acne for about two years.  </li>
            <li> The powder  is so hard to contain to container once u openit!!</li>
            <li> Skin felt very soft afterwards; it felt like the product pulled a bunch of bad crap out of it.</li>
            <li> Personally, nothing is disgusting and painful when it comes down to beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the past like month and a half I had been getting disgusting acne EVERYWHERE like chronic systic, and had no idea why!</li>
            <li> Anxious to try it out, I just went ahead and applied a bad mixture.</li>
            <li> But give it a chance to work over the course of a few weeks, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> But give it a chance to work over the course of a few weeks, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am totally disappointed, since I did not see anything about green in the description.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how slowly you try to do it-clumps happen and are nearly impossible to get rid of.</li>
            <li> then, my sister has moved to another state and given up the spa, (not a very good business in a bad economy)</li>
            <li> But overall very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It works wonders, but don&#x27;t put it on very thick!</li>
            <li> we notice it helps minimize small wrinkles!!!</li>
            <li> So messy!!!!</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m a little nervous about taking this crap off..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little annoying to take off your face, (because it&#x27;s literally mud that dries)</li>
            <li> Little annoying acne surface bumps disappearing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid this stuff will clog my pipes as it&#x27;s VERY thick.</li>
            <li> Gets really hard and sort of painful to get off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had hormonal breakouts that are rather painful and hard to get rid of.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical reading the reviews on this, but after trying it, it is all that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was thinking ill</li>
            <li> ( this stuff pulsates your skin, nothing uncomfortable though.)</li>
            <li> It was only getting worst.</li>
            <li> It only made her face even worst.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the mask has not helped with my acne.</li>
            <li> that is when i started feeling this weird sensation of heat leaving my face.</li>
            <li> Aztec Secret, however, is an answer to my desires!</li>
            <li> Was skeptical in ordering it, but it wasn&#x27;t expensive, and thought I&#x27;d try.  </li>
            <li> I am a product whore and have tried all of the expensive spa skin care lines.</li>
            <li> Whether you have troubled skin or not, I would recommend this clay.</li>
            <li> The marketing on this product is hyped, of course it is, almost all cosmetic products are touting unrealistic benefits these days.  </li>
            <li> I used department store brand paying for the expensive jar for nothing.</li>
            <li> : My skin is difficult.</li>
            <li> I must say that all the reviews of suction, tightening, cleansing &amp; so on are exaggerated.</li>
            <li> But like you, I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> BUT, I can tell you from experience, that this weird stinky mask WILL improve your complexion.</li>
            <li> Expensive stuff, advertised by so called &amp;#34;dermatologists&amp;#34; and scientists.</li>
            <li> Expensive stuff, advertised by so called &amp;#34;dermatologists&amp;#34; and scientists.</li>
            <li> Plus, there are several people who are severely allergic to it, causing nasty bumps on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a fancy, expensive price either.</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t be uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This is one of those investments that will not do you wrong.</li>
            <li> Getting it off can be slightly difficult.</li>
            <li> I have medium skin tone with a combination skin that has lately been suffering with painful acne and enlarged pores on the sides of the cheeks and sides of the nose.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It won’t work for me because I have such awful skin.</li>
            <li> But sadly it took me months to fix the breakouts.</li>
            <li> for teeth brushing, detox baths, spider and mosquito bites, my husband had a weird rash that wouldn&#x27;t go away from working in a sanitation plant, a mask of this got rid of it.</li>
            <li> OBSESSED</li>
            <li> , it was like a science project done terribly wrong</li>
            <li> (mind you my skin is post-accutane, but still not perfect) and remaining blackheads.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I am so addicted to this stuff!</li>
            <li> On a random blog, another mom was recommending this mask, since it had worked so well for her teens.  </li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> NO more!!!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not research before buying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird, but I does what it says.</li>
            <li> (sorry</li>
            <li> but ill see what happens. ..</li>
            <li> but the pores on my nose have significantly decreased in size!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t do that to your poor face!</li>
            <li> It says it&#x27;s pulsating, but to me it was just irritating!</li>
            <li> My sister had a terrible breakout recently and tried this mask.  </li>
            <li> expensive department store brands cannot beat this one.  </li>
            <li> I got this from a girlfriend who purchased off my wish list saying she couldn&#x27;t believe she was getting this for me and how lame my wish list was.  </li>
            <li> unless im mixing wrong.</li>
            <li> After my 3 and final time using this product it broke my face out horribly!</li>
            <li> I had a terrible acne breakout on my back.  </li>
            <li> With a still skeptical attitude, I decided to wait until the morning to see if the results stuck through the night.  </li>
            <li> With a still skeptical attitude, I decided to wait until the morning to see if the results stuck through the night.  </li>
            <li> Feels insane, doesn&#x27;t hurt at all....unless you try to move your facial muscles</li>
            <li> This mask is difficult to mix (it comes powdered &amp; you&#x27;re supposed to add water).</li>
            <li> If I apply maybe once a week or so, it doesn&#x27;t get that uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that difficult to mix</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried expensive ones from sephora and sometimes it&#x27;s a hit and miss but for $6-$7</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> I will tell her to update this review or if there are any questions about this item She said she would recommend it because it helps take the oil and dirt out of her face and it is not that difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I do want to mention that I used and tried everything there is -- from Olay to Dior and expensive microdermabrasion treatments.</li>
            <li> I do want to mention that I used and tried everything there is -- from Olay to Dior and expensive microdermabrasion treatments.</li>
            <li> Yes, it can be difficult to face the world.</li>
            <li> But still, I couldn&#x27;t just let my face sit there and use lame cleansers.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about using the product on my skin because I have eczema</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useless when you mix it with water;</li>
            <li> even the expensive facials I get.</li>
            <li> : people talk about how difficult it is to wash this off since you don&#x27;t want to wash it off and drain your clogs.  </li>
            <li> Thank you Aztec Secret!  </li>
            <li> but you really can&#x27;t go wrong with clay, no matter what you mix it with.</li>
            <li> there just can&#x27;t be nothing wrong wit it ever.</li>
            <li> For years i have broke out along the jaw line and forehead,nothing has worked for me not even a trip to an expensive spa.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s quite uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s uncomfortable but you&#x27;ll get through it.</li>
            <li> Well, needless to say this clay</li>
            <li> ALL these reviews are fake.</li>
            <li> my entire face covered with scars from picking the filthy pimples!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product.</li>
            <li> and that was a thin layer!  </li>
            <li> Can be a bit difficult.</li>
            <li> I swear by it now and tell all my friends to throw out the expensive stuff.  </li>
            <li> My teenage daughter, who had a terrible breakout on her forehead, also used it.  </li>
            <li> this being the case ill be taking my business elsewhere..</li>
            <li> I tried this product several times and it made my skin break out terribly!!!  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> and there is nothing wrong with caring for your face.</li>
            <li> - it deactivates the clay and renders it useless); stirred it up with a chopstick and applied it to my face with a paintbrush.</li>
            <li> so it goes on weird.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted!  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve only used this product twice and it has made my acne worst.  </li>
            <li> My acne is worse now!</li>
            <li> Applying it with fingers is difficult because it just slides around on your skin.</li>
            <li> bought this product after my face broke out terribly after using Oil of Olay Pro X Acne Protocol, and clay mask definitely has been undoing the damage Oil of Olay caused on my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update 3: Weird..</li>
            <li> Scary stuff</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird.</li>
            <li> why you have to spend  your money in expensive products???</li>
            <li> So I read all these glowing reviews, but I was still skeptical.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s just as obsessed.</li>
            <li> I have suffered for years with cystic acne and some weird almost like ingrown hairs on my arms .</li>
            <li> Once the mask starts pulsating and feeling uncomfortable TAKE IT OFF.</li>
            <li> Once the mask starts pulsating and feeling uncomfortable TAKE IT OFF.</li>
            <li> As a face mask, I&#x27;m not really impressed.</li>
            <li> Boy was i wrong.</li>
            <li> Sadly, just not for me.</li>
            <li> Sorry -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not every day you buy what appears to be a lousy jar of clay</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it shrinks pours and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Forget all those expensive clay masks with additives...</li>
            <li> No need to purchase expensive facials or products.  </li>
            <li> and its messy, and annoying to mix up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say that I was dissapointed though.</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t justify the price for the mediocre results.</li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
            <li> This time I took the mask off in the shower and it wasn&#x27;t so uncomfortable....</li>
            <li> Obsessed with this mask.</li>
            <li> I tried it as a mask and a spot treatment, both with ACV and water, and it failed me on both counts.</li>
            <li> Completely useless.</li>
            <li> Maybe I read them a bit wrong.</li>
            <li> I was scared to try Apple vinegar because I didn&#x27;t want a weird reaction.</li>
            <li> For 8 bucks you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> For 8 bucks you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I WAS BORED</li>
            <li> Then brush on your troubled areas and within minutes you can feel the clay harden and work.</li>
            <li> Taking off the product wasn&#x27;t as difficult as I thought.</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> it felt like a weird pulling sensation.</li>
            <li> used it for about a month or so and made my face worse!</li>
            <li> Looks like extremely complicated to use.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my skin always peels after...</li>
            <li> Tastes awful and my skin looks the same !</li>
            <li> Ill give another comment when I finish the jar, maybe in like a year.</li>
            <li> But, Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong?</li>
            <li> Now don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> Its absolutely useless for that.</li>
            <li> In my eyes this product failed miserably and I now have a container of this stuff that sooner or later will end up in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will have to use my expensive name brand tea tree shampoo as a body wash.</li>
            <li> Forget about expensive pore creams, acne treatments that won&#x27;t work...</li>
            <li> The last time I used it, my skin (on face) broke out in a TERRIBLE rash.</li>
            <li> I admit to not reading the product information before purchasing, silly me.  </li>
            <li> things started to go wrong</li>
            <li> so I started to worry that I did it wrong.</li>
            <li> (....I&#x27;m so sad</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s actually why I went looking for this and remembered it- the insane softness of your skin!</li>
            <li> and my skin is very tough because of it</li>
            <li> doesnt mean it is bad for you.</li>
            <li> you, (like me) hate the smell of apple cider vinegar, add a drop or two of (raw) honey to the mix when you&#x27;re mixing it up</li>
            <li> I put a very thin layer on my skin and it works just as well.  </li>
            <li> NOT use a lot, a very thin layer on my skin</li>
            <li> I was very broken out and after using it twice a week for two weeks</li>
            <li> I wear a very thin mask when I get home from work.  </li>
            <li> I use a very thin layer, and removal does take a bit of scrubbing with a cloth.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS SERIOUSLY THE GOD OF ALL GODS!!</li>
            <li> I usually dilute the apple cider vinegar they say to use in the directions because I just hate the smell of vinegar</li>
            <li> But I will keep you all posted and touch base in a few months!</li>
            <li> But I will keep you all posted and touch base in a few months!</li>
            <li> I am a person with oily &amp; dry skin with terrible blackheads and nothing seems to unclog my pores.. not fancy facials at the salon or anything..</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and eczema, and I&#x27;ve had terrible reactions to some makeup products.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and eczema, and I&#x27;ve had terrible reactions to some makeup products.</li>
            <li> Now, in my late 20&#x27;s I STILL have annoying breakouts, both hormonal and non-hormonal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was quite embarrassing and annoying to say the least.</li>
            <li> crap dries slow.</li>
            <li> When you leave it on your face it literally starts pulling like crazy as it dries which is uncomfortable</li>
            <li> The right side of my face had a TERRIBLE disgusting break out for like, 3 months.</li>
            <li> I have terrible combination skin, dark spots, and acne</li>
            <li> the clay literally sucks everything out!!!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a little bit nasty...</li>
            <li> terrible terrible acne that turned into large cysts.</li>
            <li> and my skin has gone nuts since then breaking out like crazy,  </li>
            <li> and it seems to apply easier when its cold.</li>
            <li> I used it once, but I am afraid to clog up the sink.</li>
            <li> but it kept disappointing me each time.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a man and my face is usually dirty after work.  </li>
            <li> Your hands don&#x27;t get dirty and you won&#x27;t need any additional utensils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It burns like crazy, but suffocates the remaining bed bugs on/in your skin.  </li>
            <li> It can leave your bathroom a bit dirty</li>
            <li> Thus stuff is crazy.</li>
            <li> so my pores get dirty and this helps with just that.</li>
            <li> As it dries, it tends to make my face itch like crazy</li>
            <li> After I rinsed it off, i followed it with some cold water to close the pores.</li>
            <li> Do not be afraid</li>
            <li> (rather neglected, I&#x27;m afraid), so perhaps it won&#x27;t have as pronounced an effect on those who&#x27;ve strengthened/</li>
            <li> After a few hours all the bleak heads in my face started to head.</li>
            <li> This stuff burns my face as it tightens, then itches like crazy, then feels like someones throwing ice cold water at my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  I was breaking out like crazy after I tried the Oil Cleansing Method using coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> And not a detoxing break out from the product extracting the garbage from my skin, but a clogged pore break out that was heavily exacerbated by this dreadful product.  </li>
            <li> just hate the fact it is all powdery, it gets a bit messy and annoying to put on.</li>
            <li> I was getting desperate for a remedy that could work on me</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll look crazy as hell before it dries HOWEVER</li>
            <li> No need to dirty your sink with clay</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like a peeling that absorbs dirty, oil..</li>
            <li> it stinks but does wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li> What a crazy feeling on your face when it is drying.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that I was so afraid to use this mask, and it is the one product that is working.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that I was so afraid to use this mask, and it is the one product that is working.</li>
            <li> I desperately need something for my acne.</li>
            <li> and I get muddy and dirty from the work I do</li>
            <li> Crazy sensation while it is drying.</li>
            <li> I was afraid of infection and since I do not take antibiotics ( because I do not believe in their function)</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s cold, it&#x27;s easier to apply and doesn&#x27;t drip before hardening.</li>
            <li> I could feel it tightening like crazy.</li>
            <li> There was some redness once I washed it off, but nothing crazy.</li>
            <li> can practically fry chicken with the amount of oil</li>
            <li> then I will close them with cold water.</li>
            <li> I have really horrible acne on my chin and t-zone area, and within one use they dried up and started to go away.</li>
            <li> AVC also stinks, so that&#x27;s another downside.</li>
            <li> Disappointing &#x3D;</li>
            <li> thats just crazy....</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily, acne-prone skin; I even sometimes get awful cystic acne, it&#x27;s so bad.</li>
            <li> The pulsing&#x3D; weird feeling!</li>
            <li> The pulsing&#x3D; weird feeling!</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t get into weird sensation of the mask drying!</li>
            <li> , I know, sorry!).</li>
            <li> And the cost per strip to keep reapplying to get the remaining out would be way too expensive!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted!!</li>
            <li> , you can&#x27;t go wrong with this stuff!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fourth, the redness after using it is kinda scary!</li>
            <li> I kept this on for about 15 minutes and it felt so weird!</li>
            <li> Every day without fail!  </li>
            <li> Truly a timeless beauty secret!!</li>
            <li> Even during puberty I would maybe have 5 small pimples at worst.</li>
            <li> I just cannot believe it took me 30 years to find this stuff and that after all the expensive &amp;#34;scientific&amp;#34; stuff, it was ancient aztec clay that worked!  </li>
            <li> recommend you try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> It even triggered a small panic attack, but I&#x27;m very claustrophobic!</li>
            <li> To difficult to use it,my friend said it will burn my skin,so I threw this away!</li>
            <li> Since I refrigerate mine it gets cold and can be unpleasant putting it on&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I was wrong!</li>
            <li> If you are skeptical about trying this mask, don&#x27;t be!</li>
            <li> Buy it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Obsessed!</li>
            <li> It was actually scary to see it like that!</li>
            <li> &quot; feeling (which wasn&#x27;t unpleasant at all) until torwards the end.</li>
            <li> It was chunky and sort of unpleasant</li>
            <li> Used on painful cold sores...immediate relief.</li>
            <li> that I was very skeptical regarding the reviews.</li>
            <li> It has a very faint soil-like smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that it is very difficult to mix with water.</li>
            <li> I literally could not moved my face muscles, and if I tried it would&#x27;ve probably very uncomfortably cracked the mask.</li>
            <li> very sad..</li>
            <li> it was a very uncomfortable</li>
            <li> and i tried lots of procedures, even very expensive.</li>
            <li> that said, If you&#x27;re all fidgety like me, it&#x27;s almost impossible to make it to the point of it throbbing without picking it off.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s physically impossible.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s physically impossible.</li>
            <li> but it made my face itch like crazy :-(</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not as bad if you use water instead.</li>
            <li> Price isn&#x27;t too bad.  </li>
            <li> BAD MISTAKE.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have bad acne</li>
            <li> I still breakout and it dries out your skin so bad.</li>
            <li> He also has a bad problem with blackheads.  </li>
            <li> I have had bad Psoriasis for about a year now around my nose and mouth.</li>
            <li> I admit that I do not have cystic or extreamly bad acne, but have read that this product works for that just as well.</li>
            <li> (bad, I know), and it created scarring and sadness for me.</li>
            <li> If you have a bad problem with acne and oily skin use Apple Cider Vinegar to mix it rather than water.  </li>
            <li> I have been sleeping in my makeup lately (bad I know).</li>
            <li> I do, however, have really bad blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li> and I never got any bumps or any bad reaction.  </li>
            <li> It takes out the bad</li>
            <li> My redness wasn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t have really bad acne</li>
            <li> I put on a layer, and after 5 minutes my face started itching really bad...</li>
            <li> ordered this because of the reviews &amp; because I have bad acne and not a lot of money!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> it works great!&lt;br /&gt;The bad news:</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Al&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;aluminium&amp;#34; both tell the bad news:  </li>
            <li> i never had acnee as a teenager and now at 23 i was breaking out so bad because of stress and nothing i tried worked.</li>
            <li> A couple weekends ago I got some really bad sunburn on my face and legs.</li>
            <li> Nothing bad.</li>
            <li> So, Im predestined to have bad skin as well..  </li>
            <li> This product saved me, my face was getting bad.</li>
            <li> Not too bad a purchase for an add on item.</li>
            <li> and it felt &amp; looked like I had a bad sunburn.</li>
            <li> I do breakout some after, but nothing bad.  </li>
            <li> still sting at this point but not as bad.  </li>
            <li> TOO BAD...</li>
            <li> But it says that it will do so on the container, and it does go away after 30 minutes or so, but maybe if you use water it won&#x27;t be so bad.</li>
            <li> So you have to find a lotion or moisturizer that&#x27;ll keep all that bad stuff out.</li>
            <li> So you have to find a lotion or moisturizer that&#x27;ll keep all that bad stuff out.</li>
            <li> It smells bad but it works wonders.  </li>
            <li> and when I took it off, my face felt like it was badly sunburned.  </li>
            <li> Aside from that one incident, I haven&#x27;t had any bad reactions to the clay.</li>
            <li> but my friend&#x27;s face looked like she was badly sunburned after leaving it on for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Bad idea.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; when I get bad acne and the acne spots  disappear after applying this mask</li>
            <li> bad zits --</li>
            <li> but if I am breaking out bad this is the answer.</li>
            <li> My T-zone can get a bit oily at times but nothing too bad.</li>
            <li> I have had bad skin all my life.</li>
            <li> I still have breakouts but not as badly</li>
            <li> I had bad cystic acne that wouldnt stop spreading across my face</li>
            <li> I made the bad decision to FaceTime people - laughing is not an option with a stone face</li>
            <li> I have a really bad case of sebaceous filaments on my arms and decided to try it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that bad of stuff for the price.</li>

            <li> I have bad blackheads.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not breaking out as badly as before.  </li>

            <li> it was so bad.</li>
            <li> my face broke out so bad</li>
            <li> My face broke out in cystic bumps that hurt so bad.</li>
            <li> One day i got a bad case of poison ivy.</li>
            <li> and it was really bad.</li>
            <li> For the price, it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to bad if it was a flop.</li>
            <li> It was bad that my skin and face hurt from all the zits for weeks after.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t go around eating poisonous berries, but with all the processed food these days, it can&#x27;t be a bad idea to do a cleanse.</li>
            <li> It smells bad..</li>
            <li> but I have really bad blackheads</li>
            <li> It also made my skin look as though I used to have extremely bad acne, which I have never had.</li>
            <li> i have bad skin</li>
            <li> I am not saying it is a bad product.</li>
            <li> The bad part for me was trying to wash it off.</li>
            <li> it irritated it so bad.</li>
            <li> Made my face break out really bad</li>
            <li> I wanted this to work so badly as an acne cure</li>
            <li> It turns out really bad if you use water</li>
            <li> I started using the product every two days and leaving it for 20 minutes, and I started to breakout really bad</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what to do, my face has never been this bad.</li>
            <li> It makes my face itch really bad.</li>
            <li> bad</li>
            <li> I have a history with bad skin</li>
            <li> so bad effect in my face skin.</li>
            <li> and I am absolutely shocked by the results</li>
            <li> I look so ugly now</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to give a product a bad review, but this mask is painful to me.  </li>
            <li> I have to say I was shocked at how well it worked.</li>
            <li> Its not too painful thoe.</li>
            <li> a pulsating)...it became painful</li>
            <li> but when \\&quot;that time of the month\\&quot; comes around and the hormonal acne rears its ugly head all i have to do is break out this bad boy and it stops it in its tracks.</li>
            <li> I did just that, thinking I would save my drain from being clogged and maybe even pull some gunk out of my face, but all I got were some really nasty splotches and bruises on my face--probably made worse by the fact that I used the mask two days in a row.</li>
            <li> It does &amp;#34;pulsate&amp;#34; but I wouldn&#x27;t describe it as painful.</li>
            <li> Painful and flakey.</li>
            <li> so I went into the bathroom....and was shocked.</li>
            <li> I use it on my knees at night and it helps ease the painful inflammation.  </li>
            <li> I would be shocked of it were an allergy.</li>
            <li> Another tip is not to leave it on your skin too long--the clay will start to PAINFULLY pull on your skin.</li>
            <li> clay started cracking like the mojave desert all over my face and Removing the clay was extremely painful..</li>
            <li> And when I do break out with cystic acne, the mask has a way of speeding up the process so that I&#x27;m not stuck with painful bumps on my face for months.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s painful to get off your face</li>
            <li> It is painful to remove from your face.  </li>
            <li> (I thought it would be like a painful pulsate, but it was not).</li>
            <li> It was so painful.</li>
            <li> I still have those painful cystic acne on my chin</li>
            <li> Its like a biore strip in a mask with out the painful tape like extraction.  </li>
            <li> talk/interact in any way that will make the mask crack and pull in painful directions</li>
            <li> I did it once while I was sick</li>
            <li> Medications make me sick and truly do not help.  </li>
            <li> I got this because i am sick of dealing with clogged pores.  </li>
            <li> Sick of trying things, the prices, claims, etc.  </li>
            <li> I even called in sick from work because of it.</li>
            <li> but again I&#x27;m sick of crappy acne.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am SOOOO glad that I decided to go out on a limb and buy this! This stuff is seriously incredible! I have always had large pores, excessively oily skin and acne. I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and still battling skin issues. I bought some ACV to go with this product and have used it 2-3 times a week. I mix it in a little sandwich baggy which is less messy, I apply a relatively thick layer to my face and neck and leave it on for at least an hour (usually about an hour and a half) to make sure it&#x27;s completely dry. You can feel the &amp;#34;pulsating&amp;#34; feeling as it dries and it does make your skin feel very restricted and tight while it&#x27;s drying. Warm water and gently rubbing, sometimes with a washcloth, takes the mask off relatively easy (I haven&#x27;t had any issues washing the clay off). My skin wasn&#x27;t red afterward (some other users reported this) but my skin is SO SOFT!! I was blown away at how soft my skin was. Not to mention - this stuff really makes a difference! My makeup went on so much more smoothly the following morning and I definitely noticed a SIGNIFICANT difference in how oily my face was throughout the day. I am so excited about this stuff, it is a MUST buy for anyone who has oily skin or large pores!!</li>
            <li> this stuff is pretty crazy. it gets REALLY tight, almost to the point of uncomfortable on your skin! the first couple times I used it I think it did make my skin break out more, but I think it was just the &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34; because now my skin is the best it&#x27;s ever been! I have cystic acne and I get blackheads on my jawline and I use this mask once a week and my skin is practically clear! it&#x27;s really good for spot treatment too - when I feel one of the painful bumps coming up I just put a mask on for about half and hour and it literally deflates it within a day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend using ACV to mix instead of water - it mixes MUCH better and ACV also has acne fighting properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a little freaky how red your face will be for about 30 minutes after but I&#x27;ve read that that is just because it&#x27;s bringing all the blood to the surface/increasing circulation. apparently that&#x27;s what makes this mask so powerful. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with acne or even just stubborn black heads...this mask is very cleansing!</li>
            <li> I tried this product the same night that it arrived and I was very pleased. I read the description and the container says that a single pound of this can make up to 10-15 facial masks. This is assuming that you&#x27;re using it on your whole face. However, if you only want to use it on a certain portion of your face and you use it sparingly, you could easily double this usage. I took one of those very little plastic dishes that you would use for salad dressing, added the clay and water, and mixed it up. I didn&#x27;t even need to use the whole little dish, so I popped the lid on and it sealed the moisture very well for the next use! I&#x27;ll be buying this again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Pretty good at absorbing my super oily skin. Pulls dirt and oil out of skin. You will want to use a moisturizer afterwards to prevent over drying that can cause your skin to over produce oil. Mask tightens and cleans face. I haven&#x27;t had any irritation, but noticed some reviewers saying that it caused irritation, so it may cause irritation for people with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Irritated my skin a little bit but overall it&#x27;s an awesome product!</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!!! I have extremely oily, acne prone skin. My pores are also very deep and always clogged no matter what I use. After using this mask ONE TIME my skin was practically flawless! Not only did it unclog my pores it also dried up my zits and then I even had to use moisturizer because it dried my skin slightly. But I am definitely not complaining about the drying of my skin - it needed that. I just eyeballed about 3 Tbs of dirt, added water slowly, mixing with a butter knife until it made a paste. I applied it as directed, all over (watch your eyes!) and about a 1/4 inch thick. I left it on for 10 minutes. One warning however, it does tingle, pull, and then got pretty itchy. I was so scared I was having an allergic reaction but then the itchiness went away after just a couple minutes. This is all normal. I then wet several soft paper towels with warm water and wiped it off slowly, throwing all of the chunks into the trash. DO NOT let the clay go down your drain as that can cause buildup. A little bit got into my drain but there was no problem with that. Then I grabbed my super soft microfiber towel and wet that with warm water to wipe off the remnants. My skin has never felt so soft! I am so excited to see how this would work on my back since I suffer from back acne, deep, nasty clogged pores, and very oily skin. I am one happy customer!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what the other reviews said! You&#x27;ll feel this clay mask work. Your face will start pulsating and if there&#x27;s nasty stuff under your skin, you&#x27;ll break out a little at first, but for me, it was only like that the first two times. I try using this once a week, but it is kind of annoying to clean up because I don&#x27;t let it go down the drain for clogging purposes...</li>
            <li> The sticker covered the instructions!! super annoying. Also, I accidentally used metal the first time... woops.</li>
            <li> The stuff really pulls everything out of your face. My face is so red and tight after using this because I can actually feel my blood being pulled to the surface on top of everything else it draws out. It&#x27;s waaaay too harsh to use more than once a week. This and a bottle of apple cider vinegar are more than enough to last for a few months.</li>
            <li> I just used this for the first time today and my skin feels tighter and my pesky blackheads are gone! We all know how hard blackheads are to get rid of. It feels great on my face as well with the tightening sensation. This is the most amazing face mask I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Still trying it, but it seems work for me</li>
            <li> Love it! Really draws out the oils and dirt from your pores :) great mask for acne prone skin .. Recommend it ! :)</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I have good skin that occasionally gets congested and a bit bumpy, but isn&#x27;t overly sensitive or acne prone.  I swear by this stuff when used with vinegar and I have been using it for years.  I apply it fairly thick and wait for it to dry, which can take quite a while.  It dries to hard and tight that it sort of feels like it&#x27;s sucking your face off, but it gets everything - and I mean EVERYTHING - out of your skin that you want gone.  The acid in the vinegar acts like a mini peel and will leave your face pink for about an hour after use, so I wouldn&#x27;t use it just before going out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this once a week and follow with a good, non-chemical moisturizer and your skin will feel like a baby&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my face feel and look very nice. I mix half water and vinegar with the clay. It does pulsate your face never felt that before pretty interesing. It does a great job.</li>
            <li> So I just had my IUD taken out two weeks ago and my skin has gone nuts since then breaking out like crazy,  I finally decided to give this a try after seeing it a few times , and I am happy I bought it. I ve only used it twice so far but my breakouts look tons better,  i am not saying they are completely gone, because they are not but definitely smaller then they have been, I also have body acne and have used this on my tush ;) and have seen a huge improvement there as well. I would say at least try it I use two plastic spoon fulls and that is way more then I need for a pretty thick mask plus my butt. I haven&#x27;t used apple cider vinegar yet but I am going to see if it makes as much of a difference as everyone says. Oh my skin is crazy sensetive and it only stays red for the 30 minutes the container claims,  i do use the mask at night though just to allow me skin time to freak out before seeing anyone outside of my house, just in case but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Good one, loooooooove it!!</li>
            <li> This made 3 different skin types soft, shiny, soft, and clear. (I am 56 y.o, my daughter is 16, and her boyfriend is 18...we all looked great!)  It is cumbersome to wash off; maybe I&#x27;m using too thick of a layer?  Give it a try; for the price it&#x27;s a great mask.</li>
            <li> my skin feels so soft after using and my pores look smaller.</li>
            <li> Was fun to use, I&#x27;m not very observant about whether it worked or not, because I have very discrete acne.</li>
            <li> 10/10, seeing all kinds of facial aesthetics gains.  Sup misc</li>
            <li> I have tried several different brands and this one works for me. I noticed my freckles have decreased and my skin has become softer.</li>
            <li> It really does penetrate deep into the skin and helps clear acne drastically.</li>
            <li> Strongest facial I&#x27;ve ever experienced, good grief. But that is applicable when using apple cider vinegar- it&#x27;s not as bad if you use water instead. Still takes some getting used to but overall a good working mask</li>
            <li> Was a gift for a friend and she asked for it specifically so I think she likes it.</li>
            <li> It is a bit messy, but I expected it to be; after all, it is clay!  I like the way it works.  I have very sensitive skin &amp; this is non-irritating.  I think this huge jar will last 6 months or more!</li>
            <li> I mix black or apple cider vinegar with my clay. This is a powder product so be very careful when utilizing this as it can get quite messy. You only need a little!! Honestly, don&#x27;t need that much powder. It took me a while to get the amount right as I always put too much or too little. My advice is start in small amounts and work your way up, a little goes a long way. I usually put this mask on right after I take a hot shower to open up my pores and this product will pulsate and the vinegar will sting you but that&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Only used a few times but noticed results immediately. Teenage son had acne on his nose. mixed this with acv as a mask and it reduced it! Everyones skin is different so only use a small amount to check for reactions or sensitivity.</li>
            <li> The clay is simply brilliant! It&#x27;s also great for your hair and body😀</li>
            <li> I really like what this does to my face! It minimizes my pores and makes my face look fresh. This and my Clarisonic make my face look beautiful and have received compliments. I recommend</li>
            <li> love it! really cleans pores and exfoliates dead skin. Leaves your skin clean and smooth.I use it once a month and then use a moisturizing mask after.</li>
            <li> I feel like it really helped my skin.</li>
            <li> When folks say this stuff is strong...BELIEVE THEM!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they say leave it on for 5- 10 minutes... yeah... do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got huge hives about 1 or 2 across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I will follow directions if I get the stomach to try it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s as strong as people say, I guess it will draw out your impurities...if there are pores left.</li>
            <li> It clears up my complexion and makes my skin have an even tone for about a day long. I have not noticed any reduction in any acne using this product. That&#x27;s the reason I tried this stuff out. Has the other benefits though.</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW WOW WOW. Where in the heck has this stuff been hiding. This is truly the worlds best kept secret. Don&#x27;t worry I will buy this clay until I die. Its a big container but you dont need alot. I also started putting it on the top of my hands and fingers. Truly a NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE by the NEXT MORNING. Amazon you MUST keep this Aztec Clay in stock. Just plain out Awesome. My skin is starting to look great and I have dealt with facial skin issues for years due to the type and amount of twice daily taken medications. Im super excited. Thank you for saving my skin.</li>
            <li> The first thing that surprised me was when it said there was no chemicals. I have combination/oily AND delicate skin, and I always use so many products that have chemicals and harm my skin; and many of those chemical products made my skin dry which caused my skin to be MORE oily. This product does tighten your skin and not every skin can tolerate something like this. My skin is delicate but there can be more delicate skin types. I always recommend to do a skin allergy or regular skin test to see if the skin can tolerate the product. I put a small amount on my wrist and a small amount on the area below the earlobe (I had three pimples there, so I luckily tested it out on how it worked on pimples as well). 13 minutes have passed and there was no irritation or allergic reaction and it left my skin super soft. (And on the next day, the pimples got smaller.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[You don&#x27;t need that much for your face- 1 Tablespoon of each is really good for applying it to your face. You don&#x27;t need more than 2 Tablespoons for the whole face.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is always important to follow the instructions. If it says use raw apple cider vinegar and/or water, then get RAW acv and/or water. Don&#x27;t put any oils or extra stuff that people say it&#x27;s good when it&#x27;s not. I did research on this product and they say to use raw acv and non-metallic utensils since metal with the ingredient with the clay won&#x27;t cause a complete mixture and adding oils can ruin the PH levels that are for the treatment of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the mask once with my fingers, and I had some areas that hurt more than others, almost causing a skin irritation in small areas. I highly recommend people with delicate skin to put on the mask evenly when applying it to your whole face. Use a foundation brush to apply, and it will give you an even coating. When you&#x27;re done with the mask, dab your face with warm water before removing it from your skin (this will make it easier for you to take it off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you&#x27;re done- you will probably see your skin turn red but that is said in the instructions that it&#x27;s a normal result. Wait for the red to disappear for a moment, and apply a moisturizer. You will feel it a little heavy, but it will go away. This is only an option that I put because some people need moisturizer for controlling the oils and some people don&#x27;t. Exfoliate once a week for delicate skin. This is important because exfoliation can irritate the skin when doing it more than once. (Optional) use a steamer to help open the pores and make your skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results of having clear skin will take a while. The mask takes of all of the dead skins and helps fix the damaged ones. People have experienced to have more pimples for a couple of weeks until their skin got used to it. Remember, not every skin is the same but this is something that I can relate to people the most. There are so many products that don&#x27;t help for people with combination skin and it does stink. But this mask can really help and I&#x27;m so glad it makes my skin feel baby soft and has caused many pimples to disappear after the first application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to all the boys and girls that have read this! I have faith that you will achieve your goal of having clear and soft skin. :)e done- you will probably see your skin turn red but that is said in the instructions that it&#x27;s a normal result.

            <li> I have repeatedly tried to reach the manufacturer of this product as I can&#x27;t get it to mix properly due to an inventory tag being placed OVER the instructions - At this point would prefer to return this product since I can&#x27;t use it as directed.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting this for so long! Finally after reading lots of reviews I decided to purchase it. I have to say i am so glad i did. I have been using it for about 1 month now and have seen a dramatic change in my skin. My pores are way smaller, I hardly ever break out now (mind you I never really had bad acne). It does smell funny once mixed with the apple cider vinegar but nothing I can&#x27;t handle. Shipping and packaging were great and you definitely get quite a bit for the price, I feel like i haven&#x27;t even made a dent in it yet. Overall this is an amazing product and I recommend it to anyone wanting to change up their beauty regimen with something more natural and not chemically. Once I am finished with this one I will definitely purchase another one!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this mask, it was unlike any mask I&#x27;ve ever tried. You can feel your skin tightening, and slight tingling too. It does take a while to dry, and leaves you a little red after removal, so make sure you have some down time before applying. It leaves my skin smooth and clean, I even notice my pores look smaller. I&#x27;m yet to try it with apple cider vinegar so I&#x27;d love to see how that works. I&#x27;ve gotten a few friends to try it and they love it as much as I do</li>
            <li> This is a must have. Found out about product on YouTube. Add water or organic apple cider and it gives you a nice cleansing mask. I like it but may not be for everyone.</li>
            <li> As a 30+ daily makeup wearing woman, hormonal breakouts and congested pores are my biggest issue.  I wanted to try this because I heard it was good, but I had no idea I would like it this much.  Although, no where does it say in the instructions to peel or chisel this stuff off... I tried to get most of the dried on mask in the trash so it wouldn&#x27;t clog my drain (as other reviewers said it would.)  In order to do this, I peeled and scraped a lot of the mask off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the process of peeling it off, I realized this stuff really does get into the pores.  How?  Well, if you have ever used the &amp;#34;Biore&amp;#34; Pore Strips or something like that... the best part, ripping the strip off to see the forest of pore clogging stuff stuck to it.  Well, that is exactly what I saw when I was able to get a good piece of the mask off and held it to eye level.  I saw that there were some blackheads and tons of other pore clogging debris on the surface.  When seeing that, I thought this really does grab all of the junk that my cleanser and makeup remover towel leaves behind on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing the rest of the mask off, my face was really red.  I put my usual moisturizer on and within 15 minutes, it was back to normal but super soft and REALLY clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few things:&lt;br /&gt;-The pulsating/tightening is really noticeable the longer the mask is on and starts to dry up.  I made the mistake of walking really fast and the cold air really enhanced the tightening/drying of the mask almost the point of a little pain, but maybe it was the pain of ripping out all of the pore clogging junk?&lt;br /&gt;-I mixed 6 tablespoons of clay with equal parts of raw apple cider vinegar, it made too much!  I think 3 tablespoons of each would be sufficient for a face mask about a 1/4 thick.&lt;br /&gt;-The smell is really not that bad.  Don&#x27;t let the recommended apple cider vinegar turn you away.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! Give it one week and you will love the improvement of your skin I use facials all the time and this is by far the best working one and made with all natural product! Very satisfied customer</li>
            <li> This clay is a great addition to my weekly skin care regiment! I use once weekly for 20 min. It has helped me with my oily skin and large pores. Pimples will shrink overnight! It comes in powder form so a little bit goes a long way. Make sure to use a plastic spoon and bowl to mix, not metal. I definitely suggest purchasing a mask mixing set like the one in the photo. I use braggs organic apple cider vinegar as the mixing agent.</li>
            <li> Works very well for making your own toothpaste.  Find recipes on the internet.</li>
            <li> So incredible!  Wish I took a before and after photo!  Im 45 and have had blackheads on my nose for 20 years.  nothing ever worked to get rid of them.  THIS WORKED!  part of my regular routine and so so worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Ive been using it twice a week but haven&#x27;t seen results. Can anyone tell me how much I should mix with vinegar im not sure if ive been using it correctly can you let me know what way is best to help me</li>
            <li> I mix mine with apple cider vinegar and I apply it once a week at night. My skin is slightly red after taking it off, but the next morning my skin looks amazing. I do think it helps with controlling acne outbreaks and blackheads. Would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so smooth and feels so clean!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this stuff!</li>
            <li> very good mask. its so messy.</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for years. Still love it.</li>
            <li> hard to use, clumpy, powder everywhere and it didnt show much improvement</li>
            <li> First let me say that the item arrived very quickly.  I mixed about 2 tablespoons up with an equal amount of apple cider vinegar, to make a thick paste.  Mix really well.  Then I applied a thin layer over my washed face.  Then I went back and added a thicker layer, just to make sure that the mixture got into my pores.  First it started to tingle a little bit, then my entire T-zone was tingling then it got a little itchy as it dried.  It took about a half hour to dry. (at times like this I envy those who don&#x27;t wear glasses).  Then I washed it off with very warm water and a wash cloth.  Skin was a little bit red but not very noticeable.  I really like it and will use again. Highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> Still have last, last.</li>
            <li> very good product for the price</li>
            <li> I was skeptical reading the reviews on this, but after trying it, it is all that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a nice wide mouth tub with a screw lid, easy for scooping out product.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is kinda herbal, not overpowering in any way tho. I mixed mine with apple cider vinegar, into a pudding like paste and slapped it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this stuff dries, it really shrinks and pulls. I walked past a mirror and caught a glimpse of myself and was startled. It had tightened my skin tremendously. My eyes looked stretched out like Droopy Dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I rinsed I was seriously surprised at how nice my skin looked, fresh and clear. Like I had just gotten a $200 facial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record I have 40 year old combination skin, sometimes it seems oily and dry all at once. I felt like this product really helped with combination issue. For the low price, the amount you receive and results I can easily see this being a staple in my beauty regime.</li>
            <li> This natural calcium bentonite clay is especially great for oily skin. It has been used in India for thousands of years and I have been using it for 30 years, it&#x27;s really no secret that it helps cleanse the pores and tighten the skin. It used to come in little pieces in plastic bags when I was growing up but now it&#x27;s ground and sold in a jar by Aztec Secret. USA is one of the biggest producers of this clay but it is also mined in several countries around the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a natural cleanser, and is also used to clean marble of all impurities as marble is a porous stone. The Taj Mahal in India is being restored slowly to its former glory to take away the grime built up with the ages by applying this clay to it and scrubbing away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was a teenager with oily skin I would mix this earth with a little cucumber juice (grate a cucumber and squeeze through a cheesecloth) and a few drops of honey and apply it as a mask. It took care of any acne and left my skin glowing. Nothing worked better for my skin, really!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works best with oily or combination skin. For dry skin it&#x27;s best to mix it with a little moisturizing agent like milk cream and honey (and a little water) to apply so it does not dry your skin out. It really cools the skin and according to age old wisdom and is best applied in summer months as it can be too drying for winter. There are some active compounds in it and it can be strong so don&#x27;t apply it to very delicate or sensitive skin before testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does tend to get everywhere so tie your hair back but remember it washes off and does not typically leave any stains. In fact, in India some even use it for shampooing the hair, so it&#x27;s definitely not bad for hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead, use this ancient beauty secret and enjoy your glowing skin!</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Works great!!!</li>
            <li> The product arrived in time, it was in good conditions. It works great although I haven&#x27;t used it with vinegar, I used it with water and the consistency wasn&#x27;t thin and smooth but my face felt like it was being cleansed and getting tighter by the minute. It left a bit of temporary redness when I took it off but my face appreciated the mask, my skin was noticeably better.</li>
            <li> Overall I think it was a really good product. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things to try to cleanse my skin but nothing ever really worked. This did work really well for me. I also feel like I&#x27;m at a spa resort when I put it on. Overall it worked for me but I think everyone&#x27;s skin is different and might not work for you as well as it did for me. But i would say it&#x27;s worth a shot at trying because the price is pretty decent.</li>
            <li> Amazing you really do feel your face pulsate I mix this with water and works just fine I started breaking out on my forehead a lot and after washing off the facial it was almost all gone</li>
            <li> I received my clay today. I already did my first treatment So I will share with you all on how it took me 2 min to mix,  2 min apply and no mess. I grabbed a zip lock bag and placed 1oz of apple cider vinegar and 1oz of water. I mixed the water and acv in the bag and then poured  little bits of the clay into the bag, I locked the zip bag and gave it shakes until I got the consistency I was looking for, adding more clay as needed.  I used a makeup brush to apply it evenly. After I applied it, I sat back and read some of the reviews and I felt exactly what was posted; the tingling, the  pulling, the pulsations, etc. Once my 20min were up, I went to my bathroom, grabbed a few sensative babywipes and turned on the hot water and gently cleansed off the clay. I let the hot water run in my sink to make sure my sink doesn&#x27;t clog. So far so goog. Quick, easy, and no mess. I&#x27;m in my late 30s and suffer from cystic acne, scars, and skin discoloration...so I&#x27;m hoping that this will really be as magical as many of the reviews claim.  I will update in a few weeks to see if I notice any magical results. Good luck everyone,  may all our skins become soft and youthful like a baby&#x27;s bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I gave it 4 stars onlybecause it&#x27;s too soon to see results, however, I did feel it work. I applied rose oil on my face when I was done.</li>
            <li> literally amazing. use apple cider vinegar instead of water though because water has a higher ph level and will damage your skin more and cause more of the &amp;#34;redness&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is not my first time purchasing this product.  First time from this seller.  Price isn&#x27;t too bad.  Really good as a facial.  Pulls out the oil, dirt, etc.  Also, it is good to use as a hair mask! It gives a very deep condition.</li>
            <li> if you have ance this is the best...&lt;br /&gt;but its strong and leave it only for 20 minutes less</li>
            <li> This will do wonders to any skin dilemma you may have! You can literally feel it working ! Your face begins to pulse as it starts to dry and you can feel the toxin leaving !!</li>
            <li> Great for itchy eczema skin ! Going through topical steroid withdrawal this is helpful going through an itchy flare. I just cant use ACV apple cider vinegar so I mix with water.</li>
            <li> This facial mask is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a slight issue with acne (pimples, blackheads, and some dark spots) and it definitely works to help rid your face of any redness, dark spots, and acne contributors. I have even applied a thin layer of the product underneath my eyes because of their dark pigmentation, and the effect of this was more than amazing!&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve only used this product twice a week for two weeks, yet the results are far more exceptional than I had expected. So I thought it deserved a five star review.</li>
            <li> I have not used many face products and have abused my face by not giving it the care it needed. Now that I am in mid 30s, I see that all the years of negligence is showing up. Thankfully, I am blessed with good skin that makes me look like late 20s, but regardless I know that I am very close to showing signs of aging :). I recently started noticing wrinkles on my forehead and I was very depressed and started looking online for a remedy. I used this clay the day I got it and I felt like my face was cemented. It was that tight when it dried up. I took it off and I looked grey for a while. Next day I felt that my face was very fresh and had some kind of glow. I would not say that it had done anything to the wrinkles on my forehead though and I did not expect it to do wonders either, but it did do something that made me fall in love with this product. I am going to use it twice a week may be to see what it could do. Will update my review if it does anything to the &amp;#34;experience and wisdom&amp;#34; signs on my forehead :)</li>
            <li> What everyone else has said but I would like to add that if you mix it with water it doesn&#x27;t blend as well as when you mix it with cider vinegar. I used water the first time because I was afraid the vinegar would be too harsh for my very sensitive skin. It was clumpy and hard to use. Mixing it with vinegar it&#x27;s smooth and spreads easily. It does great things for my skin.</li>
            <li> Great facial mud masque.  Helped dry acne.  You get a ton of product for the price.</li>
            <li> Works well. Bought and took to Jamaica for MR because her face was having a very hard time with acne</li>
            <li> I was super excited about this product and all it&#x27;s reviews but I had no idea I needed cider viniger or what ever. So I tried the product with water and put it on- ur said 30 mins. I was thinking ill just leave it on all night BAD MISTAKE. I woke up an hour later barely able to open my mouth because it dried up on my face.&lt;br /&gt;It hasn&#x27;t done anything for me her but I guess time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;Also it says 1/2 to a 1/4 of an inch to put on your face. How am I supposed to do that? It gets all lumpy and when it says to smooth out the bumps it gets all watery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the hype is about with this stuff. For me, it didn&#x27;t exfoliate my skin any better than just scrubbing my face with a washcloth. The only differences are that this product takes 10 times as much effort and I had to smell vinegar for 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess people just like putting goop all over their face because it makes them feel like they&#x27;re at a spa or something.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a last ditch effort to save myself a trip to the dermatologist and I am beyond thrilled. After I gave birth to my first child, my skin erupted in horrible cystic acne that required months of oral and topical antibiotics to treat (I had flawless skin prior to pregnancy, even through my adolescence so this was particularly rough for me). Since then, I have added birth control pills to further attempt to control the moderate acne that remained. Despite this and having a strict cleansing and make-up regime I have continued to be plagued with black heads, weird white heads living beneath my skin, too-frequent pimples, and of course the scarring and hyperpigmentation from the cysts. I used this product 5 out of 7 days my first week and it brought out an incredible amount of gunk. I had a few large pimples that either shrunk or came to a head with continued use, it dried out my existing bumps, and has brought so many black heads to the surface so that they can be removed. My scarring and hyperpigmentation have remained but I&#x27;m pretty sure that both will take time to improve and the scarring is likely permanent so I&#x27;m not blaming this product at all. I wish I could have found this product years ago instead of struggling with various other over the counter(some very pricey) products</li>
            <li> Best mask that I have ever used.  My dark circles are clearing up, my skin feels so smooth,</li>
            <li> I usually get facials at the spa, but this is a great product for use between visits.  Very pleased with it so far.  Skin looks great.</li>
            <li> I loved it..it doesn&#x27;t over dry your skin it leaves it really smooth and your skin looks refreshed no smell what so ever i use it ones week works great i actually told my sister about it now she has it and she also loves it i would highly recommend this product..</li>
            <li> I went through the greenbelt in austin the other day, its enormous, lush and beautiful. Anyway, inevitably i ran through plenty of brush and had a bad break out on my face. People thought i had ran into a swarm. I put this secret stuff on right when i got home and when i rinsed it off and waited 5 minutes( this stuff pulsates your skin, nothing uncomfortable though.) Looked in the mirror and my face was smoother and better than it had been in the past without any trace of the allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now that you now about the secret stuff don&#x27;t tell anyone else</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, does the job!</li>
            <li> this product broke me out terribly each time I used it...wasted my money</li>
            <li> NEVER USE IT！！！You will feel your face is burning after you let it on for 20 mins. And you will wake up with more acne and redness in the next morning. The producer may buy some good reviews from co,. If you are an acne sufferer, do not use it unless you want to make your face worse. I start to doubt some reviews on Amazon now.</li>
            <li> i bought it to my mom and she really love it</li>
            <li> best cleaning mask ever. Recommend it!</li>
            <li> It does the job but it&#x27;s a bit messy to mix up so I find I don&#x27;t use it often.</li>
            <li> Part of my beauty routine, really enjoy mixing with apple cider vinegar to cleanse the face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this as I use it for the first time.  I opened the jar and some of it came out on the counter.  So, I advise you to open it in the sink.  I used a glass bowl and a wooden spoon to mix the ACV in.  I put the bowl in the kitchen sink (garbage disposal side) and did all my mixing there so if there was a mess it would be contained.  I used 1/4 cup of the powder and a 1/4 cup of ACV.  I didn&#x27;t have any problems with clumping.  I used the back of the wooden spoon to shellac my face and neck and put some of the leftover on a trouble spot on my leg which has been showing signs of KP. I ran hot water into the bowl and on the spoon for a while so it wouldn&#x27;t stick.  So far, it hasn&#x27;t been messy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At about 12 minutes in I did feel the \\&quot;pulsating\\&quot; sensation others have mentioned, mostly around my nose and temples.  No itching or burning so far.  I&#x27;m doing a deep conditioner while I&#x27;m at.  Some did get on my hairline. I can rinse it out with the conditioner.  1/2 an hour in it&#x27;s still not completely dry. So, I&#x27;m going to go for another 15 minutes and see if that does it.  Don&#x27;t know how my face is going to turn out but my hair is loving all this time with the conditioner in.  At 40 minutes it is itching a little around my neck.  It&#x27;s completely dry there.  It&#x27;s still a little muddy around my face so I think I&#x27;ll wait a little longer. I have an evil, evil blackhead on my face that is very difficult to get out and I&#x27;m hoping this helps.  My skin tends to be rather dry in spots but overall, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s normal.  I don&#x27;t have acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 45 minutes, it&#x27;s finally dry.  It took a little while to get it off.  I used a warm, sopping wet, washcloth to gently coax it off at the kitchen sink.  It took about 5-6 minutes to get it off. I am in no hurry and I sure don&#x27;t want to rip it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It hurt a little in some parts but not screaming pain.  My face is red.  The evil black head actually came out after a little coaxing which is a miracle because normally I have to get a facial for it to come out.  I have never been able to clear it on my own.  My face feels really warm and very soft.  The bit I put on my leg is still muddy so I&#x27;m going to wash out the conditioner while it finishes drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed out the conditioner and the bit on my leg is still muddy. My face is still red 15 minutes later.  I slathered on moisturizer.  I expect it will go away soon.  I&#x27;m not going anywhere tonight so its not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The evil blackhead has been banished.  If I have any other effects I will post them but it did what I wanted it to do.  I&#x27;m pleased.use normally I have to get a facial for it to come out.

            <li> This stuff does not work for me at all. I have my cheeks full of acne and I have blackheads on my nose, but this stuff did not help take any of it off. I have a brown tanned face, I tan very easily and my face has oily t-zone, but dry cheek area which doesn&#x27;t explain the acne on my cheeks. The clay hurts my face.  its so time consuming to come off, since I recommend not washing it off straight in your bathtub or sink; the material turns into dirt once it dries so you would not want that clogging your drains. I tried mixing it with apple cider vinegar first then water; none of the mixtures gave me positive results.</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing and natural product! It leaves your skin feeling clean and smooth and definitely treats acne. I leave it on from anywhere between 25 minutes through an hour. Make sure you wash your face before using. After using the mask, I apply witch hazel toner and a moisturizer. The mask can leave your skin feeling a tad bit dry depending on how often you use it - great for oily skin!</li>
            <li> A great product, did use on teeth as it did whiten them.</li>
            <li> This s*** is amazingggggg . I kid you not . I don&#x27;t have bad acne but I do have acne spots from being hard headed and popping them ... This right here gets the job done hands down!!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works so well. I use it on my face every 2-3 days and it always clears my face up and leaves it feeling so soft and clean. Love this stuff kinda messy but well worth it</li>
            <li> Received this clay very fast from the seller. Would purchase again from this seller.  This product i&#x27;ve researched and researched. I received it on friday and tried it immediately with bragg&#x27;s organic apple cider vinegar.  I felt my skin pulsate and left it on for 25 minutes.  I have moderate acne from switching different birth control. I&#x27;ve been getting regular facials to try and clear my skin but to no avail. I went from having clear skin to problem skin in a years time.  I researched this clay and decided to try it. I&#x27;m glad i did.  It&#x27;s a little hard to remove but overall pleased with the results.  It brought some clogged pores I had to the surface and got rid of the large pores around my nose.  The blackheads I had on my nose are gone.  This has cleared up my face.  It was red for 30 mins after I washed it off but the difference in pore size and skin clarity made such a huge difference.  Matter of fact I have this mask on right now as I&#x27;m typing this review.  At this price, what do you have to lose ? Try it, it just might work for you too.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stress enough how much I love this stuff. When you first put it on its a bit scary but it works wonders. I will suggest you mix it with the apple cider and not water.</li>
            <li> Good stuff skin feels new and refreshing!!!!</li>
            <li> I think it depends of each one, for me it wasn&#x27;t effective at all. I didn&#x27;t feel anything and I didn&#x27;t see any change in my skin.</li>
            <li> Smoothed out my skin immediately. I&#x27;m 37 and don&#x27;t really have acne anymore but I had big pores. This product definitely reduced my pore size. It also evened out my skin tone after only 1 use!</li>
            <li> I like the cream but it leaves your skin feeling dry but other then that its really good</li>
            <li> Deep cleans your skin. You can definitely feel the pull on your pores as the mask dries.  I have only used it 3 times but i like it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even how to begin describing this amazing product. It surprises me at so many levels! Great, clean skin is what I was looking for when I first bought the product and I&#x27;m more than happy to share that this product delivers on promise. I&#x27;d be the first to admit that the name doesn&#x27;t do the product justice but it definitely does what a face mask is supposed to do -- get the gunk out from your skin and prevent further blemishes. I can say with absolute certainty that I&#x27;ll be back for more as soon as I am done with the first bottle ! Get yours today.</li>
            <li> I have used this clay mask for about 4 years now. I&#x27;m re-writing this review because since then I have modified my formula. I use about two table spoons of the clay, a quarter size of coconut charcoal, a quarter size amount of coconut oil, and finally I add some of Braggs Organic apple cider vinegar until I get a good consistency. I feel the mask is easier to take off with the coconut oil and I add the coconut charcoal in order to kill off any bacteria. I had great results from Origins high priced charcoal clay mask and figured if I added the charcoal to the Aztec Clay the outcome would be the same. So far the results are just as good as when I used the origins charcoal mask.</li>
            <li> This clay isn&#x27;t a miracle worker but it comes CLOSE</li>
            <li> Been using ummm maybe 2-3 weeks now. I&#x27;ll give it some more time since I only use it once a week maybe twice. My skin is so bipolar so it takes time for it to see results with anything. I like it so far. I would advise if u are only making it for a single use, then use maybe a 1/4 tsp and add as you go. Little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a whole lot from this, especially as I&#x27;ve tried what feels like everything for my acne prone skin for the last 15 years. I am fairly picky about what I put on my skin as it&#x27;s gotten to where I just try to not do anything to aggravate it, hahaha. I mixed mine with water, didn&#x27;t have any apple cider vinegar on hand and I haven&#x27;t found any raw locally. It is a bit gloppy and takes some work to get it on your skin as thick as they advise. I did actually feel my skin pulsating and there is a nice cooling effect also (I&#x27;ve used it 2X so far since ordering). There isn&#x27;t a noticeable odor. When I took it off of my face (I usually pull off the big chunks and then use a warm wash rag to gently remove the rest) I will admit my skin looked like it was glowing and it felt super clean. Like others have said it seemed to help bring stuff (you all know what it is and I don&#x27;t want to gross you out hahahaha) to the surface so it can be removed more easily. It doesn&#x27;t over dry for me, but I do have oily skin and things don&#x27;t over dry my skin normally. If you have dry skin you may want to moisturize after. I really like it, especially for the price you can&#x27;t beat the clean feeling and it didn&#x27;t aggravate my skin even days after. I&#x27;m very pleased and would recommend it :).</li>
            <li> I never care to write a review for any product but I just hope this can help someone out there. This is a heaven sent to people suffering with acne. I ordered this for my sister after staying up late reading lots of reviews. Warning..this may be a long review...I had to hold in my tears everytime I looked at her. Her beautiful face was covered with acne. It was rapidly taking away her confidence.  My sister was going thru a major hormonal acne phase. It was only getting worst. She tried almost everything over the counter. Finally gave in and seeked a dermatologist. He prescribed antibiotics and topical cream that cost almost $300. It only made her face even worst. At this point, she had given up hope. Her whole face was inflamed. She cried every time she looked in the mirror. So glad I stayed up that one night and made this purchase. Once we received this mask, she used this product mixed with apple cider vinegar as advise by other buyers. Started noticing her skin more drier than normal. Pimples were starting to dry up. Slowly but surely no more new pimple!!! She&#x27;s been doing the mask daily and her face has totally cleared up after 2-3 wks. FINALLY!!! Her skin is flat. Nothing forming under her skin. Thank god!! Now she only has scars but it better than having a faced that is inflamed with cystic acne. She still insist on using the mask daily cuz she doesnt want the acne to come back. If you haven&#x27;t found a product to stop your stubborn acne from taking over ur face and life..look no further. This is not only inexpensive, but it God sent for you to gain back your self confidence again..buy it!!</li>
            <li> I use this a few hrs ago and my skin feels and good good. The only bad thing I would say about this clay is it really made me face itch while it was on.</li>
            <li> Feels good, just really messy and would prefer more detailed directions</li>
            <li> One of the best face masks on the market. Best face mask under $60 hands down!</li>
            <li> Can definitely feel this working!</li>
            <li> WOW, This stuff is amazing, and one jar will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I tried this for the past three months and I will never be without it. I have mostly oily skin, especially around my nose and I break out almos all the time on my chin, a history of cystic acne on either side of my mouth since age 19. I am now 34 and after years of different systems I found this clay to be the most effective part of my routine. I use it every other day. I mix 1 tbs of clay and one tbs of organic apple cider vinegar (essential) and let it fiz while I mix it. I apply it and let it sit on my face until it&#x27;s almost completely dry. I use a warm wet washcloth to wash it off. I then apply my zit cream. Followed by lotion. I can say that while it may be weird and uncomfortable, the results are worth every second. It has even gotten rid of old acne scars. Pores are pretty much gone. My boyfriend is a diesel mechanic and this is sometimes the best thing to clean his oil and brake dust encrusted nose pores. This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> INSTENSE when it&#x27;s drying and also leaves your skin extremely dry if not followed up with coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;I also use ponds daily to make sure to keep moisturized.</li>
            <li> I am an esthetician and here is my review based on actually using the mask...&lt;br /&gt;First, if you have oily skin and aren&#x27;t very sensitive, use the apple cider vinegar for mixing; if you are sensitive use distilled water. Second, DO NOT USE ON YOUR ENTIRE FACE more than once a week. This mask is powerful and literally pulls EVERYTHING (water, dirt, oil, etc) out. If you use it on your entire face too often, it will cause your skin to over compensate for the loss of healthy moisture and oil, which will bring more unwanted oil production and breakout. My advice is to spot treat acne and to leave it on those spots overnight (do NOT leave on your entire face overnight). By morning you should see a noticeable difference. Also, while this clay is awesome, you still need to figure out the root cause of your acne and get on a healthy skin care and diet routine to really combat any skin issues.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Has really helped the look and condition of my skin to be smoother and have less breakouts and blackheads.</li>
            <li> My brother and mother swear by this. I occasionally catch them walking around with their masks on. They say nothing but great things. They always mention the fact that you can actually feel it cleaning while your wearing it. My mother was very happy with it because it was actually recommended by her dermatologist.</li>
            <li> You see results quickly! Although I never made a clay mask before I also bought the homemade clay small mix bowl. Defiantly recommend for anyone with blemishes</li>
            <li> Love this face mask! I&#x27;ve tried lots of them but this one left my skin glowing!</li>
            <li> This stuff is ok. It helps soften up some blackheads I had but by no means is it that great. I still breakout and it dries out your skin so bad. I do use it once every two week to help with softening black heads. A Baking soda mask worked better for my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product highly recommend it ! I get pimples only when my period is coming or I&#x27;m stress so I&#x27;ll clean my face and hardly works but this product is great and the only thing is you use it once a week</li>
            <li> totally worth the hype! Not only did this clear my skin but the next day the size of your blemishes were literally gone!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for the keratosis pilaris that I have on my arms and legs but so far I&#x27;ve only used it on my face. It is amazing and makes my skin super soft. I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I mix it 1/1 with raw apple cider vinegar. Mix, mix, mix until all the lumps are out and it&#x27;s like a thick mousse. Then I slather it on and let it dry until it feels like my face is going to crack apart. I&#x27;ve found a microfiber cloth takes it off much easier than a washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels cleaner afterwards, more plump (probably from the pulsing), and most of my sebaceous filaments are gone (until the next morning). I do this once a week and keep a jar of the leftover in the fridge to treat any breakouts during the week. The mask dries new pimples out, usually just overnight, so they can start to heal and go away faster. It also exfoliates. And this jar should last me a very long time, a year at least, maybe two or three.</li>
            <li> awesome. good for making pores smaller. I just use any apple cider vinegar not just raw apple cider one. good</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I tried it- I have twice. I don&#x27;t see what the hype is about.&lt;br /&gt;I used it with vinegar once, water the second time. I never felt the &amp;#34;pulsating&amp;#34; and didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> 1981 called and wants its skin care product back - nothing new here.  Just a clay cleanser that makes a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My new favorite is the Real Chemistry 3 Minute Peel.  Modern, clean, fast, and OMG, the results warrant a mention in the Skin Bible!  I got mine at [...]  I use it once a week to exfoliate my skin.  It takes just 1-2 minutes and I can&#x27;t believe how good my skin looks after using this amazing product.  Forget clay - join this century and check out what modern science can do for you.  I highly recommend.....</li>
            <li> As a young adult and with my hormones constantly changing, I&#x27;ve experienced some breakouts which in turn have affected my self esteem and made me picky about the environments I go into. I have tried MULTIPLE products such as Proactive, Clearasil, Neutrogena, Avon, you name it and most of them only worked for a week or two and then my face would go back to normal or even become worst; at times I acquired some scars. This mask is totally different! With the combination of a soap that I use I have not only cleared present or prevented future breakouts but I have been able to diminish the scares that I have acquired over the years. You can feel this mask working after few minutes of putting it on with the tightening of your skin. I would recommend this to anyone &amp; everyone!</li>
            <li> My face definitely improved with this clay mask. It lasted over 4 months for me. This will be my go-to mask.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great at cleaning pores and ridding my face of blackheads. The trick is to use the product with RAW apple cider vinegar. Using with vinegar creates the pulsing sensation that is often mentioned. Overall i use this product 3 times a week. My skin is clearly and remarkably soft. Make sure to use a moisturizer because it can make your face quite dry.</li>
            <li> When you open it it&#x27;s like a big jar of dirt that you have to mix on your own.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you...if you ever want to know what it&#x27;s like to have a black hole on your face then all you have to do is get this product. If you mix it just right not only will you feel pulsating and tightening, you will feel as if your face has moved( such as your lips puckering) but it really hasn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s pretty amazing. I leave it on for as long as I want or can take. It doesn&#x27;t burn me or anything(though it did burn one of my friends with bad acne, but I think that was a good sign.) It just kind of sets me in stone. I make sure that when I mix it with Bragg&#x27;s Organic Apple Cider that the texture is silky and whipped. No clumps! I have seen that some use water but meh...I say go by the actual directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think one of the misconceptions about a product like this is that your face becomes smooth when you scrub it off. This stuff is extremely hard to get off like that. I recommend taking a rag and soaking it with warm water and dabbing it generously on the clay so that it softens somewhat. THEN scrub/wipe it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only do this once a week because my skin is pretty normal and do not want to dry it out. So far the best benefit this clay has given is it&#x27;s blackhead loosening. I always put a nose strip on right after I wash this off. When I pull that thing off I get almost all the blackheads on my nose. It makes me very happy. Now I know some people have T-Zone blackheads so I am sure you could also use strips on your chin and forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is relatively inexpensive and the apple cider is too. It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> Love it! Couldn&#x27;t get rid of my acne, this stuff is clearing up my face. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and I&#x27;m so pleased, I will definitely buy more. I do use it every day if not a minimum of 4 days a week. I mix it in a glass container with a lid so I don&#x27;t waste any of it.</li>
            <li> The pulsing is really an amazing feeling. Don&#x27;t leave it on any longer than the 15-20 minutes recommended since it can be kind of intense and irritating though. I used half Braggs apple cider vinegar and half water, applying with a brush, and it left my face soft and I was able to extract some white heads and sebaceous filaments after removing it. I highly recommend using a lint-free wash rag and warm water to remove the clay at the sink (or in the shower) as it feels much better than a normal rough washcloth. Don&#x27;t use any other acne/cleansing products for the day you use this as your skin will burn (you&#x27;ve removed a layer of your skin by using this, so especially no chemical exfoliates for that day!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little uncomfortable once the drying starts. I found my forehead and around my nose to be especially bothered while it was drying on my skin. After about 15 minutes I couldn&#x27;t wait to get it off. With any acne treatment there is pain however, and I feel like this has helped so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It works okay. I like it better than most face masks. I think it does better.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it does help to clear my pores. I noticed that on the first two weeks using the mask, my skin was a bit aggravated. However, on the third week onward, my face starts to feel smooth and the pimples are reduced in size and number. Great product at great price!</li>
            <li> Struggling with acne since my late teens (now in my mid-20&#x27;s) this product mixed with apple cider vinegar has been one of the only things to relieve my acne. I Have been using the mask for about a month, and have had no deep cyst pimples and the small ones are beginning to look better. Overall, I am exremely pleased by this product.</li>
            <li> Very deep cleaning and loving the way my skin has been feeling lately and also how closed my pores seem to have gotten.</li>
            <li> I really like this! I&#x27;ve been using this every day for about a month now - it&#x27;s entirely cleared up my cystic acne! Nothing I have ever tried works this well. I do still have a fair amount of acne - mainly whiteheads - but it is much, much better than before.  I use it with apple cider vinegar, and moisturize afterwards with Cerave Renewing Skin Lotion.</li>
            <li> I purchased the big jar and i am happy to say i will not regret it! It came in the mail, i opened it up and talked my boyfriend AND his brother into using it and we all love it! it makes you skin so nice and smooth, it seemed to have shrunk the few pimples i have on my face and my pores and actually smaller. who would have thought, something that works for such a cheap price! we tried it with the water first, when i receive the apple cider vinegar i will have to update this about the experience if its that drastic. All in all, i am very please with this product and all 3 of us will be using this for a long time!</li>
            <li> For me, mixing with water worked better than mixing with apple cider vinegar. Also, be sure to mix well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this about four times already and I&#x27;d have to say my face really has decreased in the number of acne I have.. the funny thing is my acne discoloration has even looked like it&#x27;s decreasing I&#x27;m how dark they are. This product is really strong you actually feel the pulse on your face like the mask is pulling out all impurities from your pores and cleaning it.. I&#x27;d have to say im loving the four day use results and can&#x27;t wait to see how effective it&#x27;ll be after 1 month of use..&lt;br /&gt;Additionally I&#x27;d have to say do moisturize after with vitamin c or even serum that&#x27;ll help to heal the skin and reduce and redness while battling the dryness you experience soon after you take off your mask... I also spot treat my acne soon after with my 10% benzyl peroxide cream and this is helping to dry up the pimples faster..&lt;br /&gt;Trust when I say this stuff is really helpful for acne prone skin..</li>
            <li> Ive been struggling a lot with acne. And this helped clear up my acne a lot!!! Ive spent hundreds in acne products..but wow this is amazing. Ive read all the other reviews and followed what they did and dang i love this stuff!!!! I put it on once a week when i can remember ahhaa, but it really really smells like nasty ahaha because of the appl cider vinegar and two careful where you wash it off!!! It can seriously clog up your drains! I wash it off in a seperate bin of warm waterd drain it outside!</li>
            <li> I have used this product about 7 times now. It is by far the best clay mask I have ever used. Other masks cannot even compare! It gets a little intense while I wear it. I can actually feel my face throbbing. It is not painful, just unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can definitely see that my skin is brighter, and my skin tone has evened out. I have combination skin and mild acne. I bought it because I wanted to get rid of a number of ever-lasting, under-the-skin zits. Unfortunately the mask has not helped with my acne. I won&#x27;t blame it on the mask though. I live in a highly polluted and humid city that is terrible for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clay comes in powder form, and the instructions say to mix it with either water or apple cider vinegar. I highly recommend using apple cider vinegar. I used water the first 5 times, and no matter how much you stir, the clay will stay chunky. Apple cider vinegar makes the clay smooth and easy to apply (although it smells pretty gross). I used Braggs Raw Apple Cider Vinegar from the Vitamin Shoppe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for a good, deep clean. You will absolutely get one!</li>
            <li> My 15 year old son suffered from acne the last 2 years.  After numerous trips to a top dermatologist, prescription lotions and antibiotics that made him feel sick he decided to try something else.  If you mix this stuff WITH the BRAGG vinegar and do it nightly it is amazing.  His skin is truly the clearest I have ever seen it.  They say the vinegar with \\&quot;the mother\\&quot; works like a topical antibiotic.  Anyway, when used daily it works.</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair and face. It is a great product.  I would definitely buy this again</li>
            <li> I have always used face masks since my teenage years, mostly to combat acne as it occasionally flared. I am now 29 and for some reason my skin is out of control. I used my usual mint julep  but the pimples just smiled and kept swelling. I saw this on amazon whole browsing and had to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it goes on easy and dries like a .....desert. It pulls and tugs your skin in different directions to the point you can feel a pulsing feeling. It dragged my face and I kind of looked like a gangster Robert Deniro  I try to leave it on as long as possible, but often take it off before it is completely dry. My face will be temporarily red for about 30 minutes which is something I have never seen with other face masks. The skin feels tight and very smooth after removing the product. Getting the mask off can be a little challenge, even if you use copious amounts of warm water. The nice thing is that the gritty texture acts as a exfoliating scrub as you are removing it. The pimples look way better after the mask treatment. Not \\&quot;dried out\\&quot; exactly, although they are dryer than before the mask. Pimples are less inflamed, less red, and it even seems that it helps with post blemish hyperpigmentation (those lovely spots that linger after a pimple- varying shades of brown, red, purple etc..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tips-&lt;br /&gt;--I used a food processor to mix mine. I first mixed by hand and it turned out clumpy. I dumped equal parts into the little chopper/mixer and it made a nice smooth cream that was easy to change in thickness by adding fluid.&lt;br /&gt;--Use the raw apple cider vinegar, just order them together and don&#x27;t waste your time without it. Not only does it mix better than water, its a natural antiseptic, analgesic, and reduces inflammation. It can be used as a toner once it is watered down. One bottle lasts a long time, its very potent.&lt;br /&gt;--Make a bunch at once and put the remainder in a small Tupperware. The only thing I miss about mint julep is the easy to dispense squeeze bottle. No one wants to have to break out the powder, vinegar, bowl, spatula and spend time mixing every time you want a mask! If you make a decent quantity, its easier.&lt;br /&gt;--Read the directions and follow the directions on usage. It recommends applying 1/4to 1/2 inch on the face. Do you know how thick it is?. THICK! If you apply generously as recommended, you get the full benefit. It also seems to tighten the skin more, the more you put on. Go for it! It will take more than 10-15 minutes to dry, but whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think this is the best mud mask out there. I know its dirt, or whatever, and I know some people question what the reAl ingredients and authenticity of those ... It works, who cares!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work for a plastic surgeon, and this mask is better than most things we sell as far as a safe, all around facial treatment that has no downtime and can be used by any skin type, while allowing the ability to customize the intensity and effects by adding a diluted apple vinegar solution vs water, or  lighter vs heavier layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it every other night for the past week, and it has accelerated my non-healing pimples into smaller, manageable, HEALING PIMPLES. My skin isn&#x27;t really dry, but I can feel it starting to become dryer than normal, but, I&#x27;ve been hitting this mask hard so I expected that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its worth a try, its affordable and bullet proof. Plus, if you like to FEEL something to know its working, you will love this mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good luckut the powder, vinegar, bowl, spatula and spend time mixing every time you want a mask!

            <li> Feels like it&#x27;s really cleaning out your pores, gives a nice tingling sensation on your face. It is messy though compared to my other masks.</li>
            <li> I found it really hard to get a smooth paste, I mixed and mixed, and still had clumps ((I have since read the baggie idea which I&#x27;ll try next time and opt for vinegar instead of water).  I also found while applying, trying to add more to thin areas, it kinda removed what I had already put on, smeared it off to the point I could see my skin.  Maybe more practice.  But I must say, I prefer the ready made which I have also, and will probably go back to that.  I don&#x27;t think this felt any &#x27;tighter&#x27; or &amp;#34;pulsing&amp;#34; than any other I&#x27;ve used and involves more messy preparation.  I&#x27;ll finish it up, but not sure I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> My daughter, who is twenty yr old, bought this product after reading these reviews.  She has very fair, sensitive skin, as do I.  The difference is that I am over-twice her age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She fell in love with it- and I can easily see the great improvement on her skin.  Although I was skeptical and feared it would irritate or dry out my skin, I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels as if I just had a salon facial- soft, clean, healthy.  I love the way it feels as it dries and know that I&#x27;m not putting chemicals on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve just used it this once so far, but I am planning to use it bi-weekly.  My daughter and I will have to buy it by the keg!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say, after one use, that my skin feels and looks younger.  I used a little olive oil after washing it off.  I just used a warm wet towel to soften the hardened clay and it came off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would heartily recommend this product to my friends of all ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliation is usually too harsh for my sensitive fair skin, but this seems to have given me the benefit of exfoliation with no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed!  Try it and see for yourself.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what&#x27;s written on the bottle. I use it once a week, and I have to say, I&#x27;m in love with it. It&#x27;s nice rubbing your face with dirt. c:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said: DO NOT MIX WITH WATER&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT MIX WITH WATER&lt;br /&gt;DO. NOT. MIX. WITH. WATER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will end up with a clumpy, gross, nasty mess that will not be pleasant and leave you cursing the name of clay. Instead, mix with apple cider vinegar. Go ahead and buy a small bottle. I know, it sounds odd to have to rub that onto your face, but trust me, your skin will love you for it. The pH balance of the apple cider vinegar will not make you break out into terrible, horrible rashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you want to make a good clay mask, get about 1/16th of a cup (and I recommend a glass mixing bowl) and then get your apple cider vinegar. You won&#x27;t need a whole lot - and always err on the side of less. Less is more. 1/8th of a cup makes enough for me to cover the faces of me and my mom. . . with two coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, dribble just a little in. Make a little wet spot. It will crackle and fizz - congrats, the magic is working. Mix with a wooden spoon, and immediately, you&#x27;ll see the magic working. It&#x27;ll be smooth, clump-free, and although it smells faintly of apple cider, it&#x27;ll feel amazing. With the spoon, your fingers, or a brush (recommend the brush) apply it on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leave one for 30 minutes - or until it&#x27;s dry - and wash off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some faint redness is expected and normal, so don&#x27;t worry. I recommend a small dose of moisturize of your choice - my skin always felt a little dry after I took off the clay mask. If you have skin prone to breakouts, this is a great product to use. However, expect a minor flare up - clay tightens your pores and sucks out the oil that way, so it draws impurities to the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And don&#x27;t use this product more than once a week. Over exfoliating is bad for your skin!</li>
            <li> Am I supposed to use it everyday. ..I don&#x27;t see a difference on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Great for getting everything out of your face!</li>
            <li> Gotta love the bentonite clay!  It cleans and detoxifies ur skin to give you a clean feeling unlike other cleansers.  It is natural and easy to use.  Get some; ur skin will love it!</li>
            <li> Works great, like nothing I have ever used before.  I have oily/acne prone skin and this mask seems to help.  You cannot hardly talk when it is dry.  Really tightens pores.</li>
            <li> Tried all sorts of natural and chemical products. This stuff right here cut down my rosacea, skin-peeling, those under-the-skin acne-bumps that are annoying as hell.&lt;br /&gt;My skin isn&#x27;t perfect, but it is a whole lot better. I use apple cider vinegar when mixing which is also a cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get a ton of powder for not a lot of money. I love this stuff. Super surprised, will buy again.</li>
            <li> not bad, but a little trouble t</li>
            <li> Fantastiv product. It mixes best with the Apple Cider Vinegar. Love Love Love. Worth it to at least try.</li>
            <li> I mix this with equal parts apple cider vinegar and use it as a face mask - works great, my skin glows and is really soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> well, after reading the amazing reviews of pulsating face , i quite got curious about this product coz most of the reviews have said that.I ordered it and as soon as it came just couldnt stop trying it.i already have a apple cider vinegar from stop and shop so i decided to use it.As soon as i added it to the clay, it started to bubble a little bit but mixed thourougly.i put the mask on and was wondering if it was thin in consistency. i put it on the neck and ears too. After sometime, i felt that i was sweating on my forehead.i was a bit surprised coz its dead cold outside and the heaters would not make you perspire. i waited till all my mask dried up.it took me long than 30 minutes coz of the thin consistency.Surprisingly though i did not feel any pulsation but i sure had the sweating, tingling and a bit of tightening as the mask dried up which makes sense to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i decied to follow some of the reviews and took a bowl with some hot water and a cloth and cleansed everthing taking care not to over scrub it. i did not find my face red , neither any rashes but definitely felt a clarity in my skin. it could be due to the loss of top dead skin layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i decided to put some lotion on my face and when i was patting my face dry that is when i started feeling this weird sensation of heat leaving my face. At first i got scared and then i tot it could be my feeling. but i literaaly felt heat leaving my face for about say 5-8 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Horrified , i looked online for some information and that is when i came across a site which talks about a thermal mud face mask. it talks about a different clay but one from the volcanic ashes and claims to generate heat and produce perspiration to remove toxins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, i pretty much believe this product is similar to it and hence is doing its work.&lt;br /&gt;I am a little skeptic right now but will update the results after few uses.&lt;br /&gt;i gave a 4 star only coz of the amount of heat i felt leaving my skin.</li>
            <li> love how it feels and makes your skin feel afterwards</li>
            <li> A bit messy.  Apply once a week.</li>
            <li> The beeeeeeest solution to my acne-prone face thus far.&lt;br /&gt;I used this on my face every other day, but now I try to do it every three days since it does dry out the skin quite a bit. Mix it with apple cider vinegar and it works like magic :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this! It got ride of my acne after using it once for 3 weeks. This has worked better than any product I&#x27;ve used and for easy removal I wet a cloth and wipe it off my face. Only complaint I have is my skin feels kinda dry after but it&#x27;s most definitely worth it and it&#x27;s probably because I have sensitive skin. Also, this product seems to last longer and I made too much the first time so i kept plastic wrap over it and stuck it in the fridge and it seems to apply easier when its cold. :) But overall, I&#x27;m in love with this product and will definitely buy again when I run out!</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin with large pores and I&#x27;m prone to black heads. This stuff is AMAZING for clearing up my skin and making my black heads disappear. I have literally tried everything for my face and I make homemade masks and facial scrubs. I feel like I have finally found my product that works for me! Warning: the instructions say to mix equal parts clay and equal parts apple cider vinegar (or water.) If you have sensitive skin, use the water. The apple cider vinegar will burn slightly and leaves the skin red for at least 30 - 45 minutes however the apple cider vinegar seems to work better. Pinterest will have great ideas on what to mix in with bentonite clay to tailor a facial to your needs.</li>
            <li> My teenage son has suffered with very painful acne for about two years.  He has problems in his T-zone area.  His forehead is the worst.  His pimples start as large red bumps, and come to the surface as inflamed pustules.  He also has a bad problem with blackheads.  We&#x27;ve tried all the OTC treatments you can possibly think of (Proactiv, Neutrogena, AcneFree, etc...).  I had scheduled an appt. for him to meet with a dermatologist to see about getting SOMETHING that would help.  Well, after using this just ONE TIME I cancelled that appointment.  I was absolutely astounded at the improvement in just one application (I used [[ASIN:B001AIWAAE Bragg - Apple Cider Vinegar, 32 oz liquid]] to mix the clay).  I set the timer for 5 minutes and asked how his skin felt - I was concerned that it might start burning, irritating, etc.  He ended up wearing it the full 20 minutes and was only complaining of slight itching around his nose.  He rinsed it off gently in the shower.  He had a very slightly red face - just in the T-zone where I applied the mask - for about 15 minutes and then when I came back to check on his face about an hour later, it was amazing how the redness and inflammation (from the acne) had gone down.  The next morning (we did this at night) his skin looked amazingly improved.  It has worked better than any other treatment/product he has used.  This is a miraculous product and so cheap compared to all the other treatments I have purchased.  We are continuing with masks every 2-3 days and are continuing to see dramatic improvements.  He is extremely happy with how his skin is looking and is far less self-conscious about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking at [[ASIN:B000AMXR6C Thylox Acne Soap 3.25 Ounces]] to add to his regime since it&#x27;s gotten such good reviews for treating acne, as well.</li>
            <li> Way to clog you&#x27;re drains, had to higher a plumber</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It does get the skin very clean. You can feel it &#x27;pulsating&#x27; as some has described when it has been on your face for about 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing stuff. Works just as described. Only downside-- 1lbs for $10 when its 2lbs for $7 at other retailers with free shipping. I&#x27;ll keep buying the product but elsewhere next time.</li>
            <li> My face has NEVER been clearer!  I could tell a difference from the first use.  This magical powder pulls your face so tight, but the results are amazing!  My face was smooth, cleared up ALL zits within days, and is so amazing.  I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t find this sooner.  MUST BUY!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Mix with organic apple cider vinegar and use as a medical poltice or facial mask.  I have been using this product 20 years and am very happy with it.  A little bit goes a very long way so store in a cool dry place.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any blackheads no more! I&#x27;m really happy with this product and my mom too haha</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Have sensitive skin and 40 years old. Worked the first time I used it and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t regret buying this. I use this about every week to really get into my pores and clean them out and let me just say that this really works! My face has never felt softer and looked cleaner.</li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s really working on my dark spots. I mix up a sandwich bag with this stuff and some later and keep it so I can just use it every morning and every night when I shower. I also use it with another cleanser. So far so good!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!! Finally a break through in my skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 8 weeks now and it keeps my oiliness down without overdrying. Made my pores smaller but didn&#x27;t really clear up my blackheads. The label said it made your face pulsate, i didnt feel anything.</li>
            <li> Still in process of seeing any improvement</li>
            <li> Used this product for the first time this weekend and I did feel my face actually pulsate, and the feeling of my face afterward is nice as well. Overall it does what it says it will do</li>
            <li> Love it! It leaves my face feeling clean! I used it with apple cider vinegar alike it suggests to do and it worked really well! It does give a bit of a burning sensation as it drys, but it is just doing its job. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I must say this is the best facial I have ever purchased. I&#x27;m not usually into buying a bunch of creams and facials(mostly because they are expensive and hardly do anything), but this is fantastic. My skin is very delicate and sensitive, always has been, this makes using creams or other abrasive skin care products hard. This does not bother my skin at all (that is a miracle), in fact it sooths and heals. I have also suffered with acne and oily skin for years and I can always count of this to heal and rejuvenate my face. I actually feel and see the benefits. I leaves my skin feeling fresh, young, and clean. This awesome clay is also relatively cheap (compared to all the other acne medicines I&#x27;ve tried.) you can&#x27;t afford not to buy this. Probably the best purchase I have ever made for my skin. I will continue to be a faithful customer of this product.</li>
            <li> I tried various acne medications with little success.  At the same time, I haven&#x27;t tried many mask type products.  Nonetheless, I can&#x27;t imagine too many working as well as this product.  I applied it twice a week for the first 2-3 weeks then went to weekly use and it cleared up my face and keeps it that way.  As stubborn as my acne can be, it is no match for this stuff.</li>
            <li> This mask is absolutely amazing! I mix equal parts of the mask and Braggs Apple Cider Vineger. The only ACV I would ever use. I use this once or twice a week and it has really helped with my skin. You really feel how this just sucks everything  out of your pores, your face starts pulsating... That&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li> Love this product so much!</li>
            <li> So far so good. My daughter has some acne. I made a batch with water first. I have sensitive skin, so I didn&#x27;t want to use the vinegar. I have used it once,  but I didn&#x27;t see a big difference. Bit my daughter sees a difference in her skin and likes it. She uses it once a week right now.  I will make her a batch with the vinegar to see if she likes that one better.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> This says good for 10 uses, but I&#x27;ve covered my face in it now 4 times and hardly see a dent in the amount gone. I have had bad Psoriasis for about a year now around my nose and mouth. I&#x27;ve taken steroids prescribed by my dermatologist, anti fungal treatments, switched to raw milk and all natural skin and makeup products but nothing helped. I got this In hopes to clear up black heads but to my surprise after one use my Psoriasis was almost gone. After two it is totally gone!!!!!! I&#x27;m beyond happy. I leave it on for about an hour (until it&#x27;s totally dry) it hasn&#x27;t dried out my skin but must have pulled out the fungus that causes Psoriasis.  To use this product it comes dry in powder form, you add some to a bowl with water but the product is smoother if it has a day to sit mixed with the water. If you make too much it will mildew so to prevent this put it in a bowl with a lid and store any unused wet product in your freezer.</li>
            <li> Product arrived with seal broken, no inner seal, and product clearly missing from container.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;I use it once every two weeks or so, just because it is very very strong.&lt;br /&gt;You can literally feel it pulling dirt and blackheads to the surface and once you remove it with your face scrub or however, what is left is a very fresh and smooth feeling face. I love it so much. You only need a tiny bit to make the mask and it lasts FOREVER. Such a good price. Once I finish this one, I will definitely be buying another!</li>
            <li> So cheap but so amazing. I am in love with this holy grail of skin care. I have terrible combination skin, dark spots, and acne and it has cleared my face up so well. It leaves it feeling so soft. I mix Apple Cider Vinegar (BRaggs) with it and make it into a mask and I leave it on for at least an hour. I usually just watch a show on netflix while doing it. It&#x27;s messy to come off but it leaves your skin feeling buttery soft and it pulls the impurities out. This is my first review - I never write reviews but this product is so good I just had to tell the world.</li>
            <li> Nice product, my face is oily, and that product really help me, complete recommend that</li>
            <li> This mask works so well at pulling out impurities! My skin is sensitive and it did not leave me red at all! Love it!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product that I have been using for over two years. I&#x27;m an African American female and this product is good for remove oil and clogged pores. I wish I was pore to use it more often but I get lazy and it time consuming to mix it with the Apple cider vinger. This is must get if you want impurties sucked from your face!!!</li>
            <li> Posted a few detailed photos for others to see. I used it once so far. I&#x27;ve research alot of uses for it, so looking forward to the benefits. So far so good!</li>
            <li> Come &amp; try this bentonite clay...you can feel that it works even for using it the first time.</li>
            <li> Came so quickly, packaged good and safe.i got  Exactly what I ordered and use&lt;br /&gt;It every night, so do all my friends and family. Very popular and loved product! Will get it again</li>
            <li> Mix with a little water, make a paste...apply to clean skin and enjoy the super cleansing clay. Works well and sponges up all the oil your pores have to offer. Would definitely buy again. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> It did everything it claims in the description. I could definitely feel it pulsating and my skin was very smooth and tight after removing the mask. I recommend that you will want to listen to the other comments and DO NOT try pulling this off your face, it is very strong and you will tear your skin and it really hurts, I did it by mistake in a very small area and it really really hurt! It is worth the money and I can&#x27;t believe you get so much for the price. I have given some away and I still have enough to last a year. But I only use it on my face.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything for me. All it does is make my face red after for a while and my blemishes persist. It is also very messy to put on and take off.</li>
            <li> I used this once.  I did not care for it.  It made my face really itchy.  But it could have been because of the apple cider used to mix it with?</li>
            <li> As a teenager (almost in their 20&#x27;s) who has tried as what seems like forever to get clear skin, this is amazing. I started&lt;br /&gt;To get acne when I was in 4th-5th grade. I&#x27;ve tried proactive, been to dermatologists, tried every face wash that you can buy, and nothing had seemed&lt;br /&gt;to do its justice. I can honestly say that I have never had clear skin, not terribly bad, but never COMPLETELY clear.&lt;br /&gt;After using this for just one time, I woke up the next morning and noticed a huge difference. My sister and friends even noticed. I recommend this for anyone who especially has acne, or any kind of skin problem&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My method that I use is first putting tea tree oil on my face, you can buy 100% oils. Then just mix your paste and leave it on for about 15 minutes and then either wipe it off with a wet wash cloth or just water.&lt;br /&gt;For someone who has literally tried EVERYTHING. This is amazing highly recommend and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this product! I mix it with apple cider vinegar, as suggested on the package, and stir stir stir (with glass or plastic bowl and utensils, no metal) until I get a smooth mud-like consistency. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it being lumpy. You can literally feel it drawing the &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; out of your skin as it dries! I&#x27;m left with incredibly smooth and soft skin and my pores are considerably less noticeable. I could not be happier with this purchase. After using it for only a week, I&#x27;m already singing its praises to any friend or family member that will listen. Another friend that has been using a bentonite clay for years told me there are many other uses, so I plan to be experimenting soon. For now, just using it as a mask is giving me more than my money&#x27;s worth back in results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can take you a bit to figure out how much powder and liquid to mix. If you end up with too much, you can store it in a ziploc baggie or a glass jar and use the rest later. This way there is no waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it works so incredibly well, you may want to use a good moisturizer afterward. When I&#x27;m using it for acne or enlarged pores, I follow up with a dab of good quality coconut oil and a drop of tea tree essential oil. When I&#x27;m just using it to tighten and tone, I follow up with a good slather of rose hip oil (all of these can be purchased here on Amazon).</li>
            <li> Only used it a few times so far.  I am using it with some yogurt and honey or yogurt, seaweed powder and a few drops of vinegar as a face mask.  Face (n pores) looks clean after and feels tight..as in improved elasticity.  Hope to see more improvement in skin texture as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!! My skin feels incredible! Just make sure to moisturize afterwards.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to recieve this product but it just didn&#x27;t help my pores and blemishes. :/</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I typically have clear skin. My skin gets shiny by the end of the day, but it normally stays pretty clear. My big skin problem, however, is blackheads. I have them all over my nose, my chin, even sometimes on my cheeks and forehead! I&#x27;ve tried scrubs, strips, masks, lotions, and they&#x27;ve usually only helped minimally. Aztec Secret, however, is an answer to my desires! I have to use it in conjunction with other things; first, I scrub my skin with an exfoliant. Next, after patting my face dry, I mix the clay with the apple cider and spread it on my face. I leave it on for 15-20 minutes, as advertised, After I wash it off, I follow with Bior&amp;eacute; anti-blackhead strips, and voil&amp;agrave;! The blackheads have been loosened and suctioned up enough by the mask that the strips can completely finish the job! I absolutely recommend this product (with the Bragg Apple Cider Vinegar, I don&#x27;t know what the results are with water)!</li>
            <li> Aztec Secret is a really good product. I work around grease for a living and a shower just doesn&#x27;t feel like it cleans my face like this clay. I also use it before a night on the town, it gets rid of the winkles under my eyes for the evening. my face feels soft, and looks great. I use the apple cider with it and the only thing that I don&#x27;t like about it is the mess with mixing it. But I feel that its worth the trouble to get the great results.</li>
            <li> This stuff works like magic! It deep cleans and makes my skin sooooo soft! I love this stuff and will buy again!</li>
            <li> My favorite face mask and so much cheaper than many high end brands but works just as well!</li>
            <li> You can feel the results immediately after using this product! really recommended</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times now and each time it leaves my face so smooth.  You CAN feel your face pulsate when it this is on.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff but man does it feel GROSS when it dries! I feel my face tingling and if I move it even a LITTLE, it&#x27;ll stiffen my face up. I mix this with apple cider vinegar. Only thing I can criticize on is the packaging...mine leaked during shipment so I had my other items full of powder. They give a generous amount in one tub, but I would say definitely have a spoon + mixer handy to make the mask in.</li>
            <li> Love the tingling/tightening...makes me feel like it&#x27;s doing something good :) Even my hubs used it with me and liked it.</li>
            <li> I wish I knew about this stuff back in my Army days .. When in my 20&#x27;s .. We had to use head gear outside all the freakin time and during my off duty time I would wear a ball cap to hide my break outs .. Then I came home and my girlfriend now wife would make comments and I didn&#x27;t know what to do .. Flash forward to now in my 30&#x27;s I wash my face with baking soda every day and use Aztec clay on Sunday night before hitting the sack and now I rarely get zits .. I&#x27;m very happy with this product</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, however it is very strong. It has causedme break out when using it as a face mask with apple cider vinegar. However, my skin feels so soft like I just finished getting a facial. I have used it in a bath previously with great results.</li>
            <li> not that great&lt;br /&gt;、</li>
            <li> not sure just used it once. didn&#x27;t see it as being healing and the miracle potion that makes the skin soft…however I will continue to use it. It&#x27;s worth the money-- if the results prove to be more than a non harmful mask-- just not as effective as they claim.</li>
            <li> This mask is amazing.  I have sensitive, acne-prone skin that is just starting to age, and is dry almost all the time.  I have tried so many different skin care products, and I have found very few that make a huge difference on my skin, and this is one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions on the back state that you can mix this with equal parts of apple cider vinegar or water.  I chose to use the apple cider vinegar because so many people stated that when they mixed it with water, it clumped up and wouldn&#x27;t mix well.  The apple cider vinegar that I used worked really well and made it easy to mix.  You really need very little to make a thick mask that covers your entire face.  I made a mask for my husband and I, and I still made too much (I used a quarter cup of the clay and a quarter cup of apple cider vinegar).  I think two tablespoons of clay and two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar would be plenty for one person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used organic apple cider vinegar, and I&#x27;m not sure how much of a difference that makes, but I wanted to use pure ingredients.  When I initially mixed the mask up, it puffed up some of the dry clay into the air and started fizzing, which kind of scared me actually, because I hadn&#x27;t read anything that said that it would react like that.  I had flashbacks of my chemistry teacher saying don&#x27;t mix bleach and ammonia if you don&#x27;t want to die, so I set the bowl down and moved away until it stopped fizzing.  It actually mixed very nicely into a creamy texture, and felt pleasant when I put it on my skin.  I soon felt like the mask was tightening and it felt a little tingly, but really nice.  I didn&#x27;t notice a burning sensation at all, which I was worried about since I have such sensitive skin.  I left it on for 10 minutes (it says 5-10 minutes for sensitive skin and 15-20 for non-sensitive skin), and noticed it was really hard to wash off with just my hands and warm water.  I used a wet paper towel because I didn&#x27;t want to ruin my washcloths.  It falls off in clumps, so I&#x27;d recommend washing your face over your kitchen sink if possible so you don&#x27;t clog up your bathroom sink or shower.  It took about 3-5 minutes of light scrubbing to get the mask off, and my face was red, red, red.  The directions say redness is normal and should last about 30 minutes.  I would say it lasted about 2-3 hours, honestly.  I may have left it on too long, so next time I will try for 5-7 minutes instead of the full ten minutes. While I didn&#x27;t feel it burn while I had it on my face, I did notice my face felt like I had a mild sunburn once I washed it off.  I used REN Hydra-Calm Global Protection Day Cream, which usually calms my skin right away, and it kind of felt like when you put aloe on a burn, so it felt better immediately.  You could probably use pure aloe (it&#x27;s pretty cheap at Trader Joe&#x27;s or use a plant if you have one) and it would make your skin feel better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day my skin felt really clean and my pores looked clean.  My skin looked healthier overall and my pores were smaller.  I had less dryness around my nose area, which was great because usually clay masks dry my face out so bad my face will itch for days after using one.  This clay is great if you need a deep cleansing mask that you only need to use once or twice a month.  I really think if your skin is sensitive like mine you probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to handle it more than once or twice a month because it is irritating.  You get a lot for a good price, so I think this will probably last me 6 months to a full year.  This will probably be hit or miss with a lot of people just because it can be super irritating to your skin, but for under $10, I don&#x27;t think it would break the bank for most people.ls off in clumps, so I&#x27;d recommend washing your face over your kitchen sink if possible so you don&#x27;t clog up your bathroom sink or shower.

            <li> goodbye glamglow!! tip: to remove the clay &amp;#34;swipe credit card&amp;#34; on your face!! works like a charm!!</li>
            <li> Best clay mask ever, I can feel the &amp;#34;pulsating&amp;#34; action on my face stronger than any other clay mask I&#x27;ve tried. Better than Queen Helene&#x27;s Mint Julep mask and Lush&#x27;s Mask in Magnaminty.</li>
            <li> Wonderful...thank you</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It is hands down one of the best beauty products I&#x27;ve ever come across. I don&#x27;t but any other face masks after coming across this and it has simplified my beauty routine. Really helps with acne and scarring.</li>
            <li> Used to have tons of blackheads on nose &amp; chin. I&#x27;ve used this 2 x week for 2 mos and all gone!  BTW:  I went through a period of acne when I first started using it, but it didn&#x27;t last long...</li>
            <li> This product has never failed me. I love it!</li>
            <li> I just HAD to write a review. I got this in the mail at noon today and all day I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it as a facial mask (apparently it has other uses too like for your feet and body wraps!).&lt;br /&gt;I just got done using it and I am absolutely shocked by the results; I wish I had a before and after to post! What I did is I steamed my face for 15 minutes, extracted as many blackheads as possible with a comedone extractor tool (but my blackheads have always been really stubborn- like permanent scars, so I only got to remove about like 10), then I put the clay on my face using apple cider vinegar (make sure it&#x27;s organic) and a brush. I left it on for 20 minutes and removed it. ALL OF MY BLACKHEADS ARE GONE! I am so shocked!!! My T-zone is completely covered in blackheads... Basically every pore. I&#x27;ve had them for about 4 years with no luck of removal and now they&#x27;re finally gone! I am so happy! I am definitely sticking to this product. Hopefully it will do wonders to my acne. I will definitely buy more in the future when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;Pros- removes blackheads, leaves skin feeling baby-soft and fresh, makes skin feel super clean and fresh&lt;br /&gt;Cons- Kind of made my face itch in some places, super, super messy during removal&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you either rinse your face outside or cover your drain with a towel or washcloth... The clay WILL clog your drains if you don&#x27;t. Also, do not use any metal spoons or bowls when you mix the clay (says so on the package). I washed my face with face wash afterwards too and applied a little bit of moisturizer. I hope you have as great results as I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS- I will make an update to this if it seems to clear up my acne in a few months.</li>
            <li> You can actually feel this mask work! Love it :)</li>
            <li> About me:  Black female, mid 20&#x27;s, mild occurrence of pimples.  Wanted the product to help reduce my outbreaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sitting here, writing this review, while waiting for my third application of this mask to dry.  The first time, I mixed it only with water because I was still waiting for the organic apple cider vinegar to come in the mail.  The mixture came out really lumpy and kind of gross and hard to apply in any sort of even coating.  It itched on my face, and I didn&#x27;t feel any \\&quot;pulsing.\\&quot;  I washed it off in the shower, and wasn&#x27;t particularly impressed.  The second time, the apple cider vinegar had arrived, I mixed them together, and a world of change occurred!  The paste came out smooth and easy to apply and layer to a desired thickness.  Upon washing it off, my skin looked smooth, the pores were smaller, and my pimples had diminished.  That night I applied a bit of argan oil and AHA lotion to my face and went to sleep.  When I woke up the next morning, my face was smooth, my skin looked rejuvenated, and the pimples were reduced in size and severity.  Throughout the day, I had no new breakouts, and my skin did not become excessively oily.  I even decided to go without makeup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be continuing the regimen with high hopes!</li>
            <li> Love this product it really works just mix with acv and put it on the face i would do it before I showerd and then just take it off in the shower the downside to that is that the clay goes everywhere  when it&#x27;s all off make sure ur not doing anything for the next 30ish min cause your face will be like a tomato. I did it once while I was sick and I felt like it drew out those toxins as well cause I felt soo much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot about this. I can&#x27;t wait to use it!</li>
            <li> WARNING: There is no liner inside the package, if your tilting it when you open it (like I did) you will spill. So if you are reading this, put a small plate/bowl under it to avoid waste/spillage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About me --&gt; Age: 33 | Skin Type: Sensitive, Reactive, EXTREME oily (full onset oil 1 hour after skin is cleansed. My last trip to the dermatologist resulted in her telling me I&#x27;m lucky for oily skin... When its getting into your eyes and on you clean your glasses 10+ times daily, or when you look like a 3rd day oily hair 12 hrs after wash... life is miserable.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/21/15: I&#x27;m redoing most of this review just because its gotten too long for most people to want to read. It was longer than this one, really &#x3D;/ I promise I tried to shorten it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still amazed. I&#x27;ve used this product since 2/15 (7 days) only skipping once so far and my skin is less oily then ever before. My hair, on day 7, still looks clean after I last washed it 24 hrs ago. I&#x27;m cleaning my glasses 1-2 times daily, significantly less than my previous 10+ times daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendations:&lt;br /&gt;- I mix/store this in a 2 oz hinged plastic jar, so when I make too much its still sealed air tight. I recommend making 1 tsp of clay/apple cider vinegar for oily skin, 1 TBSP lasted me a week of use and I still have extra in the container, if anything if its too little you can always mix up more.&lt;br /&gt;- I tried the bowl of water to trap the clay mask, and I tried the plastic bag storage/applicator, neither one rocked my world. Don&#x27;t dump the clay down your sinks though, many reviewers have mentioned it causes issues and the headache isn&#x27;t worth the 5 extra seconds it takes to fill a bowl to dump outside later.&lt;br /&gt;- I apply with my fingers, pull out a makeup remover and get the excess product off, one day when I make the time I&#x27;ll get a brush for application. Wait the 15 minutes until dry, mist my forehead liberally with water and then wipe off the product, then misting/wiping my nose and so on.&lt;br /&gt;- I use this in my regular beauty routine. I wash my face, apply the mask and wait til its all dry (normally around 15 minutes) remove the mask, then I use the Simple Micellar cleansing water (or a toner if you want), serum, moisturizer with SPF and voila! I am ready to greet the day.&lt;br /&gt;-I intend on using this on my full face weekly, and doing the T-Zone daily or every other day.ng my nose and so on.&lt;br /&gt;- I use this in my regular beauty routine.

            <li> I can already see the difference in my skin.  Now, granted I don&#x27;t have horrible skin but I do tend to breakout on my checks and nose.  My skin appears to be more radiant.  I plan to do the facial every two days..., wish me luck!! Great product and very economical on the pockets.</li>
            <li> I used it once, but I am afraid to clog up the sink.</li>
            <li> Awesome mask doesn&#x27;t make my skin red. Stuff literally freezes on your face and cleans out your pores. Love it as a treatment I use it 2-3 times a week</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Wonderful, has cleared my skin, and evened out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I use this product for the first time and I was pleased with the results. There was a tightening pulling tingling sensation after the mask was applied. After the mass was removed my skin felt soft refreshed. Will update with more reviews</li>
            <li> Stuff works great and feels good too.</li>
            <li> I make a thick paste and apply it thickly on my face. For about 2.5-3 hrs when it completely dried depends on the weather is when I pull off the mask piece by piece over a paper towel laid over the sink(to toss in trash).  Then I use a wet face towel to gently wipe along the hairline. I don&#x27;t apply anything until bedtime. My only mask since.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 20 and have been struggling with moderate to severe acne since I was 14. Over the years iv spent hundreds on failed products ranging from proactiv all the way too Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder. I finally saw a dermatologist that helped clear up about 75% of the acne I already had. These last couple of years I waged a losing battle against these small under the skin bumps due to adult Rosacea. I thought that I had tried everything. Then I saw the reviews for this on amazon. This clay has literally changed my skin for the better. After a week of use and my skin was the best it&#x27;s been since I was 14! It has cleared up those bumps and had left my skin clear and glowing. Although it&#x27;s messy, I would recommend this to anyone with problem skin. Use of a konjac sponge helped make the rinse off quicker and less messy. 10/10 for this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent mask for home use</li>
            <li> The mask dried up acne I had on my face in just one use. I mixed it with the apple cider vinegar and it blew me away with the results. You can feel the mask tightening better than any mask i&#x27;ve worn before. I am now in love with this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different masks and face packs, including most recently the Shea Moisture African Black Soap cream mask. The Aztec Secret has thus far given me more noticeable results.&lt;br /&gt;I still have blackheads and breakouts, but this clay has significantly improved the size and amount of the blackheads on my nose and keeps my skin from being oily- in spite of living in a very humid place.&lt;br /&gt;For the amount that you get for the price too, it&#x27;s definitely the best deal. I mix mine with apple cider vinegar (since it also has its own cleansing properties) and it gives the clay the texture of a thick mousse and easier to work with than if you just use water.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really AWESOME and will be purchasing on a regular basis. It last a long time and it keeps my face youthful and smooth. It&#x27;s like GOLD in a jar. GREAT STUFF.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> my breakouts got worse before they got better, but my skin became the softest it has ever been after 3 uses!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.  Was skeptical in ordering it, but it wasn&#x27;t expensive, and thought I&#x27;d try.  It takes such a tiny amount, mixed with water, that it will last &amp;#34;forever&amp;#34;.  Sometimes I use it as a full facial and shower it off, and other times I mix a minute quantity and just dab it on blemishes - it seems to calm the inflammation, diminishes the look of the pores, and feels great.</li>
            <li> It arrived a lot sooner than expected. Thank you for the product!</li>
            <li> This mask feels amazing while using it.  It makes my skin feel really soft and clean.  My only issue, and it&#x27;s a small issue; is that it did somewhat dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I&#x27;ll make sure I do, from reading the comments it must be great! Buy it.</li>
            <li> I love this clay facial mask!! It&#x27;s great, it does have a strong odor but it leaves my face feeling fresh and soft</li>
            <li> This product gave my face a really nice glow! Like, it just improved how my face looked overall. But this mask made my face itch soooo much it was such a pain having it on for 20 minutes. I had to try my hardest not to itch my face. But its worth it because it makes my skin smooth and leaves a nice glow to it. This stuff is really messy though.</li>
            <li> I have used this now, 2-3 times per week for 2 weeks. I do not see any great changes in my oily, blackhead prone skin.  It (my skin) is still oily...and blackhead prone.  I DO enjoy the tightening sensation while the mask is on. And because I do use it along with apple cider vinegar (with \\&quot;the mother\\&quot;---as recommended), I of course dont like the SMELL when its on...but, ce la vie! I am awaiting the miracle. Will continue to use. As for now...all i Do get is a raging itch while it dries. A great sense of urgency to wash it off....while it dries. And some satisfaction after finally washing it all off (after it dries...hard...hard crust that it dries with)...and the smooth feel to my skin that it leaves behind. Ahh yes...small mercies.</li>
            <li> The day I received this I was determined to try.  I found the Apple Cider Vinegar and later in the evening my Grandson wanted to join me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both measured equal amounts of Clay powder and Apple Cider Vinegar then began mixing the paste.&lt;br /&gt;The paste can be as thin as you want it.  I preferred to get mine a little thicker than pudding.  It went on very smooth and I went across my forehead, around the nose, around the cheeks.  I used both hands to apply.&lt;br /&gt;I put just enough on each fingertip to spread evenly.  I then spread upward from the bottom of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I repeated about 3-4 times, to get enough applied.  I waited about 15 minutes, just until it dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It began drying and I could feel it tightening as it dried.  When the 15 minutes was up I waited about 10 minutes longer.  I wanted to get the best effect.  I am American Indian and my skin is very Olive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I took a towel and ran warm water on it and just placed this on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clay began to release from my skin and it was very refreshing and I have to say my face did glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could even see a change the next morning.  I didn&#x27;t look tired and it gave my face a rejuvination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my pores, I have large pores and I have scars from a bad trip to dermotologist.  I am so pleased with my skin.  I have tried many things, but this is my answer to getting my face to feel subtle and very soft.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and how great my skin felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely will purchase again and I will use this Mask about twice a month and if I need a pick me up for my skin; I definately will apply this wonder Clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My grandson has fair complexion and he left on about 10 min.  He used the warm water towel and he finally just ran warm water and he applied to his face and it released.  He didn&#x27;t mind at all.  He really enjoyed this and his skin didn&#x27;t get red at all it just looked healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A winner all the way around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dena Hall&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.oked healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A winner all the way around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dena Hall&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Worked amazingly the first few times. But I left it on for too long the last time, resulted in severe hives!</li>
            <li> Awesome mask and even better price!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. I used this on my daughters face which had lots of acne. Using it once a week has shown great results. Dried the pimples up! I use part water and part organic (Braggs) apple cider vinegar. Yes I had lumps however I let it sit and stirred again and creamy as can be (pudding like consistency). I also used this mixture on my hair to help with the excess bulbs I&#x27;ve seen on the ends of my hair in my comb. The shedding has lessened in just a few weeks and my curls are more defined.</li>
            <li> Wonderful experience. I got it right away &amp; it was exactly as described!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  1st use I could tell my face was tighter.  Dark spots are diminishing and small blackhead that I had is gone.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product 6 x and recommend 2-3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;I do mix it with apple cider vinegar and that is it.&lt;br /&gt;I have also started putting it on the top of my hands for dark spots and see results already!  (have done 2x)&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!&lt;br /&gt;I had no problems, but just be careful if you have super sensitive skin.  Read the directions and you will be super happy!!</li>
            <li> I mix this with warm water until nearly smooth and apply in a thick layer. Let it dry completely and jump in the shower and my skin is soooo smooth and soft after and my pores and blackheads are more and more diminished each time I use it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff ! It really works . I was a skeptic at first but now I&#x27;m a firm believer ! I even got&lt;br /&gt;My Brother to do it with me !!</li>
            <li> I use this with apple cider vinegar and although the smell isn&#x27;t my cup of tea this mask works great! I hate and like at the same time the pulsating feeling you get when the mask is drying. It is a really weird feeling, but you know it is working great. My skin feels wonderful after using it and it works even better on my husbands oily face too!</li>
            <li> I am a product whore and have tried all of the expensive spa skin care lines. This stuff rocks! It is so cheap too! I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Way more effective that you think it will be, but a serious pain in the butt to mix up. No matter what the other reviewers say mine is always gloopy, but the plastic bag method works best.</li>
            <li> It lasts a veryyyy long time!</li>
            <li> Helps to clear up acne on my cheeks. During the first use I was a little freaked out because when it dries, the clay can get really hard and you literally can&#x27;t move your face. Don&#x27;t freak out! I let it stay on my face for 10 -12 minutes and wash it out in the shower.I did not use vinegar in my mixture only water. I then use a toner and Cera Ve moisturizer to finish up my routine. I only use the clay mask once a week because of it&#x27;s drying affect.It works though.</li>
            <li> Just tried the clay mask for the first time and i really like it!! I mixed it with water (next time ill use a whisk to stir it, it gets pretty lumpy!)and my skin feels revitalized and detoxified. I have large pores and lots of blackheads on my nose...after 20 minutes of the mask sucking my face off, (a little uncomfortable, but thats how you know its working) my pores are definitely smaller. I also used a toner afterwards and my pores are completely clear. My face got a little red afterwards but not too bad...Im definitely keeping this stuff in my skincare regimen.  Also, i put a thin layer on my thighs 5 minutes before a shower (I get little bumps sometimes from the dry climate and my razor) and it made them completely smooth. Just in time for bathing suit season! I highly recommend this stuff.</li>
            <li> I tried this as soon as I got it because I was excited to see if it worked as well as the reviews said it did. I mixed 1/4 cup of it with the same amount of water. Probably should have made less because there was a lot left over which I then threw out and wasted. You should only use a few tablespoons of it I&#x27;d say. Used a plastic bowl because the instructions said specifically non-metal. I don&#x27;t have any of that vinegar stuff on hand and didn&#x27;t feel like going to the store to get it so I just used water. I probably should have mixed it more thoroughly because it had clumps in it. I put it on in two or three layers to build up thickness, the instructions said 1/4 inch or something which seemed like a lot so I didn&#x27;t do that much. I set a timer on my phone for 10 minutes. I have borderline sensitive skin and I wanted to be careful. It wound up being a little short of a time for me I think. Next time will wait 15 or 20 minutes instead and see if it works more. I washed it off before it had all dried completely, but my face had started to tighten, which is a cool feeling. I used a washcloth and warm water to rinse my face, and immediately saw where a few of my recent breakouts had reduced in size, and the dry skin which sometimes scabs up around the area of a zit was gone and healed. It tightened my pores and made my skin soft. Talking about all this makes me want to go do it again. I followed with a gentle witch hazel toner and some oil free spf lotion. That night my makeup looked caked and I felt like my skin was greasier than normal, but I think that was the toner and lotion I used, not this product. I don&#x27;t normally use either, and it was probably just my skin flaring up from the introduction of unfamiliar chemicals. Anyway, I love this package, it just looks cool in a natural and classic sense. I&#x27;m glad to have it for the occasional (or frequent) facial, and I&#x27;m probably going to try it on my shoulders next. I break out on my shoulders for some reason and this package said it can be used on the body so I might try it.age said it can be used on the body so I might try it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clay masque. I&#x27;m pretty sure the hype is just because you mix it yourself and see it bubble up -- it&#x27;s a gimmick. I&#x27;ve used much better masks that I didn&#x27;t have to spend any time mixing up myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very oily skin that is sensitive and prone to acne (blackheads, whiteheads, and very painful cystic acne). This product did nothing for any of my issues, in fact it made my skin worse. My blackheads/pores did not get smaller (and I have reviewed other products which have), my whiteheads got worse, and the cystic acne was still painful and inflamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my skin sounds similar to yours, then this product is not the solution you seek.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the rave reviews. Yes the mud makes your face pulsate. You do feel like its swallowing up your skin. I think that this effect helps you into thinking that it is doing alot of work on your pores. My face was red for about 10 minutes afterwards as most said it would be. Do I see an immediate difference upon washing off? No. My face looks the same, my pores still look large and my acne has not magically vanished.&lt;br /&gt;I think its misleading to tell people that you will see an automatic change in your skin. Nothing on earth works that quickly, I don&#x27;t care where this clay came from. If you want to sit two inches in front of the mirror and analyze every pore for a couple of hours then yes you will see a difference in your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In honesty, the notice in change came the morning after for me. I noticed that my skin looked more even, clear and healthy. My face looks refreshed and clean. After about two weeks, using it once per week, I did notice that my blemishes were starting to subside. But it took a little bit of time. 2 weeks to see a noticable difference in blemishes and pore size. Yes everyones skin is different, but skin is also like the rest of our body. It takes some time for solutions or treatments to work. Whether you have troubled skin or not, I would recommend this clay. But I would never lead someone to beleive that this will cure all ailments over night; and certainly not in twenty minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy this clay. It is reasonably priced for the benefits that it delivers.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old son has teen acne and once I had him convinced he gave it a try and even he was surprised. It took the redness out of his skin and started to dry up the blemishes the very next day. If only he would be consistent on using it.</li>
            <li> so i got this product last week and i noticed improvement of my skin after just one treatment. I mixed it with water and let it sit on for about 20 minutes or so and my skin came out smoother than ever</li>
            <li> I used this with apple cider vinegar.  I used it with Bragg&#x27;s apple cider vinegar.  I didn&#x27;t know where to start from so I overmade my first batch with 1/3 cup of each in a glass bowl and mixed it with a a plastic butter spreader.  It mixes up green, it fizzed a little in the bowl.  I slathered it on my face, my face was clean when I started.  Prior to putting the mask on I washed my face with DHC deep oil cleanser.  I made sure to put lip balm on my lips and pull my hair back.  Upon initial contact there is no difference in feeling.  It takes about 15 minutes before you can feel the mask begin to tighten against your face and make your lips start to pucker in.  You won&#x27;t be able to say much during this time.  I left the mask on for 30 minutes.  The first time out there was no discernable difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance.  No difference in blackheads.  My skin was smoother, and probably for about 40 minutes my skin was redder because of all the of the increased stimulation.  It feels cleaner I suppose, but it isn&#x27;t a miracle.  I moisturized with my Nuetrogena night cream afterward because my skin was begging for moisture.  Again, no difference in pores, no noticeable difference in blackheads.  My skin was smoother, felt cleaner.  I&#x27;d use it again.  But it&#x27;s not a miracle.</li>
            <li> good with apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit confused by the extreme reviews for this product.  It is a simple raw powdered bentonite clay which is readily available all over the world and used in many many cosmetics that you probably have in your bathroom right now.  The marketing on this product is hyped, of course it is, almost all cosmetic products are touting unrealistic benefits these days.  Bentonite clay is not a miracle, but it does have beneficial, productive uses both internally and externally.  Sadly, it will not heal your acne or make you beautiful overnight, it may take TIME to get the results you want, and your expectations have to be REALISTIC.  Educate yourself about this product (or rather bentonite clay, you can get it much cheaper than this) and then decide if it&#x27;s right for you and your situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good things about Bentonite Clay:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Contains over 70 trace minerals.&lt;br /&gt;-Absorbs Toxins, Impurities, Metals, &amp; Other Contaminants from the Body (used both internally &amp; externally for these purposes)&lt;br /&gt;-Can sooth muscle damage, bruises, cuts &amp; wounds.&lt;br /&gt;-Astringent &amp; Antibacterial Properties&lt;br /&gt;-Filled with Negative Ions (which bind to bad positive ions like certain bacterias and cancel them out)</li>
            <li> I really love this product! I&#x27;m a huge advocate of natural things! Removed blackheads and tightened my pores. Not to mention it feels amazing while it works!</li>
            <li> Seriously you guys, I have never used a product like this! I am a 27 year old female who still gets pimples, but once I become super stressed I break out horribly and get cystic acne that is of course painful. The stresses of life hit me real hard the beginning of the year and I started getting  pimples around my chin, it started with one and then all of the sudden I had this whole army of pimples attacking my face and they were defeating me big time because I was becoming depressed and there wasn&#x27;t enough makeup in the world to hide them. I tried so many things, but nothing was helping. I searched high and low and stumbled into this magic clay. I wish I found this sooner! Let me tell ya, I changed my whole face routine in hopes that my face will heal soon. This is what I did, I used this straight for about 4 days, I mixed it with the apple cider vinegar, and also, I diluted a tablespoon of the apple cider vinegar  in water and drank it (no silly, without the clay) as it is good for you, don&#x27;t worry about the taste...drink it really fast! :) I used the regular dove soap, the white bar as my face washing soap and I used rosewater as a toner, and my regular olay face cream. My goodness did my face heal fast! the clay, as disgusting as this may sound, but hey, isn&#x27;t this why we&#x27;re all here? it popped my pimples as I was washing it away.  Of course I still have the spots, as we all know those take a while to go away, but my makeup can hide those better, and the rosewater is very gentle, too. I will continue to use this on a  regular basis. I tell ya, give this a chance! you will NOT regret it.&lt;br /&gt;ps: I rarely review things, and I never upload photos, but I really want to show you how my face was and how well this clay works.&lt;br /&gt;The first picture is when I first started breaking out, and then the process of how the clay was working its magic :)</li>
            <li> I have sensitive oily acne prone skin I have tried absolutely everything for my acne I am 31 years old and now since i have used this product I can say I have not had any pimples I also use  Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera ~ 12 oz&lt;br /&gt;Thayer&#x27;s as a toner and I wash my face with Desert Essence Thoroughly Clean Face Wash Refill, 32-Ounce&lt;br /&gt;Mike &amp; Will.  The mask will leave your face somewhat red but its temporary and a smooth look.  Love it give it a try for the price is the best i ever used.  Good Luck to all</li>
            <li> 4/25/11&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like this product, it was too harsh for my face, when I removed it with a warm towel it scarred my skin. It felt good until I took it off; my face was red and swolen, its been sitting in the back of my cabinet ever since.... Too Harsh!</li>
            <li> Whew, great stuff; it makes it easier to remove both blackheads and whiteheads.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m not one for writing reviews. However, this is ONE HUGE TUB OF AWESOMENESS.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way with this stuff, really. I use about 1 tsp of clay and 1 tsp of apple cider vinegar (water doesn&#x27;t work as well) and apply to my skin at least once a week. As it dries I can feel it pulling on my skin. Yeah, my skin does get a little red once I wash it off, but that goes away after an hour or so (sometimes less). It does wonders for cleaning up my skin, really. I have really acne-prone, oily skin as well.</li>
            <li> As most reviews say, be careful using this stuff in the shower. It likes to clump up and can easily get messy quick. Other than that, I really do believe it has helped with my acne tremendously. I was very skeptical this product would have any effect on the acne on my skin but believe me and the other reviewers, it&#x27;s a great product and worth giving it a shot.</li>
            <li> Works so well! But don&#x27;t make any funny faces while applying it as a facial mask. When it dries, you&#x27;re gonna look FRIGHTENING.&lt;br /&gt;Gets the blackheads though. :D</li>
            <li> It was delivered fast and once I got it home I immediately tried it with raw apple cider vinegar. Your face really does pulsate once it begins to dry and it makes your skin really tight! Although I did not notice and removed blackheads but I have only used it once. My skin was dry but nothing a little lotion couldn&#x27;t help. Can&#x27;t wait to see how much better my skin can get with this!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2 months or more...I havent seen any improvement really in my skin. It feels soft just after washing it off....but tht&#x27;s t!</li>
            <li> I use this to deep cleanse my face as well as my hair and it works great. Definitely a staple in my regimen.</li>
            <li> i bought this product because of all the good reviews and wonder what in the world am i doing wrong when i used this on my face because for one it doesnt do what it says it should. anyway i wouldnt recommend this to any other buyer. it only leaves your face oily, muddy and your pores more clogged than when it went on. word to aspiring buyer \\&quot;DONT BUY THIS\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!  My face has been breaking out and after one mask all of the redness went away.  While the mask is on you do feel your skin pulsating and it feels so good!  I mixed the mask with apple cider vinegar and left it on for about 45 minutes.  My face didn&#x27;t turn red when I took the mask off by my face was smooth and glowing!  I absolutely love this mask!!!  A little bit goes a long way, if you don&#x27;t use all of the mask you can store it in a container for next time.</li>
            <li> This is the first skin care product I&#x27;ve EVER used that has actually substantially helped the appearance and quality of my skin. And I&#x27;ve tried more products than I could ever count. I have extremely oily, acne-prone skin; I even sometimes get awful cystic acne, it&#x27;s so bad. This product has helped immensely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, you definitely never want to mix with water--you&#x27;ll just end up wasting clay because water makes the mask very clumpy. I always make my facial mask with organic raw apple cider vinegar with &#x27;mother&#x27;; it mixes beautifully and results in a nice, smooth application. Not only that, but this specific unfiltered type of vinegar is shown to help regulate sebum (skin oil) production in the pores. Do some reading on the skin care benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually leave the mask on for 30-45 minutes, which is a bit longer than what the packaging recommends, but my skin is, like I said, extremely oily, way more oily than most people who complain of oily skin, so my circumstances call for &#x27;stronger&#x27; skin care measures, if you will. Anyway, once the time is up, and the mask is basically half-completely dry, I gently wash off with warm water. I always do it at night because it leaves your skin very red. However, in the morning... HELLO! *angels sing*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning after a previous night&#x27;s application, my skin is always, without fail, smoother, clearer, and most importantly: hardly oily at all! And the effect lasts for pretty much the entire day, maybe even partially into the day after that. My skin just feels healthier overall after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re the &#x27;average&#x27; oily-skinned person, then I&#x27;d recommend starting using it once a week, evaluate, then go from there. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different and so different treatments will affect everyone differently. You might need to use it more or less often. Use it the night before a date, or a party, or some other social event, etc, once you&#x27;ve figured out how it works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you struggle with acne-prone or oily skin, I highly, HIGHLY recommend this product! Really, I am SO pleased. Even if you&#x27;re on a tight budget and you think that 10-ish dollars is a bit pricey for 1 pound, it lasts a really long time. Trust me, it&#x27;s SO worth it.ly, HIGHLY recommend this product! Really, I am SO pleased. Even if you&#x27;re on a tight budget and you think that 10-ish dollars is a bit pricey for 1 pound, it lasts a really long time. Trust me, it&#x27;s SO worth it.</li>
            <li> Really does clear out your pores!</li>
            <li> I LIKE I USE ALL THE TIME AND FEEL LITLE HOT AND HARD CAUSE IS DOING HARD CLEANING IN MI FACE. GOOD PRODUCT..</li>
            <li> I used this with apple cider vinegar and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just because my skin is super sensitive (very acne-prone) but I feel like this product doesn&#x27;t do much for my face or acne. The first couple times I used it, my skin felt sooooo smooth but after awhile, I stopped feeling the effects and it didn&#x27;t do anything for my acne (didn&#x27;t make it better or worse). Of course, I don&#x27;t use this everyday (just twice a week), but I feel like my skin is either used to it now or it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this mask! I use it once a week with a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar and it helps control my acne. Ive seen that my face is now clearer because of it</li>
            <li> We mixed this with Apple Cider Vinegar and my daughter and I love it. We haven&#x27;t tried it with water so I can&#x27;t say how that mix would work, but the way we have used it as made our skin glow. Mixing it ourselves has been nice because I like it a bit thicker than my daughter. It is easy to rinse off and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work on me.. just clogged the drain!</li>
            <li> This is a really great product.  It leaves my skin feeling smooth.  I will be purchasing again when have used it up.</li>
            <li> Great product totally recommend</li>
            <li> Very good product. Works great.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure if this helps or hurts. i can definitely feel it \\&quot;working\\&quot; or pulsing like people have stated. however, it might be too much for my easily irritated skin to handle. i havent used it consistently enough to tell. it is definitely worth a try, though.</li>
            <li> Although I didn&#x27;t purchase from Amazon, I recently purchased this at The Vitamin Shoppe, and I must say, after 2 uses, I am impressed with the &#x27;after&#x27; results.  Everything that&#x27;s been said regarding the extreme suction, and pulsating face, etc, is absolutely correct. Funny thing, as it was drying, it suctioned so much, that it had drawn the corners of my nose &#x27;in&#x27; some and when I finally went to wash it off my face, I had to laugh because it made my nose look like &#x27;Miss Piggy&#x27;.  Yes your face is red afterwards, but it calms down soon after. I have never used a mask that is so intense, but you will love how smooth, and glowing your face will look in the end. Such a great value for a great product</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, arrived much earlier than expected! Great quality product. Love it!</li>
            <li> I think it makes your face feel nice. my pimples didnt just disappear. I felt the pulsating which was pretty cool. Im 31 and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but I do have pimples.  I get small ones and even the big ingrown ones that itch and Hurt even when you don&#x27;t touch it.  This usually appears around my jaw line to the end of where my ear ends. Proactive is what I use. I tried to use this instead of pro active but I still got pimples. I recommend using this as just an all around good face mask. my skin feels great and my pores have shrunk. This is not a miracle product or something thats going to make drastic changes. I still like the product though so I gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> This clay really works. I use it as a detox mask for my skin once a week or so. I do feel the tingly sensation you get when using it too. I was so surprised to see my shipment left at my front door one day. I was actually looking online to see the status of my order and I was told it had been delivered already. Opened the front door and there it was! Super Fast Shipping Speed! I highly recommend this seller to anyone. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought this clay per the recommendation of natural hair blogs and I see what everyone is raving about. I have natural hair(4b) and let me tell you, this is the best deep cleaning treatment ever. I mix my clay with a little water and a little apple cider vinegar, then apply to my hair and allow it to set for 30 minutes. When I wash it all out, my curls are extremely defined and my hair feels great. Of course it does strip your hair so make sure you follow it up with a good deep conditioning treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it for my face. I have very dry sensitive skin and every now and then I need a good deep cleansing. This works perfectly for that. My skin feels smoother and tighter after using it. I highly recommend keeping a bottle of this in the house for multiple uses.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this bentonite clay! I read tons of reviews and decided to go ahead and buy it. Why not? It&#x27;s only like eight bucks and could possibly get rid of my blackheads on my nose and chin and reduce my pores. Who wouldn&#x27;t love that?? After trying it for the second time yesterday, I can&#x27;t put in on my entire face again. I have combination skin. I am 25 and a really don&#x27;t get any bad breakouts. I don&#x27;t have a problem with zits. I have a problem with large pores, old acne scars, and blackheads. I mixed the clay with Braggs raw apple cider vinegar both times. The first time I didn&#x27;t have too bad of a reaction. I left it on for about fifteen minutes and loved the pulsing feeling. It did leave my face incredibly red and dry after using but I expected that. Two days later after initial application, I developed a large cystic like acne on my neck near my face. I attributed it to purging effects, or perhaps clay that I did not wipe off good enough. It took forever to heal! It&#x27;s been two weeks and just last night I put on a second application. At first I felt like something was wrong. My face was burning, especially around my hairline on my forehead. My face also became extremely itchy which I thought was so weird because that did not happen the first time I used it. I tried to press through and the itching did stop after a few minutes. After about seven minutes i decided I needed to take the mask off. As usual, it left my face raw, red, and extremely dry. I instantly followed up with my normal Ponds moisturising cream. When I woke up the next morning I somehow felt my forehead during the day (near my hairline, where it was burning and itching) I have ten to twelve very painful very sore blister/boil like acne. It hurts!!! I made sure to wipe everything away very good when washing it off. I don&#x27;t understand how this product could create such a bad reaction if it is really just bentonite clay and ACV. I don&#x27;t know but to me something doesn&#x27;t seem right. I also have cystic like acne popping up on the side of my face and it is still very dry like sandpaper today. I was just better off not using it. I will stick with my big pores and blackheads. I can cover those up with makeup and they don&#x27;t hurt. No more secret indian healing clay for this chick.o have cystic like acne popping up on the side of my face and it is still very dry like sandpaper today. I was just better off not using it.

            <li> Great product. Beat department store or drug store brands. Natural and organic without chemicals or preservatives. I&#x27;ve been using this for years. You will feel it working once on your face. Tingling, pulsating sensation. I used department store brand paying for the expensive jar for nothing. This is cheap and it works. Plus it last for a long, long time for the price. Just need a little bit and mix with water. My pores are small and I&#x27;m 44 years old and my skin looks very good.</li>
            <li> Works great. I use once a week, really deep cleans your pores. Will easily last a year.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the hype of this product, it had so many great reviews and that&#x27;s why I bought it. I have been using face masks since my teens and I know a thing or two about these things. This guy didn&#x27;t do anything for me except give me acne. I tried to work with this product and I gave it so many chances but it kept disappointing me each time. First time I used it I broke out on my forehead. Every time I use this I find a new pimple on my face I don&#x27;t know why. It was a generous about of clay I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to do with it. Also it dries up my skin. I wish I could be of help to somebody, if you have sensitive skin please don&#x27;t bother, it will just disappoint you!</li>
            <li> Love love love this product. It is so gentle on my skin and my daughter uses it as well. will buy again</li>
            <li> Amazing product, there is so many diy mask you can make with this miracle product</li>
            <li> This product is beautiful. It&#x27;s also great because you get to mix the consistency for yourself. It clears the skin with a deep detoxifying cleanse, as it draws out impurities and tightens the skin. There&#x27;s a noticeable freshness and smoothness after just the first use. Normally skin may be red for a few minutes after rinsing, but the noticeable glow comes alive a few minutes after your skin has settled. It is magical! It clears not just toxins but blemishes. Suitable for problematic skin and also maintaining a beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> This clay work wonders for me and does not cause me to break out.</li>
            <li> Okay, let&#x27;s get down to it: There are hundreds of rave reviews on this product, and like many other people reading through these, I thought it was too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;But hey, it&#x27;s cheap, and it&#x27;s natural--where can you go wrong?&lt;br /&gt;I figured worst case scenario, I&#x27;d end up tossing it. Less than ten dollars, not that bad, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the rundown: My skin is difficult. It&#x27;s sensitive to certain products and is somehow simultaneously really oily in the T-zone and really dry along my cheeks and chin. I&#x27;ve got blackheads all over my nose and three or four sizeable whiteheads on my face at any given time. I&#x27;ve also had dozens of very small bumps on my forehead for years. When I saw the reviewers of this product claiming that it made the pimples pop out of your face, I got a bit excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what really happened to me:&lt;br /&gt;I started using the mask every other day, moisturizing well with Clinique&#x27;s dramatically different moisturizing gel after every use. I found that while pimples weren&#x27;t exactly popping out of my face, the mask did do a very good job of purifying my skin OVER TIME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do I mean by that? The big pimples that I had got a bit bigger, and were gone within a few days. More importantly, the small bumps I&#x27;ve had on my forehead that I&#x27;ve never been able to get rid of? Within two uses (three days) they&#x27;d developed into full-fledged whiteheads. Then, a few days after that, they were GONE. And I mean, 100% gone, no sign they were ever there in the first place, and I&#x27;ve had those for YEARS. This clay doesn&#x27;t kill the bacteria in your acne so much as it brings it to the surface--a process that is actually a lot better for your skin than killing the pimples with salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide. It will make you break out because it is in fact purging your skin of all those nasty toxins. Once the pimples have developed fully, I would recommend using a comedone extractor (can also be found on amazon--I got mine for $0.79 and free shipping) to extract them, and then swiping over with a toner of your choice (that&#x27;s when you use salicylic acid or BP--in the toner.) Your pimple should be gone within a day or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that using this clay every other day to start with is very good, if a bit hard on the skin. Just remember to moisturize well after each application. After the initial purge is over, maybe switch to using it once or twice a week, just to maintain. It&#x27;s a good preventative treatment in the long term, because it doesn&#x27;t let the toxins in your skin develop long enough to turn into full-fledged pimples. If there&#x27;s bacteria, it&#x27;s coming out. After the initial purge I stopped breaking out altogether, and I know it was mostly thanks to this mask because I stopped using it for a month or so and my acne came back full-force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix it one part clay powder to one part Bragg&#x27;s organic ACV with \\&quot;the mother.\\&quot; I use two teaspoons of each clay powder and ACV, because I&#x27;ve found that the mask DOES work better if you put it on very thickly. I spread it on my face with my fingers and then use an old paddle foundation brush to smooth it out and attempt to even out the coverage. I then leave it on for half an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEFORE PUTTING IT ON: make sure to thoroughly cleanse your face. DO NOT moisturize or tone--NOTHING. I&#x27;ve found that it works a lot better if you run a washcloth under hot water, wring it out, and press it to your face to open your pores. Leaves your face slightly damp and your pores open as an excellent prep for the mask. Set the wet washcloth aside in order to take off the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TO TAKE IT OFF: I read in the reviews here that a lot of people had trouble taking the mask off. In the beginning, I tried wetting my hands and slowly peeling off the chunks. Not only was it nearly impossible, but it hurt too. I&#x27;ve found that if you take the same washcloth you used to prep your face before the mask and run it under warm water, then press it into your face to loosen the mask, it comes off easily! Just wet the mask and when it&#x27;s loose rub in circular motions with the washcloth and it comes RIGHT OFF. If it&#x27;s not coming off, that just means you need more water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion: this mask is fantastic. It&#x27;s not a miracle, but it works VERY well, especially for the price. Make sure you know how to use it and be smart about your expectations. You shouldn&#x27;t be disappointed.

            <li> This product is truly amazing! I am 29 and I have been battling acne for about 9 yrs. I have tried so many things(OTC and prescription) that I was very skeptical regarding the reviews. I have used it for two nights and it has already healed the breakouts that I had and the redness is minimal. I used a small spoonful of clay with a small amount of apple cider vinegar and then water. I mixed  with the spoon until all the little clumps were gone and then I applied it with a foundation brush. I mixed it kinda of thin because I was afraid of the clogging of my sink after I read the reviews.</li>
            <li> Wow! This stuff is seriously like a black hole for the face! But I still like it a lot, my skin feels so great afterward and my pores are so clear! When I feel like I need to, I like to use a nose strip right after, just to get what&#x27;s left over, and my nose has never ever been clearer, it&#x27;s amazing. As far as acne goes, I don&#x27;t think this product does a whole lot (it&#x27;s hard to say - some days it&#x27;ll clear it up, sometimes it won&#x27;t; my skin&#x27;s also pretty retarded and bipolar, so it could be just me) but as to general deep cleaning and firming, it&#x27;s awesome!! And a little goes a long way, this will last forever! Just a warning though, it can be like concrete when it dries, so don&#x27;t just try to rub it off unless you want your entire dermis to go with it, I would suggest taking a wet towelette and holding it on your face for a while to soften the clay first before wetting the cloth again and using it to gently rub it off. But I love it!</li>
            <li> I have used this mask as directed for three days, I have not seen an improvement in my skin at all. My skin feels softer afterwards, but my pores don&#x27;t look any smaller and I still have mild acne around my mouth/chin and blackheads on my nose. It&#x27;s an OK mask, but definitely not a holy-grail product. I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Yeah it works a little but I still have pimples on my face .</li>
            <li> Works great but made my skin super dry so intensive moisturizing is necessary.</li>
            <li> Great,  but don&#x27;t leave this on over night.  This stuff will dry like cement and make it hard to move your face if you leave it on too long.  But it has definitely tightened up my skin and my forehead wrinkles are dissappearing</li>
            <li> Overall, I enjoy the product. However, I find it difficult to mix a smooth paste and am always left with paste mixed with various clumps that are near impossible to smooth out. Also, due to the light, powdery nature of the dry product I recommend holding your breath when opening the lid. Exhaling results in a light dispersion of the product all over the nearby surface and inhaling results in light coughing. As far as its effectiveness as a facial mask, it does its job.</li>
            <li> I got my clay 2 days ago. I used it the day after receiving it. I mixed 1 tbsp of the clay, 1 tbsp of Bragg&#x27;s ACV (Apple Cider Vinegar) &amp; 1 tbsp of water in a large plastic cup (old cottage cheese container) with a plastic spoon. The mixture began to foam/fizz as I was mixing but stopped. I applied it to my face using the back of the spoon and let it sit for about 20-25 minutes. There was a little tightening but not as intense as I thought it would be, almost unnoticable tightening. The mask was hard. I washed the mask off my face and followed my normal face cleansing routine. This product doesn&#x27;t give say whether or not you need to wash you face before using, no my face wasn&#x27;t washed. I plan to use the mask again tonight the same way.&lt;br /&gt;I have really large visible pores, they did appear to be slightly smaller than normal.&lt;br /&gt;I will try to update this post as often as possible to let you all know if I am seeing any progress being made with my troubled skin.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I&#x27;ve used many masks and cleaners for my face. Nothing works as good as this! I mean you can see the results right after you use it.</li>
            <li> This clay is a miracle worker! I get acne on my nose, cheeks, chin and this works amazing! This clay will clear all your acne, blackheads, white heads, cystic acne, and tighten your pores. After I do the mask I use the Nivea soft moisturizer and my skin feels 100% better, and softer! The shipping and delivery was fast! I will buy more when this runs out!  Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Ok product  the mixture is lumpy when mixing with water and I don&#x27;t see any results as to clearing acne problems.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because every ones in awhile, i feel i need that extra feeling of DEEP clean skin. Product highlights. Price, natural, and easy to follow directions. Only negative is when applying it can get messy. So just apply it in the shower. Im a guy who likes to lift weights and watch football but i still want my skin looking good, so why not try it out!</li>
            <li> Face feels less oily after use.</li>
            <li> Good &amp; economical mask. I must say that all the reviews of suction, tightening, cleansing &amp; so on are exaggerated. This mask works to cleanse &amp; possibly helps with maintaining an acne free complexion if used regularly but all the sensations that you might feel is just the mask drying up. Like all masks, if you apply it liberally, will feel tight when they dry up. This is the same. I must say that I like the feeling when the mask dries up &amp; I have not experienced any side effects or discomfort. This is no miracle mask but it does its job. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who is willing to take the time to mix &amp; apply it. I have a designated tub for it &amp; I mix at least 10-12 uses in it rather than do it every time I want to use it. Saves me time.</li>
            <li> Is this an ancient sacred discovery from the Gods?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this mask IS a face changer with the intensity of feel, like what other reviewers say, and it worked for me! I used this once but I will continue on using this again the next month. For a beginner which I am, I didn&#x27;t like it because I felt like it was too strong for me, and it felt a bit irritating like my face was on fire and around my hair edges were a bit itchy. I was worried, but then later while it was still drying, it felt like it was giving a relaxation tingle like a mini facial massage, and ,first it felt like bunch of vacuums were sucking out each pore one by one, and it was bizarre. Wen I washed it off, my skin didn&#x27;t redden, looked so super clean, and I went to feel my face while it was wet, my face felt like a smoother texture. When I pat it dry and felt my face again, my skin felt like velvet fabric or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this mask though, but the people who read how \\&quot;good\\&quot; this clay mask is, be aware that you would feel the same experience like the others including me have. I suggest you mix this clay mask in nice and thick and apply it on your skin generously thin. Thick paste on your face will take a bit longer to dry, but the point in this mask is to when it even dries you keep it on for a little bit more time while its magic is still regenerating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck!</li>
            <li> I was just like you one time. Looking at this product, going like &amp;#34;what? really? all these positive reviews? and only $15?? I dunno, MAN&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it really is that simple. Sometimes, the sheer number of raving reviews really are indication of an item&#x27;s quality. This is one of those times. You&#x27;re here for a reason...you want to take care of your skin. Whether it&#x27;s acne, scars, hyperpigmentation, what have you.  If you haven&#x27;t already bought this, let me tell you why you should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay first of all, CHEAP. Like, seriously? $15 with shipping? If you&#x27;re like me and you&#x27;ve tried every product from here to Timbuktu, this should be one of the most economic treatments you&#x27;ve encountered. But like you, I was skeptical. In my mind, cheap &#x3D; lousy. But this couldn&#x27;t be farther from the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing. Okay, yeah, it&#x27;s NOT MAGIC. Nothing out there is. It will take time and patience, and there is nothing you can do about that. Need your zits gone by this weekend? Yeah this stuff won&#x27;t do that. BUT, I can tell you from experience, that this weird stinky mask WILL improve your complexion. After years of suffering acne and the inflamed wasteland that comes after, I finally see a light at the end of the tunnel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my mid twenties, been suffering mild/aggressive acne since my early teens. Some of us are just born unlucky, and nothing will change that. But this cheap looking miracle is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that has actually worked CONSTANTLY. Benzoyl peroxide, AHA, crappy products advertised by pretty teenagers who&#x27;ve been layered by makeup and Photoshop. None of these have ever done jack for me. But this stuff? Oh boy, let me tell you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s kinda gross looking, and mixed with apple cider vinegar it won&#x27;t smell nice. Putting it on your face, you won&#x27;t look like a young starlet. As a man, it&#x27;s a little embarassing to be walking around with a mask on your face. But guess what? WHO CARES. The results speak for themselves. I&#x27;ve been putting this on twice a day, morning and before bed (maybe excessive, but I&#x27;ve only seen positive changes, one must experiment) for about two weeks, always followed by a good moisturizer. I had just suffered a mammoth breakout, worse than I&#x27;ve had in months. This mask stopped the progression of more acne, took the damage that was already done, and slowly but surely subdued it. It&#x27;s like a ninja. A slow but effective ninja. It will take time...weeks, probably months. Yes, it&#x27;s a bit of a stretch if you&#x27;re a long time acne sufferer to assume this mask will magically heal you in a few days&#x27; time. But give it a chance to work over the course of a few weeks, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed. My red spots are fading, everyday I see a difference. The skin in-between blemishes is much cleaner and healthy looking. And whenever a zit rears its bastard face, this mask is like &amp;#34;NAH, not on my watch&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re still here? Seriously? You haven&#x27;t read enough of these hundreds of 5 star reviews? I&#x27;m willing to bet you&#x27;ve bought worse stuff than this. Expensive stuff, advertised by so called &amp;#34;dermatologists&amp;#34; and scientists. Forget all that. Buy this. Make the commitment to use it as much as you need. Mix a bunch, put it in some airtight tupperware. Put this crap on once a day, couple times a week, whatever you can do. With discipline, your fight against acne will be reinforced by this vigorous cavalry. And for me personally, I finally feel that the war is turning in my favor. DO IT.for themselves.

            <li> This stuff is aaaamazing! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and I can see a biiig difference. It shrinks pores withing tqo uses, makes skin baby soft! I definitely  recommend. I do think that they should include a scoop with it though</li>
            <li> Amazing product and detox!</li>
            <li> Great product especially if you mix with the Braggs Apple Cider Vinegar.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to hear about this product.  I&#x27;ve been shelling out money on expensive facial products, lotions, derma roller, clairsonic, peels, and pretty much everything else in between.  I&#x27;m 22 with slight acne, theres always a few small bumps.  My teenage years where a very different story.  I was left with a lot of faded red spots on my face, from pimples 2 years ago, 5 years ago...they just won&#x27;t go away.  My pores are gigantic just like my moms.  So just to give you an idea of my background.  I used the Derma Roller for 2 months straight, once a week on my face and it got rid of 90% of the left behind red marks. It&#x27;s sold on Amazon as well if you have some scars left behind you need to take care of.  So my new objective was to shrink my pores.  I almost gave up until I found this stuff.  It got here in about 3 days suprisingly...I mixed it up about an hour after I opened the package, I was pretty eager.  Although I didnt have any apple cider vinegar, I figured id try it with water first.  It was lumpy, but I slapped it on anyways... after about 10 minutes it feels like your face is throbbing kinda, but I don&#x27;t mind it at all.  35 minutes later I washed my face in the shower, and as long as you are patient and let the warm water to the majority of the work with light rubbing, the clay should turn back into mud and rinse off nicely, not in clumps.  I put a little lotion on my face after the shower and took a glance in the mirror...it was slightly pink, so I did some things around the house and waited a while before I looked again...after I looked in the mirror, I texted my mom and told her she had to try it.  The next day she did, and she told me that her black heads all just came the very top and where so easily extracted. My mom is a tom boy in a way, so its hard to sell her on any beauty product, where as I will rub pig blood on my face if you told me it would work...So a believe and a non believe is sold on this amazing pore shrinking, CHEAP product!CHEAP product!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter taught me how to make my own face powder with this.  My face is amzingly soft.  It though it would be drying but it is not.</li>
            <li> I have only tried the mask once so far. It is messy and a pain to mix. But, my face pulsates after a few minutes and my skin became so tight that I definitely could not leave it on longer than 20 min. My face felt very smooth and my pores look better already.</li>
            <li> Just used this for the first time and so far so good!  Left my face red, but the jar says that is normal.  It totally shrunk my huge pores on my nose and the overall texture of my skin feels smoother.</li>
            <li> I love this clay.  Really tightens pores and makes your face or other areas feel clean and tightened.  If there are related products (a facial mask), would love to buy but haven&#x27;t seen anything available.</li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth afterwards. :)</li>
            <li> I really like it and so does my sister. You can use it many times before you even start to make a dent in the powder. It works really well but can cause your face to look a little red after. According to other reviews and the description, it&#x27;s because all the blood rushes to your face and the impurities are coming out of your skin. Your face might feel a little dry afterwards so be sure to apply face lotion. You might want to reconsider if you have sensitive skin because this thing is heavy duty. Make sure to crack most of it off over a trashcan because it can clog your pipes and drains since it is clay. Then you can wipe it off with a wet washcloth. Make sure to wash your face carefully after.</li>
            <li> i read all the amazing reviews and couldnt help but to go to whole foods and bought it.  The cashier even looked at the product before the scan and said i heard this stuff is good... Well I waited two days before I concocted my clay mixture.  All the tightening and clay cleasing felt good but i feel like my pores are not going away...</li>
            <li> I use this as a spot treatment on zits and it works well.  Just wish it was a little easier to mix up and remove.</li>
            <li> Holy smokes is all I have to say about this product. I saw it here on Amazon and was contemplating buying it, but then I saw it in the beauty section at Whole Foods and bought it along with the Apple Cider Vinegar. I used it when I got home and this stuff isn&#x27;t lying when it says it tightens your face. It truly does feel like it&#x27;s sucking on your face. You really can feel your face pulsating, but it&#x27;s not painful. Washing it off is a little uncomfortable because it&#x27;s so rock hard by the end of the 20 mins...and it leaves your face a little red...but it goes away after about 30 mins. I LOVE this mask! My skin feels so clean aftewards</li>
            <li> My wife bought it and she really liked. It really makes the skin cleaner.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Skin feels amazing after use. Utilize apple cider vinegar for a deeper clean</li>
            <li> I finally got my clay jugs in! Here&#x27;s my first experience. My facial acne is not the worse, but I figured I need to do a little more&lt;br /&gt;to keep it under control. My first paste mixing was very poor. I had the applecider vinegar in all. But I did not measure&lt;br /&gt;anything evenly so my clay mix was very watery. Anxious to try it out, I just went ahead and applied a bad mixture. It was all patchy&lt;br /&gt;and looked more like I had a light glaze on my face. Never any thick spots of clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now here&#x27;s the good part. All I&#x27;ve said so far is how bad I was at using the clay. Essentially, it cant be mixed any worse than me!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I let it dry and continued and washed my face off. I did not even get to feel the so called \\&quot;pulsing\\&quot; feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Well, after I got my face cleaned off I had some redness(as stated there would be). My face was a little stiff feeling&lt;br /&gt;so I went and waited an hour for my face to re-moisturize. I should have used lotion but it was garbage from the store.&lt;br /&gt;You know, that trash cheap lotion that contains Titanium dioxide. The whole point is to purify your face right? exactly...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway 80% of my acne was gone when I woke up!(keep in mind I only have light acne + I mixed the clay poorly).&lt;br /&gt;All I need to do now is avoid sugar and drink lots of waters and I don&#x27;t think I will have to deal with uncontrollable acne ever again.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m more than confident when I mix the clay properly next time, I will have unimaginable results.&lt;br /&gt;This product is a pure unlimited Jackpot for the skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I will be cleaning other areas of my skin next :) Why not?</li>
            <li> I did notice my skin was tighter after using this, but I have not seen much other results.  I originally purchased it to combat adult acne, but I have not seen difference when using this product.  I probably would not buy this again.  Also, I forced my husband to use this and it made his skin very red. I am the one with sensitive skin, so I was shocked it did not affect me in that way, only him. After removing his skin was bright red for several hours.  Just a word of caution to others!</li>
            <li> Wow after reading the reviews I went ahead and purchase this product! To my surprise it was indeed great! Part apple cider vinegar and part clay is all it takes for amazing skin, unbelievable! I have to say its quite messy in the beginning but overall the experience for a high end facial nothing compared to the Indian Healing Clay. Great for many usage too! I&#x27;m one happy consumer!!! Thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> I have combination oily skin that tends to dry/chap with New England winters. I don&#x27;t have acne or acne prone skin, my biggest issue is blackheads around my nose. I have used it with ACV but prefer to use it in conjunction with organic yogurt. The product is awesome and leaves my skin clean, the redness goes away after 20 minutes but it doesn&#x27;t burn and it certainly isn&#x27;t torture like other reviewers describe it..it just tingles a bit. A little goes a long way and this has lasted me over two years and I have yet to see the bottom of the container. I would buy again once I have no more left.</li>
            <li> Worked just as it is said to, made my face feel so clean and soft after a few days of use</li>
            <li> i wouldn&#x27;t swear by it or anything, but it&#x27;s a nice face mask, feels good on the skin. nice texture and feels clean and soft after. doesn&#x27;t seem to help with acne at all but i like it anyway</li>
            <li> I purchased my Indian Healing Clay here on Amazon. I would recommend this seller, product was what I was expecting, and it arrived on time and well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I also purchased this with the Bragg raw Apple Cider from Amazon and was also pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Quite a few people mentioned that this mask was kind of \\&quot;uncomfortable\\&quot;, or not for the faint of heart. That made me a little nervous about trying it. Mainly because I have sensitive, acne prone skin. BUT, this mask was actually pretty gentle! And it didn&#x27;t really start the \\&quot;pulsing\\&quot; feeling (which wasn&#x27;t unpleasant at all) until torwards the end. It does get very very tight as it dries, and its a fun at home spa treatment you can do by yourself, or with your friends. It also got a little bit tingly torwards the end but nothing intense. When I rinsed it off my skin was red, but not super bright red. My skin felt really clean, and smooth. By the way, I left it on for a little over 20 minutes. I can&#x27;t wait to start using it over a longer period of time to see more results!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE I cannot express how mug I live this stuff it&#x27;s my first time using it and it took my black heads right now also my face isint oily anymore and oh so soft yes if you leave it on to long it will burn but you have to follow directions Dec recommend</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so smooth after using it consistently. My younger cousin that suffers from acne has used it and has noticed her breakouts decreasing.</li>
            <li> Indian Healing Clay is  terrific.  I&#x27;ve used it for years.  It is mixed either with vinegar or water until it is a paste then spread on one&#x27;s face and allowed to dry. I like to lie in bed with my head hanging over the edge to allow as much blood as possible to flow to my face.  It takes about 15 or 20 minutes to dry depending on how thickly it is applied.  It&#x27;s best removed in the shower because it forms a formidable substance once dry.  It pulls blood to the surface of the skin while at the same time drawing out impurities.  When rinsed off one&#x27;s skin looks radiant.  Highly recommended if you want to care for your skin into old ago.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like this mask. You have to work so hard to get this on smoothly without putting clumps of clay on your face. I prefer using Multani Mittee, which is another type of clay but goes on easily.</li>
            <li> As an acne sufferer since I was a teenager (now 34) I have tried every scrub, mask, treatment and ointment I could get my hands on. In full disclosure, my skin has gotten exponentially better since my teens, but I still break out regularly and have an oily unpredictable complexion. I use this mask between once and twice a week and have seen a drastic difference. I highly recommend using the cider vinegar (frankly I don&#x27;t see the point of using it with water since you don&#x27;t get the satisfying pulsing effect). I have seen a dramatic difference in my skin using the mask in combination with a regular skin program. I echo what others have said as well - the whipped consistency is really the key to getting the most out of the mask.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I applied it to my face and I emerged from the mask glowing. My boyfriend has itchy dermatitis on his leg that hasn&#x27;t responded to any topical medications. He put this on the sores for 20 minutes, and it has almost completely cleared up overnight. We couldn&#x27;t believe it! I have Psoriasis, so I&#x27;m going to apply the clay and see if it responds to it. This stuff is an all-natural, decently priced godsend!</li>
            <li> As a clay face masked it worked good did it purpose of deeply cleaning your pores out. It will leave you face very red after you wash it off, but the mask cleared my acne. It works best with apple cider vinegar, but using with water it works fine to just the results might not be as good. Make sure after you use it you apply a moisturizer because it can really dry out your skin. I had hives from a reaction to medicine I was on,and it you mix the clay with water it can help calm hives from the itching and burning too.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it was a good product it can be a little bit of a pain to use compared to face masks already in a tube. It is a slightly messy product to use compared to a pre-made mask, but i will say it works better than any other pre-made mask iv used. The container is a large container filled with lots of powder, im not sure if i can use it all before the expiration date</li>
            <li> This product is unpredictable, but generally I like it. Sometimes it gives the illusion that acne is being cleared, then like an hour later all the acne comes back. I don&#x27;t really think it works for acne, except it shrinks my blackheads sometimes. It kind of stings my skin, sometimes so much that I can&#x27;t even leave it on for one minute. I recommend using only a small amount and putting apple cider vinegar, it helps the sting go away. This product seems like it&#x27;s more for skin improvement than acne. I would recommend Clean &amp; Clear 3 step cleanser over this any day. Buy this if you aren&#x27;t prone to acne or looking for an acne cream.</li>
            <li> This thing really does wonder. I use it as a mask two times a week and it works great, leaves my skin feel clean! Adding that it is 100% natural and nothing but pure clay  makes it the best mask on the market!! Would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s has lived up to the claims made, happy with my purchase .</li>
            <li> I discovered Aztec Secret 10 years ago and was glad to find I could order it through Amazon. It is an amazing facial you mix with vinegar. Love it! And it is very affordable.</li>
            <li> First, it does not dissolve well in water. Second, when I used vinegar, it totally ruined my skin because of the acidity</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I love how it makes my skin feel clean and fresh. Having acne postpartum, I used with apple cider vinegar and it really helped to bring the pimples to the surface both on my face and my back.</li>
            <li> Combine aztec clay-apple cider vinegar-honey....best combo...the honey moisturizes and kills bacteria...try it you will love it!!! I do it once or twice a week, no pimple and my face is glowing.  When I first started using it people kept asking me if i was preggo, because my face was glowing!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any marked difference in my skin, it feels good when I use this product. My skin does tighten then redden after I take it off.</li>
            <li> This is seriously an awesome product, but should only be part of your bags of tricks for overall skincare. If you already aren&#x27;t using a cleanser, a toner, and a moisturizer with sun protection everyday then this will not be the magic end-all be-all of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit of background on my skin type; it is generally considered combination and is breakout prone, however I sway to only slightly oily and slightly dry. I have large pores and often treat them with a BHA liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I got the Clay is because of all the minerals it can deposit into your skin and to help tighten pores, which this does very well. However, the biggest suggestion I can make is do not...I repeat DO NOT use this with Apple Cider Vinegar! I have seen success stories on other posts, and for those people that&#x27;s fantastic. However, ACV is not a proven ingredient in topical skin care! When ingested, it has great benefits for skin, but doesn&#x27;t do anything for the surface of the skin but smell funky and do a little bit more exfoliating. If you are somebody who is applying this clay purely for the removal of dead skin, then be my guest and mix ACV with it. I mean, if ACV is as great for skin as many people claim, why hasn&#x27;t there been more companies to include it in their formulas? For me, it just doesn&#x27;t make sense. Plus, there are several people who are severely allergic to it, causing nasty bumps on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I personally get the most out of my clay treatment is directly after cleansing, I mix this 1:1 with distilled water and add a teaspoon of my favorite toner. The toner that I find most beneficial for my skin type is the Paula&#x27;s Choice Purely Natural Gentle Toner. I find that this toner has a lot of really great antioxidants and some really great ingredients that feel great on the skin. I also like to add a few drops of Melaleuca AKA Tea Tree Oil to help with my acne-prone skin. However, if you use a Benzoyl Peroxide already I do not suggest this addition. Just make sure that your toner does not contain any sort of Alcohol or other potentially irritating ingredients; remember, it&#x27;s staying on your face for at least 15 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask is supposed to stay on your face for a long time, why not get the most out of the best ingredients?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To take the mask off, let your face soak in water to soften the clay. Don&#x27;t try to scrub it off, just wash it off nice and easy. Follow up with your regular routine, and you are good to go! Do this once or twice a week, spot treat with it when you need it, or use as tolerated. The results from the mask may be temporary, but if you have damaged skin like I did this can be a crucial part in helping you heal faster.Just make sure that your toner does not contain any sort of Alcohol or other potentially irritating ingredients; remember, it&#x27;s staying on your face for at least 15 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask is supposed to stay on your face for a long time, why not get the most out of the best ingredients?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To take the mask off, let your face soak in water to soften the clay.

            <li> I am overall very pleased with this mask. I mixed it with water per the instructions (you can also use apple cider vinegar), applied a moderately thick layer to my face and let dry. It was a bit difficult to get off and it did leave my skin quite red afterwards (instructions say redness will subside after 30 minutes). My skin felt great after the redness left, and very clean. Highly recommend this as a detoxifying mask.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial mask I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of beauty items. I go to a wonderful spa in West Hollywood, and my skin always looks great afterwards. However, even after extractions, they are never able to get all of the dirt out of my pores. This mask will get the dirt out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, I know the packaging isn&#x27;t fancy or beautiful. There isn&#x27;t a fancy, expensive price either. I bought this from Amazon.com for about $8.00. It is a little frustrating to use because it doesn&#x27;t come in a ready-to-use mask form. It comes in powder and you mix it with water until you get a watery paste. One tablespoon of the powder is enough to do a mud mask.&lt;br /&gt;The first jar my mother gave me I threw in the trash because I thought it was worthless and didn&#x27;t even bother to read the directions. This jar I skeptically mixed and put what looked like mud paste with clumps I couldn&#x27;t quite smooth out on my face. You leave it on 20 minutes. The first 10 minutes are fine. The last 10 minutes your face is literally frozen with solidified mud. I move my face around so I won&#x27;t be uncomfortable. The results are amazing everytime ... cleaner skin than when I go to my lovely West Hollywood spa.</li>
            <li> Never would&#x27;ve thought this product would be absolutely amazing! I love it &amp; recomend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> I started my period the week for my dance and I knew I had to use some miracle worker to fix my skin... I used this only one time before the dance and all the peeling skin I had from my over used acne medicine all came off. My skin felt amazing and i put moisturizer on it after and I LOVED THE FEELING. Best mask ever</li>
            <li> this is my favorite beauty secret item!!!&lt;br /&gt;thanks!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from acne since high school. After taking birth control, my acne got better and stayed like that for a year. But suddenly my acne returned in full force and I was devastated. I tried so many things. Before trying this one, I was in doxycycline 100mg, and I&#x27;m not sure if that really helped me. But I can say for sure this helped me out. It allows acne to be popped and disappear x2 faster. I do this everyday.</li>
            <li> THE BEST!! I never would have thought a simple clay mask would be so amazing. I admit that I do not have cystic or extreamly bad acne, but have read that this product works for that just as well. My acne is more moderate, but leaves scars. I researched a lot of products and saw this and thought, it&#x27;s cheap and has a lot of good reviews, why not try it? Well, I ordered it and the shipping was fast. That night I mixed it with Apple cider vinegar and I dint like the smell but I don&#x27;t like the smell of vinegar in general anyways, but I felt my face tingle and get tight. I could almost feel my acne getting dried up! I left the mask on for 20 min and washed it off. ( washing it off is the worst, i placed paper towels in the sink to catch the large clumps of clay to prevent clogging my sink). My face felt so clean!!!  Now, my face was a bit red but that went away overnight. The next night I mixed it with water, and found that it mixed a little easier but worked just as good. Now my acne is so much better form using it twice a week. I barely have acne. I still have scars, but preventing new acne to make new scars will help the healing process.  I would recommend this to anyone to give it a try,</li>
            <li> You look nasty with it on, but this stuff is great! The &amp;#34;pulsing&amp;#34; you experience while it&#x27;s on is quite fun!</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne on my chin for years.  After using this treatment for 2 weeks, my chin is completely clear.  In the past I have tried all kinds of washes and been to the dermatologist many times and never had much success. I think our skin becomes congested by our diets and all the makeup and products we apply to it that it just needs to be cleaned out. I apply the mask every other day. Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> best product I&#x27;ve used, Very good for pimples</li>
            <li> I have not try it cause it like lime powder. The transport is very fast and quite a big bottle.</li>
            <li> I got this for myself as a deep cleansing mask and love it for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brother also loves this mark, he says it helps control his oily skin and breakouts. He uses it whenever he feels a breakout coming as a spot treatment and it helps him.</li>
            <li> This product will feel like it is literally sucking the life out of your face and it will leave proof by making your face as red as could be. But oh my is it worth it! I have always had oily skin that caused multiple black heads and acne which would always leave discoloration and hyperpigmentation. This mask in particular has changed my face! No longer do I have to go through the humiliating process of unhealthy skin. I do think that the apple cider vinegar(I use the unfiltered kind with the \\&quot;mother\\&quot; in it)vastly increases the healing power. Some products overpass the test of time because they are pure and natural. This is one of those investments that will not do you wrong. Do yourself a favor and get this mask and even for your close friends because change is what we all need.</li>
            <li> not working ,dont waste your money  thank u .  It not gonna help prove your skin&lt;br /&gt; ........</li>
            <li> I have an oily skin &amp; I&#x27;m prone to acne. Cluelessly I tried a lot of oils on my face - argan, tea tree, lavender. Each one only worsened my problems as my face couldn&#x27;t taken any oil at all.&lt;br /&gt;I initially used this clay with apple cider but the fumes from ACV was too much for me. Now I use it with egg white ( I save a few drops from my breakfast eggs) &amp; there&#x27;s a lot of improvement in my skin. Feels smooth &amp; I heavent had any breakouts in about 6 weeks that I&#x27;ve been regularly using this. It&#x27;s not a miracle. But it healed gradually . Also I&#x27;ve stopped using my foundation . Don&#x27;t seem to need it everyday now.</li>
            <li> This mask feels like its pulling my brain thru my face and I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using apple cider vinegar vs water is the way to go. It makes he mask moussey instead of lumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think half of the appeal is the way it feels on my skin as its drying. It&#x27;s tingly and tight and it just feels satisfying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything for my skin.  Went to the Dermatologist for awhile which helped.. went on an antibiotic and a couple topical creams.  Yet, my acne was still slightly there.  A stranger came up to me and recommended I use this product.  At first, I was appalled that someone called me out in public for the bumps in my skin..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I know  why they recommended this product.  It&#x27;s amazing.  I&#x27;ve tried it a few times and can already notice a drastic change in my skin.  After applying it to my entire face I noticed my pores became smaller and my skin was much smoother.  I also use it daily as a spot treatment and leave it on for about 20 minutes.. that way it doesn&#x27;t dry out your entire face and focuses on those trouble areas.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I used this mask.. and can feel it works very quick.. but it is not my favorite since it is a bit messy.</li>
            <li> I bought this and it shipped on time as promised.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had problem skin, specifically dry and oily, with intermittent acne. My pores have always been large.&lt;br /&gt;My first time trying this I got some friends together. We mixed it raw apple cider vinegar and it made a nice smooth (and bubbly) paste. We placed it on our face and played a board game while it dried. It felt good, refreshing. I will admit taking it off was difficult, and i would run hot water down the drain for a while after, so that it doesn&#x27;t clog your drain! I peeled off a large chunk of it from my face, and i could see little oil stains on it, it really did draw out the oil/gook from my pores! My skin was red for a good 30/40 mins after, so do this on a night you don&#x27;t have any plans! My skin was smooth after, like...ridiculously smooth! I followed it up with alcohol free whitchhazel and moisturizer...my skin has never felt so smooth! (Not to mention, my pores are less noticeable! YAY!). I would absolutely recommend this product! : )</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I am an older woman and have been having all kinds of problems with my face breaking out.  Too oily, too dry.  Nothing seems to work very well.  But I have used this twice now (and you don&#x27;t need more than one spoonful) and it makes my skin feel so good afterwards.  It&#x27;s a little messy but well worth it.  I will be buying this again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I havae used this for a facial mask for many years.  It&#x27;s the best</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and suffer from occasional hormonal cystic acne. I&#x27;ve used benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid for years and noticed that the appearance of my skin declining. So I decided to turn to a more natural alternative. I&#x27;ve experimented with a few different clays to try to solve my acne issues. I&#x27;ve tried French Green clay and Lerosett (rhassoul clay), and this bentonite clay. I will say that this product is pretty good you can really feel your face pulsating as it sucks out all the toxins. I actually tried this b/c of the price and it works great for being so inexpensive. The one thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is that when you attempt to wash it off it is sooooo thick and has clogged up my drain. Compared to the other clays I&#x27;ve tried this is the thickest when rinsing off and you must apply a thick layer for the clay to be effective. I would say that this compared to the other clays is the harshest on my skin. My skin is considered combination/oily and not sensitive at all but it did leave redness on my face for about 10 minutes. I also noticed that after rinsing the product I felt I had little cuts on my face. I didn&#x27;t but that&#x27;s what it felt like. I also have hyperpigmentation issues and noticed that this clay doesn&#x27;t really help at all with any scarring but the other clays do. This is a good product but if you have hyperpigmentation issues like myself I would suggest a more expensive clay. Also, don&#x27;t forget to moisturize after the clay b/c it will leave your face very dry.</li>
            <li> This is te best face mask I have tried! It works for both my acne and acne scars better then proactive and way cheaper!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a man and my face is usually dirty after work.  i bought this to help keep my pores clear.  i&#x27;ve used it twice so far, and it works great.</li>
            <li> I went and bought this from a vitamin store after reading a few things about it. i was a little skeptical at first but i figured it was worth a shot. i feel in love with this stuff! i use it every night! i mix one part water and one part clay and then add tee tree oil to it as well.the smell of the iol helps me relax while i have it on and also it is said to have a antibacterial effect in it. i have been using this for about a week and i already notice a difference in my face. when i use the mask i dont wash it off i peel off what i can. i also try and let it dry all the way. which means it will be on longer than it says to. when you peel it off you can see what it is doing. if you have larger pores or clogged pores you will be able to see the stuff that came out and is know on the mask when you peel it off. its gross but at the same time its cool because you actually know it is working! my pores are almost all clear! and they have reduced in size to where you can barely see them. heres what i do step by step&lt;br /&gt;1)mix 1 part water 1 part clay 2-3 drops of tee tree oil&lt;br /&gt;2)put the mask on and let it set till it all dries!&lt;br /&gt;3)peel off then wash off the remainder&lt;br /&gt;4) apply witch hazel&lt;br /&gt;5) apply a moisturizer that has acne fighting agents in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i dont use vinager bc my face dries out very easily so if you think you can handle the vinigar then you may have even better results than this.</li>
            <li> I love this clay!!! I am currently &amp;#34;Team Natural&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m always looking for &#x27;natural&#x27; products to add to my daily routine.  I&#x27;ve been hearing rave reviews about this product and that fact that it&#x27;s multipurpose makes it even better.  Of course as soon as I got it, I made a mask just by adding equal parts of apple cider vinegar (1 tbsp each).  I mixed them together in a small Ziploc baggie and applied it.  Within minutes, I could feel it working on my skin.  After about 20 minutes, I removed the mask with warm water.  My skin felt amazing!!! I haven&#x27;t used it in my hair yet but in due time.  I will definitely be purchasing this product in the future.</li>
            <li> AMAZING. Makes your skin red and irritated after use, but amazing way to clear your face out. Use Apple Cider vinegar if your skin can tolerate it for better results. If not, dont do it youll probably burn.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful. It helped get rid my my acne. I had very little acne but broke out on my chin and jaw with blackheads. It makes me skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable how good this stuff works</li>
            <li> Im not going to exaggerate this review and call it a black hole in your face, but it does a good job. Completely got rid of blackheads and my skin is definitely softer and clearer. I had acne as a teen and used birth control to control it, but I&#x27;m off it now and using this as a precautionary measure. I haven&#x27;t had a severe breakout, and I can say the product had something to do with it. I have used other face masks but this works the best so far. So I recommend this, particularly if you have bad skin. Proactive never worked for me but this stuff does. Hope it helps, acne is horrible.</li>
            <li> The other reviewers are right - Use it with apple cider vinegar and you&#x27;ll see the difference. I first tried it with water and it didn&#x27;t do anything. Next time I used ACV and the results were amazing! It is as good as getting a facial done at home. I have oily skin and it cleared up my face well. Used a non-oil based moisturizer after I was done.</li>
            <li> First off, you WILL need vinegar to get this clay dissolved. Water alone did not work for me, but you can combine a little water and apple cider vinegar and the clay will dissolve properly. Otherwise, it&#x27;s impossible to get it into a smooth consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, you do not need a half inch thickness for your face, or whatever thickness the package recommends. A thin layer works just fine. I think I use about a teaspoon or less and an equal portion water/vinegar mixture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, the clay will get very hard, but once you wash it off, it does leave your face really smooth. It also works well for drying out acne if used in certain spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product and can tell it will last me a long, long time. Good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> I accidentally mixed it with cooking wine the first time, so it was really itchy, but when I actually used ACV it worked amaizingly well.</li>
            <li> The product gets very messy when using it and it’s hard to clean. It could be improved if it was ready to use instead of mixing powder with water to put on the face.</li>
            <li> absolutley love it! I never had any skin problems till after my kids were born. I had big pimples around my chin and nothing worked on it till i found this. My face is finally clearing up again only after using for 1 week.</li>
            <li> Great Product, fast delivery</li>
            <li> Let me first start off by telling you my skin type. I have very oily skin, which means that I am also acne prone. I have been realizing that the blackheads on my nose and chin were getting worse, and my face always felt dirty, no matter how much I cleaned it. I read all of the reviews on this bad boy and decided to give it a go, because it&#x27;s worth a shot, especially since it&#x27;s only $5.49. Let me start off by telling you that the shipping was very quick, I got it by the time they told me I would. It showed up and was in perfect condition. Next was the preparation, I have read plenty of reviews and many people said that it was time consuming. I guess that is understandable if you used water. It won&#x27;t mix properly. While using the apple cider vinegar it was very easy to mix. I did a ratio of 1:1. 1  tablespoon of the clay and 1 table spoon of the vinegar and it mixed beautifully and was just the right amount for the face. The application was simple and the smell of it really didn&#x27;t bother me, I actually didn&#x27;t really smell the vinegar at all. It began to dry very quickly, and was completely dry in 25 minutes. I began to feel my face pulsate, and at the thirty minute mark I washed it off. I saw many people say that it clogged their drains, and I found a way to get the mask off of your face easily while not clogging your drains or making a mess! Take a bowl and fill it with warm water. Make sure the bowl is big enough to fit your whole face in and submerge with water. After it is completely dry and it&#x27;s time to take it off, just dunk your face in the water for a few seconds (5-10) and begin using your hands to scrub it off. It comes off pretty easily and isn&#x27;t messy, unless you make a wave pool with the water and the next thing you know its all over your counter and floor...Then once you are done pat your face dry with a towel and look at your face, woah it&#x27;s red. Don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s normal and goes away! After using this...I can honestly say that I have never been more happy with a product. My pores are so much smaller, and my black heads are almost completely gone! My skin is baby soft! After using this on your skin and it is completely dry remember to go in with a moisturizer, because now any treatment you want to use with sink right in. I use the Garnier Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel-Cream. The redness will go down with time. My skin looks awesome! I highly recommend this and already have my friends going online to purchase for themselves. Get this stuff, it&#x27;s pretty badass.ppy with a product.

            <li> This stuff is amazing! I&#x27;ve tried everything to treat my acne and this worked first use. I mixed it with organic apple cider vinegar and once it dried, I rinsed it off and now my skin is noticeably clearer.</li>
            <li> I love this for DYI face masks.  Tori L.</li>
            <li> Great when used with apple cidar vinegar. This comes with a lot of clay so can be used for a long time!</li>
            <li> So this is one of my favorite products. Just mix it with apple cider vinegar and apply to face. It really cleans well but the only downside is your skin will be a bit red after using it but it works great. My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in a long time. I haven&#x27;t had a pimple in 2 months using this and my skin looks healthy and clear. I highly recommend this product, but if you do have sensitive skin I wouldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully! Just as described. Feels great afterward. Love the tingle you get that says it is really working!! Have recommended to friends and family.</li>
            <li> thank you  very much,order it ,got it very happy</li>
            <li> Its just OK in my opinion. I was expecting more from all the high reviews. My skin does look better but it did not reduce the pores as well as I would have like. My skin does look clean after a 20 min session and a face wash. I have used a refining mask before that had sulfur acne treatment and it was a clay like mask and after that one the pores around my nose were almost completely gone. After using this I still see a lot of my pores around my nose and that is the main area I want clear and smooth on and around the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will give it a month and a few more masks and see how I feel about it.</li>
            <li> works great in my natural and organic products</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t I know about this magical clay in high school?? I&#x27;ve had acne ever since I was in 7th grade. The hormonal kind that sucks your confidence into a black hole. My skin is sensitive but more on the normal side. I&#x27;ve had nasty white heads and black heads since middle school. I would stand in front of the mirror and pop every pimple with pus in it until there weren&#x27;t any left.. (bad, I know), and it created scarring and sadness for me. I&#x27;ve been doing it for 5 years. :( I&#x27;ve tried Pro-Activ, The Regimen from Acne.org, and many other acne products you can pick up at Walmart. I&#x27;ve seen no results with anything until now. Using something natural on your face makes more since than putting chemicals on it, right?? The first night I used the clay (mixing it with Bragg brand apple cider vinegar) my face felt less oily, and less full with nasty gunk. Don&#x27;t worry about using apple cider vinegar on your face. Yes it&#x27;s an acid but not too acidic for your face to harm it. It actually balances the pH of your skin. The second night using this product made my face feel smooth as a baby&#x27;s ass and that&#x27;s nice. I could see my zits clearing up and shrinking. The third night using it basically cleared my skin. I only have a few zits left but now my face is glowing and clearer than it has ever been since 7th grade. My scars are fading because of the vinegar. I LOVE this clay. I&#x27;m glad it had good reviews so I was more motivated to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clay tightens your face and it&#x27;s very hard to make any facial expressions lol. And you&#x27;ll look like a lizard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;The clay dries very hard so you need to take a warm shower to get it off or press a warm washcloth on your face to loosen the clay and then wipe it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not let the clay go down the drain if you decide to pick off the clay. Line your sink with paper towels for easy cleanup and no drain problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reccommend using apple cider vinegar. You can find it in the pickle isle at Walmart! Another good way to mix the clay is to use raw and unfiltered honey! Honey is good for healing, just like the clay. Add water because the honey/clay mix will be thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do not need 1/4 inch of clay on your face like the container says. That&#x27;s just wasting. A thin layer works just as well :)is to use raw and unfiltered honey! Honey is good for healing, just like the clay. Add water because the honey/clay mix will be thick.

            <li> My skin feels amazingly soft after using this product.  I have noticed it is helping to clear up any blemishes I have.  I haven&#x27;t noticed much for reduced pore visibility, but have only had the product for a few days and am hoping to see a change soon.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Bentonite Indian Healing Clay. I have used other brands of healing clay before and love using it for deep cleaning, so when I was offered this Aztec Secret Indian healing clay I gladly accepted it at a promotional price in return for my my honest opinion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say this is fabulous! Indian Healing clay is used to detox and revitalize your skin. It gives your skin a deep clean and helps with anti-aging as well. I used this and immediately noticed that there was a decrease in my pore size. I use this mask primarily do decrease the size of my pores but I try a lot of variations with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are few options that you can try:&lt;br /&gt;**Every time I do it, the mask stays on my face(sometimes body too) for 10-15 mins until dry and then I wash it with warm water. Its easy to apply and hop to shower so to avoid mess in sink **&lt;br /&gt;1tsp Indian healing clay + 2 tsp Rose water - Normal days&lt;br /&gt;1tsp Indian healing clay + 2 tsp Plain yogurt - More moisture needed&lt;br /&gt;1tsp Indian healing clay + 1/4 tsp Vinegar + 1/2 tsp rose water - Deep pore cleaning&lt;br /&gt;1/2 tsp Indian healing clay + 1/2 tsp Powdered oats - Scrub and deep cleaning&lt;br /&gt;1/2 tsp Indian healing clay + 1/2 tsp milk + 1/2 rose water - Pore cleaning&lt;br /&gt;1/2 tsp Indian healing clay + 1/2 tsp lemon juice - To clean oily t-zone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The recipes are endless, but this is a miracle product, it really does wonders to the skin just after 1 application, try it out!&lt;br /&gt;Best of all it is a perfect dupe for glam glow mud mask! Save 70$ or more n get this clay which is natural, cruelty free and loaded with minerals!</li>
            <li> bought 1 container, loved it! bought 2 more for gifts. I use it weekly for myself and husband. Now my son wants me to put it on his face too!. Really takes all the junk out of your face especially blackheads.</li>
            <li> I really never had bad acne just wanted something to keep my face looking good and young! This stuff really does help! I love the way it feels and it cleans your face down to the last bit. I don&#x27;t even see any imperfections up close whatsoever. My friend who has bad acne used it for a week and his face began to clear up, it&#x27;s the best thing you can do for your face without having to suffer expensive medical costs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better ones from Deep Sea Minerals from Australia and it came pre mixed. But it&#x27;s okay i guess.</li>
            <li> It does everything it promises.  Your face pulsates, loosens blackheads, makes your skin ultra soft.  Very easy to mix.  It has seriously calmed down my raging acne.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of this and thought it might be just a hippie trend, but my skin looked better after just one use.  I used it with the Bragg Organic Apple Cider Vinegar, mixing it in a small bowl to a whipped, smooth consistency and keeping it on in a thin layer until all parts were dry (a good time to shave your legs). Then I rinse and wash with a gentle cleanser and the little \\&quot;scrublet\\&quot; that came with Loreal&#x27;s 360 Clean cleanser. My pores look so much better, my skin doesn&#x27;t look as dull, and my breakouts have been greatly reduced after maybe 3 masks in 3 weeks.  My boyfriend has even noticed.  Yes, your skin will look red afterwards (but my skin always looks red), after a little while that will go away, and I think it has reduced my redness overall.  It seems fine for very sensitive skin, however I would still only use it every 5-7 days, with the apple cider vinegar, and apply moisturizer quickly after washing.  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I really want to like this product but it just isn&#x27;t exactly what I was hoping for.  For one thing, it is a powder that you mix yourself.  I am sure it probably said that in the product description, but I missed it.  I am ok with that though.  My complaint is that no matter how much I mix, no matter what combination of powder, water and vinegar I use, I cannot get it to a smooth consistency.  It is more like cottage cheese.  It doesn&#x27;t go on easily, it doesn&#x27;t feel good and I am not sure that it is making my skin look any better.  It is just ok.</li>
            <li> This mask leaves you face feeling so smoth. Love it</li>
            <li> This broke me out pretty bad. I haven&#x27;t broke out bad in the past year due to using raw honey as a face wash. This just made things way worse. I bought it it to help get rid of blackheads, which it barely did. I understand some things break you out before they work but I used it many times within a month and it never got better. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, but only if you mix with an acidic liquid, in order to balance the ph, since the clay itself is highly alkaline and will destroy the skin if you use with water alone. I tested the ph using strips and confirmed. So Apple cider vinegar or lemon juice is best , since both are equally acidic. However, if you use lemon juice, you need to stay away from the sun for several hours because citrus makes skin photosensitive. I think the instructions on the pack should not even recommend mixing with water. Also, it&#x27;s important that you measure carefully and use equal parts of this clay and ACV. Wrong proportion will influence the ph of the final paste you end up with. A thin layer will do.</li>
            <li> Can be a bit messy. I like that is a simple product and does not have tons of suspicious or harmful chemicals. I mix it with a bit of warm water and it will turn super clumpy. It&#x27;s kind of difficult getting the right consistency and hard to get it even on the skin. Regardless, leave it on for 10-15 minutes especially in a dry cool environment and you will feel your skin and pores tighten like never before. Once it is completely dry and you feel like your lips and eyes are about to burst, go wash it off with warm water. Smooth N Silky skin. Hoorah.</li>
            <li> My face felt like it was being vacuumed!!! Holy moly! This is incredible. Buy the big one, you will want it! Ps- seriously heed the warning about redness- my skin did not feel or look irritated at all but was very red for about 30 minutes post removal (I am guessing this is caused by blood rushing to the surface of the skin) so make sure you give yourself some time before stepping out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product nightly with organic apple cider vinegar and I can see the difference in my complexion.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff....very healing inside and outside</li>
            <li> Love this clay will continue to use.Thanks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this clay does what it does, but it certainly made my hair react differently that it has to other hair products...and in a good way. I have natural kinky curly hair (3c/4a) and heard that this clay works wonders on our hair. So, I mixed up a half cup of the clay with equal parts aloe vera juice (for best PH level) little by little until it had a pudding-like consistency. Then I got in the shower, wet my hair and started squooshing it in, section by section, from root to tip, until my whole head was done. You MUST do this in the shower or the clay mixture will get all over everything in sight. Then I put a plastic cap on for about 20 minutes, THOROUGHLY rinsed it all out and then conditioned hair and scalp with TRESemme Naturals Nourishing Moisturizing Conditioner (my favorite). My hair was definitely clean and soft after, but the big surprise came later when it was dry. My curls had a lovely defined but looser pattern that I don&#x27;t normally get. I almost felt that I could do a wash and go for the first time in my life! I braided it that night for stretch, and the next day my hair was just gorgeous. It wasn&#x27;t frizzy, the shine was very nice and the curl definition was perfect. I must say, I didn&#x27;t expect anything when I tried this clay, but I definitely saw a difference from what my hair normally does. Because it&#x27;s a bit messy to use (like Henna without the color all over the place), I will only do this once a month, but will absolutely keep it in my regimen. I have also used this clay mixed with apple cider vinegar for spot acne treatments and it works very well for that too. All in all a great inexpensive product that does what it says it will do and then some.</li>
            <li> You do not have to glop it on half an inch thick for it to work. Just enough to cover skin does the job. Mixed with vinegar it really pulls crap out of pores (mainly the nose). This jar will last me for a year or two.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice now but I defintley see results. It&#x27;s nice to have something that doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of ingredients that don&#x27;t seem to help anyway. I have occasional acne and this by far is the best treatment for it. Benzoyl peroxide wash and salicylic acid don&#x27;t seem to help me. Love this product!!!! Feels great on too!!!</li>
            <li> This made my skin feel so soft!  I have only used it once, but after I rinsed it off and all through the next day, my skin felt baby soft!  You don&#x27;t even need very much!</li>
            <li> This stuff is remarkable, it truly is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not only a relaxing facial, but it will smooth your skin and help remove any blemishes while doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not a peel-off facial and will not magically clear up any facial acne in one use, but it definitely helps defend my skin from impurities. I suggest using it twice a week for near flawless skin!</li>
            <li> This product is definitely one of the best facial masks that I&#x27;ve ever used. Simple to put together, and goes on easily. Probably the only drawback for me is how long I have to wait for it to dry.. but I&#x27;m just an impatient person and that&#x27;s a long time for me to not be able to open my mouth or talk. It definitely pulls on your face and tightens up quite a bit.. which can get a little irritating. Getting it off can be slightly difficult. I normally just dampen it with some water again and then it comes off easily.. I try to remove it by rubbing it off with wet hands making it a very effective exfoliate. Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Great to have in your skin care routine! It feels like it really cleans your skin and penetrating in to your pores and getting the filth out. This does not dry your skin out nor break out. My co-workers says, &amp;#34;wow your face is glowing! What do you use?&amp;#34; and I simply tell its Aztec Secret.</li>
            <li> This mask worked pretty well. Not a miracle, but good for cleaning out pores and drying out blemishes. Even though it stinks a little, I would suggest mixing with Apple Cider Vinegar, per the instructions, and not water. When I tried mixing with water, the clay clumped and had a really lumpy texture. With the vinegar though, it was very smooth. It fizzes a little, so make sure your bowl is big enough when you mix; it can be a little messy.</li>
            <li> Wow... this product will clean your face, hair and blemishes. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have medium skin tone with a combination skin that has lately been suffering with painful acne and enlarged pores on the sides of the cheeks and sides of the nose.&lt;br /&gt; I got  this clay mask after reading the reviews. I like the fact that the mask  comes in powder form , so i can mix it myself. Honestly it lasts longer that way.&lt;br /&gt;I have been applying the mask,  once in three days and after three applications , I do see a good difference. My skin is a lot smoother and has a glow to it. I am yet to see it  help  lighten the acne scars , i am hopeful about it . i guess time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;The pulling and tingling feeling is definitely intense. I mixed the clay with rose water and a little vegetable glycerin , i like the effect on my face so far. I will update the review as weeks go by.</li>
            <li> I used this product for my hair! My hair type is 4b-4c. i did my research on youtube. It detox your hair and defines your curls!&lt;br /&gt;I also use it in my daughters hair (age 2)  iT works with her hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;Of course it great on your face!&lt;br /&gt; Just make sure you follow the directions and DO NOT MIX WITH METAL SPOON!</li>
            <li> Just got it and used once. Made my face smooth after it, but just like every mask, it hurts to take off. Great with raw Apple cinder vinegar. If you can bare the pain of taking it off get a wash rag and dunk it in raw Apple cinder vinegar or water to get it off.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t seem any difference in my skin but I only used 3 times and had to hold of for a bit due to getting my eyebrows feathered. No bad smell and you can definitely feel a pulling effect on your skin as it dries. Skin will be a little red after use but goes a away with in a hour. My skin felt softer after using.</li>
            <li> Got this about 6 months ago. I did not feel the pulsing. I felt the itching and slight burning of the skin on my eyebrow area, chin, and outer regions of my face. After I washed it off my face did feel clean. As for the miraculous effects, I&#x27;m still waiting on those.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something i could use on my face that wasn&#x27;t harsh to my skin.After reading the reviews i decided to give it a try and I&#x27;m so happy i did ! this stuff is great. It cleaned my pores and my skin hasn&#x27;t looked better. I also used it in my hair after i washed it and my hair and scalp never felt so clean. hint- this stuff will clog your drain so what i did i got one of those plastic drain covers for a dollar for my kitchen sink and while i was taking the stuff off it got all the clay i tossed the gunk in the trash and my sink stayed clog free</li>
            <li> it works wonder on skin. I use it once a week as i have dry skin. it dries out acne within 24hrs and leave skin very cleansed and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is the third time I&#x27;ve purchased this product, and still LOVE it!! Nothing gets my pores cleaner!</li>
            <li> I really like the product. I have blackheads deep with the skin, I am going to use this every few days to see how it is. I love the pulsating, tight,tingling feeling, my lips didn&#x27;t pucker they r naturally huge, ugh. But as for the product, I like, I really hope it gets rid of my blackhead&#x27;s , the other pic is a close up of my nose. So pray for me.</li>
            <li> Love this for skin and hair</li>
            <li> This reminds me of a mud mask i owned from Borghese. Mixing is easy with ACV. I applied on my face with my fingers and left on for 20 min..it dried hard and cracked all over..i felt the pulsating but just like my other mud mask. To me the mask washed off very easily..i splashed warm water and with my fingers adn adding more water it washed off..i dont understand why it says to apply 1/4\\&quot; to 1/2\\&quot; on the instructions and then on the spanish instructions that is not mentioned. I mixed around 1tbs and it was a med coating not too light and not heavy...my face was red after i washed off but like it says in 30min will go back to normal..so keep that in mind! i will keep using it and will post results again...its natural its a mask and im sure its doing the cleaning...</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!!! Buy it today! I have suffered from acne since my early teens now 27. I happened upon this by chance and decieded to give it a try. I mix mine in a zipolic bag with ACV. I use it every few days since I have very acne prone skin. It will cause purging the first few times you use or at least for me it did.  I have been using it for about 4 weeks and my face hasn&#x27;t been this clear in a long time.</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL TRAVELING WITH THIS MASK.  I WAS STOPPED AND THE MASK WAS CONFINSCATED BECAUSE THE INGREDIAENTS ARE ON THE DO NOT FLY LIST...SO I LOST THE COST OF THE PURCHASE....I OPNLY GOT TO USE IT ONE TIME BUT I DID LIKE IT.</li>
            <li> Where has this product been my whole life??&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin look and feel great. It takes away the white heads and the black heads. My skin looks so clear after I use this product.</li>
            <li> I was sold after reading all of the reviews. I tried it and just like everyone has said, its wonderful product. Skin feels so soft and supple after each use. Love it.</li>
            <li> This makes your face feel nice and smooth!</li>
            <li> This works great!  Will take a while to use, but would buy again!</li>
            <li> i do not use this consistantly enough to see any difference. I do not break out very much. But i do mix this with morrocan red clay. My skin leans more towards the dry side, so i have to be careful as to how often i use this clay. One of my friends, who has acne prone skin, she loves it. I do try to use it once a week to help prevent breakouts.</li>
            <li> I heard great things about this product, figured I&#x27;d give it a go...it&#x27;s amazing! My skins feels so soft and has cleared right up! I do not have problematic acne but it worked on the few little spots I get! Best part? It&#x27;s so cheap! It&#x27;s an inexpensive product that does wonders.</li>
            <li> A very strange face mask.  I got this and did not realize that it is an actual clay powder solution that you make at home.  So i mixed water or whatever and made the mask.  It was chunky and sort of unpleasant yet i gave it a try and let it harden on my face.  When i finally was able to get the mask off after some very hot water, my face felt so smooth and nice.  The mask works better than any other mask I&#x27;ve ever used.  I only recommend doing it like every two weeks though.  Its pretty powerful and could dry out your skin i bet.</li>
            <li> Love this! Super comfortable and enjoyable DIY face mask.</li>
            <li> Background: Female, mid 20s. I’ve been breaking out since I was 8 years old. Went through 3 rounds of Accutane over the years (I hold the honors for being the youngest patient MY dermatologist ever prescribed it to, bow down). I bought this clay in May ’14 after reading the reviews. Then I got stage fright and never used it. “It won’t work for ME,” I thought, skimming the reviews. “This is the usual case. Everything works for other people who swear they didn’t think it would work for them but then it did. It won’t work for me because I have such awful skin. Woe is me.” I uncovered the jar 8 months later and was like “well, I bought it. Might as well try it.” I had no plans that night so I made trying this secret clay to be my big plan for the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realized I had no idea how much to mix and I didn’t feel like combing through the Amazon questions and reviews to see if anyone gave out measurements. I’m not really good at winging it with measurements. It’s not a strength of mine. Just tell me how much to use! I think I made it too liquid-y on the first go-round. Though it did harden. 10-15 minutes in, I started feeling panicky. This was my first try at a mask  and I didn’t expect it to be so tight. Was I having an allergic reaction? Was I allergic to apple cider vinegar? (lol) I CAN’T TALK OMG SO TIGHT. I never really felt the pulsing? Just tightness. It’s intense for a first-timer! I went to take the mask off and realized “um wow okay this stuff is really, really, really hardened on there” and I had no idea whatsoever how to get it off. I used a pre-moistened face wipe but that didn’t really work. So I got a wash cloth with warm water. I have very fair, sensitive skin so when it did come off, my face was BRIGHT red. They warn you of this but I was still shocked at how red my whole face was. It was a jarring difference between the areas where I didn’t put the mask (like around my eyes) and the areas where I did. And of course then my friends asked me to go out. Not looking like this! Anyway. They say to expect 30 minutes of redness, but I had to wait a little over an hour before my skin returned to a normal, not so alarming, color.  I moisturized after about 15 minutes. One review here said they use witch hazel, I might seek that out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, my skin was SO soft. I couldn’t believe it. I was the weirdo in line at CVS stroking their own face. Haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it again the next night because I was eager to try again and play around with it some more. This time, I made the mixture in a cheap bowl from the dollar store. For the people who are like me and need step-by-step, I used 1 tablespoon +1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar and the clay. A few reviews mentioned using a make-up brush (makes sense but I immediately was like NO! I love my brushes too much) and the only brush I felt okay using this mixture with was some tiny cheap brush so that’s what I used to paint the mixture on more evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And! The most exciting part: the pulsing! I DEFINITELY felt it! So my second time around trying it I definitely improved: 1) I put it on more evenly (thanks to the brush) and I felt the pulsing, which to me, signified that it was working the way it was supposed to. The pulsing&#x3D; weird feeling! Same really red face as the first time, and it took a little longer to “cool down”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, my face was smoother, softer and generally looked better. I bet over time this will help with acne scars. I really can’t wait to see what using this stuff for 3 weeks will do!nd of course then my friends asked me to go out. Not looking like this! Anyway.

            <li> I read all of these amazing reviews here and it seemed like it&#x27;s a miracle mask so I bought it right away. Gave it a try. Used it for a week, every day (a lot of people said you should use it every day for a while and then magic happens.  And I didn&#x27;t see any changes... And by &amp;#34;any changes &amp;#34; I mean NON, ZERO, NOTHING. How is it even possible?! Good thing it was very cheap purchase, won&#x27;t feel sorry throwing it out</li>
            <li> I guess ancient Aztecs, fleeing the crushing defeat of Spaniard conquerors, took only the essentials: such as, their Indian clay recipe and a goat for milk, keeping the secret safe for future generations of oily-skinned men such as myself. The instructions say to leave it on your face for 15 to 20 minutes. Don&#x27;t take a Xanax and drink half a bottle of wine while you&#x27;re waiting, or your pores will feel like the Spanish conquistadors came 500 years in the future to conquer your face. Also, if you have white pillow cases, the mask leaves a striking stain when you lay face down on the pillow.</li>
            <li> bought as gift no complaints</li>
            <li> omg this stuff really is amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously amazing !!! And super cheap uet extremely effective !! BUY THIS</li>
            <li> Not sure what this stuff is actually doing to my skin, but using it once a week has definitely resulted in fewer zits and better skin tone and texture.  Though its effects are confounded by the other products I use, so I&#x27;m not exactly sure who&#x27;s the real hero.</li>
            <li> Just finished 1st application and I love this.  First value-for-cost is terrific, especially compared to drug-store and department-store competitors.  Plus it&#x27;s light/not heavy on the skin; mine is sensitive so this is a big plus for me.  One word of caution: directions say mix w/equal parts apple-cider vinegar &amp;#34;and/or&amp;#34; water; I suggest combo because scent of vinegar on your face/under your nose can be overpowering.</li>
            <li> Okay.  It took me a minute to get the consistency I needed to make a clay mask...it reminds me of the Queen Helene Mint Julip Face Mask without the fragrance.  It feels good to the face when it&#x27;s starting to dry, and rinsing off was relatively easy...I just used a warm, wet washcloth for the removal.  Clean up, afterwards, was easy, as well.  I would recommend using it no more than twice per week, and only once per week if you have sensitive skin.  If you have a bad problem with acne and oily skin use Apple Cider Vinegar to mix it rather than water.  If you have dry skin and acne, use Sweet Almond Oil, or Avocado Oil, to mix it...and just leave it on for the 10 minutes, no longer.  You really don&#x27;t want clay to dry all the way on your face...as it gets harder to remove.  Always follow up with a cleanser after taking it off, and be sure to use a mild astringent after that.  I use Witch Hazel (organic, fragrance free) and there have been no skin reactions to so much being done at once.  I really like this clay.  I like that there is no fragrance, and that it is so simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for pimples:(</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time today since I was too excited to wait. I&#x27;m honestly REALLY impressed. I have blackheads around my nose and when I took the mask off they were noticeably smaller! I also have a few pimples (I have minor acne around my chin/cheeks) and they were no more puffiness or white heads peeking out. I&#x27;m really impressed! It makes your skin feel tight and smoother after you take it off. I only had it on for 20mins.. Next time I will keep it on for 30min to see if I get even better results. Long story short, give this a chance!</li>
            <li> This stuff cleans my face like nothing else.</li>
            <li> made me break out and inflamed my skin</li>
            <li> Has a cooling feel on your skin. Some redness after wash off.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> After using this for the first time I felt that it dried my face. And I started to get small bumps all over my cheeks which I never had acne before. I stopped using it right away. But sadly it took me months to fix the breakouts.</li>
            <li> The real deal ! Will last you a long time!</li>
            <li> When i purchase this product i did not have any high expectations, i just wanted to try a new facial mask for my face and stumbled upon this product and decided to give it a try. Prior using this product i cleanse my face with my everyday facial wash. I mix the bentonite clay with apple cider vinegar, it is stated in the directions that water can also be used but my preference is ACV because of its benefits. I apply the clay mixture to my face and neck, i also add two slices of cucumber over my eyes and just relax for 20 minutes then rinse with warm water. I pat dry my face and add my daily moisturizer and i was good to go. I did feel my face tightened when the mask was drying as it said it would on the back of the product.&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product 4 stars and my reasons for doing so are listed below.&lt;br /&gt;1. After i rinse my face with the warm water my face felt so soft and that earned a star.&lt;br /&gt;2. My facial muscles felt very relaxed as well as if i did went to a spa and did a deep pore cleansing facial,so i gave another star for that.&lt;br /&gt;3, I have sensitive and very oily skin(face) and to my surprise i think this clay helps with that which is good for me cause i hate my  oily face and i give a star for that as well.&lt;br /&gt;4. This is very cost effective for me, it saves me time and money than going to spa for a deep pore cleansing facial, which earns another star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also says that the clay is good for acne i am not sure if it works for that because i do not use it consistently to see if it works with my acne. However, i decide i am going to add it to my facial routine and start using it once a week to see if it reduces my breakouts. If it does i will definitely give another update or edit this one and maybe add it as a staple item in my facial routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do hope my review was helpful to those who are concerned for this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years. It&#x27;s the best kept secret for truly deep cleaning your skin even if you used once a month.</li>
            <li> Okay.so i read several review on this and even wtched you tube videos and it soundd great.i bought the aple cider  vnegar and waited for the clay to arrive.i had 2 huge pimples and i was anxious to see if this mask really helprd to reduce them.well i left it on for 40minutes  and it wa extemely tight and it pulsed.when i rinsed i was hoping to see the bumps disappear but the didnt but my skn was very smooth and my pors appeared smaller.im going to use it again tomorrow and see at happens.ill write an updated one later.</li>
            <li> It deeply cleans the skin, and you will feel your face breathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cause redness for about 20 minutes. That&#x27;s OK, you know its working.</li>
            <li> What else can I say? I really loved my experience with the clay. I am used to clay masks, I think they do wonders. And this one is not an exception. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, yet parts of my skin sometimes get oily. I wanted to test the mask out to make sure it did not irritate my skin, so the first time I used it I just tried it on my nose. I also used a skin strip on my nose after using the mask and I was able to get out more blackheads than usual with this. Throughout the next few days, I noticed that my nose did not get as oily as the rest of my skin did. I mixed the clay with the apple cider vinegar, but I have a friend who tried it with just water and liked it as well.</li>
            <li> Tried this with my boyfriend last night. It dries pretty fast. We only used a thin layer. It is a bit hard to mix and the clay powder will spill upon first opening.&lt;br /&gt;As for the product... Love it! Boyfriend described the brightness of our skin afterwards as &amp;#34;from night to day.&amp;#34; He really liked the tingly/tight feeling too. My skin was red and a bit bothered before... But after this it was clear and bright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar says that it should make 10-15 applications... But I think it makes a lot more if you use less than how much it recommends (1/4-1/2&amp;#34; layer on the face... Yikes that&#x27;s thick!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. It has a very faint soil-like smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very happy I purchased this! Can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin looks and feels in a month.</li>
            <li> perhaps it&#x27;s good for skin, but it&#x27;s too hard to clean the clay on face, ans create a lot of mess at home, finally I gave it up.</li>
            <li> I liked this product a lot. My face felt good after the first use.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! Although it is pretty messy. I mean, it&#x27;s literally mud. The best (and cleanest) way I have discovered to do this is to make a bunch of mud and store it in a tupperware. Add some water and clay into the tupperware until you get the right mixture, then stir with a plastic spoon until all the lumps are gone. Then you can apply the mud to your face with the back of the spoon - this way your hands stay clean - and just rinse the spoon off when you&#x27;re done! I keep the spoon in my makeup bag. A little strange, but it&#x27;s convenient. The consistency of the mud gets a little weird just sitting there after a few days, but all you have to do is add a bit more water and stir and voila! more mud for your cleansing pleasure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE TRY WASHING MY HAIR IN HOT AND ROOM TEMPERATURE WATER BUT I FOUND OUT THAT THE WORM WATER WORKS BEST, IT ALSO MAKE A GREAT FACE MASK</li>
            <li> I just recieved this product today and I mixed with acv and I left it on for about 45 min and when I took it off my face felt soo good I would definitely recommend I&#x27;ll keep everyone updated but I&#x27;m liking it so far : hey again I just wanted to let you know that if your tempted to buy this product buy it now!! It&#x27;s amazing and it makes your face super soft before this product acne was a problem for me. I cried because I thought it would never get better. But here I am telling you guys that you need to get this product no joke my face is clear !!! (Except for acne scars of course ) but it&#x27;s amazing!! I totally recomend</li>
            <li> Easy to use, feels good on the face and leaves your skin soft and glow.</li>
            <li> This mask works great!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and for the price it&#x27;s a great find and buy</li>
            <li> This is truly amazing for clearing up acne! I use every night trying to completely clear up my face, and wow is there a difference from a few weeks of use. I&#x27;ve even gotten my skin totally smooth and blemish free, but of course those pesky hormonal blemishes come back. Even on those I use it as a spot treatment with apple cider vinegar just to dry them up and poof! They almost vanish. I&#x27;m so glad I found this clay.</li>
            <li> Use it for years... Great solution for a bright face...</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t see much results, after the first couple uses my skin was still very oily, and bumpy. But the more iv used it the better results I see! My pores are so much smaller and not just after I take the mask off but for days later! I use this twice a week with acv! I recommend this to those with acne/oil prone skin! And you must have patience with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the miricle solution, but is a very fine clay.</li>
            <li> Not sure why this product is do popular. It wasn&#x27;t a hit for me. Besides, being messy and inconvenient, it simply wasn&#x27;t effective for me.</li>
            <li> Yuck! It&#x27;s powder and it&#x27;s gross. No big secret here aside from it&#x27;s not what you expect, nor is it helpful.</li>
            <li> It really works! Just buy it!&lt;br /&gt;Be sure you mix with apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> This product lasts a long time! I still have a pretty filled container. I use it with the Braggs raw apple cider vinegar and water. The first two uses I felt my face pulsate, but I haven&#x27;t felt that since, and I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 months. Its sort of a messy clean up as well because you dont want it getting into your drains.</li>
            <li> i have dry/dehydrated skin&lt;br /&gt;my first try, left my skin red but the results were really great! .... theeen i started to break out, lots of tiny red bumps&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ll give it one more try &amp; see if it makes it worse or whether something else made me break out&lt;br /&gt;i did make my grandma try it out and she hasn&#x27;t gotten any negative reaction but she was acne-free</li>
            <li> Really great product. After repeated uses I noticed that the blemishes on my forehead and around my nose area that would never go away started to decrease in size. I still have a lot more product to go so I will still continue to use it in hope that they would disappear. Also i noticed that after using this product my face is softer. Really recommend!</li>
            <li> Earlier I gave a 1 star out of 5, because I was upset I never got it. But I&#x27;ll rate the product since I had Togo buy one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels really great. I need to see the results before I can say it works with acne for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can really feel the pulsate!</li>
            <li> At first, I thought this mask was too drying and too harsh and made me break out.I have used it for years -- on and off. I used to use a very thick layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I used Apple Cider vinegar and made a very watery paste, which I applied with a make-up/shaving brush -- Fantastic results. My skin is usually sensitive, dehydrated (lacks water not oil) and acne prone. Hoorey for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I use this weekly, my skin stays clearer. Other factors affect my sensitive breakouts and this mask does not CURE anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can add:&lt;br /&gt;Aloe juice&lt;br /&gt;Home brewed teas&lt;br /&gt;Oils (I used olive and had soft gorgeous skin afterward, but too much oil is no good for me.)&lt;br /&gt;Use as shampoo for problem scalp -- see other good reviews on this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing worth noting: skin likes to stay more acidic (pH balance of 6-sish) and this clay is very alkaline. That&#x27;s why it fizzes when you add vinegar. For breakouts, I prefer to balance this mask with an acid. I don&#x27;t get the same results when I use water alone.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this clay. I have purchased expensive high end clay mask that didn&#x27;t work. I was so surprised that mask worked as good as it did. Very generous amount for the money will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this clay for almost a month now, and have been using it every 3-4 days or so.. Wow! You can feel it working every time, and you can see (and feel!) results from the very first use! I find myself looking forward to my next at-home spa session featuring this and a hot bath. My face feels heavenly afterwards, especially my forehead and nose. When I put on my regular night moisturizer ([[ASIN:B000WNLFBI Egyptian Magic All Purpose Skin Cream Facial Treatment, 4 Ounce]], somewhat pricey, but effective and multi-tasking), and my face just feels so good I can&#x27;t stop touching it. ;) This is a great product that doesn&#x27;t break the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For acne-troubled skin (I&#x27;m 19, an intern at a hospital, so stress, school, $#!T like that give me pimples) I mix up my own personalized clay mixture with the following ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Aztec secret healing clay&lt;br /&gt;-tea tree oil (well-known acne benefits)&lt;br /&gt;-aloe vera gel (to soothe)&lt;br /&gt;-turmeric powder (an anti-inflammatory agent, not too much though as it can stain)&lt;br /&gt;-water (just enough to mix it into a nice, thick paste)</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! really cleans face and leaves it feeling amazingly smooth.  Used on all my family members and my dad fell in love. . He even complained that I didn&#x27;t put enough under his eyes lol. Will definitely re buy</li>
            <li> I am very much excited to start my first review with AZTEC SECRET INDIAN HEALING CLAY. The only reason I purchase this product is to qualify for FREE Super Saver Shipping. This product turned out to be my favorite facial mask at all times. I absolutely love giving myself this mask because it squeezes and pops pimples (if any) for me. There is no restriction what liquid you might like to use for this facial mask. I am using lemon juice, green tea, yogurt, milk, water, orange juice, coconut milk, coconut oil and castor oil. I also tried orgasm - will be disgusting for some but hey whatever works for you. Personally, nothing is disgusting and painful when it comes down to beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my routine: 1. Apply moisturizer (any kind) I am using coconut oil for my oily skin. 2. Mix mixture with any liquid for your choice - can mix as thick as you would like or as thin as you would like. 3. Apply and leave it on until it starts to get annoying (Today after leaving it on for 4 hours, I took a picture and sent it to my sister stating that would you like to purchase a iguana pet for your son?). I sure looked like an iguana. 4. Jump into warm shower (during shower, I wash my face last). 5. Pat dry and apply lots of moisturizer. I try to use this mask everyday. This is my 3rd week of using this product and honestly, I cannot say it does miracles but it sure feels good. It will keep your skin looking healthy without giving you new pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An A plus product, highly recommending to any skin types. Males - this mask is hard to take off, if you are patient then go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to thank Amazon for a wide range of awesome products with excellent online service and excellent customer service. I am becoming a life long customer and will always trust this company with all my heart.</li>
            <li> STRONG!!!!!!, stuff. Works great!!!!!</li>
            <li> Left my skin Soft it felt as if it was sucking my whole face I had no redness or any kind of reaction</li>
            <li> As it dries, your skin tightens.... Then you feel very gentle pulses!  Like my face is exercising. My skin is tight and clear!!!  I didn&#x27;t know this comes in a powder form. I mix with water so you basically get twice the amount.</li>
            <li> After trying so many products i think i have a winner!! I cant say much yet as iv used it once but i can say that first time i used it all my back heads on my nose were gone! and i had alot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does exaclty what it says, as long as you read the directions it will work!</li>
            <li> I use this clay on my face and in my hair. It works wonders on both. I particularly like it in my hair. Bentonite clay is a natural detoxifier so that&#x27;s why I use it in my hair. I figure my scalp is skin so it should do the same thing as it does to my face. It leaves both soft and supple and my hair is not hard or crunchy from the clay. Actually it washed out relatively easy and feels pretty silky. I love it and I will be buying more of it soon.</li>
            <li> Wife gave it the thumbs up!!!!</li>
            <li> This product would have been amazing if it wasnt so hard to get off. I have sensitive skin so having to rub it off with warm water is counterproductive to actually working. If it was easier to get off it would be an truly amazing product you actually feel it working.</li>
            <li> It broke my face out and my daughters also. We had such high hopes for this clay.People if u have sensitive skin don&#x27;t try!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this clay mask.  I always mix it with apple cider vinegar to a clump free, whipped texture and leave it on until it is all the way dry.  It is NOT a magical acne cure for me, however it definitely is helping that situation by cleaning out my pores.  It is easy to make a big mess if you&#x27;re not careful, and I caution against dry clay going down your sink drain- it could easily create a clog!  I&#x27;ve been filling up my mixing bowl with water to dissolve it further and then flushing it.  My only word of caution is to be GENTLE taking it off and make sure you use lots of water because it can easily pull of your top layer of skin and cause redness.</li>
            <li> I completely followed the directions (mix equal parts) and added 1/3 cup of the clay to 1/3 cup apple cider vinegar. When I put the solution on my face, it stung a bit but didn&#x27;t seem too harsh so I persevered. After washing the mask off, my blackheads seemed to loosen and my face was glowing for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I started to notice some red, itchy blotches all over my face less than 24 hours later. The lighter bumps are very painful. I do not have any known allergies so it&#x27;s strange that my skin is reacting this way to 100% calcium bentonite clay, as the label claims. On day 2 after using the clay, my face started to peel and I wish that&#x27;s a good sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel really hateful towards the product because before my purchase, I read both positive and negative reviews on Amazon and reread them before finally deciding to try the mask. I used it at my own risk and so should you. Now, I got what I paid for and I am about to pay more since I&#x27;m meeting a skin specialist tomorrow. Hopefully my face recovers very soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints about the seller (Health and Beauty Pros) since I bought this with Amazon Prime. It arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> If you have bad acne, instead of purchasing Proactive, try this bentonite clay instead, it deep cleans pores and prevents acne, it also make an effective alternative shampoo.</li>
            <li> Let me begin by correcting all of those concerned about their drains. Bentonite Clay is perfectly safe for your drains, even if you have a septic system. Having been concerned when my product first came, I researched this. I live in the French Quarter(old pipes, old septic system, old everything!) and found that it is even safe for septic systems. It would take between 30 and 50 years to possibly even start to make a layer of clay that would potentially cause it to need to be pumped. There are people that have claimed they notice their drains stay more clear(probably partly due to the acidity of the vinegar.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the mask, I love it! It really sucks on my face and pulses. I follow the directions on the package and it only takes me  a teaspoon of clay and vinegar. My face is very red afterwards, but I use Retin-A micro nightly also. I make sure to moisturize immediately after, then wait an hour to do my Retin-A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this for a clay detox bath a few nights a week...it is relaxing, and it helps with my aching joints and back. I am hoping within a few months of regular use to see many of my skin issue clear up. These include: KP, Acne, dry skin, uneven tone etc. I also hope the baths help alkalize and detox me enough, so I stop having some of my chronic health issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updates in the future!</li>
            <li> So as always I read volumes of reviews-I&#x27;m your typical skeptic and a straight-shooter when it comes to telling it like it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so I get this clay and apply it and my oh my it was the BEST facial ever and I&#x27;ve had many. I could feel this pulsating action and the skin was noticeably different after once application.&lt;br /&gt;I mixed it w/Braggs ACV rinsed after about 15 min and reapplied to freshly opened pores. It was even better.&lt;br /&gt;Tip:&lt;br /&gt;To remove, I just wet my hands and slowly using circular motions re-moisten the clay all the while rubbing gently and greatly reducing the clog factor as the slower method allows more flushing of the drain.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: If you don&#x27;t care to use ACV try a lemon---Ahhhh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a facial about 6 in the evening, moisturized with Philosophy Hope in a Jar. The next morning at 6 when I went to wet my face so I could wash it...just with the plain water my face was squeaking-as only clean skin does-as my hands passed over the surface.  I was like, WOW! Nearly 12 hours later my skin is STILL squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;m not seeing any results</li>
            <li> I have oily, acne-prone, sensitive skin that will break out if anything even comes near it. I discovered this product on Amazon after seeing that it had over a hundred rave reviews. After reading all the hype about this mask all over the web, I had to try it, so I ran out to Whole Foods early in the morning to get my hands on a tub of this stuff. After using it for the first time last night, I can tell you that this mask lives up to all the hype. It is the BEST mask ever! I can&#x27;t believe how cheap it was, too- only $7 for a 1lb tub! This clay is amazing. My skin looks soooo good- I didn&#x27;t think it did much at first but when I woke up this morning it looked like I had gotten a facial! My pores, which can usually be seen from space, were invisible. My complexion was even toned and my skin was as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt. Before using this, I had a bunch of lumps and bumps on my face (clogged pores that were all turning into pimples) and this morning they were GONE. I cannot recommend this product enough. Also, I couldn&#x27;t find Braggs organic apple cider vinegar so I had to use the regular watered-down ACV from Ralph&#x27;s but I think it would&#x27;ve worked even better if I had used the raw, full-strength stuff. The acid is what makes it pull tight, and the ACV I bought was only 5% acidity. I also put too much on (the directions say 1/4-1/2\\&quot; thick but just layer  it on a littler thicker than a normal mask, otherwise it won&#x27;t dry fast enough.) After rinsing this off my face with warm water, I washed with my L&#x27;Oreal RevitaLift Radiant Smoothing cleanser and then applied my AcneFree 3-in-1 Night Repair Foam and my Neutrogena Firming Moisturizer. My skin looks amazing and I highly recommend this facial-in-a-jar!</li>
            <li> I bought the apple cider vinegar that was recommended to using it with. It really makes your face super tight when it dries up and it actually does pulsate. The first day it made my face super red..I guess it&#x27;s because it makes your blood circulate to your face? Luckily I used it at night and by morning it was gone. The next time I used it, my face didn&#x27;t turn red at all (and it still hasn&#x27;t). I use it once a week. There&#x27;s a lot of product in here so the price is great and it lasts long. I&#x27;ve barely put a dent in it and I&#x27;ve used it over ten times already.</li>
            <li> This really does make your face tingle! I mixed up WAY too much the first time I used it so I ended up covering my full face, neck, shoulders, and chest and then hopping in the shower to rinse it off. It made my skin feel SO soft and my pores were noticeably smaller and very clear. Great weekly treatment!</li>
            <li> Great value and quality of product. I love having time to make masks.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I have really bad adult acne that cinsists of blackheads, whiteheads, and cystic acne. I have tried so many products over the years and nothing has worked. I thought I&#x27;d try this healing clay and see if would make a difference and it did!&lt;br /&gt;I made sure I used equal parts clay powder and apple cider vinegar. I put a warm washcloth over my face for a couple minutes to open up my pores and then applied the paste. I could really feel this stuff getting into my pores! When I took off the mask my face was red and felt burned but it went away within the hour. I use this three times a week on my faxe and arms. I&#x27;ll probably use it forever.</li>
            <li> This is very good for people that does not have access to sauna or does not have time to go to sauna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically this is the same concept as a sauna where you sweat out all the toxins out of your skin. This is the purpose of sweating and this is why you sweat! What this clay does is absorbs the toxins out of the skin, as a result leaves you with dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, you would need a moisturizer to nourish your skin!</li>
            <li> Being the skeptic that I am I anxiously awaited for the arrival of this product. I have used mask after mask looking for something to help me with my confused skin, oily at the cheeks and forehead but dry at the nose. Not to mention now that I&#x27;m turning forty mother nature has decided to bless me with the pimples I should have already had as a teen.  I followed the directions used Bragg&#x27;s Apple Cider Vineger and hit the bathroom, at first I got a bit of a tingle and was underwhelmed but quickly changed my mind as it began to dry.  All I can say is...I&#x27;m sold, blackheads gone, pimples dry, whiteheads, what white heads and my pores where gone as well.  I know they say use once a week but I know I&#x27;ll be using it twice a week because I love the way it feels.&lt;br /&gt;Update: August 8th&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve added this to my skincare routine, I just wanted to give an update.  A couple of years ago I made the mistake of pushing a blackhead and it left a scar about an 1/2 inch deep on my face.  It doesn&#x27;t look bad, most think it&#x27;s a beauty mark, but I know different.  Since using this mask I&#x27;ve noticed that the scar is slowly reducing in size and appearance.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that my pores are diminshing and my skin tone is also improving.  This mask is also great for removing ingrown hairs along the bikini line and on my SO&#x27;s face.  I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purging my oily skin with this mask for the past 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have nothing but positive things to say about this product.  It&#x27;s VERY inexpensive and works.  My face pulsates by the 20 minute mark of the clay drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it once a week during summer and for spring, fall, and winter about once a month. This product does not go bad so by the time I run out of the clay powder, it has been a full two of using the regular sized container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend using apple cider vinegar with this vs only water.  If you have &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; to dry skin, I would not use this product.  When I first found out about this product, I did a mask twice in one week during the summer time and my oily summer face started flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is my HG face mask.</li>
            <li> I was having problems with clogged pores and was considering going to get a facial at a local spa for more than $100.  I decided to try this product first since I didn&#x27;t have the time or money to spend at a spa.  It worked great!  I have fairly sensitive skin.  I mixed per the directions with apple cider vinegar and left it on for 20 minutes and didn&#x27;t have any problems.  It definitely helped clear my clogged pores.  I used Earth Therapeutics Cleansing Strips afterwards that I had also ordered off Amazon, but I&#x27;m not sure if they were as helpful as this clay.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new clay mask and bought this one based on all of the good reviews. They were all on point, this stuff indeed seems to be amazing. I used it last night for the first time and my skin looks younger and fresher this morning. My husband even commented on it. I did follow a tip I read on here and applied a tiny amount of organic coconut oil to my face afterwards. It felt amazing to rub into my skin after the mask. I used as little as possible and then wiped my face with a soft towel to get any excess oil off. I think the mask and oil work together really well. I literally cannot wait for my next facial!</li>
            <li> So glad I listened to the reviews on this.  It does everything it says it does.  I mixed it incorrectly the first few times...to thin...I mixed it to a thicker consistency and sat down with a cup of tea.  So relaxing, and I felt the vibrating.  When I washed off, my face was so soft.  A bit red like they say, but went away after an hour.  It has really helped with my complexion, more radiant, less breakouts and black heads on face/nose.  Amazing price.</li>
            <li> I am speechless. I took a chance and bought this clay! It has never failed. It is remarkable. It makes your skin feel baby soft. Its amazing. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have extremely oiy skin with very large pores and being 42, I have tried everything to address these issues. Some items have helped temporarily or reduced their appearance under makeup, at least until everything is washed off. Nothing has ever given me any noticeable long term benefits.  However, I recently started using this mask regularly and I am thrilled with the results. When I first received it, I mixed it as directed but with water, because I hate the smell of vinegar. The only problem was that I could not get the lumps out. No matter how much I mixed it was still lumpy. I even tried boiling the water first to see if that helped but I got the same results. I realize the lumps don&#x27;t interfere with the effectiveness, but they just irritated me (probably because I am a little OCD!) A few weeks ago I decided to try lemon juice and I hit the jackpot! I barely stirred the mixture before it became a fluffy, mousse like consistancy, completely free of lumps! I was able to apply it to my face with ease using a fan brush (of course you can use your fingers, but I am broke and trying to pretend I am at the spa, lol!). For the first time I was also able to apply a very thick layer as the lable suggests. I sat in front of a fan and watched tv. I kept it on for about an hour or so (as long as I could stand it) because it became so hard and tight! I literally stuck my face under the faucet with warm water and rinsed thoroughly with my hands for about 4 minutes until every bit was gone and finished with a cold water splash. I am extremely pale and my face was very pink for about 45 minutes afterwards. When my face had dried completely, I applied a few drops of Kiehls Midnight Recovery Concentrate and when I woke up the next day, my complexion was absolutely flawless and glowing! Of course my pores are still there but they are MUCH smaller. Since then I have repeated this procedure every 3 or 4 days and the results just keep getting better and better and my skin seems to be producing less oil. I also tried it without applying any serum or cream afterwards and the results were just as good. I am hooked for life and plan to stock up. I realize that if I quit using the mask my pores would probably return to their original size but at least I have found something that gives me noticable results that last for more than one day at a time.  I can see a real difference without anything on my face :)producing less oil. I also tried it without applying any serum or cream afterwards and the results were just as good. I am hooked for life and plan to stock up.

            <li> I got this product about 3 weeks ago and i still do not see a difference . My blackheads are still there. I used it with water the first 2-3 times but found with water was a bit hard to apply so i switch to raw apple cider vinegar and it went on smoothly . Im going to continue using this product and hopefully i see a change.  Btw i have a few pimples and a tons of red marks .</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t do anything for me- my skin just hurt after I used it. My pores were the same and I couldn&#x27;t see any difference in blackheads. Disappointed :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen so many good ratings about this item, so I made the order.  After the first use mixing the clay with water, it felt really good with the pulsating on your skin. But,when I washed it off I began to noticed bumps all over my face.  I read that it was normal for your face to be red. And it will go away after 30mins or so.  Unfortunately, the item left me with bumps all over my face.  ( I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin) My cheeks are inflamed and honestly I do not like the bumps feeling &amp; redness on my skin.  This is the 3rd day and I still have the bumps, the redness settled down but I don&#x27;t know what else to do. Anyone experience this before? I wanted this to work, I have mildly combo skin and used &#x27;&#x27;clay like&#x27;&#x27; mask before. Yet never experienced such results like this. I can&#x27;t even put foundation because the bumps are so visible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m another happy customer with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I used the clay with apple cider vinegar and it was a breeze to mix up and apply.&lt;br /&gt;When it dries it is extremely tight, I didn&#x27;t want to talk or move my mouth at all.&lt;br /&gt;After washing it off I had a slight pinkish color which lasted maybe 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;It definitely does clean, half of my pores (nose/cheek area)all but disappeared, the other half were&lt;br /&gt;still visible but completely cleaned out which made they seem smaller.&lt;br /&gt;(looking for a good product to tighten the pores afterward now.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use a pore strip afterwards on my nose, it was about 95% clean. Thinking I can now&lt;br /&gt;just have a pack on hand for quickies but can pretty much eliminate the need for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the small amount of leftover in the bowl I applied it to my bug bites (green fly) which&lt;br /&gt;were driving me insane. I didn&#x27;t feel the need to scratch or rub them since. I didn&#x27;t do a cluster&lt;br /&gt;of them by my ankle and those are still killing me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the better face products I purchased!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried it with the water as a facial mask, but it did make my pores seem invisible, and my face was super smooth! I have the vinegar coming, so I will be trying it with that soon. Can&#x27;t wait to see what a difference it will make. You do need to have a good face lotion to use with this, since it kinda sucks everything out of your face...</li>
            <li> Everyone should own this stuff. I was kind of skeptical when I first bought it, but so glad now that I did.  It really makes my face feel soft &amp; clean.  It is very hard to get off, but I don&#x27;t mind, because it works so well.  I think it is kind of hard to get all the lumps of the powder out when mixing the stuff though, but I mix it with water, so I&#x27;m not sure if that makes a difference.  And it really doesn&#x27;t have a smell to it, so that makes it even better I think.  Whenever I use the clay my face doesn&#x27;t feel like its pulsating though, but after I take the stuff off then my face turns red, and heats up, &amp; kind of gives me a headache for a little while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling a lot with my skin lately. My usual routine hasn&#x27;t been working as well as I&#x27;d like, so I&#x27;ve been scouting the internet for newer products to try using. I came across this and was immediately interested. I&#x27;m happy to say that my interest paid off. I tried the mask for the first time today and saw instant results. My skin felt and looked clearer, smoother, and healthier. Larger pores that I tend to have around my nose were also a great deal smaller. I will definitely make the most out of this purchase. One thing I will say, however, is that it can be a bit messy mixing the clay powder if you don&#x27;t have the proper tools. I tried mixing my clay powder with just some warm water in a bowl with a spoon. It got the job done, but I&#x27;ll probably look into using a rubber spatula or brush to mix and apply the mask in the future to make things easier. All in all, I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to add something new and effective to their skincare routine! For comparison&#x27;s sake: I have normal to slightly oily skin. I don&#x27;t suffer from a lot of acne - just the occasional breakouts here and there. My skin has a normal amount of sensitivity.</li>
            <li> for teeth brushing, detox baths, spider and mosquito bites, my husband had a weird rash that wouldn&#x27;t go away from working in a sanitation plant, a mask of this got rid of it. We both had a nasty foot parasite it banished as well, when nothing else worked.</li>
            <li> Just takes a little, I left on for 20 minutes and my face was very red somewhat like a sunburn, it went away after about 20 minutes, but kinda freaked me out.  I just use 1 time a week for 10 minutes and it works nicely...my face broke out just a tiny bit, 1 or 2 pimples which I assume it from such deep cleansing...I love how it tingles so you know it&#x27;s working!!!!</li>
            <li> Since this is the first time I was using a pack on my face I was a bit hesitant. However, I could see improved results right from the first time I used it. My face cleared up in about a couple days and my scars have lightened considerably too!</li>
            <li> This is a deep cleaning face mask. You can feel it working on your skin. I always use it with apple cider vinegar. It sizzles and turns into a paste. I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin will purge every time I use it which is only about once every couple months. I recommend moisturizing after every use because this will make your skin feel super dry. The price is right and it doesn&#x27;t take much at all for a single use.</li>
            <li> I am OBSESSED!!!! I bought this product a week ago and have used it twice so far and OH MY GOD. My skin seriously looks the best it has in years! My pores are small, my face is smooth and soft, and my acne marks are fading! I mixed this product with apple cider vinegar, I highly recommend using that with it. Honestly this is probably top 3 best beauty products I have ever used. I have told all my friends to buy it, and now I am telling you! BUY THIS! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! #OBSESSED</li>
            <li> I like this.  Not too messy, I mix it with distilled water, Braggs acv and aloe vera or sometimes some vit e oil and its a very good mask for my skin.  My face is a bit red after I remove it but that  fades.  Doesn&#x27;t make me break out, leaves my skin looking fresh and soft.</li>
            <li> Great!!!! The best mask in the world working awesome</li>
            <li> Good bye high end expensive facial products. Hello economical product which TOTALLY works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it last week, followed the instructions using water. Waited for 10-12 minutes for it to dry. Washed my face, and voila :) tightened pores and an amazingly fresh face. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> First I want to say that, I am not a \\&quot;paid\\&quot; reviewer, as I once also doubted it about the the other reviewers. I am on week 3 of this product, using it at least twice a week (first week 3 times). So far so good. I usually have cystic hormonal acne on my cheeks and neck. And this has kept it under control so far, and after about the third time using it, has brought out smoother skin that i have not felt in years. Yes, its creates a bit of itching, and pulsating since it really pulls the skin tight, when drying. Yes it hard to take off, but its worth it. I leave it about 20 mins, as I can&#x27;t take more than that. Everyone should do it as they feel comfortable. I used it with ACV since it the best mixture. Yes it leaves the skin a bit red and with larger pores, THAT eventually shrink back down and the redness leaves. Afterwards I apply some Vitamin E oil to moisturize a bit. So far i am completely addicted to using it and I hope it keeps working as it has. Feel free to ask me any questions, everyone is different and this so far has been the most affordable effective product i have ever tried.</li>
            <li> All you need is a sandwich bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Tie and pin back any hair.  This stuff gets everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Put a scoop of clay into the sandwich bag.  Add water or vinegar.  Seal out all the air inside the bag and knead it into a smooth paste.  Adjust with more clay or water as needed until you get your desired consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Partially flip the sandwich bag inside out on your hand, like a glove.  Apply the clay to your face with your bag-glove.  Your hands don&#x27;t get dirty and you won&#x27;t need any additional utensils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Let dry 10-15 min and remove with facial wipes (the pre-moistened kind).  Alternatively, you can rinse it out into a basin or bowl, but don&#x27;t do it into the sink or shower because it&#x27;ll eventually clog your drains.  It&#x27;s mud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Moisturize.  The good thing about this sandwich bag method is that if you have any extra (and I always make too much), you can just keep it in the bag for the next use.  You literally bought a jar of dirt off Amazon; don&#x27;t waste it.  Seal out all the air to keep it from drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Protip #1: If you don&#x27;t wash your hair every day, apply this stuff before you shower on a non-wash day.  When you finish, just rinse it off.  Time saver!]&lt;br /&gt;[Protip #2: Dried, this stuff looks like boogers.  So clean it out extra carefully around your nose to avoid awkward public situations.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOORAH.  It&#x27;s clean, it&#x27;s cheap, and it&#x27;s easy.  And you won&#x27;t have to throw out a single bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the review of the product itself, I can&#x27;t attest to that as well as the other reviewers.  I&#x27;m several years past my teenage bad-skin era.  I use this mask to deep clean my pores around once a week, which it definitely does. This is in additional to cleanser/moisturizer 2x daily + exfoliating every few days so I have consistently good skin. However, the other reviews of this product&#x27;s effectiveness are stellar, and that&#x27;s what convinced me to buy.  :)</li>
            <li> My daughter says it is helping her acne and makes her skin feel softer.</li>
            <li> I loved this on my face and even had my sister use it... she is 17 I&#x27;m 27... we both really liked it. We r both prone to acne and she is in the public eye a lot in news and newspapers etc... we both really liked how it made our skin look... haven&#x27;t used it enough to know if it helps reduce acne bc I left it at my moms and I don&#x27;t think my sister knows it&#x27;s even there. But it Def made our skin soft. And I like it. Glad there is actually a good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> It is so amazing. I use it on my neck and face and I can really see a major change. My face feels so soft and refreshed. I will definitely buy again soon☺</li>
            <li> it works as good as the ones I pay for in facial salons.  Don&#x27;t use too much or it just cracks</li>
            <li> The directions say to apply the mask 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick.  If you apply it that thick it takes forever to dry and it is just down right hard to apply that thick.  You can feel it sucking all of the impurities out of your skin as it dries.  It leaves your skin baby soft and extremely smooth.  I thought it would be hard to rinse off, but it wasn&#x27;t ( rinsed off very easily with warm water).  I didn&#x27;t have any problems with redness afterwards , but my daughter did.  The redness disappeared within 15 minutes. The mask helped diminish the the acne that my daughter had on her face (the pimples were visibly smaller and dried out once she removed the mask).  I have an oily t-zone and I didn&#x27;t notice as much oil the day after using the mask.  I did feel the need to use a moisturizer after using the mask, my daughter did not.</li>
            <li> This stuff really is great but make sure you don&#x27;t over coat your face because once it dries it will take a lot of scrubbing with a wet rag in order to clean it off, other than that it really tightens up on your skin and makes it extremely soft for at least 12 hours after using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 26 and having never really used any facial products besides some basic stuff like neutrogena wash, I&#x27;ve suddenly plunged into a rigorous beauty regime stockpiling all the best (at least by customer reviews) products. I just used this clay and I gotta say it&#x27;s pretty crazy how much of a difference you can see immediately after removing it. My pores are so clean I can&#x27;t even see them anymore! I&#x27;m so happy :) . I had it on for 20 minutes and I didn&#x27;t think my face was all that red afterwards. It definitely felt tight, but it didn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely need to figure out a good way of mixing it tho. The method someone suggested of mixing it in a ziplock baggy worked ok. Maybe I didn&#x27;t mix it well enough because i got clumps that were hard to spread. But I&#x27;ll try it again next time, it definitely minimizes waste and you can save what you didn&#x27;t use for later and it won&#x27;t dry out.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m super excited about this product and definitely recommend it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit (Aug 29): ok, i did it with Apple Cider Vinegar this time and mixed it in a little ceramic cup instead of a ziplock baggy... it came out WAY better! Like smooth whipped cream, not lumpy like the first time :D Awesome :D *happy happy joy joy*</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this about a month ago and I love it!  I really have only used it probably 3-4 times and the first time I left it on for about 20 mins until I felt my skin start to pulsate and it kinda freaked me out.  I took it off and my face was bright red!  Then I read the back of the jar in more detail and found that this is normal.  My skin is noticably smoother, its helping to dry acne much faster than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.  I love it so much I mix a batch for me and my husband and put it on both of our faces. My husband is very impressed because he had a very deep acne spot that has been hanging around for about 2 weeks going on 3 weeks. I put it on his face last night and he said it was crazy because it started draining after he took it off and he didn&#x27;t even pop it because he didn&#x27;t want a scar.  I didn&#x27;t even put it on his whole face just put it on the two spots he had and today they are much smaller.  I did my whole face last night and he commented on how smooth my face looked today.  It&#x27;s worth the money and the 1lbs jar should last a long time.  I usually only mix 2 tablespoons of clay with 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar and usually have some left over.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping for the miracle everyone was talking about... It really made my face glow after my first application, but the following days i broke out - which was okay because i heard this can happen. I continued to use it 3x a week for about 6 weeks hoping to clear out my pores and bring my acne down. Sadly, it maybe made it worse. I continued to have bad cystic acne the entire time. I finally gave up and went to the dermatologist for prescription meds which are working thankfully! It does clear blackheads and promotes extracting, so i&#x27;ll continue to use once a week.</li>
            <li> I mixed up a little solution of the clay and vinegar and applied.  It felt nice and dried completely after about 25 minutes.  It worked out a blackhead that I thought I might have to name.  This seems like a fine simple American product.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel fabulous. Reduces size and appearance of pores. Even smells pretty good. One thing, watch your measuring when mixing it up... I over shot badly the first time, so ended up wasting quite a bit. My measuring skills have never been good. Other than that, its wonderful. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have thought to try a product quite like this, but the reviews convinced me.  Do give it a try - it doesn&#x27;t cost much for the number of uses you can make from this product.  It is not hard to mix, and isn&#x27;t as messy as it could be (sticks to stuff, but doesn&#x27;t really drip).  The blackheads came back quickly, so will need to use this more often, but was amazed that it pulled them all out the first try (after a hot shower).  Didn&#x27;t feel much, so was surprised to see such good results.  Also helped with dry skin on foot, though did not last.  Hope to see more with repeated use.</li>
            <li> OMG ....i lake , good product, so very happy , thanks , and good deliver , OMG ....i lake , good product, so very happy , thanks , and good deliver</li>
            <li> Age: 18&lt;br /&gt;Skin: Normal, prone to blackheads, clogged pores, &amp; random breakouts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely tightens your skin and softens it, but it hasn&#x27;t achieved any miracles. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month or more.No improvement in my skin. Maybe it&#x27;s because I haven&#x27;t been using with apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! Better than glam glow</li>
            <li> Hi. I did lot of research about bentonite clay and figured it out that calcium based bentonite is for internal use and sodium base bentonite is for external use, this is calcium based and I think this is best for internal use.</li>
            <li> Face right! Face tight!  😄😄😄</li>
            <li> Really really great so far. Have been using this every night for a week instead of soap. I mix with filtered water and a little rose water. My skin looks clearer and more even than it has in years!!!! It is, however, cheaper on iHerb http://iherb.com/?rcode&#x3D;MZW868</li>
            <li> Used to purchase a product called &amp;#34;Mud&amp;#34; years ago and finally decided to go back to clay masks. This product, together with the raw apple vinegar is amazing on the skin. Just received it today and tried it...wonderful stuff, my face feels and looks revived!</li>
            <li> the top was broken so about 1/3 cup was in the b ox next time i&#x27;ll just buy it from my local health store I emailed the company and they are retuning my money the clay that was left in the jar I used it and my skin feels clean and very soft I recommend this clay to anyone that gets breakout during their cycle.</li>
            <li> Didnt really work any better then the cheep clay mask i can buy at the local cvs or wallmart...</li>
            <li> Works Great! Saw a difference after the first application works best with Apple Cider Vinegar.  It does make your face feel tight and itchy but if you can with stand it then its all worth it.  Also I find it easier to take off in the shower rather than over the sink.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended to others and will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t know about this being a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product, it&#x27;s too cheap to not try. I moved a month ago, and the increase in humidity has made my otherwise pretty clear skin a wreck. I&#x27;ve used this a couple times now, and just love the feeling when you remove the mask, you feel so clean and refreshed. I have noticed a decrease in pore size, and my semi permanent blackheads on my nose are virtually gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I was waiting for the mask to dry completely, which isn&#x27;t necessary- it recommends a time frame on the jar itself. Use warm water to remove- it will almost just peel off after you rewet the mask.</li>
            <li> Made my face red and irritated. Obviously peoples&#x27; skin work in different ways so you never know till you try. But i am reviewing this from my point of view and it really burned my skin.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel. Helps with acne and reduces redness.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this product especially after reading the bad results. I had a thyroidectomy a few years ago and ic been struggling with hair loss, constant change in my hair texture. I only kept it in my hair for about 30 minutes before rinsing it out. My hair had never had the type of curl definition and soft texture it had after my first use. THIS IS WORTH THE BUY! !!!!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t washed it off yet but it sure does feel good! Feels like it&#x27;s doing something! Kind of excited!</li>
            <li> I brought this on everyone&#x27;s praise about this product. I mixed it with apple cider vinegar and it was just....horrible. My skin was all red and irritated. It didn&#x27;t feel like it deep cleaned ANYTHING. I had high hopes for this product and now it&#x27;s just sitting in the cabinet collecting dust. I tried it on 3 separate occasions and it was the same outcome. Great that it worked for most people. I, sadly am not one of them.</li>
            <li> I like it!  It&#x27;s a little tricky to get the right ratio mixed (doesn&#x27;t seem that 1:1 is enough liquid), but it works great once you get it on</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this for a mask. I bought it to make a baby rash cream. However, I thought Id give it a go and use it as a facial mask. People, do your homework on this. It is NOT easy! I had blobs here, had to remix, clay everywhere, it was like a science project done terribly wrong and I was the creature produced from the catastrophe. That being said, even though I did screw it up I really loved how rosy my face was and how good it felt. It was also reassuring and fulfilling to think that this product isn&#x27;t filled with chemicals (which I believe damaged my skin as a youth). The fact it has such a rich history makes you feel a deep appreciation for the past and the knowledge they obtained. It is so easy to overlook more natural and &amp;#34;basic&amp;#34; products when you go down the shiny makeup and skin care isle. There are tons of uses for this product, and I plan on trying them all. :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is great hands down!!! Period point blank. Its a great detoxing, tightening great facial mask. Dont spend money at the spa, save ur money and get this majic clay today u will fall in love!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I got this product, but within not even a week my pores shrunk just a tad bit. It&#x27;s very messy when making the mixture because you have to mix powder with liquid and it&#x27;s hard to blend to a good result. After applying the first time my skin felt really smooth. The product basically tightens up your skin so your pores are going to shrink. After applying it for a few more days after my skin would get a little red in areas that are kind of sensitive but it really did disappear even though I thought it wouldn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s easy to apply though after you mix it all together. I will update if my blackheads all disappear within a month or a couple months&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have been using this product for a couple months now- not religiously though. When I first started using it after a while my face started to react. Started getting red sort of so I stopped using it everyday sometimes 2 or 3 days a week sometimes not even a week or whatnot. Anyways, I&#x27;ve probably used it 50 times since I got it a long time ago. Every time I stop using it my pores get bigger and when I use it they shrink, but seriously THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING. Honestly, it is messy. But what I did is I made it into a cream, which saves you more clay powder and makes the product last REALLY long. Just take a jar or a cup make sure it&#x27;s one that you never really want to use again but that it&#x27;s clean, and add the powder in and some water. Depends on you how much but too much clay makes it too hard and too much water makes it too watery. Think of it like making brownie or cake mix. Let it sit for a day or two and the clay will turn into mush, like mud. If you&#x27;re going to not use the clay for a couple days then just put a fair amount of water so it doesn&#x27;t dry up due to evaporation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this product is amazing. I can feel my face itch and it&#x27;s as if it&#x27;s squeezing my face and letting all my dirt and oils and icky stuff into the clay so it can harden and I can wash it or peel it off. This takes a lot of time though, and after your face stops itching or you can&#x27;t feel it anymore that means it&#x27;s done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But seriously, very significant changes to my face after using it, if I would of used it more often I know my pores would be gone because they shrunk from a size 10 to a size 2.ff.

            <li> I. Love. This. Stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s Much easier to use with ACV than water.  Made that mistake the first time,  all clumps.  This time,  I used ACV and it&#x27;s like night and day.Yes, my face smells like vinegar but I&#x27;m clump free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first use I immediately noticed a difference in my pores and my skin felt great! I&#x27;ve got it on now and I&#x27;m hoping to see even smaller, cleaner pores.  I. Love. This.  Stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it.  Do it.</li>
            <li> Great mask. Love it. Leaves my face feeling great.</li>
            <li> May I use this on a daily use, or will it harm my face?</li>
            <li> This is an amazing mask for oily skin. It&#x27;s shrinks pores, reduces oiliness, helps diminish acne. Etc etc.</li>
            <li> Like the fact that it is very fast on delivery.  But it scared me the first time i used it.  My face turned really red, it looked like my skin got burn but it did goes away the next morning.  So i guess it is ok.  Could not tell if it help the skin or not.  May be a few try.  Have to wait and see.</li>
            <li> In MY opinion, when I used this clay.. Just like most deep pore cleansers I use.. It always brings out your impurities before you see the actual results. It makes a huge mess using this stuff no matter how careful you try to be and it&#x27;s a pain in the butt trying to clean it up. I did feel the tightening of the skin when using this product and felt like my face was cleaner.. I have been using this for a month or almost 2 now and there really isn&#x27;t any different results from my basic facial cleansers. I had really High hopes for this product when I bought it since I read the reviews and I don&#x27;t have like bad acne problems just a few minor break outs every once in a while. Instead of spending money on this and shipping I will just keep going to Walmart or Walgreen for my facial cleansers since they do the same job.</li>
            <li> I looked into reviews about all natural acne products, and this was was mentioned due to its good pore cleaning ability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved that i wasnt putting werid chemicals on my face, and it absorbed alot of stuff. Blackheads on my looked like they were half pulled out (i only left the mask on for 10...another 10 would have yanked all those pesky things out) and my cheeks are so smooth now! If theres no \\&quot;junk\\&quot; in my pores, i hope that will mean reduced breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con? it is really strong. Afterwards a good face cream is essential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Months later update (6/11/11)&lt;br /&gt;I kept using this because I liked how it pulled out all the oil (mind you my skin is post-accutane, but still not perfect) and remaining blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;  Then the warm weather hit and my back acne came back. I didnt want to go back on accutane, birth control pills, so i tried this. In 3 days my back was clear!! Im using it 3 days a week now...just to keep myself clear for them strapless sundresses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Id be careful mixing with apple cider vinegar if your skin is super sensitive, but its definately a MUST in my skin care regimen now.</li>
            <li> L&lt;br /&gt;o&lt;br /&gt;v&lt;br /&gt;e</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good mask for oily skin, but be careful it can clog your pipe drains like cement. Use a soft paper tower or bunch of facial tissues to remove the mask and wash face after what&#x27;s left.</li>
            <li> Works!  I use it with the raw apple cider vinegar,  As it drys it makes your skin pulse, but doesn&#x27;t hurt, you just know it&#x27;s working &amp; your face maybe red afterwards, but only for a few minutes.  I also used the tip, by making it in Baggie (less mess).  I&#x27;ve been using this about once a week for 4 weeks.  Would buy again</li>
            <li> Love it. You truly feel it working a tingling and tightening. My face felt so smooth. There was a little redness. Do not let this product go down your drain it will clog it. I put a plastic shopping bag my sink and them rinse my face.</li>
            <li> Felt great when I put it on and my skin looked great. Now, I have skipped my $50 facial appointment this week because this product works so much better.  Use a glass bowl to mix and wash out the remaining product before it gets too hard.</li>
            <li> I like to mix this with apple vinegar and a few drops of tea tree oil (which also helps buffer the vinegar smell). It really does help maintain healthy clear looking skin. The quantity you receive for the price is worth it, I recommend this stuff to my friends. The only thing you need to be careful about is not letting it clog up your sink when you rinse it off, I just use a warm washcloth and rub it off chunk by chunk. It stings a little when you know it&#x27;s working, but it stings soo good.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I love how it makes my skin look &amp; feel!</li>
            <li> Thanks god, I did not pay more than $10 for this crap. Like others, I bought the clay based on the great over 2K reviews. I have tried it twice, and I did not see any improvement. Instead, I got patchy redness all over my skin. I followed instructions and mixed the clay with water. I let it dried for 15 mins before washing it off. My face was still red after one hour. The instructions say the redness should disappear in 30 mins. I look so ugly now and I do not want to risk my skin on the clay again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always suffered from Acne and understand it takes more than once or twice to use a product to know if it will work. Most people freak when they break out worse when using a new product. It&#x27;s perfectly normal as the bacteria is flushing from your skin. Skin has several layers, the epidermis is basically 25-30 layers of dry dead skin, so you can imagine how long it takes for new skin to turn over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been able to control my acne with a good basic cleanser (no harsh stuff) and a mild face scrub 3 times a week (skinceticals has a good one but its pricey) . I&#x27;m trying to save money and go more organic or &amp;#34;from the earth&amp;#34; based products. I switched to coconut oil for eye make up removal, diluted apple cider vinegar wash and needed a  mask/scrub so I&#x27;m trying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I&#x27;ve only used the product once so far (just got it tonight) I tried the baggie method someone else mentioned (thank you!) and it worked well with mixing and applying. I mixed with organic apple vinegar cider (with the mother in it) and it did fizz a bit. I applied it really thick as instructed. I left it on for 12 minutes. NO one has mentioned the smell that I&#x27;ve read so far. Apple Cider Vinegar STINKS! But it is very good for your skin, so I breathed through my mouth the whole time.  I wasn&#x27;t sure how to remove it without getting in in the drain so I figured it would be a trial and error process.  I got a rag I didn&#x27;t care about throwing away and a bowl. I used super hot water on the rag and wrung it out and laid it on my face to soften the mask (like they do at the spa), then rubbed the mask off keeping the chunks inside the rag and using the bowl to dump the clumps into. That worked well and I didn&#x27;t have to re- rinse the rag during the process.  I noticed the areas where I applied thinner mask, were the most red. Where the mask was thicker, were barely pink right after removal. I wonder if there something to the thickness level that is causing bright redness for some people? I rinsed in the sink once everything was off to make sure no residue was left (another step people miss, causing breakouts). I used the rag to remove the chunks from the bowl and tossed the rag and washed the bowl. I need to find a better way as throwing away rags is not resourceful at all and I don&#x27;t buy paper towels. I&#x27;ll look through more posts and see what others are doing. I really don&#x27;t want to clog my drains or my washer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels super soft and the pores appear tight. I put on a good moisturizer (another key component) and will report further findings in about 6 weeks of use. Which should be the minimum time given for any product to really do their job as it takes a long time for skin cell turnover.ess for some people?

            <li> I&#x27;m struck by the many positive reviews here.  Even my favorite can&#x27;t-live-without-it products have a bell curve of opinions going on (as do the Amazon top 100 beauty sellers).  I don&#x27;t like to give a product a bad review, but this mask is painful to me.  I&#x27;ve given it several honest tries, and every time I do it&#x27;s just itchy right away and it sucks up too much oil, too quickly.  You don&#x27;t get to relax and sit back with a mask on and unwind.  I have to mention that my skin is pretty resilient and not sensitive - it withstands the highest % Retin A rx cream, as well as glycolic peels without incident. Testing all kinds of products on my face is a major part of my work, and I&#x27;ve done some hair brained stuff to it.  This mask however stands alone as the one product I won&#x27;t sample again.  I will also say that other magnesium - containing products have been compatible with me.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing for my son&#x27;s acne.</li>
            <li> I am so addicted to this stuff! I have clear skin but I get blackheads on my nose and forehead, and when I do get zits they last awhile and are in pretty prominent areas. No matter what I use if seems like my forehead is always bumpy and gross, but after using this it&#x27;s soft, smooth and clean. My face feels ridiculous, and all the pores are clean. It sucks all the dirt out of your skin and makes it look awesome! I put Witch Hazel on a cotton ball and rub it on my face afterward and I look like a million bucks. Buy this!</li>
            <li> This stuff makes your face so smooth and it did help eliminate blackheads. I  love it!</li>
            <li> Love it! Great to mix with Apple cider vinegar! Great for acne</li>
            <li> I really like this mask, it does what it claims. My face really feels fresh and clean of all impurities. It&#x27;s a wonderful at home clay mask, at such an affordable price. I don&#x27;t see myself buying anything else. I would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> i honestly think this product needs to be a staple in every girls \\&quot;bag of stuff\\&quot;. it deep cleans, gets out make-up, any air toxins,and dirt. the best i&#x27;ve ever used. great weekly facials. since i&#x27;ve used it, i&#x27;ve seen major improvements in my skin and i have sensitive skin and no matter what i use i have little bumps i cant get rid of, trust i&#x27;ve tryed it all, even a derm. this stuff is all you will need for the skin you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> This product really works and results are seen within a couple of weeks. Would recommend to others :)</li>
            <li> this wasnt really a miracle. although, i dont really have bad skin so i don&#x27;t know if thats a factor. it is however like ive heard very tightening and itd be smart to use a moisturizer after because my skin did turn red. it hurt but after, my skin was considerably softer.</li>
            <li> I just started to use this product on 6/23/2011. For the first time I was skeptical after reading the instructions, so I left it on for only 8 min. I mixed it with organic apple cider vinger (pure). I mixed it until it was a paste. Long story short I did not have the puling sensation. I took it off while in the shower, easy to remove. I used it again 6/25/2011 this time I left it on for 15 minutes. Still no puling sensation. I did every thing the same as I did before. I woke up the next morning and my face had more bumps then what I started with. Is this product one of those that makes it worse then graudally improves? BTW my skin is not sensitive. please feel free to advise if I am doing something wrong. All help is much appricated ;-)</li>
            <li> this is my first time using this product and it feels like it is doing something great i can feel the tingle and the tighting on the skin i mixed it with the rae apple cider vinger and i think it is doing something great! but it has a nasty smell you smell like vinger lol but in the long run it is worth it you also can use water so whatever you choose i would go with the vinger it gives it more working power i think so give it a try it does leave a red patches but it dose go away .</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it does wonders for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> This mask is seriously awesome.  I am the 43 year old mother of an 11 year old and a 9 year old.  I still get some acne, and my 11 year old daughter is getting major acne as puberty begins.  We tried Proactiv, but it didn&#x27;t have much of an effect for either of us.  On a random blog, another mom was recommending this mask, since it had worked so well for her teens.  I checked it out.  I figured, for less than $10, why not?  I had no idea of how much to mix up, I mixed half a cup.  Don&#x27;t do that, unless you just want to have a very large quantity of mud to keep in a sealed container for the next few months.  Try a tablespoon at a time, until you know how much you require.  Just saying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed at the results.  My acne wasn&#x27;t horrible; it&#x27;s all but nonexistent now.  My 11 year old, whose hormones are crazy in this stage of her life, uses this mask twice a week.  She only gets the occasional pimple now.  She used to get huge zits all over her forehead, so we are extremely happy with this product, just on that count.  My 9 year old only uses it on her chin, where she is prone to blackheads.  It&#x27;s helped lessen them, although her results aren&#x27;t so dramatic as my 11 year old&#x27;s.  It is kind of fun to get together with my daughters twice a week for facials.  I appreciate the bonding time.</li>
            <li> Just as it says in the description, it is a very strong facial mask. For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong. This is the same stuff that they use in the spas. At least it feels like it. Mix a bit of water with it, and as it dries it really pulls on your skin. I have even mixed it with milk as I feel it is has more benefit than water does for my skin and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. A little goes a long way too. Don&#x27;t think you have to cake it on your fact like mud. Just take a bit of the powder, mix it with water and put the muddied water on your face. It works like a champ!</li>
            <li> Awesome so far first day</li>
            <li> Came quick and was glad to find this so cheap. I&#x27;ve only bought 2 before this but will keep doing it because its amazing and very natural, especially when I use raw apple cider vinegar for half the liquid.</li>
            <li> Have not noticed any groundbreaking results but it seems like you average clay mask.</li>
            <li> I got this product and I began to use it that same day within two days my face had an incredible improvement. I never had skin problems growing up and now I am battling the problems teens go through 0_o. I&#x27;ve tried just about everything and nothing seems to help me long enough for me to have clear skin again. well within days of using this product my blemishes have began to clear up and the marks left behind by previous breakouts are getting lighter. However I have had to back off a little from using it as often since it will dry my skin out if used to frequently. I will continue to use this product even with clear skin as it also leaves your skin soft after washing it off. you really do feel the pulsating on your face that it claims and my skin is red for about 20 minutes but other than that nothing but good things from this product. packaging of the product was perfect as well. two thumbs up from me.</li>
            <li> This product works very well on my face, however it does dry it a bit too much.  Once I rinse my face, I do have to apply a heavy moisturizer.  I do recommend this.</li>
            <li> rate 5, wonderful product, use once a week, good for pore, this product will leave face feeling smooth,tell my sister and friend,</li>
            <li> Who knew?  I wish I had a long time ago!  I have spent a ton of money on high end masks over the years.  None of them surprised me like this one.  I mixed mine with Braggs vinegar.  You really feel this working and it definately brings circulation to your face, so don&#x27;t be surprised if your face is bright pink when you remove it.  You have to let this dry completely, and it&#x27;s a little difficult to remove, but totally worth it.  Follow with your favorite moisturizer and be happy in the morning!</li>
            <li> I got this for both daughter &amp; daughter-in-law - they used it and compared it to much higher priced face masks.  As a matter of fact, my daughter has a friend who is a make-up artist and, through her, has tried several &amp;#34;Hollywood&amp;#34; super-expensive products and says this mask makes her skin look and feel just as good.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize I wold have to mix this myself. if doesn&#x27;t give exact measurements for mixing. It is lumpy and nasty. I only left it on less than 10 minutes. I used it last night and still this morning, my fast is red and burns when I wash it. A total waste of money for me. I wish I hadn&#x27;t thrown the packing away. It is too much trouble to take it to the post office to send it back anyway. I wish I had my money back. Such a waste of time and money!! I don&#x27;t understand why others liked it.</li>
            <li> Could see a huge difference in my husband and my skin after just one use. We will be using it regularly to clear out and minimize pores. I am so impressed to actually find a beauty product that you can see a noticeable improvement so quickly! Beats paying a fortune on a facial at the spa. Yeah, it is a bit messy and a little uncomfortable as it is drying but that just means it is working!</li>
            <li> I love mud masks, I make natural masks myself and was unsure about this one, but MAN did it exceed my expectations. You can either use raw apple cider vinegar or water OR both and it starts to feel tingly on your skin, leaving it fresh and VERY soft. 1 POUND TOO... will last a long while.</li>
            <li> Love this mask.  I use 100 % apple cider vinegar when I use it.  Key when you wash it off to just keep splashing  water on it and it will just fall off into the sink. Do not rub it or it will take forever to come off</li>
            <li> Amazing product. We have had the whole family try ouet. It&#x27;s a hit</li>
            <li> Refreshes the skin so well!</li>
            <li> Seems just as advertised, this is the classic green facial mud. Hasn&#x27;t magically cured my mild adult acne as some said but does help my skin.</li>
            <li> Stuff really pulls and is kinda messy and hard to get off your face but really works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice so far, but I&#x27;m already seeing some positive changes. I&#x27;m 37 and very fair, combo skin with occasional mild breakouts. Definitely has tightening qualities-time will tell if it lasts beyond a few days following application, but so far so good. My pores do look smaller and overall my face feels smoother. Not at all drying like some clay masks can be. I&#x27;m following it with a rosewater toner and vitamin c serum, this seems to be a good combo for skin starting to age noticeably, at a far more affordable price point than m</li>
            <li> Love how this makes my face feel. Soft, soft, soft!</li>
            <li> my skin looks beautiful</li>
            <li> I have used this product twice and already notice my acne disappearing. WOW!!! I have used a lot of items especially memberships like &amp;#34;PROACTIVE&amp;#34;. NO more!!!! I will keep buying this awesome and inexpensive product!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works, been using it once a week with great results. It makes your skin glow. Use wet towel to remove it will plug your drain if you dont.</li>
            <li> It is simply amazing. I first wash my face with an all natural soap and then i use this mask. I mix it with Raw unfilitered apple cider vinegar. I use it about every other day or every 2 days. It is amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> Applied first application, did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Okay maybe not flawless. I use this to detox my hair without stripping it. Gentle and isn&#x27;t harsh like shampoo. Use it on my face as a mask and makes it feel really good. My face isn&#x27;t flawless though , I do see improvement.</li>
            <li> Was a little skeptical. Just received it.  First use: My skin actually felt really nice after.  Fist thick mask I&#x27;ve ever used. And I am looking forward to using it again. You can use a thin layer a I used a tick layer and it does harden enough to feel it on your skin. Also it&#x27;s easy to wash off. You don&#x27;t have to scrape or rub it off warm water takes it right off.</li>
            <li> For all first time users. PLEASE READ&lt;br /&gt;- to use: for every teaspoon of powder is half a teaspoon of water/apple cider vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;And naturally if you want more then just follow through (eg 2 teaspoons one teaspoon of h20 or acv)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your skin will tighten enough for it to itch. DONT ITCH IT. Because it will come to a point wherein you want to remove it -- suck it in! If that&#x27;s the case I suggest to just do 5-10mins. This itching means your skin is sensitive so don&#x27;t do it too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-put a thin layer and do not wash on sink wash on kitchen sink after instead. There&#x27;s a strainer there so u can just throw out the residue afterwards so as not to clog any drains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my first time hence the 3 stars. My skin is pretty fine. I just was looking for something that will make my skin flawless - porcelain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I like that this is an effective, natural way to take care of my skin.  However, using this product is a process of trial and error.  As someone else said, do use apple cider vinegar instead of just water.  It does smell a little funky, but I definitely got a better texture and smooth feeling afterward on my face.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it took so long for me to find out about this product. I&#x27;ve used it 4 times and my skin looks so much better. I&#x27;m 45 and will occasionally get a breakout. It cleared any blemishes up very quick. My skin is soft and my color looks so much better. I had a little redness afterwards but it went away quickly. The first time I used it it was a little intense but I toughed it out and it was well worth it. Now I don&#x27;t have any burning just the pulling you&#x27;re suppose to have. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Works really well but be careful when you use it. My fave is bright red for a while after I wash it off. It really does get deep down in your pores.</li>
            <li> This is one product that I keep in my medicine cabinet ALWAYS! I mainly use it to fight acne in 2 different ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I create a face mask that I rinse off later on while bathing in the tub. I use a small ceramic bowl, add about a tablespoon of the powder and slowly add small amounts of water while stirring. This will prevent the clay from clunking up. I prefer a thicker mask so I add just enough water to create the mask. Then I place it all over my face and neck. If I have extra I place it on my upper chest. You will immediately begin to feel tingling. Your face will then begin to tighten as the clay mask begins to dry. You may even feel your face pulsating. I draw a bath in the meantime. Once I am done with my bath or when the tightness is too much for me, I remove the mask with a washcloth. Simply wet the washcloth with water and pat on the mask to moisten. Then go over again in circular motions until mask is removed. You will have to give your bath an extra rinse since the clay may stick to the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I also use the clay for problem areas. Since I too tend to have cystic acne, I immediately mix a small amount of the clay/water and place on the problem area. The clay will reduce the inflammation caused by acne. Sometimes I leave on overnight. I have seen other people suggest mixing the clay with apple cider vinegar so as to prevent harming the skin. So far I have not had any problems. Will try the ACV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is affordable and less expensive than all the other acne treatment products I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it too often, just when I have break outs or need to clarify my hair. It is pretty awesome. I am going to start using it to prevent breakouts. I have been sleeping in my makeup lately (bad I know). So I will get breakouts from time to time. My pores have also become more noticeable. I put this mask on let it sit for a while. I feel the pulsating and squeezing. It maybe mental, but it feels like it&#x27;s working. After rinsing it off most of the products I apply kind of burn. I don&#x27;t know if this is because I exfoliate prior to the mask, or I use Retin A. Maybe someone else has had a similar experience. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be too serious though. After thoroughly removing this from my face with warm cloth then a toner all my products absorb quite nicely. I also notice my pores seem to get smaller and if I use it before an event, my makeup looks more natural( I also don&#x27;t have to use much) I would have used it more often in the past if I didn&#x27;t have to mix it.Yes I am that lazy. I bought two tubs last year they are still full. I might start experimenting with body mask and putting it on ingrown hairs just to use it up.  I will definitely buy this in the future.</li>
            <li> Did my first facial last night and I love the results. I did have a bit of peeling around the mouth area, but I exfoliated this morning and it came right off. I will probably have to use this product a few more times to actually see distinct results because I am currently on antibiotics and using some other facial products.</li>
            <li> I used this stuff for 3 days and I started getting acne...before that I only had blackheads to deal with. I will never use this stuff ever again.</li>
            <li> This does amazing things for your skin. I have oily skin and cystic acne. This has helped a ton and has reduced the amount of time that I have a large lump under my skin from the acne. Even if you don&#x27;t have problem skin your face will feel amazing after.</li>
            <li> Its great. Makes your face feel so clean</li>
            <li> This product says that it is clay and it is, so when you mix with the apple cider, please put on a thin layer, not thick because if you put it on to thick like I did, you will have a hard time washing it off. My face was all red from trying to wash off a thick layer and I have brown skin, lol so be careful. When i put it on thin it was easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this off and on for decades. Only with ACV. Bragg&#x27;s. I put a nice layer on. Not too thick or it won&#x27;t dry. Not too thin or it&#x27;ll dry too fast and won&#x27;t pull enough out. Unless you just want it for a sort of conditioning, cleaning. Then do your thing. But you do need to be careful with this stuff. It&#x27;s strong. I&#x27;m a fair-skinned middle-aged woman and this can give me broken capillaries. I like to use it just for the blackheads on my nose because it&#x27;s so strong that it really pulls everything out in one go. When I do do my whole face my skin is definitely tighter and the pores smaller. No question. The redness goes away soon enough. But broken capillaries? Not so much. Bottom line? You can use it various ways to solve various problems. Just read the label and then experiment. No one else has YOUR skin. For me it&#x27;s the best blackhead remover for my nose that I&#x27;ve ever come across. Looking like Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer for a half hour afterwards is a small price to pay. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this clay to see if what I&#x27;ve read about clay masks actually was true.  In this case, it did everything the manufacturer said it would.  It tightened my skin but since I have sensitive skin, it kind of stung too and that&#x27;s okay as I read that in the directions.  What I must have missed was how to take it back off--plain water.  It began to flake off after about 15 minutes and since it&#x27;s clay, I didn&#x27;t think it was a good idea to wash it down the drains so i wiped most of it off and then rinsed off.  It was messy at first but now I have the hang of it.  It definitely seemed to clear up my skin and tighten it.</li>
            <li> The absolute best clay mask I have ever tried!</li>
            <li> Loving this product so far. I had a mixture of the clay and raw organic Apple cider vinegar. Since it was my first time , I only left it only about 10 minutes. After I washed it off, my clean felt so clean and smooth. My face wasn&#x27;t dry or irritated at all.</li>
            <li> Bets product I have ever used IN MY LIFE!!!!!!!!! I will buy for a LIFETIME ordering 3 more tonight</li>
            <li> It feel good after use it in my first time make my skin beautiful and shine but  after 2 minutes it became a littel red i don&#x27;t know that is normal reaction or no but i recommend it</li>
            <li> There is a lot in this jar. I make up smaller amounts in a little jar to have on hand for a few days. I mix mine with the apple cider vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this due to the extensive great reviews. I have had no issues with clogged drains.......or clogged pores for that matter.</li>
            <li> Absolutely A great product</li>
            <li> It is multani mitti which is a very popular dirt. More expensive than expected. However, the product is good but I could have gotten these me thing at a cheaper price. Unfortunately I did not research before buying.</li>
            <li> The best cleanser ever. I use it 2x a week and my skin is nice and clear. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 years now. I also use coconut oil to moisturize afterwards.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m somewhere between mild and severe acne, and this mask really calms my skin. Immediately after washing the mask off, the blackheads on my nose were mostly gone. I noticed my skin a lot less red the next morning. The trick is keeping the mask 50/50 when mixed with water. I used too much of both components when I first tried mixing. About a tablespoon of each is enough to cover your face!</li>
            <li> I have struggled with skin issues for a long time (I have combination/oily skin). I have food allergies and digestive issues which makes it hard to keep your face clear. I have purchased super expensive serums and other face products and nothing has worked. I was doing some research on detoxing the skin and came across this clay. It was so cheap so I decided to give it a shot.  I have been using is for about 3 weeks pretty religiously. I do a facial with the clay and ACV 4-5 times a week and then I put raw honey the other 2-3 days.  In the first 7-10 days, my face felt cleaner but did experience a few more breakouts while the skin detoxed... but the blemishes went away in 1-2 days vs hanging around for awhile. I have read that&#x27;s normal for your skin to breakout so I didn&#x27;t stop with the facials. Now onto week 3, my face has improved 90%! I am amazed how clear and soft my skin is by using clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you struggle with skin issues, I encourage you to try this clay.  You need to use it religiously and don&#x27;t stop when you see your skin pushing out a few more blemishes in the first week or two. By week 3-4 you should really notice a difference!  My next plan is to try taking this internally to see if it helps with digestion!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel nice and tight and clean!</li>
            <li> My skin breaks out horribly after using this product</li>
            <li> At first I mixed it to thick, and clogged the sink. It is slippery and at times hard to work with. Try a small amount, and use oil to mix it instead of water. It clears the skin when used a couple of times a week.</li>
            <li> THis works great.  Ive tried all the clay masks  there are, all the korean, japanese, chinese, and indian ones.  Not to mention fro origins and sephora, but this one pulls everything.  Use once a week, if used too often, my face will become wayyyyy red.  Dont leave it for too long, or you will find urself having all the gunk pulled out...leading to a small pimple somewhere.  Think of it as supreme cleansing.  I have a bowl, i pout one to one mixture and throw out the rest.  love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I only purchased it because it had so many high ratings ... It&#x27;s a little cumbersome to use and I think one needs to be careful not to plug up a drain ... (I think I did that) ... so now I use it a little less.... but still think it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I have used this several times and it seems like it is all still there a small tablespoon of clay and a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and then the softest and smoothest skin possible, love it.......</li>
            <li> This product really works! My son had inflamed acne on his face and tried everything. Proactive, Neutrogena, Prescriptions, Esthetician...it cleared for a while, then all came back. He uses it with the Apple Cider Vinager, that is an astringent. It took a while (about 2 months) but now his skin is clearing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Aztec brand for years.  It does such a good job for facials.  Your skin feels so &#x27;new&#x27; after this mask removes that layer of dead skin.  You can feel your face pulsating as this clay starts to dry on it.  I always use a moisturizer after doing this mask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product on my face, I do feel a slight tingle as it is drying.. however my face does not &amp;#34;pulsate&amp;#34;. Application is a little messy as expected.. I don&#x27;t know if this product really done much for my face other than make it feel nice. Everyone&#x27;s different, never hurts to try I don&#x27;t guess.</li>
            <li> Wonderful on hair and skin.....love it!!!!</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite thing I have bought off amazon. It really works. Use it once a week and you will love it.</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> This mask is amazing! My mother and I mix the clay with Apple Cider Vinegar and then apply it with our hands. Once the clay dries you will feel small pulsations as it is pulling toxins out of your skin. I wash mine off in the sink all the time and have never had a problem with clogging the drain. I even made my boyfriend who suffers from acne try this product and his face looked more radiant and clear after just one use.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Hard to get off unless you wet it first!</li>
            <li> I applied a really thick layer the first time, and didn&#x27;t see much results.&lt;br /&gt;I tried applying a thin layer the next day, and WOW! I felt my face pulsating,&lt;br /&gt;and kind of like very tight and puffy. When I washed this off, all the under lying garbage came out to the surface. At least five white heads popped out of no where, I am sure if I waited another week, they would pop out by themselves and it won&#x27;t be pretty. I am going to do this again today, and see if more white heads will come out to the surface of the skin. This really cleanses the deepest layers of the skin, you can feel it sucking out all the oil. It&#x27;s weird, but I does what it says. I panicked when I first washed my face, because it seemed to me that I had more acne, but I realized, that this stuff brings out whatever is lying under the first layer of the skin to the visible layer of the skin. that means it&#x27;s deeply cleansing the skin. I will update within a week. I also had a big cystic acne on my chin, and usually it take 2-3 days for one like that to get soft and get a white head. Imediately after I did this make, two white heads came out to the surface of this cystic acne and the next morning the entire thing was dry, and today is the third day, it&#x27;s just a scar now. NO redness or pain. amazing!</li>
            <li> I tried this, read every review and followed the instructions. even tried it with the ACV as well. Then 2 weeks later, my skin completely dries out and feels like sandpaper after I wash my face. I have spent more money on different moisturizers to try to get my skin back. So far, no luck. I need to go to a dermatologist now.</li>
            <li> This product not only came right when I expected it but it performs better than I expected it to. I truly like this product and plan to order it again the moment I run out of it.</li>
            <li> This totally and utterly disappointed me. The raving reviews are what caused me to buy this product in the first place. I also adore the idea of an effective, natural product. But it did NOT work at all for me. First, its so messy. Unbelievably so. I left it on until it dried and that day - it all looked good. But the next day, my face what back to normal (almost as if I hadn&#x27;t even used it). It made no difference. At least it didn&#x27;t make my skin worse - but I never used apple cider vinegar, so maybe that is why it didn&#x27;t work for me. I guess, if you want to try it, its not a bad idea. However, be warned that it is MESSY and that the apple cider vinegar may be required.</li>
            <li> This stuff seriously works and it is amazing! I have used it once so far and I have already seen a difference! I have struggled pretty much all my life with blackheads on my t-zone and chin and this clay mask has reduced it on my cheeks and nose! I plan on using it once a week and I use it with raw Apple cider vinegar. I love how cheap it is and how well it works. What I do is wash my face with Acnedote scrub and then mix 1 tablespoon of the clay and 1 1/2 tablespoon of the apple cider vinegar together. I then put it on my face with a concealer brush and wait 20 minutes for it to dry on my face. I then rub it off with hot water and a wash cloth and after I use bare minerals moisturizer. I am going to try using OZ Naturals moisturizing face mask afterwards because I have heard the clay mask drys up your face a little. And I am switching over to foxbrim vitamin C lotion natural moisturizer on my face instead of the bare minerals to see how that works. If you use the moisturizer right after you take off the mask it shouldn&#x27;t dry out your face at all. It didn&#x27;t for mine anyways. But if you use it more frequently like 2x a weeks you should use a moisturizing face mask as well. The clay mask does leave your face red afterwards but it only lasts for 30 minutes. Overall, this product is definitely one of my favorites and I recommend this to anyone who is dealing with blackheads, oily/combination skin and acne.</li>
            <li> Not that different than other clay masks I&#x27;ve used but that doesn&#x27;t make it bad! It cleans and tightens pores like you would expect and refreshes your skin. I mix it with other things like green tea extract and sometimes a tiny bit of apple cider vinegar if I want a good purge of my pores. (No more than a teaspoon in your mask though, you could burn or irritate your skin with too much)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff, I&#x27;ve been using it for years and keep reordering. It feels very refreshing and I get great results.</li>
            <li> i tried this product because of all the hype and great reviews....plus it didnt rip a hole through my wallet, like some of the other masks i have tried in the past and recent years.....the combination of apple cider vinegar with the clay is almost a mini miracle.....every time i use this mask i feel like i just got a facial at an expensive and over priced salon....seriously it feels like all the crap is being lifted out of my skin for a fresh new start......there is a little redness after using this mask but that just means that its doing its job....blood flow to the face is important!!!......it brings oxygen and nutrients to the skin cells for better healing and rejuvenation...(sorry im a med student)....overall &#x27;me like&#x27;..&#x3D;p</li>
            <li> Used ONCE by far, really at a loss for words, WOW.... My face looks and feels so clean and refreshed. I&#x27;m a big skeptic on facial clay masks. BUT this is it for me. Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This clay is fun to mix up, like playing in mud.  I have used it on the bottom of my feet.  I have not used it as a facial yet.  It&#x27;s amazing how it feels.  It tingles and afterward your feet feel so good.</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised.  Container was full, get some tips on how to mix well and this will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I feel it pulling crap out of my skin I love this stuff I mix with Apple cider much better than when I mix with water</li>
            <li> One of the best products I ever purchased. As an African American with natural hair, I use this as a hair mask. I add olive oil, water, and apple cider vinegar to the powder to create a paste. I put the paste in my hair and let it sit for 45 minutes. My hair is so thick and strong.</li>
            <li> Man this stuff really gets the job done with pores/ acne. Try it and you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I bought this after starting a new medication that caused some unusual breakouts for my skin. I also love that there is nothing in here but clay and you don&#x27;t have to worry about the harshness of certain compounds. I just use water and throw a smidge of coconut oil in to help with moisture and use it about every two-three weeks. I follow it up with either pure coconut oil or The Body Shop Vitamin E moisture mask. Don&#x27;t make the mistake of just washing it off and not moisturizing afterwards, that will cause more dryness. Also if you have dry/sensitive skin DO NOT wait for longer than 10 mins. It will really itch and make you crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all my pores are smaller and its a cheap alternative to the other clay masks out there. Its also very pure and easy to use. I personally put mine in a plastic baggy and cut the tip and apply it like you would decorate a cake and then smooth out. Useful and I have a baggy to keep it in. You won&#x27;t use as much as you think. Don&#x27;t be afraid to put it on your neck as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> OK... so you know how all the reviews are talking about \\&quot;suction\\&quot;? Well yeah, I&#x27;m wearing it right now (face &amp; neck)... Have had it on less than 10 minutes and I have my laptop in my lap and I&#x27;m looking down at it and..... can&#x27;t lift my head to look out my picture window. My face is stuck in the down position. If you are reading this and live in NJ.... HELP!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s amazing. Best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used. Also great on mosquito and other vampire-like bugs bites. I use Braggo&#x27;s Apple Cider Vinegar, but you could use water if you must... sigh...</li>
            <li> This product comes as a powder and says to mix it in a one-to-one ratio.  However, it comes out really lumpy and thick at that ratio. I have tried it with more water with better results, but it is still lumpy. However, for the price/amount of product, this is a great value. This jar will last me a few years!</li>
            <li> Folks, the earth didn&#x27;t move, my lips didn&#x27;t pucker, BUT this is a great product. It&#x27;s like anything else, it&#x27;s as much what you put in your body as what you put on it. The first day I used a half and half mixture of water and ACV. Good results, not great. But the second day I tried it, I steamed my face first for 7 minutes (something I&#x27;ve done now once a week for 20 years) to open up the pores, added more ACV and waited. It worked even better, the tiny break out blemishes I sometimes get minimized. My face was smoother and clearer. In my opinion, this is a cumulative effect and you must \\&quot;customize\\&quot; and be patient--the Most important ingredient. I suspect folks who are not getting enough filtered water, sleeping well, not exercising, etc. may not get the same results. For me, I&#x27;m sold. I drink plenty of water and two quarts of my \\&quot;beauty juice\\&quot; daily (juice fresh carrots, parsley, apples, ginger root, lemons, and celery)So, combined with the clay regimen it really makes a noticeable difference. One other thing: You must moisterize! Afterwards I apply another product bought here at Amazon: pure Emu oil. Amazing properties. Rub in well and let it set for five minutes then remove with a warm, damp face cloth. Your face will love you.</li>
            <li> Receive the product promptly and use it right after the same day received at that night. The first time I use clay mixed with water and apply on my face and neck, you can feel a little bit burn on my face. After 20 minutes, I use warm water to clear up, the skin feels soft, smooth and bright; my pores are smaller even the whiteheads are clear up as well although the skin is a bit of read but after 3 minutes, they are gone. This is a real amazing product with high quality and small spending for facial clear product. Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> Best skin care product purchase I have made considering its price and effectiveness.  I&#x27;m so glad that I found this.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had have mild-to-medium acne condition and have been struggling with it for years.  Aztec clay mask not only helped clearing up my face it helped me saving $$.  Thanks to all the reviews too.  I would not have tried it if it&#x27;s not because people sharing their experiences here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One table spoon of the powder and one table spoon of organic apple cider vinegar would do the trick (for me anyways).  I apply it to my face twice a week and leave it on for 20 minutes then rinse it off with warm water and a clean face wiper. It did make my skin a little red right afterwards (try touching the skin with an ice cube gently) but the color faded after 15 minutes.  My face feels clean and smooth immediately. I definitely feel that my pores are cleaner and my face can breathe better. Although after three weeks of using it, I can&#x27;t say that my pores are less visible, in fact, they look quite noticeable...maybe it&#x27;s because I keep staring at them or maybe they are so clean you can see the emptiness(cuz if they&#x27;re clogged, you can&#x27;t see the holes).  I do get a little bumps here and there every once a while but they go away quickly and they are a lot better than big ones. The blackheads are disappearing too.  The only thing is that the mask doesn&#x27;t seem to help with dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that it&#x27;s a lot easier to apply makeup on now and I&#x27;m happier with the result. I don&#x27;t look like I have makeup on but my skin looks healthier and natural.  One thing i have to point out is that I also use Clarisonic Mia (facial brush) to wash my face twice a week (not the same day i use the clay).  My guess is that both these products helped.  Good luck!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!! After suffering with severe cystic acne for 5 years and trying absolutely everything (from Proactiv, to urine therapy, to rx&#x27;s + more) I started using this mask every morning for 20 minutes. I have absolutely no more acne and the scarring is fading away fast!!! My skin is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s on my face now. The package says use once a week or more for problem skin. I started with once a week and saw slight improvement in my acne. Then I kept increasing it until I saw such great results that I do it every morning now. I may take a day off here or there but I try to use it at least 5-6 days a week. You will not believe the results if you do this!!! I mix it with apple cider vinegar like the package suggests and I do it before my shower and just wash it off in the shower. If you have acne you MUST try this. Give it two weeks doing it daily and you WILL NOT believe the results! It&#x27;s very deep pore cleansing and has over fifty minerals that soothe and repair the skin! I whole-heartedly I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling very soft</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the hype behind this product :/ it is just like any other facepack. Clears oil and dries out the face .doesnt help a great deal with acne . I wish I find a product for my hormonal chin acne due to pcos :/</li>
            <li> This clay worked right after I used it. Left my skin feeling soft &amp; also helped with the redness of acne &amp; made the swelling go down. Helped with dark spots from acne. It burns a little for me but nothing to cry about. This stuff is just awesome!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it on the frequent to know of its true effects, but the first time i did use it, it dried out all my existing pimples!!!</li>
            <li> PROS:  This works really well.  I recommend it.  Your face gets incredibly tight, more than you&#x27;ve ever felt before, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt.  I was worried it would hurt, but it doesn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s so tight that it will surprise you, and then your pores will be so minimized and clear that it will surprise you too.  I use it once/week.  It&#x27;s a wonderful feeling afterwards.  Your face will be as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind.  I use proactiv 3-step with this once/week.  My skin has been very acne prone and I was even on accutane.  I still get breakouts (but it&#x27;s about 2 or 3 zits instead of 20), but they are much more manageable with this in combination with proactiv.  I&#x27;ve used both products together for about 8 months.  You&#x27;ll never need to buy another face mask again.  Oh, and it lasts a long time too.  8 months x 4 weeks... 32 weeks and I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in the top of it.  I use about a teaspoon full for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:  Because it&#x27;s powdered clay, it&#x27;s hard to mix.  I use a clean ceramic soap dish and hot water.  The apple cider vinegar recommended in reviewed smelled nasty, burned, and didn&#x27;t work any better or worse.  This product and water is plenty on its own.  If you use too much it can clog up your sink/shower.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing; all the positive reviews on here are definitely true.  Buy online from iherb.com, use code KOY923 at checkout for $5.00 off your first purchase!</li>
            <li> Fun to do and works great.</li>
            <li> So I had gotten this from amazon some time ago but after a few uses it had caused my skin to break out. It had \\&quot;pulled\\&quot; the acne to the surface of my skin and it was really embarrasing so I stopped use. Maybe it could have been i was trying it with something else but 2 weeks ago i decided to give it another try. Today I write to you ss a person with clearer skin. I&#x27;m not sure how it works with bad acne, that problem was cured mostly by another product years ago but they changed the formula some time ago and it no longer worked. I had been looking for years for something else to finish off the rest and do something about the old pox scars still left behind. I mix it with regular ole acv store brought and it tightens my face. I leave it on for 30 minutes. Towards the end at least for me it starts to sting/burn/itch but not horribly. My pores are also a LOT smaller! Highly reccommened product.</li>
            <li> really great, i agree with all the positive feedback.</li>
            <li> The mask really does pulsate...it feels like it&#x27;s sucking your face off! But in a good way that proves it&#x27;s really working. I have trouble getting it to form a smooth paste, but I refuse to use vinegar instead of water (can&#x27;t tolerate the smell). So I just put it on lumps and all! The excess keeps nicely in the fridge. It&#x27;s a bit difficult to rinse back off (pay attention to other reviews that recommend rinsing in the kitchen sink!) because I imagine it would clog up bathroom drains pretty easily. Once you get it off your face feels so clean and your skin is super smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have both just tried it. The clay is pretty messy and I am worried that it will plug up my sinks so I took a big bowl of hot water and a rag and cleaned my face off after it dried than flushed the water down the toilet. I do agree that some of my pores did look a little bigger, but I guess that could be because its bring the acne to the top??? I don&#x27;t know I will have to wait and see how it goes. My daughters face turn bright red and it hasn&#x27;t went away yet though she says her face feels fine..so its def something to use at night to give your face time to go back to normal color.I also use the oil cleansing method, which I like a lot, but its nice to have a few different natural things around to keep you skin in good shape.</li>
            <li> If you want to get rid of any blemishes or anything that may be causing imperfections in your complexion, then try this!!! Seriously, this stuff sucks works immediately to remove a substantial layer of dirt for healthier looking skin. Even my husband uses this stuff</li>
            <li> It does make my face red, only use for recommended time on label. I recommend using a face lotion after you wash it off, but I have sensitive skin. I have made it with both apple cider vineagar and water and I really like how my face feels the next day. My boyfriend and I use it together, I think this product is good for all skin types.</li>
            <li> Great facials. I&#x27;ve done 2 already. You can FEEL it working and pulling and cleaning! I&#x27;m certain that this tub will last me a long time!</li>
            <li> Nothing has worked better than this. I&#x27;ve tried multiple acne medication, blackhead scrubs and nothing seemed to work. I saw this, read the reviews and decided to try this before I gave up. &amp; I&#x27;m glad I did. This may sound a little gross but this dirt or &amp;#34;clay&amp;#34; literally sucked out the blackheads on my nose &amp; on my face. It took out stuff I didn&#x27;t even know was there! I absolutely love this stuff. It works and it feels good on the face but don&#x27;t leave it on for too long. Probably 15 minutes Max because it will start to feel like it&#x27;s burning your face.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE TIGHTNESS IT GIVES TO MY FACE.. But didn&#x27;t do much for my pimples or black heads</li>
            <li> Such an amazing product. You won&#x27;t regret this buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing a bunch of people on youtube like it. I found it fun and easy to do. The smell didn&#x27;t bother me at all and I didn&#x27;t think it really did anything besides clean my face and make it dry.</li>
            <li> I took a lot of the others reviewers advice and mixed the powder with apple cider vinegar in a sealable sandwich bag. This allowed me to save some for the next time I wanted to make use of it and not have to mix again. I have seen a difference in some of the blemishes on my face, especially the red marks. I had several really vivid red marks and those have really lighten up through my use of this clay. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I heard about this on a website I keep up-to-date on, and everyone was singing its praises. Being very inexpensive, I decided to order it and try it out. It comes in a powder which you mix with apple cider vinegar to make a paste. Kind of messy, but easy enough to apply. It is somewhat challenging to estimate how much you will need, and I ended up mixing too much my first time. I ended up using it on my body, as it really does make your skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> I spent a year suffering from adult hormonal cystic acne.  1-2 huge throbbing pimples 1-2x/month!  It was psychologically devastating and physically painful too.  I felt completely at its mercy.  The worst part was that it seemed to have come out of nowhere-- I&#x27;m in my late 20s and had spent my life with occasional pimples but mostly very good skin (albeit fair, dry and very sensitive.)  Anyway, I&#x27;ve finally found a routine that has VANISHED the cystic acne:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I stopped consuming all processed sugar and gluten. I think this is what really stopped my body from \\&quot;making\\&quot; the acne in the first place.  Try it for a month-- it&#x27;s totally worth it (this from a sweet tooth.)&lt;br /&gt;2) Tanda blue light 1-2x/day on problem areas. Kills bacteria deep inside the pore, which I think is what finally got rid of my stubborn existing acne cysts.&lt;br /&gt;3) AZTEC HEALING CLAY facial 1-2X/week.  I do not recommend using it with the apple cider vinegar to anyone with sensitive skin.  Try mixing it with rosewater if you&#x27;re looking for a thrill.  Aztec does a great job exfoliating and releasing blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;4) Mario Badescu drying lotion overnight about 3x/week.  Excellent, overnight resolution of any smaller inflammations and great for blackheads too.  A great partner for Aztec Healing Clay, I think.&lt;br /&gt;5) Awaken My Senses Night Oil for Sensitive Skin-- a miracle moisturizer for my sensitive, sometimes dry face. I use it at least twice a day religiously and never use any other moisturizer any more. It&#x27;s a beautiful, organic product from a wonderful little company I&#x27;ve fallen in love with, and it&#x27;s great following each of the above drying treatments, especially after Aztec Healing.  It&#x27;s also rated 0 by the Environmental Working Group (zero is the best score they give, and beauty products rarely earn it.)  When I use this it feels like I&#x27;m feeding my skin what it always wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this routine more highly-- I wish someone had prescribed it to me a year ago.  It&#x27;s also very low-toxin, for those interested in controlling the amount of hazardous chemicals you&#x27;re rubbing into your face each day (see EWG website.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps some of you with similar skin!ear ago.  It&#x27;s also very low-toxin, for those interested in controlling the amount of hazardous chemicals you&#x27;re rubbing into your face each day (see EWG website.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps some of you with similar skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been breaking out like crazy recently, and saw this on my recommended list, and after reading the reviews, I decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;When I put it on I was surprised because I&#x27;m so used to masks stinging my face, but it was VERY soothing.. and as it dried I could feel the &amp;#34;pulsating&amp;#34; feeling.. it felt like a face massage.. I could&#x27;ve fallen asleep, but I didn&#x27;t want to leave it on longer than recommended ..&lt;br /&gt;When removing the mask, it came off easily and all the blackheads and whiteheads were brought to the surface.. my face feels sooooo moisturized and soft.. it&#x27;s never felt like this before!! And after washing my face and letting it dry, my pimples shrunk down dramatically! Amazing :D</li>
            <li> I havent really seen improvement.. but ill see what happens. ..</li>
            <li> This is a very good bentonite clay powder.  I have used it to dry up new baby&#x27;s umbilical cords.  It dried them up very well and heals the wound.  It is very messy, but cleans up well.  It is green in color as it should be and make a good deep cleaning facial mask. I have been using it for over 20 years and still love it.</li>
            <li> It is just a good skin exfoliator, blackhead still there. Leave skin really soft,a little redness..if you feel your face dry after the clay, be sure to use a good cream to hydrate the skin and don&#x27;t use the clay more than 1 time a week if dryness occur.</li>
            <li> It worked for me. I have very oily skin and sebacious cystic acne. I followed the instructions posted by other customers (Apple cider vinegar and bentonite clay) and my acne has reduced tremendously in a couple of weeks. Hope that it helps me continue to control my acne.</li>
            <li> Excellent.reveiws where true to product..love it cant stop talking about it....</li>
            <li> Works so well! helps! I mix it with apple cider viniger and it makes my face glow and shrinks my pores. I highly recommend it! Especially good for reducing my acne.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it enough to truly give an accurate review, but seems to do the job. It is quite messy and can be difficult to get off. I also don&#x27;t know if it is good for your plumbing.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when my facial powder came in. It&#x27;s in a huge container and will last probably a full year! It&#x27;s great! It&#x27;s cleans well and leaves your face with a soft, glowing look to it. It has many, many uses for it: including body wraps! Buy this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this clay! I use it as a hair revival and also a mask. Not sure with water but when mixed with Apple cider vinegar you definitely feel a tightness as it dries.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination, adult onset acne-prone skin and I have been trying to find more natural-based products to use that had great reviews. I had been using Glamglow, which I liked a lot, but was so expensive for how much you got that I wanted to find a replacement. My first try mixed with apple cider vinegar was amazing. My skin felt like a baby&#x27;s bottom after one use. My skin looked bright and tight. I can&#x27;t wait to use this a couple times a week. I used 1 tbsp of each and still have enough to use again, but have it all sealed up for a second application. I cannot wait to see how long this product will last me with regular use.</li>
            <li> The product is great but it doesn&#x27;t work wonders on the first try. I have pretty okay skin, i get the occasional pimple. I do, however, have really bad blackheads on my nose. I just did the mask for the first time, having a slightly bad nose and a couple of pimples on my cheek. The pimples are still there but the pores on my nose have significantly decreased in size! I will say moisturize immediately after! Warm water on a towel to take the mask off helps a lot too. My skin is feeling baby soft, but it is still red after 20 minutes of the mask being off.</li>
            <li> This mask works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you, (like me) hate the smell of apple cider vinegar, add a drop or two of (raw) honey to the mix when you&#x27;re mixing it up and it just smells like honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions call for a quarter inch of packed mud, but if you go that far, you&#x27;re looking at a 45-minute-plus commitment. It does a great job with an 8th inch..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT pull it off after it dries. It binds to your skin! Are you people insane? It MELTS off with running water! Don&#x27;t do that to your poor face! Get in the shower. Sheesh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, If you&#x27;re all fidgety like me, it&#x27;s almost impossible to make it to the point of it throbbing without picking it off. I look like the Phantom of the Opera by about minute 30. Still awesome.</li>
            <li> It was fun to not be able to move my face after the clay hardened.</li>
            <li> This product is truely amazing! I try everythingggggg! And this by far is the best face mask! I have been batteling with cystic acne and breakouts. It was awful. My face is now clear to a routine of amazing products. This mask is cheap and can be used over 30 times. I lather it all over my face and keep it on until it dries or as long as I can stand it. I had my doubts about \\&quot;sucking everything out\\&quot; but last night proved it true. I use this once or twice a week typically after a Salicylic Peel (also purched on amazon 15$)  I saw some blackheads on my nose and after this mask they were gone! I went to squeeze them out and my pores were clean!! This product is 6$ and worth every penny. Its way cheaper then any other expensive mask. Definitely purchase this!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say this product gets extremely tight and can crack off. May make face very red for an hr but just moisturize. I use this on spa night once a week and the next morn by face is smooth. I take it off in the shower it isss extremely messy but its worth it. I use ACV with it. Simplyyy amazing!!!!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I use this everyday, when I wash my face. I use it in a mixture, but it can be used alone with a little water to cleanse.</li>
            <li> Right around the time when you think you regular cleanser isn&#x27;t working for you any longer and you feel like you need a deeper clean, try Indian Healing Clay. I&#x27;m a brown skinned woman early forties who has found that from time to time I need a stronger facial cleaner and this product is it.You get an instant glow, and your face is super clean. You do get a slight redness after removal of the mask but it is temporary. I also noticed that for me the areas around my mouth and nose are a little more sensitive, so practice makes perfect in determining how much to use and where your sensitive spots are. I&#x27;ll continue to use my regular daily cleansers, but I&#x27;ll use this product as a mask every two weeks or so to get that deep clean.</li>
            <li> Actually made me break out.</li>
            <li> Pros: Good product for the price &amp; it made my skin feel softer.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Plugged up my sink after rinsing it off, it always clumps up when i mix it &amp; I didn&#x27;t feel the pulsating everyone is talking about :(</li>
            <li> This &#x27;Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay&#x27; is phenomenal.&lt;br /&gt;It prevents and heals acne already present. It also&lt;br /&gt;soothes and evens the skin tone.  It also gives the&lt;br /&gt;skin a better texture.  IT IS PHENOMENAL!  LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it expecially for men. It is very masculine&lt;br /&gt;for men.  No perfumes, all natural.  Try it once,&lt;br /&gt;you&#x27;ll love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the worst product it doesn&#x27;t not work at all it just worsen my acne</li>
            <li> Meh. It&#x27;s currently sitting under my bathroom sink collecting dust. I used it a few times with apple cider vinegar, but it just wasn&#x27;t for me. PocketDerm is all I really rely on now to keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li> Love love this clay mask. Makes my skin so smooth and soft. I have used other high end masks and this surpasses them all-Great buy!</li>
            <li> This mask is awesome.  I have combination oily skin and I get acne break outs on my chin.  So this is how I use the mask:&lt;br /&gt;1. I steam my skin first, I have a Panasonic black head remover and I use that for extractions or I gently press on acne pimple to remove puss (don&#x27;t torture yourself).&lt;br /&gt;2. I mix it in an old hair dye mixing bowl. It&#x27;s a powder, is very fine and can get everywhere so be careful.  I found a scoop works best.  It does not come with one , but pouring it into the mixing bowl is messy.&lt;br /&gt;3. I mix equal parts with the organic apple cider vinegar.  Do little bits at a time to get the right consistency.&lt;br /&gt;4. Leave it on until it dries.  I found that it tightens the skin as well as helps unclog pores.  For me I noticed my fine lines diminishing after the second mask.  I also use a thicker mask and again, I felt a noticeable tingle and tightening, but not the kind of tightening you get from drug store masks, where it tightens because it&#x27;s drying you out.  It feels like it&#x27;s literally tightening the skin no just drying it out.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s good stuff and I recommend for anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It works so well on my pores, it makes them smaller in just one use. I&#x27;ve recommended this product to family members and they love it also. This stuff works best with apple vinegar!</li>
            <li> The discription match the product. I receved it on time and no damages were found. Product as multi uses and the discription says.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews and watching youtube videos on this i was so excited to try it out. I bought 2 pounds of it and it came rather quickly. The first time i used it i mixed it with water. It was very clumpy, very un mask like. When i finally got it on my face it itched like crazy. I was only able to leave it for about 15 minutes. I really didnt see a difference in my skin after taking it off. The second time i applied it i mixed with apple cider vinegar. It was easier to apply. When it dried it seemed to just crack and fall off my face. I didnt feel it pulsate or anything. When i took it off once again it didnt look like it had dont anything significant to my face. I am going to continue to try it and see what happens.</li>
            <li> I absolutely L.O.V.E. this mask! This clay mask is a powder that requires either raw apple cider vinegar or water to be mixed with it prior to application. I used apple cider vinegar because it mixes much better than water. After I rinsed off the mask, my skin felt so clean and soft. I would recommend others to purchase this as well.</li>
            <li> First, a little background about my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In middle school I started having breakouts that pretty much never went away.  I ended up using Proactiv, which helped for a few years but eventually stopped working.  Now, in my late 20&#x27;s I STILL have annoying breakouts, both hormonal and non-hormonal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently started using the Say Yes to Tomatoes Acne gel clenaser which seems to be helping, but I was still missing that one piece of the skincare puzzle to bring it all together.  When I saw all of the positive reviews for this mask, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this mask, every other day (25 minutes), for about 2 weeks now and I can honestly say I have seen an improvement in my skin.  The first time I used it, it did make my face extremely sensitive and red the next day but after a couple of uses, that went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of warning:  This did bring quite a few pimples to the surface.  I gave myself a 2 week window in which I allowed the mask to suck all the gunk out without thinking the mask itself was actually causing my skin to become worse.  Now that I am over that 2 week hump, my skin is clear and I feel that the scars I have from older blemishes are lightening.  I also feel that I have a glow that I didn&#x27;t have before, which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask does pulsate/pull on the skin but other than that it isn&#x27;t uncomfortable at all.  I would recommend this mask to anyone who has some minor skin issues, as I don&#x27;t know how it would work on major skin problems.  All I would advise is to give it at least 2 weeks to see what type of results you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**9/10 UPDATE:  I seriously love this stuff!!!  It&#x27;s been a few weeks since my first review and my results have only gotten better.  I have had maybe two blemishes since this mask yanked all the stuff out of my pores....and those blemishes were not as severe and didn&#x27;t last nearly as long as they used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so excited to have finally found something that works!mething that works!</li>
            <li> i tried it with the facial mask recipe to remove impurities from my skin, it works very well. good value.</li>
            <li> Great Product But Friggin messy , its so messy and stinky but it does work well it cleared my skin well</li>
            <li> I used this as a full face mask a few times and didn&#x27;t like it. I left the jar in my closet and didn&#x27;t think of it again for a few months. I just couldn&#x27;t get into weird sensation of the mask drying! It says it&#x27;s pulsating, but to me it was just irritating! I couldn&#x27;t wait for it to dry so I could wash it off. My whole face would be very red after removing the mask, even when I was gentle with the removal. It just wasn&#x27;t what I had hoped it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was cleaning my closet out not too long ago and saw the jar and thought, why not! I&#x27;ll try again, but definitely not as a full face mask. I had a zit that wouldn&#x27;t budge so I mixed up the mask and put it over the pimple and also over my nose like a pore strip. I rinsed it off and kept reapplying the mask over the two areas until the pimple came to a head (gross, I know, sorry!). It was awesome to see the mask actually working to pull the pimple gunk out of my skin Also, my nose pores looked amazing! Usually those pore strips leave something to be desired for me. And the cost per strip to keep reapplying to get the remaining out would be way too expensive! This mask is AWESOME as a pore strip alternative and a spot treatment. I&#x27;m so glad I gave this simple mask mix a second chance. My nose is smooth and my pores are clean...I&#x27;m a happy camper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Random thoughts/tips:&lt;br /&gt;*You don&#x27;t need to apply a thick layer&lt;br /&gt;*Don&#x27;t let it get down your drain! It will clog your pipes! (Someone else recommended putting a paper towel down in the basin of your sink while you rinse to catch the mask as it comes off, awesome idea!)&lt;br /&gt;*You don&#x27;t need to scrub hard to get it off your face, resist that urge and just be slow and gentle.. your skin will thank you :)</li>
            <li> Best facial on the planet!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it work. But its fun to use lol.</li>
            <li> Great item made my face glow!!</li>
            <li> I am using this for amazing facial masks and it&#x27;s helping clear my skin! AWESOME value when you buy it on Amazon compared to what retail charges for it!</li>
            <li> Has so many uses.  Leaves my skin feeling amazing.  Use some in my hair to absorb excess oil. great product.</li>
            <li> I was googling face masks one day and this product was so talked about that I searched for it on amazon and decided to try it. Holy cow, this clay mask is incredible! I&#x27;m so surprised I&#x27;ve never heard of it before and that it was so affordable!! Your skin really does pulsate! After I wiped it off, my face was a little red but only for maybe 15-20 mins. After using it for the first time I immediately noticed that my pores looked smaller and my skin was so soft!! definitely recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> This face mask has worked wonders for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to get this product for a few months and I finally ordered it! It got here within a few days and I immediately tried it. I mixed it with raw apple cider vinegar and it works perfectly. Although, the apple cider vinegar doesn&#x27;t smell to good the smell will eventually go away. You can also mix it with water. This product does make your face pulsate and it will leave your face extremely red after, but it will take about 30 minutes for the redness to go away, so I recommend doing this before bed or on a day you don&#x27;t plan on going out somewhere. I&#x27;ve used it twice now and so far it&#x27;s made my face really soft and smooth and seems like it&#x27;s really gonna start to fade my acne scars! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with different skin types, just be sure to use a moisturizer after so your skin doesn&#x27;t dry out. I use the clean and clear dual action moisturizer, it works really well!</li>
            <li> YES. ITS IS NUMBER ONE IN SKIN ANTI AGING FOR GOOD REASIN. STOP BUYIMG HIGH DOLLAR PRODUCTS. THIS PRODUCTS WORKS!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the mask a couple times but haven&#x27;t seen great great results yet. Its pretty messy and hard to remove but my skin does feel smoother afterwards. I also believe it mixed better and was more effective with the apple cider vinegar than with the water I initially mixed it with. Im looking forward to using it more in order to hopefully see more results.</li>
            <li> WOW! This stuff kicks some black head butt. I mixed with the apple cider vinegar and felt the pull. My face was pulsating! After rinsing my face is glowing the next day and looks so clean and clear. Amazing product!</li>
            <li> Ok so I tried this and at first I was a little taken back by the smell of it and sizzle noise when I added the vinegar but after I put it on my face it didn&#x27;t smell !! During the 30-minutes I felt the clean tingling, the throbbing, the tightening.. I loved it! I washed it off with a warm towel and I put a strainer over my drain just in case. My skin is glowing and feels better then it has after any facial!! I&#x27;m soo happy I found this product!!! I&#x27;m addicted!!</li>
            <li> Just wonderful. The best clay mask I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice weekly and even add it to my bath. I highly recommend it, it is very useful and works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was prompt, my package arrived as planned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shopping!</li>
            <li> A pound of anything is a lot!!!  This clay jar will last a long time.  You don&#x27;t need a lot and this clay really works!!! Your&lt;br /&gt;face feels soft and clean.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I love this clay I use it for facial and my feet,  this clay make my feet like I have baby feet again. I just use water and castor oil and cover my feet with plastic grocery bags for about and hour, and  oh my god!!!!! this is a really great product thats not expensive . I also use this clay on my hair I  have natural kinky 4a(B) texture hair and this clay made my hair feel so soft and my curl pop out more.</li>
            <li> My sister had a terrible breakout recently and tried this mask.  It didn&#x27;t totally eradicate her problem since it was cystic (and that requires more than a simple mask) but it did help with the surface pain.&lt;br /&gt;I love the &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; as the mask tightened.  Even with the tingling, this is actually pretty gentle for a mud mask.  I didn&#x27;t feel  any burning sensation as I normally do with with other mud masks.</li>
            <li> Nothing happened...&lt;br /&gt;I did a +water mix, a + apple cider+water mix AND a just apple cider mix but no difference at all. If anything, my acne is appearing faster</li>
            <li> Great Natural Healing Product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this product in my bathroom cabinet for almost 20 years.  Every time I get a breakout, a rash or a bug bite, I sprinkle a little of the powder into the lid of the container and swirl it around with either some water, some aloe vera juice, or apple cider vinegar, and apply it to my skin with either a finger tip or a small fan brush and it soaks up the problem in just a few minutes. Don&#x27;t make it too thick and pastey, though.  A thin solution will dry faster and not overzap your skin.  Your skin will turn red underneath the mask, because it draws the blood to the surface.  The thicker it is, the longer it takes to dry, the longer it remains on, the redder your skin will get.  A light dose is best, I&#x27;ve found.  With a thin layer you can actually see the effect of the oils getting drawn from your pores into the clay.  Do not put it under your eyes as it is too drying for that sensitive area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special use:  After having experienced the scourge that is &#x27;bed bugs&#x27;, there comes a time where all your clothes and bedding are bed bug free [thank you pak-tite] but your body, itself,  is not.  If you lie down on your clean bedding, or put on your clean clothes you will start the cycle all over again.  ARGH.  Nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My solution: Slather up your whole body with a thin solution of Aztec secret and apple cider vinegar.  It burns like crazy, but suffocates the remaining bed bugs on/in your skin.  Ahhhh, peace.  Sound sleep &amp; bye bye bed bugs.  A life saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe will always have this product in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a good product but I didn&#x27;t know until I got it that it&#x27;s powder and you mix it with apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li> Made baby diaper cream and makeup w this!  Really like it!!!  Great service!!</li>
            <li> for some serious acne treatment creams go royalcosmetics.net</li>
            <li> So many uses, great product</li>
            <li> This really cleans out your pores but it itches like hell</li>
            <li> I was honestly pretty disappointed in this product. I have combination skin that is sensitive. I used the sensitive skin time and the apple cider vinegar. I heard all of the rave reviews of how great this product is. It made my skin soft but it didn&#x27;t remove any zits or anything like that and I have used this product 3 times. I have realized that if you make the consistency a little bit thicker it does work better then if it is on the more liquidy side.Overall it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> I just washed this mask off... and WOAH! It was unlike any face mask experience I&#x27;ve ever had. True to all of the other reviews- it felt like suction all over my face and almost looked like it changed my face shape! My lips were even poofed out! My face was tingly and FELT LIKE IT WAS WORKING MAGIC! I have a lot of large pores, whiteheads, blackheads, and a few pimples- and when I washed it off it seemed like the forming pimples had been brought more to the surface and were easily pop-able. My skin was not especially soft or smooth, but it definitely feels clean and not overly dry. I am extremely excited about trying this again and adding it to my skin care regimen! For the price- this is the best thing I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews I read about Aztec Secret - Indian Healing Clay, I purchased it and definitely feel I scored quite a bargain. I mixed small amounts with water and applied it on my skin. The second time I used it, I applied the mask more liberally and got even better results. The feeling of tightness/pulling results in a really effective deep cleaning of the skin. I left it on long enough to completely dry. My face felt so much smoother, and there was no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The absolute best way to mix this is by adding apple cider vinegar. It totally changes the consistency of the mask, making it lighter, smoother and easier to apply and remove. Further experimentation with the addition of honey, olive oil, lemon juice and/or tea tree oil made it even better. If you are going to use this regularly, and I recommend that you do -- it is essential that you add some moisturizing product to the clay. You will still get the same cleaning effect, but your skin will look far nicer afterward. (That&#x27;s even for people with oily skin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes so little to make up enough for one application, I&#x27;m sure that the one pound jar will last me quite some time. The dry powder requires no refrigeration, and will certainly stay fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay is so pure, safe and effective that it can replace every other mask you&#x27;ve ever used, no matter what the price. It&#x27;s up to you to change up the ingredients for your own particular needs. You will definitely not regret this modest purchase that will pay off so beautifully!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This clay clumps and is very hard to make a paste.I won&#x27;t be buying it again unless it&#x27;s something I can use internally as well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING. I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to find it but I&#x27;m glad that I did. I have very sensitive skin with some cystic acne. My pores also always look so big ;( But using this with apple cider vinegar made my face look and feel so great. It literally cleaned out my pores and made them look visibly smaller. I also noticed that my preexisting acne and scars have started to go away since using this. Overall I think it&#x27;s amazing and definitely worth the buy, especially since it&#x27;s so cheap and works better than most of the expensive skin care products I have purchased over the years.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome . A pal recommended I use it on my hair and , WOW! . I recently straighten my natural hair (naturally curly) and my hair was severely heat damaged . My curls would not return . I used this on my hair and let it sit for about seven minutes before rinsing it out. At first it didn&#x27;t feel curly ( while washing ) but once I got out the shower and stepped in front of the mirror I could see my curls slowly returning. My friend said a month or two use of this should have me back to where I was, idk if that&#x27;s true but I will say it worked really well this first time around !</li>
            <li> This thing actually gives my face a proper cleaning.</li>
            <li> I just used this for the first time, it works wonders! it is magic in a jar. I mixed with water ( I ran out of apple cider vinegar but am excited to use it) and applied a thin even coat on my face. After about 10 minutes, rinsed with warm water and 99% of all impurities were gone, my face felt smooth and bright. I have to admit I doubted this product but know I am pleased to make this part of my weekly routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with the Aztec secret Indian healing Clay. It felt as any other ordinary face mask,  my face did feel clean afterwards I washed off the clay but only because I washed it off.. Also gave me more acne</li>
            <li> after I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews about this product,I decided to give it a shot,and it works great, I get acne once a while and this product helps me a lot,especially I have a very greasy face, i recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have used it only once. The skin does become quite smooth just after it&#x27;s use. I did not apply the clay on my face, instead I used it on my feet and arms.Will be able to give a better view after having used this for a couple of months.</li>
            <li> I had some mild cystic acne on my left cheek, cheek bone area due to not washing off my bronzer thoroughly. After using this product every other day for a week my acne cleared up. I only put a thin layer on and it still works for me. Only about half a tablespoon of product. I can see all the impurities get pulled out into the clay.  I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I recomend using natural oils as a moisturizer (coconut or almond oil)  after using this mask since it can be drying if you use lotion. I highly reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> I use this on my natural hair after mixing with apple cider. I use this as an alternative for shampoo wash (so my hair doesn&#x27;t feel dried out and brittle) and leaves my hair looking fuller and so so clean. Great product for your natural hair.</li>
            <li> This is such a refreshing clay. I loved how easy it was to mix (just water) and how quickly I had felt the difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 16 and I hate my face because of my acne but this made me love it a lil more. I use it with water, so maybe the results aren&#x27;t like I expected but after I use it I feel that my face looks cleaner, and a little brighter and it doesn&#x27;t help a lot with acne though, the first 5 mins after I get it off I feel that my face is irritated.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I mix it with apple cider vinegar and let it dry on my face (when no one else is home) and the next day my skin is less oily and visibly smoother. Also, it doesn&#x27;t bounce back with extra oil the next day like many products that are supposed to remove oil and really just dry out my oily, oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can also attest that a little goes a long way- it only takes a few spoonfuls to mix up a mask, and this is a bargain for this product. I wish I had known about this years ago!</li>
            <li> I have oily to combination skin and sometimes get hormonal breakouts. I bought this product because of the great reviews and  have used it three times on my face since buying it. I like it alot but I dont understand why it&#x27;s so hyped up. It does a good job of cleaning pores, smoothing skin and the apple cider vinegar is good for my oily T zone. I will keep using it but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a miracle worker, with continued use though I can see how it would be advantageous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will however tell you why I will be a loyal customer. The jars are pretty big and you don&#x27;t need a lot of clay for  the face mask which leaves a lot of clay for your body mask!. That&#x27;s right! I mix a few tablespoons of clay with milk, water or rose water and plaster it all over my body. It&#x27;s a bit harder to spread on  ( apple cider goes on smoother) but it does wonders for the skin  on my back, legs, tummy.  It can leave your bathroom a bit dirty but it&#x27;s nothing to wash away after and it&#x27;s worth the effort. People pay big bucks for similar treatments in a spa and I am not aware of another product that gives you so much clay for this price.</li>
            <li> My face has been looking a little tired and dragged since I have been full time working and full time schooling. I decided I would try a face mask that will help bring my face back to life and this one for sure did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this I was so excited, but when I saw that it was a powder, I was a bit confused. It then made me realize how much healthier this is rather than premade masks. The first couple of batches I made were a bit chunky, but I used the smoother parts to apply to my sensitive, combination skin. This is the strongest mask I have ever used. At five minutes, the mask was so tight I couldn’t move my lips, only my eyes had mobility. I only kept it on for ten minutes, but this stuff still did so much for me. My face was soft, smooth, and looking basically flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day though, I broke out a little bit on my forehead and my nose, but that was just because the mask was pulling out the impurities. The day after, my face was at my best. Sadly the results do not last very long. Definitely a product to use as directed because the results will not last longer than a week. If used consistently as directed the skin will be less likely to breakout, but if not, the whole process must happen again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This strong, odorless face mask was so easy to use and gave me the results that I wanted. Another reviewer said it deep cleaned your face to get “all the gunk out of them.” Not only did it tighten my skin, but rid many, almost all of my blackheads. I am definitely going to buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Good to use for boyfriends! I put it on him and his wrinkle on his forehead nearly completely vanished on the first day. We now use the mask together! :D</li>
            <li> Very, VERY lumpy when you mix it.</li>
            <li> It really cleared up alll my acne. It&#x27;s a bit tricky to mix because it becomes globs of the dust, but you get the hang of it. You do NOT need as much as it says on the back, a little does the trick. I have way less breakouts now(I had VERYYYYY severe acne), and I probably only has two pimples now. It doesn&#x27;t smell that pleasant. Great, cheap, and VERY effective.</li>
            <li> As an esthetician with more than 20 years experience, I can tell you that this is an exceptional mask.  If you&#x27;ve got highly sensitive or reactive skin, it may be too aggressive a mask for your skin; but for normal to oily to acneic, or thick sun damaged skin, this mask will do the trick.  If you are sensitive and want to give it a try, use water instead of vinegar and start off leaving it on for 10 minutes; other skin types can leave it on for longer periods.  No matter what instructions say, listen to your skin.  If it starts to burn too much or if you become overly sensitive to it, try leaving in on for shorter periods.  For those of us who can take it, go for it!  It&#x27;s wonderful!  Your skin will pulsate, detox, and tighten.  Blackheads...gone!  Pimples...gone!  With regular use, fine lines and wrinkles...gone!  Don&#x27;t be afraid if you skin is a little sensitive or red immediately afterwards, this will dissipate in 20 to 30 minutes.  Spritz your face with a gentle toner to replace your acid mantle, it will calm and quench your skin.  Follow with a good moisturizer.  DO NOT use a moisturizer with alpha hydroxy acids until several days after applying this masks.  Your skin will already be well exfoliated, you will see, after the clay mask.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> My skin was extremely dry after using this product. Highly recommend to use a deep moisturizer afterwards. Not sure if it even works for what it is intended for since I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes.</li>
            <li> I use this mask every couple of weeks, especially on my nose, to clean out and shrink the pores in my skin.  I would give this product five stars, but there are a few issues I have with it that should be addressed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros?&lt;br /&gt;The product works, plain and simple.  Yes, my skin is soft after rinsing off, and yes, my pores are clean and smaller.&lt;br /&gt;It feels great on my skin.  There is something very soothing about hiding behind all that mud.&lt;br /&gt;The price is reasonable, especially considering that I will be able to get 15 masks or so out of the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons?&lt;br /&gt;This stuff will clog the crap out of your plumbing.  I have not suffered an issue with it because I was careful, but it is impossible to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;The mud is very, very hard to get off of my face.  My advice to anyone reading this review is to have plenty of disposable paper towels on hand, because it is better that it ends up taking you ten minutes pulling it off your face with a bunch of paper towels, and then rinsing the last portions off in the shower, than to try to wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;Mixing it takes forever, and in order to prevent lumps, you have to take your time.  I was only able to prevent wasting most of it in lumps by using a super tiny whisk and mixing it in a cut-down paper cup, adding a very small amount at a time.  In order to make this mask clay powder into true clay, I suggest starting with two to three tablespoons of water and adding a small amount of powder, and then mixing.  Repeat until it is thick enough for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the product is not overly expensive and works well, it is worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Great quality and price and lasts a long, long time. I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I mix it with ACV to make a face mask. Makes my skin feel very soft after I moisturize. I think it&#x27;s better not to put too thick of a layer on. I put on enough that it will be dry after 20-30 minutes. I peel off what I can then wash the rest off. Some have had problems with it clogging drains.</li>
            <li> This mask is great.  Leaves my skin so silky smooth.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Great mask!  I use vinegar rather than water with it and it leaves my face a little red for a bit but it looks great in an hour or so.  It really makes my face soft and reduces the pores.</li>
            <li> Personally, this didn&#x27;t work for me. Nothing changed in my face other than more hurting. My face almost always reacts to face washes, so that&#x27;s kind of a regular happening.</li>
            <li> First of all I never write reviews so this product must be amazing. Just used this product today. I only purchased it because of the amazing reviews it had and the price. WOW is all I can say.! My skin is sensitive and oily and this mud mask seemed to pull out a lot of impurities. It did make my face hot after 10 minutes but that part didn&#x27;t bother me. It was worth whatever little agitation I felt. This is the best mud mask I have ever used and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.! I can&#x27;t stop staring at my skin and how healthy it looks after one use. I&#x27;m very excited to see how my face will look with future uses. Stop reading reviews and just buy this product.</li>
            <li> Really, I have used this stuff for about a month and I look at least ten years younger!  People have been saying to me &amp;#34;you look younger&amp;#34; I use it once a day. I am so glad that I found this product.</li>
            <li> I read about this in a health magazine and decided to try it. I really like it. It leaves your face soft and beautiful and has helped clear up a couple trouble spots on my face. I used it on my teenager and pre-teen too and it cleared up the little pimples they had. One thing I didn&#x27;t pay attention to when I bought this is that it comes in powder form and you add either apple cider vinegar or water. Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t give exact measurements and doesn&#x27;t come with a measuring spoon so I luckily had one plastic spoon (you can&#x27;t use metal) and used a plastic bowl with a good sealing lid because I made too much.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it!</li>
            <li> The delivery was fine. The actual product I don&#x27;t hate it but I also don&#x27;t love it. I ddnt really feel much of the pulsating feeling of it I just got the tightening feeling but overall I have not seen much improvement or much of a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best mask there is - don&#x27;t waste your money on masks with fancier packaging. This is great clay and many of the attractive masks I see in the store have cheaper ingredients. I add a few drops of lavender or tea tree oil to my mask &amp; store any leftover in the fridge for up to a week.</li>
            <li> Very good  mask.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll recomend.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery time ok.</li>
            <li> Works great! Has helped reduce my cystic acne. Use it with apple cider vinager. Mix it together in a ziplock bag and wash off with paper. It is clay and will clog your sink!</li>
            <li> Works as described. It really does a good job cleaning my face. It washes away easily. I&#x27;m happy with it and will purchase again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I have used this at least a dozen times now and LOVE it!!  I still have a lot left....It may take me a year to use this whole container!  I do mix mine with apple cider vinegar, yes it smells funky but thats just the vinegar.  I like to wash my face first and then apply before I take a shower, it comes off much better when you have running water. I would buy again and I do tell others about it!</li>
            <li> My spouse and I both use this and we absolutely love it. It leaves your skin feeling super soft and we have both noticed that it has reduced the amount of clogged pores we have.  Being athletes, we are prone to have more problems with clogged pores and get what you call &amp;#34;athletes face&amp;#34; and this has really helped keep the problems at bay.</li>
            <li> I am 32 and for as long as I can remember I&#x27;ve have tons of black/white heads on my nose,chin and cheeks. I used this twice already and I already see a difference in the amount of blackheads. Make sure to use the raw apple cider vinager. I used water the first time and it didn&#x27;t work as well as it did with the ACV. I&#x27;m going to also buy the tea tree oil that some people recommended. I felt very itchy when it first started drying on my face. It wasn&#x27;t too bothersome but if I can stop the utch why not. Also, I left it on for 40min and it was fine with my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKS AS WELL AS IT IS STATED IT DOES...IT DOES PULSATE AND SKIN  IS ROSY AFTERWARDS BUT MY FACE IS SOOOOO SOFT AND IT TRULY FEELS SO CLEAN AS WELL. I DID MIX MINE WITH BRAGGS APPLE CIDER VINEGAR.......THE SMELL OF THE VINEGAR IS THE ONLY BAD THING</li>
            <li> It was not as stingy as some of the other reviews said, but it had a very tightening effect. My skin was noticeably clear after I removed the mask.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and your face does actually pulsate.  It is a pain the wipe off but any mud mask would be.  I like how my skin feels afterwards and I like how you can make as little or as much as you want.</li>
            <li> I do love this healing clay but i would recommend it mostly for people with oily to combination skin because it has a great drying effect. That or use in combination with a good moisturizer. It really gives me a clean feeling after use. And i feel it helps out my skin a lot. however it does leave my skin red. almost like wind burn for 30 minutes. So if you use this product with the recommended directions make sure your not going out after! i personally have a vary pail complexion so it leaves my skin bright red. I love the quantity it comes in. I have barely put a dent into my supple. it will probably last over a year. Overall i would recommend this product, but not to anyone will DRY skin.</li>
            <li> I love this, I mix it with some other ingredients to give my skin more \\&quot;food\\&quot; and my skin feel baby soft after, the black head are all clean. Check it out at my blog, I will post picture to follow up after 1 more week of using. Here are the link&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I have known about this product but mainly as a facial for the past 10 years. Over the past week I learned that it can be used on the hair but really internally which is a miracle to me in what I am researching. Do your own google searches and you will be amazed at the significant weight loss people have been experiencing, cures it has provided for things deemed &#x27;incurable&#x27;, etc. What got me tonight was I decided to a foot soak and I was blown away. I filled up a foot bath with warm water and added 1/2 cup of clay and soaked for about 30 minutes...when done I went to dry my feet and noticed that my foot felt soft yet when I rubbed my hand on my foot alllllllll of this dry skin just started literally falling off! I coudlnt&#x27; believe what I was feeling nor seeing. My foot felt brand new. So in essence without having to scrub but instead just barely rubbing my foot all the dead skin came off. I followed up by putting on some whipped shea butter and socks and feel great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also been taking bentonite internally (the liquid form brand called \\&quot;great plains\\&quot;) and my energy is up but I also sleep like a babyyyyyyyy!!!! This has been only 2 days of me adding an ounce to apple juice or a smoothie. All worth a try...as a facial mask I do that twice a week with peppermint and lavendar drops, apple cider vinegar, honey, water, and vit e! My face has a natural glow every time I do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grab a jar and quick...super inexpensive way to make a miracle happen in your life! Thanks again Amazon for making healthy living easy and affordable!</li>
            <li> I wanted a mask that would help clean my enlarged pores. I tried the Queen Helene Mint mask. It worked OK. I wanted something better...and this product is far superior. I mixed it with the apple cider vinegar, put it on and let it dry. WOW!! You really can feel it working. I picked off the bulk of the clay before jumping in the shower and rinsing off. My skin never felt better, but when I looked in the mirror...I have to say I was shocked at how well it worked. My skin was pink for about 30 minutes after the shower, and I waited before I attempted to apply my make up, so figure in some extra time if you are on a schedule. This product was worth taking the time to write a review..it really is that good. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!! Thanks Amazon for great products I never see in stores!!</li>
            <li> definitely felt it pull the skin. I&#x27;ve used it once so far and it felt great. easy to mix and use</li>
            <li> I give this mask 5 stars because it works. I have mild adult acne breakouts from time to time and I was having one yesterday. I put the mask on right away and afterwards seen my blemishes heal and practically vanish. I will note that the directions says to put a layer on 1/4 of an inch thick for best results I did that the first time and did not get the full effect of the mask. I applied a thinner layer this time and got excellent results. I guess it all depends on your skin type.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much!! I found it accidental on Aamazon and I freaking love it!! the positive reviews are right. this stuff rocks</li>
            <li> it works great and i will be ordering more  this makes your skin feel great i will never be without it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with this clay. I had acne problem and tried many different products but none seem to work cuz the acne doesn&#x27;t go away. I always have these red bumps on my face and they are really annoying and after trying this indian clay, the red bumps seem to get much better and i can see my skin improved. Well worth the money, will buy the 2 pound next time.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this clay, based on previous reviews. I steam my face before and after and use the product with ACV. I have to leave it on at least 20 minutes before I feel the \\&quot;pulsating\\&quot; action. I was hoping it would help with my whiteheads, but it may only work for blackheads? However, will continue using to see what happens.</li>
            <li> expensive department store brands cannot beat this one.  As it says in the description, skin may appear a bit red after it&#x27;s rinsed off...no big deal.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> For the record, I have very oily skin, and after reading all the 5 star reviews I figured this product had to do SOMETHING for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It did not; It honestly did nothing at all for/against my skin.&lt;br /&gt;If anything it did feel a little bit cleaner after use, but that is nothing to warrant another purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it until I finished the product and I still saw no difference, luckily it&#x27;s pretty cheap though so no harm done.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it will work wonders for others, but it honestly did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> This was good the first time I used because I used for less then 10 min. The second time, I left the mask on for 10 to 15 minutes and when I removed it my face looked like I had gone through a \\&quot;peeling\\&quot; session I mean red and burning! There should be a warning for sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> Everybody should buy it, and do a facial mask every week. It will suck oil and dirt away from your pores. It will give you some redness on your skin, but that will disappear in half an hour as the instruction says. Also some vinegar smell, which will dissipate after a good night sleep.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I loooove this stuff! It gives amazing results and even made by pores smaller!!! I also use it on my hair and it made it so incredibly soft!</li>
            <li> I am in my 30&#x27;s with relatively oily skin that is prone to hormonal breakouts which are very difficult to control b/c they are cystic and deep. THIS CLAY helps draw any kind of issue my skin experiences to the surface and gets rid of it! It feels very strange on the face...as it dries you can feel the tightening and you know it&#x27;s sucking up all the nasties of the week.&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I use the clay as a weekly treatment and even though the directions instruct mixing with water or apple cider vinegar, I prefer to use Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel. Once I rinse, I make a concoction of jojoba oil spiked with lavender essential oil to calm it down and this ritual has helped clear up and beautify my complexion. People I work with have even asked which local spa I go to for peels! HAHA I GOT EM ALL FOOLED!</li>
            <li> My skin felt so much cleaner and looked so much better after just one use! This will totally be included in my regime from now on.</li>
            <li> It is as advertise and came quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on stellar reviews and it worked pretty well for a while.  Does not clear blackheads as well as others and it&#x27;s messy because it&#x27;s not premixed.  Probably biggest advantage is it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> Thus stuff is crazy. It does pull your face skin back, and being all natural, it is a good alternative to some chemical masks. However, is it very hard to remove after you use it. This comes in part from the fact that you do not want to wash it down the sink, which is a definite negative when compared to chemical masks, which you can wash off. Also, it sticks to the skin and only comes off in small flakes, so I feel like I am scratching my face off over the trash can to remove. Also, it is very hard to mix to a smoothe paste, and on the last time that I used it I resorted to a hand mixer, thinking that I might be missing something by mixing wrong. After 3 uses I see no improvement in complexion or uniform color, but I still can see the value in a natural product that is an alternative to harsher products for people with sensitive skin. I will probably never use the rest of it, but I give it 3 stars for novelty.</li>
            <li> I have ben using this for only 2wks and so far so good i have recieved compliments already from my family and friends...i love the intense tightening when the mask dries...mix with brags apple cider vinegar  for the best results...i had acne and acne scars. My acne is almost completely gone but my scars are also getting lighter! 2wksss...Wow Love It!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been having constant acne on my chin area. Tried everything and nothing seemed to work.&lt;br /&gt;My fiance found this clay mask and we love it!&lt;br /&gt;It makes your face feel nice and clean. Cleans out your pores, treats acne and helps with wrinckles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Def recommend! :)</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it will do. Got rid of all the blackheads on my nose on first use. Delivery was quick too.</li>
            <li> I have used this product twice already and I have seen a difference. I work on a food line so my pores get dirty and this helps with just that. I mix it with water and it&#x27;s totally fine .. I have sensitive skin so I only leave it on for the maximum 15 minutes and rinse off. I wipe most of it off first with a paper towel so there are no chunks of clay going down my sink than I rinse with warm, than cold water to close my pores. After I pat my face dry I put aloe vera LOTION on my face as a moisturizer and go to bed. Next morning my skin still feels flawless. I&#x27;m only going to use twice a week so I don&#x27;t over due it. But I def love this product.</li>
            <li> Very nice but make my skin dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is snake oil.  Any real benefits you&#x27;re getting from this are probably the placebo effect working its magic.  However, it does feel nice, and is good for a spa day with the girls (or guys, as the case may be) every now and then.  I used it once a week for 6 weeks and I never once felt my face &amp;#34;pulsate&amp;#34;.  Neither did I see my complexion improve.  I did, however, spend many long minutes in the shower trying to get the dried stuff out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent skin care! I am an african-american female and this works great on my skin. You can literally feel it pulsate. I highly reccomend this and the price is excellent. This can literally last you an entire year. I use this ( &amp; you should) once a week and you only need a little bit. I let mines sit for 20-25 minutes wash it off, and your skin is instantly smooth. This cleared up my acne and pimples and now I have beautiful skin.!</li>
            <li> I just tried this mask for the first time. Kept it on for about 20-25 minutes. When it dried, my skin got REALLY tight, but it didn&#x27;t hurt at all. Taking it off with warm water was very easy...I read reviews of people saying they had to &amp;#34;peel it off because it wouldn&#x27;t come off&amp;#34; and I can&#x27;t understand why....it literally took about 1 minute. I&#x27;ve had it off for about 10 minutes now, and my skin still feels tight and smooth. I cant wait to see more results overtime...for $9, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this stuff!</li>
            <li> i use it once not bad so far</li>
            <li> It tingles. But its good 😋  my face is very smooth after my first use. Brighter too😊</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually sort of astonished at how great this product is. I&#x27;ve had it for only two weeks and I haven&#x27;t even used it every night, but even using it only maybe three days a week, it has cleared up acne that&#x27;s been stubborn for months. The long and cold New England winters drive my sensitive skin crazy--it gets super dry, eczema, rashes, the worst. I&#x27;ve tried every over the counter treatment there is, and I&#x27;ve balked at trying Proactiv or any other really strong product because I don&#x27;t really want to put that on my face. Fed up after an enormous breakout that had me running to Sephora, I tried this out with apple cider vinegar. After about six tries, it hasn&#x27;t totally cleared up my face, but it&#x27;s gotten further than anything else! Best of all, when I felt an emerging acne cyst--which can develop and last for MONTHS--I put the mask on it a few nights in a row in desperation, and it actually stopped and reversed the progress of the cyst! That made me a convert. I&#x27;m definitely going to keep using this stuff and I look forward to what another 6 or 12 applications will do.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I have generally sensitive skin. I mixed the clay with raw apple cider vinegar and left it on for about 15 minutes. I could feel my face pulsate and begin to stretch. My skin felt amazing and so refreshed after I washed it off. Can&#x27;t wait to do it again next week.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know it was in powder form it&#x27;s such a mess and it&#x27;s hard to wash of my hands!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now and I can say my skin looks amazing!My pores are soo much smaller!I will cleanse first then use a toner then I will mix this mask with vinegar and then apply it to my face for 15 minutes. As the mask starts drying I can feel it pulling on my skin.Its not too painful thoe.It&#x27;s definatley worth it!</li>
            <li> First time user.... Went through all the reviews and found them very help full. I applied with apple cidar vinager and used a plastic bowl and spoon. I let it dry for 35 mint&#x27;s. Used a big bowl with warm water and a wash cloth to take off. My face was so smooth and shiny not oily shiny. Also I like to use organic coconut oil for my face.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to make too much of you&#x27;re new to this stuff. Makes a thick paste. Good product.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. My pores are literally falling off my face!!! I had pretty bad blackheads on both of my cheeks and the clay has just about cleared them completely. Couldnt be happier that i started using. Pretty sure im a lifer</li>
            <li> Great  product long lasting</li>
            <li> Great for oily skin, I use it with apple cider vinegar.  Really brings the blood flow  to your face and makes you glow for the next several hours (after the extreme redness wears off after 20mins).</li>
            <li> I received today and applied it. First of all it doesn&#x27;t have a smell. I can&#x27;t do other home remedy face masks because of the smell. This Indian Clay doesn&#x27;t smell and its easy to apply and take it off. After I applied I felt the tingling and pulling and everything. After I took it off my face was clear, toned, smooth and soft. The pores and blackheads on my nose were gone. I think I will apply this every week to keep my skin blackhead free :)</li>
            <li> AMAZING! Best mask I&#x27;ve ever used! Really improved skin w/ repeated use!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I got this from a girlfriend who purchased off my wish list saying she couldn&#x27;t believe she was getting this for me and how lame my wish list was.  LOL  jokes on her because after a month of using this once a week my face is so clean and healthy looking.  Never thought I would like this as much as I do.&lt;br /&gt;At first I didn&#x27;t get the whole face pulsating thing, just thought as the mask dried it got tighter that was all, but the more I do it I can see where they get the pulsating part.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is a bit on the sensitive side so as for the redness, that does happen but as stated in the instructions it goes away in approx. 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase!!</li>
            <li> I used it only once and used a mix of both water and vinegar worked beautifully.</li>
            <li> I chose this mask due to the reviews and low price, felt it the best pick.  I recieved it in the mail today as and of course tried it right away.  I mixed the clay with apple cider vinegar and waited 15 mins.  Within that time I could actually feel my face tighten as the clay dried and started feeling a tingle after about 10 mins.  Best facial ever!!! After washing my face clean, I can actually feel the difference in my skin; it  feels soft, clean and renewed.  I PROMISE if you try this facial you will not regret it!  Im a guaranteed customer from now own, infact I might go ahead and stock up:)</li>
            <li> This product is like a tightening massage for the face.  I have large facial pores, this product shrink them to nothing in 2 facials.  I use it twice a week (Sunday &amp; Thursday).  It&#x27;s amazing and worth the funds spend.  I wanna try it on my stomach and see if become a tummy tuck in a jar!</li>
            <li> Removes all buildup! Easy to use, noticeably brighter skin. My coworkers love it so much they ask me to buy them some. Seller was easy to work with and provided fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I just got my mask today and just removed it. I&#x27;m in love so far! While the mask was on I felt the pulsing in my skin and tightening. When I removed it my face was pink, but no pores were visible and a few pimples were ready to be popped. I have cystic pimples, black head, LARGE pores and tiny hormonal pimples. The large pores are on my chin cheeks and nose. I usually get cystic pimples on my temples, hairline, chin, or side of my nose. Blackheads pop up on random areas of my face but mostly my chin. The tiny pimples are pretty much everywhere on my face. I&#x27;m 22 years old and I&#x27;m very self conscious about the acne and large pores. I&#x27;ve tried everything known to man on my face to rid the pimples and nothing has worked consistently. I also have a very uneven skin tone and an oily face. I use bare minerals makeup again and it helps a bit. I&#x27;ve been wanting to buy this for quite sometime because of the great reviews but was hesitant, finally just went ahead with it and I&#x27;m so happy so far. I will use this everyday for a week and update my review.</li>
            <li> Wow - this stuff is great!  I use it with raw unrefined apple cider vinegar with &amp;#34;the mother&amp;#34;.  My skin has improved after just a week!  I leave it on about 20 minutes (enough time to dry).  It does pulsate and burn just a tad (as advertised), but I know that means it is working!  My skin is red for about 30 minutes after, but not a big deal because it doesn&#x27;t hurt or look unusual.  I&#x27;m going to be using this for a long, long time!</li>
            <li> Seriously this stuff does not do anything, I used it a few times and threw it in the garbage. I bought it based on all the five star reviews and because people were swearing it helped with acne. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I mixed it with apple cider vinegar the first time I used it and noticed tighter skin and a big reduction in blackheads!  It does deep clean and my skin is thankful for it.  Immediately after, I applied a facial moisturizer and my skin has never looked so good.  Cheap and effective, just how I like it!</li>
            <li> I use this once weekly, I have stubborn blackheads on my nose and it helps loosen them. My face is not completely clear yet but I&#x27;ve noticed a drastic improvement because of this product. I do recommend applying a face moisturizer after, your skin can feel a bit dry. Way worth the $11!</li>
            <li> This is an awful product,  period.&lt;br /&gt;My skin started breaking our like a teenager.&lt;br /&gt;This Clay Is Rubbish!</li>
            <li> My skin feels great after using this, and brighter.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and decided to use it for the first time this weekend. I didn&#x27;t have any of the apple cider vinegar so I just used it with water. It made a lovely, thick paste which I then applied to my face. Within two minutes it had already dried so I washed it off immediately with cool water rather than keeping it on any longer. As soon as I began washing the mask off my skin was burning and I was left with a bright red, blistered face. I am in agony and look absolutely disgusting. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> I love it - works really good</li>
            <li> I cannot figure this stuff out. The first time I used it, it was so burny and painful I panicked and took it off. I think my skin is too sensitive for this. It has to be great or it wouldn&#x27;t have such a large following. I have only tried with vinegar maybe I&#x27;ll try with water and see if that is less Intense. Otherwise will have to stop using because it makes my skin look bumpy and inflamed.</li>
            <li> As I started using it, you can really tell that it opens up your pores and you feel refreshed after washing it off. I can&#x27;t give exact answers solely because I just started using it, but by reading the reviews I believe it is what people say it is. Will comment again just to keep other potential buyers updated.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  I use this as a mask 1x a week and my blackheads shrink more and more each time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the ease and effectiveness of this product. It has a very earthy feel and smell. My skin was glowing after one use. Excellent price as well!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, works awesome on my troubled skin</li>
            <li> I love this mask. It is tingly but not uncomfortable. My skin feels very smooth after I wash it off my face. I am 21 and still have pretty bad acne along the hollows of my cheeks and along my forehead. I try to do a mask once a week and it has definitely helped reduce my breakouts.</li>
            <li> Wow I wish I had known about this sooner. It has helped my face so much. My skin looks so much better and the blackheads that I have had for years are going away!! I gave some to my daughter to try and I can&#x27;t wait to see the improvement in her acne.</li>
            <li> Okay this stuff gave me the worst allergic reaction. 2 days later and my entire face is STILL itching.</li>
            <li> okay liked this product but didn&#x27;t know I had to mix it myself. even still this will last me forever. unless im mixing wrong. you don&#x27;t think its going to harden then all of a sudden it reall hardens. afterwards your skin feels so clean and amazing</li>
            <li> Absolutely spa-grade quality facial mask. Do not chip off dried pieces, remove with warm water (as the instructions say)</li>
            <li> So I coo&#x27;d over all these reviews on here for about 2 months trying to decide if I wanted to buy mud for my face and if it was actually legit. I told my husband about it and somehow convinced him into doing the first application with me. I put my first application on waayy too thick and after pacing in front of a mirror for like 45 min I decided to take it off out of annoyance because only half of it seemed sort of dry. The bottle lies, you don&#x27;t need much at all. Honestly, about a tablespoon is enough for your face and I use red wine vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second application was thinner and I sat still it got hard and harder and basically started to kinda pull (never really felt a pulsating)...it became painful so I took it off, which was even more painful if you do not use enough water. My suggestion either hop in the shower or re-wet the entire mask to come off easy or it will hurt your face. Mine looks like it&#x27;s sunburnt for like 3 hours afterwards...but it also looks pretty clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m gonna lay it on the line about the whole acne thing, I&#x27;m 30 yrs old I didn&#x27;t even get acne till I as an adult. I do have enlarged pores around my nose, and up in my T zone...around my chin I have some white heads that are always under the skin...it&#x27;s combo always. Aside from feeling really clean after the mask, I don&#x27;t see any change after regarding my acne. I do see minimal change regarding smile lines but it seems temporary. This isn&#x27;t a magical product but it seems helpful, I wonder if it&#x27;s worth the mess and trouble though. I&#x27;ll keep it up cause I&#x27;m a believer at heart and it can&#x27;t hurt I guess, I mean I have a whole bottle of dirt lol</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It lasts forever too. Whenever I feel a pimple coming on I either apply this to my entire face or as a spot treatment and the next day the pimple is either significantly decreased or gone completely. Will repurchase, but it&#x27;ll probably take me forever to get through one tub.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my skin when using this product, good or bad. It&#x27;s fun to mix up and use but wow is it uncomfortable when it starts to dry. I started doing spot treaemts with this instead of full facials because of how uncomfortable it was when your whole face began to dry. It also leaves my face bright red for an hour or two after washing it off. It&#x27;s hard to get a good consistency as well. I can&#x27;t escape clumps when mixing.</li>
            <li> Mixed equal parts of ACV and clay, applied to my face and watched TV. I love the fact that this is natural and it really makes  your skin feel so smooth once you&#x27;ve washed it off. I wet several washcloths in warm water and apply to my face to soften the mask. After the mud softens you can easily clean with the damp washcloths. I then rinse my face over the sink.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for everyone who would like a natural way of deep cleaning your skin.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin and large pores on my face. After seeing the reviews, I ordered this clay hoping to find my answer.  I have tried it once, I did not have raw AC vinegar so I mixed it with water. It was easy to apply and felt good after putting on.  Around the 20 min mark, I could definitely feel my face start pulsating.  When I rinsed, I let it run down the sink but it very small pieces, not large chunks, and it took me FOREVER to get off, felt like it took as long as I let it sit on my face!  When I had it all off, I noticed the pores on my face appeared much smaller than before, and my face definitely felt a ton cleaner.  My face was a little red after but it went away around the hour later mark.  However, after about 1.5 hours after I had rinsed it off, my pores appeared the same size as before I even applied it, which disappointed.  I will use this a few more times &amp; update after.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t give me any results to my skin. It didn&#x27;t tighten/shrink my pores or get rid of my blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;If some results, it gave me redness and dryness to my face. After I washed it off, there was two red rings around my eyes because it was so dry. It also smells a little funny once you mix it with water. You can&#x27;t really smell it when its a powder, but with water it smells like dirt (just slightly).</li>
            <li> This clay is great! It helps keep my skin tight and my pores clean. Be careful not to let it stay on your face for to long as it will burn a little afterwards. All in all a great product; and get this..... its cheap!</li>
            <li> The ONLY bad thing I have to say about this is it is clumpy when you mix with water to make a mask.  Use ACV like the directions say and no problems.  My kids love it in their bath and it makes excellent toothpaste per Wellness Mama&#x27;s recipe.</li>
            <li> Awesome face mask! Mix 1tsp i with 2 capsules of activated charcoal and 1 1/2 tsp of apple cider vinegar and aloe vera mix with a drop of tea tree oil. It&#x27;s the best thing my face has ever felt! Pulls all the nasty out. I have sensitive/dry skin and doesn&#x27;t freak my face out at all. Will repurchase and have recommended to several friends.</li>
            <li> just because it has lots of badtass good ratings already, why should i drop it</li>
            <li> I would have definitely put a five star rating because the clay was magic on reducing the size and redness of the pimples on my chest but the worst part of using this clay is taking it off. It takes soooooo long and so much water to get it off. but I guess it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> Works wonders for your skin!!</li>
            <li> I love it so much&lt;br /&gt;It makes my face look nice every time i use it</li>
            <li> I struggle with the occasional blemish here and there but the past few months my skin suffered from poor diet and stress. I tried almost everything to combat this sudden increase in acne. I had to go back to the basics. Nothing worked like using this product every other night, then backing off to twice a week. It really pulled out all the junk in my pores. Eventually I&#x27;ll be back down to once weekly but this mask has worked wonders to clear what many other products couldn&#x27;t. Mix with a little apple cider vinegar, apply to face/skin and let dry. Rinse and smile!</li>
            <li> Great product and has so many uses I am just learning about all the benefits of clay but would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. DON&#x27;T USE WATER. They say you can, but it really only works if you use the apple cider vinegar. It&#x27;s super cheap at stores. For the first month it didn&#x27;t really do a whole lot but now I only use it once a week and I rarely breakout. I don&#x27;t even use any other face products anymore. Just that once a week clay mask :)</li>
            <li> It has many uses,&lt;br /&gt;Even men can use it!&lt;br /&gt;It works best when mixed with high quality vinager.&lt;br /&gt;Just read the label &amp; it will get you going in the right direction.</li>
            <li> My review may not come up as a verified purchase but I did order this on amazon a few years ago. Just now getting around to reviewing because I just recently started using it and the one I put based is no longer available so it would be a waste to leave a review on that link.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways like I said I bought this back in 2013 with the intention is using it to help my skin. I suffer from a skin condition called HS (won&#x27;t get into details but I sure have terrible skin) I get a lot of scars which end up accumulating black heads and it just looks terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I completely forgot I ordered this and pulled it out last month, I mixed it with Apple sider vineager as instructed and apply it with a hair coloring mixing brush in a plastic bowl. I apply it think but not quite 1/4 inch thick but it is plenty! It takes a bit to dry and once it does hopefully your in the bathroom already because if you move it crumbles and moves off making a huge mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this on my face, neck , arm puts, breasts, thighs and I am happy with the product. I feel very clean, my skin is fresh and the next day my complection is so much better. I have used it 3-4 times in about 6 weeks but I&#x27;m going to try and do it once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have more than 3/4 of my jar with the uses. (i bought the big one)</li>
            <li> exactly what I expected yay thank you</li>
            <li> great for home face mask.</li>
            <li> Really like this stuff but my experiments with raw Clay is a new thing. Happy to find a good way to use ACV in a mask with it. This clay has a &amp;#34;rubber&amp;#34; smell that I am not fond of but I don&#x27;t know enough about clays to know if that is normal or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Be careful using this around your eyebrows and hairline. It is REALLY hard to get out of your eyebrows and hairline. I&#x27;ve had it pull my eyebrows out, even when being gentle while removing it with warm water.</li>
            <li> This is so worth every penny. My daughter and i both use it. My skin is looks and feels amazing after. I mix mine with Braggs apple cider vinegar. My daughter prefers to mix with water</li>
            <li> Love this mask make my face feel really good well be buying this again.  Give it a try you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this product but it takes a lot of time to prepare. You can&#x27;t just wash it off your face and down the drain because it will seriously clog your drain so I need to get a large bowl and put it in the sink to rinse. Also it doesn&#x27;t mix smoothly and is clumpy when I put it on my face. Other than that, great product.</li>
            <li> Although there are many positive reviews about this one but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t fit my oily skin at all!! It&#x27;s even gave me acne! I hate it!</li>
            <li> Connect the product was on time and deal with the seller very sophisticated product is worth the experience&lt;br /&gt;Worth 5 stars</li>
            <li> I am really really really pleased!! I just received it today and already used it. I am beyond amazed in the results.  I noticed my pores smaller immediately.  I used water instead of vinegar.  the tingling sensation feel good, relaxing to me. I will definitely be recommending and be a long time user of this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! Sucks LITERALLY everything out of your pores, and you will feel your face pulsing while it is drying, because it is very intense. It&#x27;s hard to wash off, but that is only a minor qualm. I would not recommend doing before a night out because your face is a bit red after. Do it before bed and let your face breathe overnight. You&#x27;ll wake up looking sexy as hell!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a photographer who likes his models to use it before a photoshoot to minimize pores, blemishes, etc. before a shoot, since digital photography shows every imperfection!  I&#x27;d already starting drinking a tablespoon of Bragg&#x27;s Apple Cider Vinegar every morning for its health benefits, so I just added it to the clay exactly as in the directions.  I&#x27;ve been using it once a week for about a month now, and I will never stop using this product even if I have to fly from Pennsylvania to California to pick it up myself!  I&#x27;m a 45 year old female, and for the first time in years, I can easily walk out the door without any makeup on, feeling totally confident.  I like to use this prior to the weekend&#x27;s activities, or right before I go to an audition or shoot, to take years off and give my skin a healthy, glowing look.  My skin feels velvety soft too!  Lots of my younger friends are spending thousands of $$$ at their dermatologist&#x27;s office for peels, laser treatments, injections, etc...and they think I am too.  ;)</li>
            <li> I love love love love love this stuff. It does wonders for my face. My skin is prone to breakout and this stuff does not break out my skin and clears up breakouts quickly.</li>
            <li> After letting this dry completely, it was pretty painful to get off my face, even when it was wet and I did get a little bit of red bumps on the thinner layers of my skin like under my eyes and a little bit down my neck. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all either. It took a VERY long time to wash all of the clay off my face when I did get it wet. The only thing it did help with was getting rid of blackheads, so I suggest to only put it on areas that you have blackheads on, not your entire face like I did. And make sure to have a very good moisturizer after because it really dries up your skin. I would also avoid wearing makeup for the next couple of days because it may irritate/ make your skin look flaky. All in all though, it was the best blackhead remover I&#x27;ve tried yet. P.S only use water when you mix it, the vinegar will be too harsh on your skin.</li>
            <li> This might turn out to be a hefty review, so brace yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are you braced?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, let&#x27;s go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I wanna say I&#x27;m a high school senior typing this on my mom&#x27;s account because rules are for squares and I&#x27;m a triangle.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I&#x27;ve had troublesome pimples and blackheads and those massive geysers embedded in my skin for as long as I could remember. Sure, it was probably just a few years, but when you&#x27;re one of the only teens with pizza-face in both your high schools, it seems like an eternity or two. And, yeah, I have the classic &#x27;I&#x27;ve tried everything&#x27; story, I had a dermatologist, the whole nine yards. So I feel a lot of your guys&#x27; pain. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I guess I should start off with my experience in making this mass of mud.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll need more dirt than you think. That&#x27;s cuz the vinegar dissolves some and leaves you with a dry, unmixed turd, so you have to keep adding and adjusting til the consistency&#x27;s right. I went with a more whipped texture, like thick cool whip. :) According to some other reviews [ and believe me i read a novel&#x27;s worth before i broke out my ten bucks ], you aren&#x27;t supposed to mix with metal because it&#x27;ll react with the vinegar. Well, I&#x27;ve had my fair share of school projects and I just took an old plastic paintbrush - you know, the ones you get for a dollar in an unnamed packaging - and used the end to mix because the bristles are held by this weird metal bracelet. It was kind of hard, since the end is just shy of the circumference of an ant&#x27;s head, but it got the job done. When it was thoroughly mixed, I just used the brush end to slather it onto my face. A little cold, but it was fun. :) To wash - mind you, I used some cheap plastic bowl that probably held chicken fried rice at some point - I just rinsed the bristles and bowl as well as I could, using my fingers to break up stubborn chunks. I used warm water and swished my hand in the sink to make sure it was all more or less dissolved, then ran the tap a little longer to ensure no clay chunks were latching themselves in my s-pipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say, the thinner you paint your layer, the quicker it dries. And I mean THE QUICKER IT DRIES. Like, it literally started drying on my cheek as I moved to my nose, haha. Simple fix, just paint some more on until your whole face is covered in a decent layer and there are few dry patches [ normally at the edges ].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can definitely vouch for the pulsating effects, as this felt like it was sucking the crud straight out of my pores. My face felt a little warm, but I&#x27;m sure I can attribute that to the blood vessels and circulation being enhanced or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I should mention I dolled my little brother up [ don&#x27;t worry, he&#x27;s got teen acne, too ] in green so we could both suffer for beauty. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking it off wasn&#x27;t too hard. What I did was soak a wash cloth and press it against my face until the mask was all wet again, then I used the same wash cloth to gently buff the clay off. It dissolved more easily that way and the whole process took about five minutes. I have one of those mini mesh strainer thingies in my sink, so I could see any clumps that weren&#x27;t dissolved, but I surprisingly didn&#x27;t have that problem! Woo, score for me. :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some redness after it was all washed off - mind you, I&#x27;m by no means fair-skinned - but unlike some of the other reviewers mine was gone when I finished gawking and ogling and touching the soft skin left behind by the mask and actually dried my face. You might want to pat your face dry as opposed to rubbing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this mask is super and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it. :)lved, then ran the tap a little longer to ensure no clay chunks were latching themselves in my s-pipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say, the thinner you paint your layer, the quicker it dries.

            <li> This works wonders! Reduces the pimple size and redness greatly by the next day. It dries your skin out so have moisturizer ready! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> First off, this is going to take some time. It is messy in terms of cleaning up after using it and getting it off your face. I have been using disposable paper towels that are wet to get it off because I do not want it to go down the sink &#x3D; clogged drain. (It&#x27;s clay people)&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is a one ingredient product w/o all the added junk that the stores sell. I used mine with Apple Cider Vinegar. I have acne prone, sensitive, oily skin. I have noticed that if I have any possible acne, this mask usually helps to bring it to the surface. So, you might have some bad breakouts after the first few masks, since it brings all that gunk to the surface. I think that this has helped my acne, I do not think that I am breaking out quite as much, and if I have acne, this helps to heal it faster.&lt;br /&gt;This mask does pull really hard on your skin, so I strongly advise not to put it anywhere near your eyes. It literally pulled the skin and made me look like a basset hound one time. My blackheads on my nose have lessened but are not completely gone, so do not get the impression that it will just suck them all out. It helps but does not get rid of them 100%. W/ shipping I paid about $17 for the smaller jar. My sister and I are sharing it, and by looking at it, it will last a long time, so definitely worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall-good product; just messy and hard to get off.</li>
            <li> I know that this product works for a lot of people based on the reviews but I have sensitive skin and the clay plus apple cider vinegar made me break out pretty bad.  I normally do not have acne but for some reason this pulled every blackhead and pimple out of my chin/lower cheek area and now I have these tiny bumps plus actually acne.  In addition, my face got really red after doing this which freaked me out a lot so please be prepared for that.  My final input is that this product is too much hassle for me.  I hate the mixing and the cleaning and I don&#x27;t want to clog my drains.  I wish this would be easier and worked for me because I do need something that will clean my skin minus the side effects.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very annoying to clean off after applying on the face&lt;br /&gt;but it&#x27;s very refreshing and tightening&lt;br /&gt;you need to handle the amount by yourselves</li>
            <li> I use this with Bragg ACV as a mask to dry up cystic and it WORKS GREAT!!!! better than anything topical you can try. I will make a liquid paste and apply to whole face or just the acne spots(the spots apply several times per day at first), let dry for 35 mins and rub of with dry washcloth, or soak of sore areas with wet cool wash cloth. Fantastic results! This clay used with apple cider vinegar yields fantastic results!! I have used this for years, and always get great results with this combo!</li>
            <li> i have bad acne on my chin only.  The rest of my face seems to be OK.  I used this mask for 3 days in a row and the acne isn&#x27;t really improving.  The rest of my face feels soft and nice.  Do you know if you see worse results before it gets better?  Also, is it bad that I used this for 3 days in a row or should I only be using it twice a week to see better results?  If someone can comment back I&#x27;d appreciate it.  Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> This clay is very good quality. The only thing I could find to complain about is that sometimes it is hard to mix without getting lumps. It does exactly what it says it will do, though. I used it to pull impurities out of the skin on my arms, and it left my skin soft and smooth. I also used it as a facial and was pleased with the results. Tried using it to condition my hair, but I didn&#x27;t really see much difference, since I have very soft hair anyway. I took it internally without a bad reaction. All-in-all, I will continue to use this brand in the future.</li>
            <li> There are over 1K review on this product so I&#x27;m not sure if anyone is going to read this one, but for a face mask &amp; it&#x27;s price, this is great! My pores are getting smaller &amp; my face is clear of any pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not an overnight miracle &amp; I&#x27;ve been using it for the past month now. At first, my face broke out, but it cleared up in a few days. I&#x27;ve used many mud masks over the years &amp; having my face pulse is pretty normal to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pour just a tad of apple cider vinegar in a plastic tupperwear bowl &amp; add small amounts of the clay &amp; mix with a plastic spoon until I get a smooth (not too runny!) foamy consistency. Then I smear it all over my face. I like to put mine on thick. The thicker it is, the longer it will take - up to 30 min. If you put it on thick, it will start to hurt your skin due to it tightening to be careful. Then I take a paper towel &amp; run it under hot water (I like my water hot) &amp; then just rub it off my face. My face will be red &amp; craving moisture so then I&#x27;ll put some anti-aging cream on (did you know you start to age at 14?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never had \\&quot;trouble\\&quot; skin except large pores &amp; they&#x27;re starting to get smaller - but pores will always be there. They&#x27;re hereditary. This isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; product for me like some of the reviews I have read, but it&#x27;s a great cheap mud mask &amp; I bet you get the same results using this as if you were to go to a spa. I&#x27;ve read that some people put in tea tree oil or they use this for their feet. I have yet to do that. I even read that some people EAT it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a cool product that I&#x27;ll probably be using for the next few years.</li>
            <li> This mask is amazing!!  I took the time to read all the review bf I purchased (negative and positive).  First of all, I am a real person who has VERY sensitive acne prone skin; I am female, 40, have oily skin and large pores.  I bought the mask and the vinegar and used per instruction and have used this mask for almost 2 months.  I have found that if I use it regularly (for me that&#x27;s at least 2x week) it helps keep my acne under control which is a miracle to me.  My pores have not decreased but I&#x27;m still very happy; I love the tight pulling while the mask is on too.  I disagree with the advice to put it on thickly though.  I tried that at first and it took FOREVER to dry; the next times I simply put on a layer that was not stingy but not thick and it worked just the same without the long dry time.  I also love that my face isn&#x27;t dry after I use it - I&#x27;ve never used a mask that didn&#x27;t leave my face dry.  I highly recommend this mask - a big thank you to the person who tipped me off that I could buy it at Whole Foods!  I am recommending this product to everyone!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this stuff when I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend and I use this once a week or so.  It doesn&#x27;t bring up any acne for me on my skin.  I love this clay.  I mix equal parts with clay and water in a ziploc bag, apply, wait 20 minutes, and take off with face towelettes, then wash my face with cetaphil.  You can keep the extra mixture in the ziploc bag and put in the refrigerator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE!</li>
            <li> This is perfect! It sucks the gunk right out of your face, and you can really feel it sucking (what an odd feeling)! It takes all the gunk out of my nose pores, and leaves them almost invisible!</li>
            <li> This is a fun product to use. It dries so tight, I can feel it working. Afterwards, my skin feels so soft. It&#x27;s kind of hard to remove when you&#x27;re finished. I usually jump in the shower to wet my face and remove it completely.</li>
            <li> everyone should try this immediately, has done wonders for my skin. However, it says to apply 1/4-1/2 in layer, I find a thin coating is more than enough</li>
            <li> Very nice product I had to buy a few more jars.  This is like a miracle in a jar every time I use this my skin looks amazing and just glows.  I had a few break outs on my face and back.  Put the Aztec Secret healing clay on it my break outs were gone love this product.</li>
            <li> My Wife is making some homemade toothpaste and this is a core ingredient - she is happy with the quality and as a bonus, is pleased she can make a face mask with the remaining clay left over!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this 3 total times. I never noticed my black heads disappearing but will say that my face was glowing after use. After my 3 and final time using this product it broke my face out horribly! I&#x27;m sill unable to recover from this breakout and still have scaring and new acne occurring. I&#x27;ve never had horrible acne but this has done it!</li>
            <li> Good! Especially for the price. I have sensitive skin and this works on me. The one thing bother me is every time I made a mess using it.</li>
            <li> Amazing. Looks small but you get a lot of product!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS MASK! I have been struggling with adult acne and this product is fantastic. It&#x27;s easy to use and while wearing it you can feel the pulsating of the mask working on your skin. My skin feels great after and by morning (I always use once a week before bed) my skin has cleared up a lot; not everything but there is a big difference. When I use it consistently I have noticed a change in the appearance of my pores. I have recommended this to a few people already!</li>
            <li> Wow - I don&#x27;t normally write reviews for things that often, but this stuff is honestly amazing. Cleaned out my pores and removed some pesky blackheads on my nose. It isn&#x27;t the most attractive mask that I&#x27;ve used, but is that really that big of a deal? Lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this stuff. It&#x27;ll change your life.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift and I Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Amazing Product :) Helped My Skin After One Use.</li>
            <li> I love this product! everytime i broke out,after useing the clay the next day my skin was almost clear! i have really sensitive skin so it&#x27;s  hard for me to get good products!!! the first time i tried it i did get scared  because after washing it off my face got super red! BUT  dont freak out it dose go away !!! WORKS GREAT !!! YOU CAN ALSO BUY IT AT  sprouts for around 8$</li>
            <li> holy cow, this stuff is on my face for the first time right now and i see what the whole \\&quot;pulsating\\&quot; thing is about. my whole face feels like it&#x27;s bumpin and grinding to some dubstep, wub wub wubbbbb wubwubbbbbwubwuuuub. it&#x27;s nice but not gonna lie i&#x27;m pretty nervous about it, my face is trapped in some rock hard aztec mud and i&#x27;ve never really been one for new experiences. i&#x27;ll edit when it&#x27;s off to let you know how it goes, but i&#x27;m enjoying it tentatively thus far. about ten minutes to go before i hit the 15 minute mark, and i&#x27;m a little nervous about taking this crap off.. fingers crossed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: alrighty, this stuff is miraculous. Definitely recommend. Not great feeling when it&#x27;s on but afterward your face feels reborn.</li>
            <li> I have acne and this really gives you the deep clean you need. When people tell you it gets tight, it REALLY gets tight!</li>
            <li> I really like this mask. I know that a mask is not going to do miracles like they all advertise but for a good, pampering self-induced spa night, this is a fine choice. It does pulse and feel like it&#x27;s doing something to my skin but I haven&#x27;t noticed a marked difference in my skin tone or texture. I do like it though and will continue to use it to pamper myself. :)</li>
            <li> I never heard of the Aztec brand before but this product really works. I still suffer from break-outs and this product is helping heal that. It is a really cool experience too. You do feel the tightening of your face. Very spa-like!</li>
            <li> Such a great product! I use it a twice a week.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it does, and my skin feels much cleaner afterwards. It&#x27;s not the easiest thing to mix, and I can usually never get the right texture...but it works. Next time I might buy a pre-mixed clay mask. Also, beware, it can get messy.</li>
            <li> If you want to clear everything out of your skin, this will do it.  I have dry skin so I don&#x27;t use vinegar, I use water.  A friend of mine, who suggested this to me, has oily skin, large pores and breaks out a lot, so she uses the vinegar, and it works really well for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do NOT have to use a lot.  I put a very thin layer on my skin and it works just as well.  Actually, better, because when I put it on thick, pieces of it would fall off my face.  A thin layer does the trick, and it stays on your face even after it dries.  Also, the less you use, the less it will clog your drains.  It super tightens your skin, and my pores are noticeably smaller (and I never had large pores, but after using this and noticing the difference it makes, I guess my pores were getting bigger).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your skin will be dry when you are done whether or not you have dry or oily skin, so moisturize after.  Your skin will absorb anything you use very quickly, so I recommend a great moisturizer.  I use [[ASIN:B00BD822BI Bel Essence Anti Aging Treatment - Intensive All Natural Anti-Wrinkle, Facial Lift Skin Care Formula - 1.5oz]] because it is the best all natural anti-aging cream I have found, and it replenishes your skin with vitamins, fatty acids, and omega 3s that your skin needs to be healthy.  I tried other drugstore brand moisturizers and anti-aging creams, and the Bel Essence gives me the best results that last - you don&#x27;t go back to your &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; picture even if you stop for a short time (as if I would).  The combination of completely cleaning your skin with this clay and then a great anti-aging cream is amazing.  You will not believe how soft and smooth your skin is after this facial/cream, and your pores are immediately smaller.  I did this every couple of days to start, to really clean my skin, then 1x or 2x a month.  More is not necessarily better, remember, the clay removes EVERYTHING from your skin - the good and the bad.  So make sure every time you use it, you replace the good to build your skin up.  I found that the absolute best results were to use the clay before you shower at night, then after you get out of the shower, when your skin is warm, use the cream.  It gets absorbed so much better and the results are the best.  I LOVE this clay and the combination of the products has made a huge difference in my skin.  The bonus is that after a couple of months, the fine lines on my face - eyes, forehead, lips are GONE.  Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - the weather is getting a little cooler and drier now, so I don&#x27;t do the mask as often, maybe once a week max, but the anti-aging cream I recommended, Bel Essence is amazing in the cooler and drier weather.  My skin is still moisturized the whole day, and the cold weather used to cause lines to come back no matter what anti-aging product I used, but the bel essence keeps me as line free in the winter as I am in the summer.  Between the mask and the Bel Essence, all those fine lines on my face - GONE.  My skin is tighter, firmer, and smoother.  The mask gets rid of the old skin beautifully, and the Bel Essence builds up the new.  I&#x27;ve lost 5 years at least on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - I&#x27;ve been using this awhile and I have some more tips.  First, I use water, not vinegar.  I do have some acne (my skin breaks out more in the summer), but it&#x27;s not a bad condition and the vinegar irritates my skin.  So if you have normal, dry or just slightly oily skin, I would start out with just water for the mix, and maybe try the vinegar.  Vinegar will dry your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second.  I recommend using this once a week, twice a week at most.  If you have oily skin, it can cause your skin to produce more oil (because you are drying out your skin when you use it). So be careful and judge how frequent use affects your skin.  One of the big reasons I use the Bel Essence cream is because after using the clay, I put oil back into my skin, so I don&#x27;t end up with super dry skin, and also, Idon&#x27;t end up with super oily skin.  Highly recommend the product for use with the clay - and the cream doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.  I was a little hesitant to put oil on my skin, but it has only made my skin better, and it works better than any chemical anti-aging cream I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, even though I use a small amount, I sometimes end up with a little left over.  I mix the clay in a container that I can store in the fridge so I can use it on my next treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using both products for quite some time now, and my skin glows, is soft, line free (thank you Bel Essence), and the clay also helps to minimize pores so my skin is smoother looking.  Since I break out in the summer a bit, I use it twice a week, and it has helped more than anything else to keep my breakouts to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a routine I will be keeping forever and ever.  (Don&#x27;t discontinue your products Indian Clay and Bel Essence!) I get a lot of compliments of how good I look, people I run into always comment on my great skin and especially, how young I look.  For someone who has up and down skin conditions, it is heaven to hear this!don&#x27;t end up with super oily skin.

            <li> Nice stuff, works great for blackheads but doesn&#x27;t do away with them 100%, I&#x27;d say maybe 70% of blackheads gone</li>
            <li> Amazing product!! Your skin feels so smooth after use!!</li>
            <li> I had a terrible acne breakout on my back.  Nothing seemed to help it.  I even put hot pack on several days in a row.  I read the reviews on this and figured I would give it a try since nothing else seemed to be working.  I was a little worried at first because my back was red (as stated in the product).  However, within a short time I noticed the acne had subsided substantially.  Periodically I will get another breakout and I immediately apply this.  I will be ordering this again in the future.  I also use this on my face as I have very large pores.  It really gives a great cleaning of the pores too.  Plus, my face looks really great after this process. I have also tried all kinds of facial masks and this one beats them all without question.</li>
            <li> The main thing about the clay is you can&#x27;t rinse it down the drain for fear of clogging plumbing (warning on label) which means it&#x27;s inconvenient to use.</li>
            <li> Very affective mask. I mix with the apple cider vinegar. I can feel the tightening as the clay dries. It can be a little sloppy if you are in a rush. Take your time and you will be pleased. My skin feels so smooth and clean each time. I can especially tell around my nose where I used to see tiny dark spots of oil trapped under my skin.</li>
            <li> Great facial, mix with ACV.</li>
            <li> I have 51 years and have had no serious issues with my face but thought it would be good to add it this clay to my regimen. It works well giving my face a fresh glow and seem to have reduced the pores on my nose.  It mixes much better with the apple cider vinegar than water and a little goes a long way.  I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt; However what I am most pleased with is how it has peeled off the old dead skin on my legs and clear up the eczema/dry like skin I had for over 10 years.  To see the result you need to be patient because the first time I used it all I saw was dried skin flaked up.  I continued and eventually healthy glowing skin appeared. After using the clay, I moisturize with rosehip, jojoba  or good quality olive oil.  To maintain the look on my skin I needed to do it at least twice a week and I don&#x27;t always remember.  It may be different for others.  It is worth every penny and you can use it everywhere on the body even on scratches- dries up in a jiffy.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS AMAZING! I cannot believe the difference it has made to my skin. I use it about 3 times a week and it has cleared my skin drastically. My blackheads and whiteheads are literally gone.&lt;br /&gt;Ive found that mixing it with organic apple cider vinegar works best for me.&lt;br /&gt;And it really does pulsate as it dries. The only thing I had to get used to was that it pulls your skin so tight as it dries that it&#x27;s a little painful. And it does leave your skin dry afterwards, but nothing moisturizer can&#x27;t fix. The results are amazing. I would recommend this to everyone with problem or even normal skin. And the best part, it&#x27;s dirt cheap! A pound of this stuff last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been living with a gold mine all this time and hadn&#x27;t realized it. I was only using this clay for my face (which works amazingly for acne btw) but I have been doing some studying on some of the additional ways to use this clay. Well to say the least, it was somewhat jaw dropping! Well it can be used for gum Health, to pull the toxins from your gums. It can be used in you bath water to help to pull impurities from you skin. You can add a tsp of it to your drinking water to help improve internal body illnesses. It can be used vaginally to help eliminate vaginal diseases (yeast infections, vaginosis, etc). It can also be used to filler your water.....plus a host of other uses. Please be sure to conduct your own research before use and be sure that it&#x27;s all natural bentonite clay.</li>
            <li> Works great !! Great buy</li>
            <li> PERFECT. Is amazingly working on reducing blemishes and is even helping with some clogged oil seeds! Love this product!</li>
            <li> Generous supply, add it to any facial cleanser and does wonders.  Very Happy!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this product. When you use apple cider vinegar is works 10 times better. However it is powerful. You can feel and clearly see the results. It has cleared up my face so much in the past three months. I&#x27;m so happy to have found such a good find</li>
            <li> This is very good.&lt;br /&gt;thank you.</li>
            <li> Wow, so impressed. My skin looks so much better than it has for years!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have order this product. As I have gotten older my pores have gotten larger. Using the Aztec Healing Clay has made the pores seem much smaller and tighten the skin at my jawline. I use this product faithfully every week. I use it occasionally on my legs I have some circulation problems in my legs and the clay seems to help when I have swollen ankles. I will use this product the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars and I only used it one time this week. I&#x27;ve been breaking out like crazy due to stress and my dr put me on antibiotics which had me incredibly dizzy for a week! So I decided to give this a try and well... It works like a charm. I left it on for about 15 minutes and felt tingling all over my face. It washed out all the blackheads on my nose and cheeks. It brought all of my impurities out to the top of my skin (which I am still treating with Epiduo, which I received after the clay from the dr) and left the rest of my face feeling refreshed. It did leave my cheekbones a bit red, but I&#x27;m sure that was my fault for applying it on a non-acne area. I plan on applying it on again in a few more days after the redness goes away. My face is a bit on the dry side (was extremely oily before mask) but I make sure to keep it really moisturized with a high spf sunblock. I&#x27;ll make sure to leave updated comments once I use it again!</li>
            <li> I got this several months ago and attempted to use it with water multiple times. The texture was terrible to try to apply to my face. Today I tried it for the first time with Apple cider vinegar and WOW. It created this amazing mousse like texture and allowed me to apply it like a pro. Amazing face mask!</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get the magic effects I saw in the reviews, hoverer does not seem like it&#x27;s doing anything for me. I&#x27;ve tried it with water and vinegar, but did not get any results for my acne.</li>
            <li> I expected more of the cleaning effect from this clay... maybe it is just my skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wipe it away or try to pick it away. Get into a hot shower and let the water an steam soften it up.. it will then just run off on its own, use your hands a little if necessary, but only after its softened. If you don&#x27;t do it the way I said, then your face is going to be really red and agitated. Don&#x27;t worry about the mud running down the drain, the mud tends to stick to the tub just enough to the point it doesn&#x27;t flow down. Just turn the water off and wipe it away with a paper towel. That easy.</li>
            <li> Yesterday was the first time using this and loved it! My skin looked so smooth, revitalized, fresh and happy! It also feels sooo relaxing! Lets see how my skin reacts with general usage! I&#x27;m really excited! Thank You!</li>
            <li> So I just did this tonight. It is a messy product. Even when it came and I took it out of the plastic it was dusty. Mixing it was fine. If you put it on too thick it just falls off your face. I used this with apple cider vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should&#x27;ve used a squeegee to get this stuff off ha ha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I got it off my face was super red. I took the advice given here and put on a heavy moisturizer. I drink quite a bit of water regularly so I just kept doing that too. I could see exactly where the mask was due to the red lines. It&#x27;s about an hour later now and it&#x27;s looking less and less irritated. Also, there seem to be no blackheads on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: you can totally feel the tightening and the pulsing, it seems to be working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: it&#x27;s messy messy. I tried the plastic bag method mentioned here and it didn&#x27;t really work so well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I have used this once a week for  about a month now and I really like it. I use about 1/2 spoon full and I have enough for my face. I have used both water and vinegar. Only the vinegar looks like it does anything. I have tried various temps and methods of water but it just doesn&#x27;t mix or apply as well as when I use the vinegar. My skin is soft and looks so much better. I even use Ponds moisturizer and it doesn&#x27;t leave me greasy or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also not very messy. I use a little glass bowl, dump it in, vinegar, mix. I put it on then wash the spoon and hands while rinsing the little bit left in the bowl. I wait 20 min then rinse off in the shower. No gunk no problems.</li>
            <li> it came in a powder form and have add ingredients to mix for mask, also the label with the directions was covered with a sticker- if I was going to use it. No returns!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. I made my own foundation powder with it, and now my daughter it using the clay itself for a clay mask to treat acne, and she loves it. I will certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim and didn&#x27;t expect much from it. However, I was pleasantly surprised. My sister and I have a weekly &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; night. We both love the results from this mask! It makes your skin soft, helps clear up any blemishes, diminishes pores, and the best part...we notice it helps minimize small wrinkles!!! I will say while the mask is on, it feels as though you have a black hole on your face. I definitely recommend using this mask once a week. When you go to wash it off, soak a wash cloth in warm water and place it on your face for a few minutes to loosen the mask. It comes off very easily then.</li>
            <li> i used it for the first time and my skin looks awesome. my boyfriend had huge pores and red skin and he used it and his pores have significantly reduced in size and his skin looks amazing</li>
            <li> Great product.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> this is has calm my acne like nothing else before, i have super sensitive skin but its clearing up compare to how it was, i love this !!</li>
            <li> I have used many products but this is by far the best. My teenage girls use it and they have some of the best skin ever.</li>
            <li> This product probably seems super overhyped and I know it&#x27;s hard not to be skeptical when it seems like people only have good things to say, but this stuff really deserves all the 5 star ratings! I&#x27;ve only used it twice now and already I can see a huge improvement in my skin. My only warning is to be careful how much you mix up - it&#x27;s very easy to make way too much!</li>
            <li> I read several of the reviews and decided to give it a try. I have suffered with acne for the last 15+ years and although I get a few small blemishes here and there, I really wanted something to shrink my giant, be careful not to fall into one of them, pores. I mean seriously I could put loose change in some of them. Yes, I did feel a pulsing and tightening and was thinking &#x27;Heck yes! That must be my pores shrinking!&#x27; Well I don&#x27;t know what it was, but my pores are the same size, and although it did bring a couple of deep blackheads to the surface, it also made me break out, like really, really break out like I haven&#x27;t in years. And right before my son&#x27;s 2nd birthday party, right on! My skin is not any softer, my pores are not any smaller and all I have to show for it is a pop mark. Boo! I will give it 2 stars because it did bring some of the blackheads to the surface, but apart from that, the jar now has a nice new home in my trash compactor.</li>
            <li> Great product, I was very happy with the amazing results, and it feels absolutely incredible. Especially for such a low price, I definitely recommend at least giving this a try. I&#x27;ve been trying to find more natural, organic solutions since reading [[ASIN:1456613588 Age-Proof: Beauty Alternatives You Need to Know]], which I also highly recommend! It is a helpful resource for anyone wanting easy, credible tips on natural beauty alternatives. I am beyond happy with the knowledge it provides, and I can already see a difference in my skin after using the tips and tricks Louisa mentions!</li>
            <li> I have had moderate to servere acne for 3 to 4 years now. I&#x27;ve tried proactive which was about $20 bucks a month. Proactive did nothing for me. Maybe because our skin types are different? Anyways, I paid less than ten dollars for this clay and let me tell you now. This product works the night and you wake up with glowing skin 70% of my acne got smaller and i have smoother skin. I mixed one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar with one tablespoon of the clay. I am so happy eiith this product and wish i can use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I use it with apple cider vinegar and my skin has never looked better. Your skin really feels like it&#x27;s pulsating when it&#x27;s drying!</li>
            <li> I usually buy the big container of this as I use it for a few things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FACE MASK:  Works amazing mixed with apple cider vinegar (ACV) until a thick consistency.  I use the back of my spoon (use a wooden spoon) to slather on my face and neck and leave for 15 minutes (longer is NOT better, it is harder to get off).  Then I get a big serving bowl and fill it will HOT water and use a face cloth to steam the mud loose to where it is easier to wipe off.  Throw the mud water on some house plants, compost pile, or out the back door.  It&#x27;s good stuff for the soil too!  It may take several application 1-3 times per week before you will see your pores shrink.  I have seen several reviews here complaining of \\&quot;break outs\\&quot; from this product.  Just a reminder, this clay pulls toxins through the skin to the surface, so in actuality, a \\&quot;break out\\&quot; is the result of a skin cleanse.  Use a gentle moisturizer afterwards such as [[ASIN:B00DS842HS Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil]], [[ASIN:B004Z209HS Pura D&#x27;or Pure and Organic Argan Oil, Brown and Gold, 4 Fluid Ounce]], or even [[ASIN:B0001VKD82 Olive Oil,Og,Ex Virgin, 16 oz]].  Yes, these are all oils, but pure, organic, unrefined natural oils that do wonders for the skin.  I&#x27;ve been interested in trying [[ASIN:B004KKUYXE Olive Gold O3 Skin Care Lotion - Ozonated Olive Oil Super Oxygen (4oz)]] as I&#x27;ve heard wonderful things about this product.  So let me know what you think if you do, my email is in my profile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TOOTH PASTE:  I have a tooth powder recipe (email if you would like it) that is 80% bentonite clay.  This clay is a wonderful mineral that helps remineralize my teeth.  I&#x27;ve not needed to see a dentist in over 5 years.  It has also, helped whiten my teeth, heal my gums, and prevent tooth decay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GASTRO/INTESTINAL DETOX:  I&#x27;ve incorporated a bentonite clay and distilled water mixture (to drink) in the last 10 days of a fasting and was amazed at the garbage it pulled into my p**p (bowels).  Bentonite clay is known to act as a magnet to heavy metals in your system.  It helps draw these metals into your bowels to be eliminated.  It&#x27;s very strange the first time you do this, you may have a metallic taste in your mouth when this is accumulating.  From childhood medications/vaccinations to a poor diet throughout our lives we have heavy metals stored in our organs, bones, and tissue, therefore to incorporate this \\&quot;magnet\\&quot; to any detox routine is very beneficial as Dr. Bernard Jensen discusses in his book [[ASIN:0960836071 Tissue Cleansing Through Bowel Management]].entonite clay is known to act as a magnet to heavy metals in your system.

            <li> The stuff is crazy! I have been trying to find a way to get rid of my blackheads and shrink my pores and I think I finally found it. I just used this for the first time tonight, but I can already see a noticeable difference in the reduction of my pores and smoothness of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just mixed about 1.5 teaspoons of the powder with about half an ounce of Bragg&#x27;s apple cider vinegar and applied an even coat to my face, until the entire surface was a greenish gray color. Let the mixture sit as a mask on my face for about 15 minutes and then washed the mixture off with warm water and a washcloth.</li>
            <li> Used this on my face and hair, 4c. Made my hair very clean. After I washed it, I had the best twist out ever. Gave it 4 stars cos my hair felt strange by day 3 post wash. #note to self, use conditioner after rinsing the clay out. I will definitely keep using.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet but it seems like a good product. I like the packaging and it seems to be fun. I will add more to the review once I use it.</li>
            <li> Very good for blackheads and clogged pores, I have tried many other products for my problem skin and thus is by far the best for the price. You want be disappointed MIX with the vinegar for best results. It does feel kinda weird when it starts to dry but I liked it you can really feel it pulling all the junk out of the pores.</li>
            <li> So happy love it on my face and hair feels so clean after using the. Indian clay</li>
            <li> I honestly can say that this product works for me , I was a little skeptical at first though. I have been using this product for some months now about once and week and I really like it . I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive product and someone who doesn&#x27;t mind having to mix a few ingredients together before using . It is a bit difficult to rinse off and messy if you are not being careful but I didn&#x27;t mind that . I also noticed a bit of redness after I completely took the mask of but it went away with in minutes .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s messy and Hard to get off&lt;br /&gt;you may experience a bit of redness</li>
            <li> Felt blood pulsating on my face Daum</li>
            <li> I really like this face mask. It&#x27;s easy to use and it&#x27;s really made a difference in my skin. I rarely break out anymore and my face is much smoother. I use it maybe a couple times a week at most. The only thing is trying to find a right balance between powder and water</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews and especially not in so much detail, but this stuff helped me, so why not share the experience and hopefully help someone else...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the mask out for the 1st time last night.  I have recently developed bad adult acne; the kind with about 100 tiny pimples that give your face a horrible texture in addition to regular larger pimples here and there.  I came across this product and thought why not?  It has some too good to be true reviews along with some normal and of course bad ones.  And I was starting to get a little desperate because my normal serums have not been working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not being sure of how much I needed to make, I mixed 1 Tbsp + 1 tsp each of the clay and Vitaminshoppe brand unfiltered apple cider vinegar.  It turned out to be enough to put a pretty thick mask layer on my face and a thinner, more normal layer on my neck.  (I will probably reduce to just 1 Tbsp each next time.)  So, I highly recommend not trying to multi-task while wearing the mask, like tucking your child into bed...  This is not your usual mask.  It does tighten to the point of it not being comfortable to move around; and forget trying to talk.  So the mask got really tight on my face.  I did feel the pulsating on my nose.  The thinner layer on my neck got itchy because of the vinegar (which if you didn&#x27;t know is a natural antibacterial and therefore can burn a little anyway...)  And of course, I wore the mask longer than recommended until it started to burn a little--probably closer to 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the extra thickness of the mask, it was harder and messier to get off than other masks.  I first tried my usual warm wet washcloth to start wiping the mask off.  That actually hurt.  I immediately realized I would need a lot more water to loosen up the clay, so I did end up hanging my head over the tub rinsing with warm water and my hands.  When most of the clay was off, then I reverted back to the washcloth method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise, my face was much smoother.  All of the tiny pimples were gone.  The other ones were smaller and less swollen.  My face wasn&#x27;t really red at all like other people described.  I could tell my face was a little dry, so I put on a mild face moisturizer...I think it was a Ponds anti-aging lotion.  With a still skeptical attitude, I decided to wait until the morning to see if the results stuck through the night.  And once again, to my surprise, the results remained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it did not magically clear up my entire face in 30 minutes, but it did significantly reduce what was on it.  It was well worth the smoother skin and reduced acne.  I may try it again for the next few nights to see if it will completely clear up my face, even though  I remember reading somewhere that you should not use it too often because of its potency.  I will just make sure to moisturize... :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----So an update after using it a few of times----&lt;br /&gt;I now know what other people are talking about with the burning sensation.  But only because I still leave the mask on way longer than the recommended time.  I actually leave it on for as long as I can stand it.  So my face does turn red in some spots but fades away.  It doesn&#x27;t bother me since I do this at night before bed...  The mask has continued to help minimize my acne, but it has not made it all disappear.  However, I have noticed that my face looks somewhat healthier, maybe a little glowy, and younger.  Yes, even my fine lines on my forehead have become less noticeable.  Maybe it is from my anti-aging lotion getting sucked into my dry pores.  I don&#x27;t know.  But, needless to say, I am still pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise, my face was much smoother.  All of the tiny pimples were gone.  The other ones were smaller and less swollen.

            <li> I cannot believe how well this thing works, I usually don&#x27;t write any reviews but this product deserves it. I don&#x27;t have any acne but I do have some black heads on my T zone. After using it for the first time, I can already see the difference, my skin is incredibly smooth and feels nice and tight.</li>
            <li> Definitely a recommendation for people who have mixed-oily skin and stubborn blackheads in the T-zone and especially the nose area. Mix the clay with some water to make a thin paste then let it dry up. It feels like the clay is sucking out the gross stuff, and bringing it the surface. Rinse off (in a basin, not down the drain) and you can gently extract. Pores definitely look smaller, cleaner and tighter. Wholesome product that&#x27;s natural, and actually works as a once in a while, quality facial.</li>
            <li> Works wonders for my acne! I use it everyday before &#x27;that time of the month&#x27;..you know what I mean, ladies.</li>
            <li> I hate face masks, but I love this Aztec clay mask!!  I have suffered from acne my whole life.  I bought this product last year and I have been using it every weekend since.  I have small pimples on my face and this product has helped to clear it up. I mix the clay with apple cider vinegar.  Sometimes, if I&#x27;m too lazy to wait for the mask to dry, I use my blow dryer on a cold setting to speed up the process.  A lot of people on here say they don&#x27;t feel the pulsating sensation - if that&#x27;s the case, you probably applied a thick amount to your face.  When it&#x27;s time to wash it off, I stand in the shower and let the water fall on my face and it will loosen up the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently had rhinoplasty on 03/21.  I had to wear a cast for a whole week, so I couldn&#x27;t wash my face.  This past Sunday, I woke up covered (and I mean COVERED) with a rash + pimples all over my face.  It turns out that I broke out from not washing my face AND had an allergic reaction to the antibiotic that I was on.  My face looked the worst it has ever been!!  On top of it all, I had to go to work on Monday.  I have used this mask for the past 3 days in a row and it has incredibly helped clear up my face.  My skin literally looked like gravel on Monday - it is now Thursday and some of my skin is smooth and the rest of the pimples are significantly smaller in size.  I am going to keep using this mask every night until my skin is clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, since I&#x27;ve had acne since I was in my teens (I&#x27;m 30 now), I have a lot of dark scars on my face, especially on my cheeks.  Continued use of this mask has softened the color of my scars as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this product!!  It really really works wonders!!</li>
            <li> Just read the other reviews on here for this product, and trust me this stuff works. Nothing better than this clay mask anywhere else. I brag to everyone about it and have gotten many people to buy this product. and...it&#x27;s only $10, how could you go WRONG?</li>
            <li> I bought the clay to reduce my adult acne. I mixed it according to the instruction with water and apple vinegar. Mixing was not a problem to me unlike many other reviewers mentioned. If you use it often, just mix in more water and more vinegar than for one time and store in the fridge. The mask feels good for the first few minutes, the problem arises as soon as it starts hardening. It fractures in little pieces that are stuck to your face as the mask shrinks and the skin tries to regain its normal shape. This must create tiny cracks in the skin that hurts forever after the removal of the mask. Besides the burning sensation after the mask is off and for the next few days until the skin heals, there is acne. Deep, red, painful acne appearing all over the face. I tried this mask twice with the same results.</li>
            <li> Great with the Apple cider vinegar as a facial exfoliant</li>
            <li> Because my skin is mixed – oily skin, so I have very obvious blackheads in T zone area. My friend tried this one before, and she suggests me to try this. Since the price is cheap, so why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use it, I will mix it with apple vinegar, apply thin layer on the skin, and wait for 20 minutes, I clean my face. And I seen my blackheads are gone. It just completely clean my skin. With this price, and it give me smooth and clean skin, I would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Bentonite clay has been used in skincare for centuries. You can mix it with braggs Apple cider vinegar (for the days you need a deeper detox), aloe vera (for a lighter, refresher) or even just purified water. I will sometimes use.a few drops of various essential oils with the mask depending on my skin&#x27;s needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you apply it, get your skin will start tightening up... To the point where you won&#x27;t be able to move your mouth... talkng will be hard and when you look at youself in the mirror, you might try to laugh but your face will feel frozen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wait about 20min. then rinse with warm water and voila! Your skin will feel tighter, smoother and look fresh and new. I love this clay...it is amazing!!</li>
            <li> This product makes my sensitive skin feel great. i use it once a week.</li>
            <li> This product is great for acne, and it tightens the skin. I used this product with vinegar and water, but works better with water only.</li>
            <li> Works well, but  difficult to get it mixed into a smooth clay. The premixed is much easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this once a week for about a month now. I use half vinegar and half water. Smells a little weird, but not terrible. The tub says its good for 4 masks but that&#x27;s SO off I&#x27;ve barely put a dent in it so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily-to-normal skin, and just get the occasional breakout. I don&#x27;t have acne. I bought this to supplement my current routine. So far, it&#x27;s been making my skin feel so soft and refreshed. It does get a little red for about 30 minutes, and I apply lotion to remoisturize, but it works like a charm! I&#x27;m not going to start saying it \\&quot;sucks everything from your pores!\\&quot; Because that&#x27;s a bunch of crap, but whatever it does, my skin likes it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend. For those saying they had a reaction, it IS very basic and can be harsh, so it&#x27;s probably worth testing on a small area first.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!! I Will order again!!!! My face feels so clean and tight!!!! Its good for acne and bug bites sooo i highly suggest it to anyone who has acne or gets the occasional bug bite and just wants to treat themselves to a nice spa treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mask about 7 times.  Each time, I&#x27;ve only used it with water (I may try the vinegar in the future).  I do love how soft it leaves my face and for me it helps with blackheads, but I have to run my nails over them for the dirt to come out (probably not the best way to go about it lol).  Lately I&#x27;ve been using it to counteract some medicinal side-effects (i.e dry skin &amp; washed out complexion) as well as to calm my acne when it gets really bad.  It seems to help give me back my \\&quot;youthful glow\\&quot; and I use it whenever I want my face to look more refreshed (keep in mind though, it isn&#x27;t a magic cure-all and certainly doesn&#x27;t repair me 100%, but a 40-50% improvement is fine for me).  It also doesn&#x27;t get rid of my acne, it just makes it stop itching and being so inflamed.  And no, I have never felt a \\&quot;pulsing and tingling\\&quot; just mud tightening on my face.  It&#x27;s a little messy the first couple of times, but once you learn how to mix it, it&#x27;s not bad (the clumpiness is a pain though).</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It does take a few times to get used to the texture. My face feels wonderful after I use it.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing. I use it once or twice a week, depending on how I feel about my skin. Pair this with Apple Cider Vinegar, I don&#x27;t think it would give the same results with water or any other liquid you would use. Leave it on for about 35 minutes, you&#x27;ll know when to take it off (your forehead will begin to itch). Your skin will be red for like 3 hrs, so I recommend using it before you go to bed. When you wake up in the morning, your skin will be so soft. I love this stuff, it really helps repair your skin overnight and you will see/feel a difference the morning after. I have shared this product will a lot of my friends and family and they all have their own bottles of [[ASIN:B0014P8L9W Aztec Secret - Indian Healing Clay, 1 lb clay]]. So happy I gave this stuff a chance, I seriously don&#x27;t know what I would do without it now.</li>
            <li> Although a little frightening while on, this mask does what it promises to do.  My skin is smoother and clearer after I use it.  It is no joke when they tell you your face will be red for a while after.  It will be RED and have a pretty good tingle, but a nice layer of moisturizer and a couple of hours and you are back to normal.</li>
            <li> i LOVE using any type of natural clay in my skincare regimen. but this so far is my favorite. as others have mentioned its definitely strong but it does the job! i usually am preferential to mud masks or french green clay. but when \\&quot;that time of the month\\&quot; comes around and the hormonal acne rears its ugly head all i have to do is break out this bad boy and it stops it in its tracks.</li>
            <li> Warning--DON&#x27;T peel bits of this mask off as some have suggested. I did just that, thinking I would save my drain from being clogged and maybe even pull some gunk out of my face, but all I got were some really nasty splotches and bruises on my face--probably made worse by the fact that I used the mask two days in a row. Not smart, I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And not the product&#x27;s fault, because the parts of my face that aren&#x27;t bruised look great. It doesn&#x27;t look like a fairy waved her wand and made all my blemishes go away, but my face is smooth, and the bumpy clogged pores I had everywhere have shrunk a good deal. The few zits I had have shrunk as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always go overboard when I first get a new skincare product, and it happened to backfire really terribly in this case. Hopefully the bruising goes away soon. Moral of the story: use this stuff sparingly and carefully, and it works great.</li>
            <li> At end of day, once a week:  Mix 2 tsp clay with 2 tsp apple cider vinegar, mix into a paste with a small rubber spatula in a tiny bowl.  Spread over clean, dry face, let dry.  You will feel like your blood is rushing to your face (it is) and lots of tingling and maybe even a teensy itch here and there (resist the urge to scratch or use a toothpick to satisfy little urges).  Leave on until it is good and dry.  Use a good hot-as-you-can-stand-it wet, rough washcloth to repeatedly wipe it off, then wash your face in warm water, finish in cool water.  You WILL see a huge difference in your pore size and the clarity of your skin.  It is very drying by design, so I recommend following it up with your favorite LIGHT nighttime moisturizer and going night-night.  Continue to keep your face clean and moisturized throughout the week and repeat again in 7 days.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product, which was a bit cheaper, along with my vitamins from another site.  I went pretty much by the reviews as I stumbled on it during a search for something else otherwise I still would not even know about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I must say it was little disconcerting to hear the sizzle when mixing this with apple cider vinegar but I gave it a shot anyway (you only need a small bit of this stuff and we mixed a bit too much).  My teenage daughter and I tried it, I put mine on in two or three layers so it was pretty thick, she maybe did 1.5 layers.  Now she was still talking and laughing during the wait, I had went downstairs and my facial movements were still so mine dried to a thick mask (though it later cracked and I looked like an alien from out of space).  My daughter&#x27;s, I later saw, had some peeled off especially around her mouth because of facial movements and constant touching of her face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept mine on between 25 to 35 minutes when I felt it completely dry.  During the later time of the drying I did feel the pulsating, pulling, tightening, squeezing and almost hurting of my face (if I moved it), and further when I went to wash it off I saw that my lips were puckered.  I bent into the sink and turned on very warm water and started slowly washing my face, no rubbing just gently moving the water over the mask until it started &#x27;melting&#x27; and washed off completely with no chunks of clay in my sink, it just blending into water down the drain like normal.  My daughter on the other hand was trying to peel it off but she did what I did and found it easier.  I don&#x27;t think peeling it off is a good or healthy idea as I would think it more damaging that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So afterwards I had red skin but after applying a moisturizer (a lot) it eventually went away and I never got any bumps or any bad reaction.  My face felt smooth though dry and the next day it even felt smaller (I&#x27;m sure that was my imagination), as the days went on (we only plan on using it once a week) though my face felt more smoother, even-toned and even firmer.  My daughter&#x27;s face definitely looked brighter from the beginning but that might have been due to lack of even washing her face on a regular basis but she liked it&#x27;s effect and wants to do it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would say that the whole experience with waiting for the mask to dry was a bit scary weird (more due to first experience) but not bad as after washing my face I felt that the experience had really gotten the blood circulating in my face which is a good thing.  The after effects are definitely the goal which has been accomplished, though I&#x27;m not sure about blackheads (reason for the 4 stars) as I would think one would need to do a minor facial scrub maybe the day afterwards (or maybe up to 6 hours later) to get them out while they are still &#x27;loosen&#x27; from the mask but I don&#x27;t think it is something that happens overnight (at least not for me) from just doing the mask but a combination of activities in conjunction with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are definitely looking forward to trying it again and will keep an eye on the &#x27;benefits&#x27; of doing it over a period of time and report back if anything is out of the ordinary.h my face felt more smoother, even-toned and even firmer.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my face mixed with apple cider vinegar.  It really comes alive (bubbles up some) mixed with apple cider vinegar.  Remember to mix it with the liquid with a non-metal utensil as it says. I really like how it makes my skin feel and I think my skin has improved slightly.  I&#x27;d buy it again, but it will last me quite a while.  I haven&#x27;t tried it internally though, but some people do.</li>
            <li> Not for very sensitive skin but it is great for cleaning impurities out of your skin. Especially for women who&#x27;s skin has gone crazy.</li>
            <li> This really is a great product. It works great. I am so glad I bought this product and excited to tell my friends about it. I just wish I would have found it sooner. I love it!</li>
            <li> Every time I mix mine, I use really hot water but its still super clumpy and hard to blend. Dries a little slower than i was hoping too. But besides that it works really well! Feels insane, doesn&#x27;t hurt at all....unless you try to move your facial muscles (: My skin is super super smooth afterwards. Kinda fun to mix it yourself and It&#x27;s got a cool hippy looking container lol</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review for anything before but I just had to for this product...I have always had major skin problems since I was young girl (I broke out at like 10 years old and so I have always hated my skin).  My skin is a weird combo of being oily and yet drying out relatively easily.  While I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a miracle cure all, this stuff has done wonders for shrinking my pores and getting rid of black heads!  My face is practically blackhead free &#x3D;) It may have also helped to regulate the oil production in my face (though that could be due to the witch hazel I use, not sure) My friend even told me my skin was looking better.  Now if it could get rid of the acne and scars too, then it would be the perfect product, but regardless it is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While some people say you can use it with water, I really don&#x27;t recommend it.  Apple cider vinegar gets it to a nice smooth consistency that pulsates on the skin and dries relatively even.  You can easily pull it off the skin which I like to think removes the blackheads.  Whereas the water mixture was harder to mix, came out clumpy, latched on to my skin and could not be removed as easily.  I had to aggressively wash it off and it took so much longer to do. I like to wait until it&#x27;s almost completely dry to remove or it doesn&#x27;t have the same effect or feel.  My skin feels a lot cleaner and smoother when I leave it on longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the mask for about 4-5 months now, once a week or before special or major events...and I&#x27;m still on the same jar (only about 1/2 way through it). It&#x27;s definitely worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> I have used this facial mask 3-4 times since I received it two weeks ago. I have tried it with water and with warm milk with equally nice results. I haven&#x27;t yet tried to mix it with apple cider vinegar, but plan to soon. First off, I personally find the suggestion that you apply it in a layer 1/4 to 1/2 inch think to be FAR too thick. I apply a layer about 1/8 of an inch thick and that is plenty. A little goes a long way - I would estimate that 2 tbsp. of clay is sufficient. It definitely gives that pulling/tugging sensation as it dries, and I leave it on as long as I can manage (about 10-15 minutes). As it dries, it tends to make my face itch like crazy and I usually end up running to the bathroom to rinse it off. The first couple of times I used it, it left my face a bit pink, but the more times I have used it, the less my skin seems to react this way. When I used it today, my face wasn&#x27;t flushed at all. A lot of people who have reviewed this product express that they like the pulling/tugging/pulsating (itching) feeling...as they can feel it working. I find it rather uncomfortable, but the results are well worth it. After I rinse off the mask with a warm, damp washcloth and moisturize, my skin literally feels like butter, my pores are visibilly reduced, and my overall tone is improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this mask faithfully, experimenting with different liquid mixers despite the unpleasant feeling as it dries because the results are so impressive. Today I washed with Cetophil, followed it with 100% natural witchhazel toner (Dickinson&#x27;s), applied the mask for 12 minutes, and finished with Sweet Blessed Bee Magic skin moisturizer. I can&#x27;t stop touching my face - it is so incredibly smooth and luscious feeling. My makeup applies so beautifully after I&#x27;ve treated myself with this mask. I do recommend this to everyone...as long as you can stand the icky feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this product 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t itch so much :(</li>
            <li> Just got it yesterday and works wonderfully. I am going to use 2x a week. This stuff makes me look adorable and refreshed. My skin seems like its healthier looking.</li>
            <li> No it does not do deep pore cleaning. Very misleading. Other products are better. I will be using it up just because I bought it and will never order this again.</li>
            <li> Nothing short of a miracle!  I have had annoying acne over the last 7 years, my forehead would never clear up entirely.  I am 32, it&#x27;s embarrassing!  I have used Proactiv, Acne Free, Natures Miracle wash and natural pills, Neutrogena and anything else I could get my hands on.  I used this mask and started noticing results within the first 2 uses.  I waited a few weeks before writing this review to make sure it continued to work.  My face has never been so clear.  I am ecstatic with it!  I have recommended it to several friends and can not say enough good this about this product.</li>
            <li> When I add water to mix, this brand quickly forms surprisingly-solid clumps that do not break up and mix into paste.  The only way I can mix it is if I add another powder in with it, like oat flour.  Then, once applied, my skin gets totally irritated from the mask!  I tried it a few times and gave up.  I&#x27;m sorry to say it was a waste of money for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered Magick Botanicals Coso Green Clay again which I&#x27;ve used in the past.  It is EASY to mix!!  And it works, but doesn&#x27;t sting and irritate the skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love green clay in general. It works great on taking toxins out of the skin. I can put it on a newly-forming pimple, and one or two applications will do away with the pimple entirely, like a miracle.  Great stuff.  But I&#x27;ll be sticking to the Magick Botanicals brand!</li>
            <li> I wanted to use this for a couple weeks before I gave a good review on it. So here we go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Don&#x27;t expect totally miraculous results right away. It takes time for some things. This cleared up the blackheads in my nose really quickly and that was pretty awesome, but I had a lot of closed comedones (acne that isn&#x27;t inflamed, but is just a bump under the skin. like an inactive zit) that needed to &amp;#34;purge.&amp;#34; There&#x27;s a difference between your skin getting rid of these little comedones and having a reaction to a product, so make sure you watch and know which one it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I have oily skin, and leave it on my face for about twenty minutes. I shower at night and don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, so for the first couple weeks I used the mask on nights I didn&#x27;t wash my hair. I&#x27;m going to start cutting back now. It takes out the bad but it also takes out the good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with clogged drains. Yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I use Bragg vinegar and usually start with a 1:1 ratio and add a little bit more clay. I make it in batches and store it in my fridge, and the mixture does absorb some of the liquids after it sits for a little bit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Leave it on your face until you feel the pulsating, and then leave it on a little bit longer. The pulsating is blood being drawn up to your skin. Your pulse and the suction-y feeling on your face will have the same rate since it&#x27;s the same thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. You definitely don&#x27;t need a 1/4 inch mask. Find whatever works for you. Apply it so you can&#x27;t see your skin underneath the clay, but not so thick that it&#x27;ll fall off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;buy this. give it time. it will work for you unless you&#x27;re allergic. don&#x27;t just give up immediately, because this is not a one time miracle cure. good things take time, and this is worth the wait!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see myself without this deep cleanser! I love Bentonite Clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this clay for my face and also my hair. It&#x27;s great for deep cleansing your pores especially used with Braggs Apple Cider Vinegar . For my face I apply the clay on my face and neck, I allow it to stay for about 5 minutes until I feel my face pulsate then I get in the shower allowing the steam to open up my pores for a deeper cleanse. After using this clay my face always feel refresh and clean. It can also be used with baking soda if you&#x27;re suffering from acne, or with sour cream to help fade blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For hair, it also deep cleanse from product build up. Add some aloe vera juice for moisturize, leave on for a while but don&#x27;t let the clay dry, wash out with warm water then deep condition your hair. Your hair will look and feel soft, shiny, healthy and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin I recommended you massage a bit of grapeseed oil on your face before applying the clay combination(s).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bentonite Clay is wonderful to have and I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This mask is difficult to mix (it comes powdered &amp; you&#x27;re supposed to add water). It is really challenging to get it to the right consistency. It doesn&#x27;t spread well or stick on the face well. It makes a huge mess--powder/brown everywhere. And on top of all that, it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much of anything for my skin. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews on products but I really felt the need to do one for this! It is by far the BEST, i mean THE BEST!  It really opened up my pores and cleaned them out. I used it with apple cider vinegar as directed and it tightened/pulsated while on my face. Ive spent a lot if money on expensive products that I was hoping to get these results from and they dont come close to this one. After I rinsed it off, i followed it with some cold water to close the pores. For the price, it is a great buy!The skin on my face has never felt this great EVER. It is so smooth and i cant see a single pore. I noticed a huge difference after one use. I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This powdered clay, added to my facial mask mixture. Has helped to revive, and rejuvenate my skin. I love it.</li>
            <li> Leave skin incredibly soft. Great for acne and oily to normal skin.</li>
            <li> Bigger then I expected&lt;br /&gt;Will come back and review once my apple cider arrives....</li>
            <li> I have the WORST skin of any person I have ever met. I have been battling with acne since I was 12 - I&#x27;m 31 now. If it wasn&#x27;t teen acne, it&#x27;s been hormonal. I have very oily skin and acne scars. This produce has truly improved my skin. I have less pimples and my scars are fading. I use this twice a week, wash daily with an acne wash, tone with a rose water witch-hazel toner daily and moisturize with an oil free all natural cream.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy this product, worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! I&#x27;ve been doing it  for just 2wks and I already see a difference! (And it&#x27;s not just me, other people have commented how my skin has started looking better too, so *phew it&#x27;s not just wishful thinking either!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I&#x27;ve literally tried everything under the sun to get rid of my acne, and this is the only thing that actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to mix it with:&lt;br /&gt;Apple cider vinegar (for alkalizing benefits) + essential oils (peppermint) + clay&#x3D; add all together until mixture is desired creaminess you like, measurements don&#x27;t have to be precise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leave on for 1hr - 2hrs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My type of skin is that overly dry but oily type and it&#x27;s been perfect ever since applying this always right after a nice pore opening hot shower.</li>
            <li> It was already opened, not new product.</li>
            <li> I am 36y/o and I still struggle with acne. I had a little red mountain forming on my face yesterday. I applied a full mask for 20 min before bed. Then washed my face but applied a little to the pimple and slept with it overnight. Im impressed. The pimple is completely gone and no redness today. By far the best acne product I have tried.</li>
            <li> lovely sensation, decently priced too.</li>
            <li> I use this a couple times a week. A little bit of powder goes a long way. I definitely feel like my face is cleaner and healthier after using it. I never feel my face pulsate like it says. I also use it with just water.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!! My daughter and I have &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34; days and this is at the top of our list. It does get super tight on your face but that&#x27;s the fun in it for my daughter and myself. It leaves the skin feeling nice and smooth and super clean.</li>
            <li> This I think could last you forever and it&#x27;s definitely a great mask. It does &amp;#34;pulsate&amp;#34; but I wouldn&#x27;t describe it as painful. It is hard to wipe off, so I would have a warm/steamed towel ready to soften it up once you want to remove it. This product is not for someone who wants a quick and easy facial. It takes effort but I think it&#x27;s well worth it. You will not be able to make facial expressions comfortable once it is dry, so do leave plenty of time to make a facial, have it dry completely, and then to remove it. It takes practice to get the hang of removing it, so expect dirty sinks and towels for a while until you figure out the best way. Also note, a little goes a long way. So I would advise against using a heaping tablespoon of product and equal amounts of apple cider vinegar. Otherwise you will have tons left over. I have put excess in the fridge and used it later with no ill effects but I don&#x27;t suspect it would last indefinitely.</li>
            <li> This product help clean deep into my pores, The reason why I gave it 4 stars is because the only thing I didn&#x27;t like is the smell of the product on your face, especially you have to go out of your way to get Apple Vinegar Cider just for the item to actually work on your face compared to using water. But I can&#x27;t complain because the price is right in my area when it comes to facial products. I actually bought this because of the reviews, and so far the product has done its work.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  Great Value.  Makes your skin super soft after 1 use.  A must have!</li>
            <li> love it and so does my clients</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how many reviews there are for this item. It was one of the reasons I wanted to try it myself. I bought this to help deep clean my pores and give me a facial without paying $30. I&#x27;ve tried it twice and it literally feels like your face is being tightened into a corset ( this is a good thing). Once the clay dries and turns white I wipe it off with a wet cloth which is a scratchy feeling. After it&#x27;s off, my face is super red since all the blood was being sucked to the surface but my skin feels clean and smooth. As for my pores it does clean it well but doesn&#x27;t make my blackheads completely disappear (wasn&#x27;t expecting it to). Give it a try it&#x27;s only $8.</li>
            <li> Gives a fresh and smooth feel after use.&lt;br /&gt;Only after it dries and we wash it off our face big clay chunks fall . Do not let them down the sink directly. If possible throw the big chunks away and wash the rest off the face.&lt;br /&gt;It smells strong and strange but the results are good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for reducing redness and swelling. I used it on some fresh mosquito bites for about 20 mins and the redness and itching was gone, and the bite was nothing but a small dot. Use it overnight on pimples and it should be less red and swollen</li>
            <li> I use it for all kinds of different things. It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> My face has never looked better. I was starting to get a breakout but applied this mask and viola...breakout avoided. Now I use this weekly with apple cider vinegar as suggested on the package directions. Please be aware of slight bubbles when you add the apple cider vinegar to the clay. I wasnt expecting that but it was cool to see. Turns out my local farmers market sells this too so I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> So this stuff is awesome. I&#x27;ve tried almost everything in the book, clinique, stuff from target and other.. I have pretty normal skin but when I breakout it gets pretty bad and irritating. I was aware of the red face side effect but it just goes away after 30 mins. it really helps a lot. I feel like my face is a lot more clean after, I use it for mosquito bites too because I swear im allergic to them, or they love me too much.. The mud bath is a amazing too.</li>
            <li> Very good helps reduce pimples  overnight</li>
            <li> Hi everybody, I never really write reviews, but in this case I feel I have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read all the reviews before I purchased the product, I thought it would really help, but it was all the way around, it actually brings all the bad stuff to the surface, but that&#x27;s all, it doesn&#x27;t eliminate it! My skin got a lot worst since I started to use it 3 times a week. I even stop using it for a couple of months and use it again ONCE and now I&#x27;m regretting it, Mi skin looks awful. I had a lot of hope in this thing but it was a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried virtually everything to control my adult acne and this was another product to add to the list. I used organic raw apple cider vinegar as suggested. It does pulsate, it does turn my face red afterward. Other than that it doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot. My face feels great after I remove the clay. I can say that it reduces the severity of the acne that I get around menstruation but I haven&#x27;t seen anything amazing. Despite the bad smell of the vinegar, I found it easy to mix and apply. I plan on continuing to use it as a weekly facial.</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time last night, and I got all those same things... the pulsating, the cold-hot feel... then, it felt like it was totally stretching my skin as it dried. Skin felt very soft afterwards; it felt like the product pulled a bunch of bad crap out of it. I only did about 15 mins with the mix, and I used the vinegar method. My redness wasn&#x27;t too bad. I plan on doing this again in a few days, and I&#x27;m going to leave on for about 30 minutes this time. Hopefully this puts my over-oily skin in check.</li>
            <li> This improved my skin and good for days where you feel like you need a spa day. Better with apple cider vinegar,it makes your skin feel tighter.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product and I have been using it for years! I recommend it to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> Such a deep clean I love it.</li>
            <li> Makes skin beautiful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! I noticed a difference right away. All of my blackheads are gone as well as the newly formed pimples.</li>
            <li> It is just okay would not repurchase. This item has many uses but did not meet my needs for this product.</li>
            <li> I use this weekly for my face, and it works great! I have prescription acne medication/face wash, and it works okay, but isn&#x27;t anything special. As soon as I started using this religiously, my face cleared dramatically and I barely have any acne. With most face masks I can&#x27;t see any noticeable difference between the before/after, but within a day of using this my skin is soft and acne/redness is under control. My only drawback is that this is messy and kind of clumpy, but it&#x27;s worth it for the clearer skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to rate this item yet, even thought I&#x27;m using it for a month already. I have hormonal acne and I didn&#x27;t notice any dramatic improvement of my condition. I use it once every 3-4 days, it makes my skin really really soft and cleans it, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to treat my acne. Right now I&#x27;m taking some acne medication and I hope that all this stuff together will help me to keep acne under control.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I do recommend this item as cleanser but not as a treatment product for those who have hormonal acne.</li>
            <li> If you mix this with apple cider vinegar it leaves your skin looking vibrant and feeling soft/smooth. It works wonders, but don&#x27;t put it on very thick! It will take you a while to wash it off.</li>
            <li> I have not been using the product long enough to rave over it, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it...</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED THE ORDER WITHIN A WEEK OF PURCHASING IT AND WHE I APPLIED IT ON MY FACE I CAN ACTUALLY FEEL THE TIGHTENING. I LIKE THE ITEM PROVISING YOU FOLLOW UP WITH A GOOD MOISTURIZER</li>
            <li> Was weird at first and is weird when it is all bubbly and even more when it dries (feels like your face is tighter than everrrrrrrr) but it worked great and my face was SO clean and SO clear. Pores were small and clean and complexion was fresh looking (reddish at first) but it works well.</li>
            <li> I think it does a good job of making your face feel fresh. It pretty messy, but I enjoy the fact that I can give myself an at home facial. It does burn/itch initially and your face is red after , but it was nothing too irritating .</li>
            <li> Really enjoy using this product. Makes my skin very smooth instantly after using it. Pores do appear smaller after each use. Smell isn&#x27;t terrible. Will be purchasing again in the future!</li>
            <li> Good product. I use once a week, I mix with Apple cider vinegar. The mask pulls all the gunk from your pores</li>
            <li> Really nice face mask, although I thought it was a mixture already made up, it isn&#x27;t. You need to put some of the dry clay into a bowl and mix it with some apple cider vinegar, and water. Which is an extra bit of work to use the product but that&#x27;s ok because the results are very nice, my face honestly feels revitalized.</li>
            <li> I really liked this clay for a facial masks, It really did make a difference. It brightened my skin and made it feel extremely clean. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This mask makes my skin feel amazing. Since I don&#x27;t have really bad acne I didn&#x27;t really see a difference but it did help the dark circles under my eyes a bit. I definelty recommend this</li>
            <li> This works great. No smell. Leaves skin clean and soft in less than ten minutes. Don&#x27;t scare kids or pets with this on. My cats gave me strange long looks.</li>
            <li> This mask is SO POWERFUL! You most certainly need to be gentle with it. I have acne prone oily skin and this mask has changed my skin completely. The first time i used it, I began by mixing it with water and a small amount of apple cider vinegar and left it on for about 20 minutes (which was really too long) and then rinsed with warm water. Your face will be red, but it goes away within the hour. My skin was so soft and the swelling of the blemishes had diminished. Next I then washed my face with my regular cleanser, which I recommend since this mask draws out impurities and you dont want those impurities to rest on your skin and cause further break outs. I finished with my moisturizer and then headed off to bed. Upon waking up my skin was clear! Now I use this once a week just to keep the impurities and oils from building up and I swear my skin has changed. I would recommend, but use it carefully because it is so powerful.</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time today. The jar arrived with a bar code attached on the back directions, so I could not read them. I went on Amazon and asked the question online. It was answered within 20 minutes. Reading the reviews I was able to get the least messiest and easiest way to apply the clay. Thank goodness for that because this stuff is clay &amp; very messy. The hint to mix in a zip lock bag and then apply to your face was great. Thank you Amazon, you have really thought about what your customers may need and I for one appreciate that.</li>
            <li> Love this mask... Really tightens my pores and I love the results.</li>
            <li> For the last few months, I&#x27;ve had insanely stubborn acne on my chin. I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun to knock it out, and could find nothing that worked...until now. I used the mask for the first time last night, and I&#x27;m still amazed at how great my face feels! Before the mask, I had 3 monster zits that I could feel coming in...you know the ones, where they practically have a pulse? Today they are not only significantly smaller, but also much less red and tender. I didn&#x27;t feel the pulsating advertised, but I believe I used too much apple cider vinegar and made the mask too thin. Still, this stuff is awesome. I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
            <li> The is the best ever!!! I love doing facials with the bentonite clay!  I use acv and honey or water just depends!  But my face is so clean and refreshed! Can&#x27;t wait to try a clay bath! Def recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Such a pain to use.  Have to mix it up..oops, too much water! Oops, too much powder!  And again.  And again. And again as I try to mix this stuff up...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always clumpy - is that normal?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oops, made a thousand times too much for my face.  Again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, no have to wash my mixing brush.  Now have to wash the tiny glass bowl I mix this in...wash, wash, wash....</li>
            <li> I never write reviews for products, but this mask deserves it &amp; after reading some 1 star reviews I feel obligated to put my two cents in. First off, this product has changed my skin completely. I went from worrying about when the next huge breakout would happen to having no worries at all. After years of searching for a product that would improve my skin and halt my breakouts, this has been the only one that has worked for me. Because it worked so well for me I am a little bit skeptical of the 1 star reviews. Sure, everybody&#x27;s skin is different and I&#x27;m usually warry of most products because my skin is super sensitive but please don&#x27;t be afraid to try this product! It could work miracles for you too! - I use it every other day, somedays I combine the powder with apple cider vinegar and other days I use just water. I find that switching between the two had worked best for me.</li>
            <li> Pulls at your skin, but helps my skin to look so much clearer! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have noticed a BIG change in the condition of my skin...my skin has brightened up and looks healthier. I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I use it once a week, mixed with ACV, and my face feels and looks great afterwards.</li>
            <li> This is very good treatment to, especially if you have large pores or pimples. What I do is either mix it with apple cider vinegar or plain water into a thick paste. I spread it all over my face and when it starts drying I love how it pulls and tightens and when I wash it off my face feels nice, tight, and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several masks before, and I will say that this one does do what it promises: it makes your skin burn and tingle while it sits laboriously on your face.  I have used this mask several times and invited family and friends to use it, too.  Regardless of how I mix it, it always takes at least 30 minutes to dry and it is painful and miserable to take off.  Afterward my skin hurts and feels tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is dry, it is not sensitive, and I am not acne-prone.</li>
            <li> I dont use it ever day, hell I dont use it every month, but when I do use it WHOA my face feels amazing so tight and perfect. I mean Im only 28 but wow I can appreciate a deep cleaning on my face since I work in healthcare, my boy friend and I got a great laugh and pictures (LOL) to show off before and after. We did not use apple cider vinegar as instructed instead we used what still an amazing deep cleaning. After applying try not to smile or laugh...ehhh actually do smile and laugh so you can see how amazingly well this stuff works! Can get a little messy I keep my tub in a zip-lock bag the powder is extremely fine, also I recommend tying the hair back.</li>
            <li> I used this with raw apple cider vinegar and applied it to my entire face. It sucked EVERYTHING out of my pores but for the next 2 weeks my skin was extremely rough and dry. Now I use it as a spot treatment for pimples, which it is perfect for! It sucks it right out and doesn&#x27;t leave a huge swollen bump that squeezing would.</li>
            <li> If you like to give yourself facials this stuff is great. I love that it comes as a powder and you can mix as much as you like.</li>
            <li> Like many others said, this thing does pull away oil and make your skin feel soft.  But it&#x27;s so hard to mix it with water.  I used warm water but still got a lot of tiny clumps.  I can mix grout better than this.</li>
            <li> I received my Bentonite Clay a few days after I ordered. I was pleased with the timely order. I used my clay, and I can tell you it was the real deal. The price was great and I would definitely purchase it again...</li>
            <li> This stuff works! I put on a layer, and after 5 minutes my face started itching really bad...guess that&#x27;s when you know it&#x27;s working! After washing it off, my skin felt super soft.</li>
            <li> My face, I can&#x27;t stop touching it after one use! Didn&#x27;t cause any redness for me but I hardly read the directions so I added as much water as I felt needed. I think the bad reviews are from those who didn&#x27;t add enough water. Honestly this stuff is amazing and I will continue to use it forever. :) I have oily acne prone skin and I love the way this clay makes me feel!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mask.  I have used it twice so far and love the results.  My skin is sensitive but the only reaction I have when using is that my skin is red for about an hour afterward which is to be expected.</li>
            <li> Wow this stuff is fant&amp;aacute;stico it helped dry up all my acne here&#x27;s my everyday routine. In the morning i use frustre oatmeal with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Tea tree soap in liquid form and then moisturize with cerave lotion. By the way i have dry skin and use to have lot of blackheads etc. At night i do the same but after Washing my face i use a yogurt mask when i don&#x27;t use the clay. I don&#x27;t wear liquid makeup it breaks out my skin, i use a powder foundation. I also use the clay as a spot treatment in just a couple days it dries up the zit. I use the clay and braggs acv. Hope this helps believe me i&#x27;ve tried everything no joke this is the only thing that works</li>
            <li> So I can atest to the \\&quot;pulsating\\&quot; thing. I mixed it myself in a small container 2tbsp of the clay and Apple Cider Vinegar. I am dealing with hormonal/cystic acne and this is my last experiment before going to see a dermatologist. Right now, I can tell you it is unlike any other mask I have EVER put on my skin. My regimen now consists of (Dudu Osun Black Soap - Cleanser), this as a mask, (Jojoba Oil - Moisturizer) and I rub a slice of lemon on my face to sleep overnight to deal with the scars left from this acne nonsense. I can say that at this present moment, I can feel this mask doing wonders on my face! It tingles, my face feels like it has a heart beat, and it is somewhat itchy, I also feel like a pucker fish the way it is sucking stuff from my face. I will definitely report results with photos after a few weeks as I am an amazon freak!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not great, it&#x27;s not awful. I guess I was expecting more based on so many good reviews... it doesn&#x27;t clean my skin, it doesn&#x27;t clear my pores, to be totally honest it doesn&#x27;t really do anything. I even bought the good apple vinegar for it, and it didn&#x27;t make any difference. It smells bad and it&#x27;s harder to get off than most face masks. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> Awesome mask!! I use it with ACV, &amp; I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I can feel it working big difference in my skin</li>
            <li> I use Bentonite clay for my monthly hair masks and I must say its intimidating at first because you have to measure things but its fine. I have had this product for a few months now and because I don&#x27;t use it that often but I have tried it with water, avj and acv. I like it best with avj, it just makes my hair and face feel a lot better and less drying.This brand is the more popular one, good cost for the amount and effective.</li>
            <li> This is just great! Love it and I&#x27;ve only used it once cause I just got it yesterday but I can see a difference in my skin. I&#x27;ve heard so much about this mask refering to acne and I can already tell that this is gonna work. My skin felt clean, soft and brighter. I hope it continues to do as I&#x27;ve read it has done with other people. I also want to thank the people who took their time to write a review because it was a huge help and I also hope mine can help as well.</li>
            <li> a huge inprovement on my skin quality after 2 applies</li>
            <li> Great product!!!!  I&#x27;ve only used it twice and I can already tell a difference in the size of my pores.</li>
            <li> Was recommended this by a friend and feel that it really does clean out my pores. My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t feel the pulsing it claims, perhaps I mixing it wrong?! I have notice difference when using this consistently 2-3x a week and have receive compliments on how great my skin looks.</li>
            <li> Unable to place the adequate comment on this product which I still haven&#x27;t  used. I am hoping it serve the purpose for buying it.</li>
            <li> I read about this on a beauty blogger&#x27;s page and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I mixed it up in a plastic bowl with a stainless steel spoon (only now reading that I should have used a plastic spoon?!) and went with a small amount of clay and just started adding water until I had a somewhat soupy mixture.  I didn&#x27;t want a thick layer on my face (so basically I did not follow the directions).  I left it on for about 20 minutes and it had hardened in some areas, but not others (even though the layer was pretty thin).  To remove, I wet a washcloth and applied that to my face for a few minutes, splashed water on my face several times, then alternated both until it was all removed. It definitely took some time though - the clay really sticks to your face!  And even though I read that your face may be red after you remove it, I was still shocked to see how red!! It looked like I had been out in the sun all day.  Yikes!  I applied some argan oil over my face (having read that you should moisturize after).  Over the course of an hour, the redness dissipated.  All in all, this was a great mask.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t do it more than once a week for my skin type.  I&#x27;m actually looking forward to using it on bites/stings this summer to see if it works in that regard.</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time today, I LOVE it and will definitely buy more once I run out :)</li>
            <li> This is a great masque! I simply mix a small batch and share it with my daughters. It lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing the Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay. Recently I have been researching DIY mud masks, and this product was mentioned frequently. You can mix essential oils, rose water, and activated charcoal with the Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay to make a great anti-acne mask. Because of it&#x27;s large size, this tub will last me months. I will definitely purchase this again when I run out!</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but I really recommend applying this stuff maybe - to start - once a week. I tried 3 days after an application and my face felt almost raw and hot. If I apply maybe once a week or so, it doesn&#x27;t get that uncomfortable. Another note, I find that 1 tablespoon of the clay to 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar (or water) works really well. I mix it up in a closed quart zipped baggie, turn that baby inside out and use the bag as my applicator. just make sure everything is well mixed otherwise you&#x27;ll have watery parts and clumpy parts. I keep it on for about 15 minutes - thats when things start to feel really tight! remove the clay and I immediate put a moisturizer on - preferably one with aloe for a soothing finish. My face sometimes turns red after removing the clay but it goes away in about 30 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> totally recommend see results fast</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel tight and refreshed. I would definitely buy this again, as it is an all natural cheap product that actually does what it says it does. When mixing it with water the mixture is a bit clumpy, but it is otherwise fairly easy to apply. I love having this on my face - it feels nice.&lt;br /&gt;*update: Mix this with natural yoghurt to create a better paste. It also makes the mask easier to wash, and boosts the exfoliating action of the mask.</li>
            <li> So; I have been using this every morning for the past 5 days now. I only planned on using it 1-2 times per week; but I decided to go ahead and use it daily so I could see what potential this stuff had. I have read all sorts of different things ranging from &amp;#34;just a facial&amp;#34; all the way to &amp;#34;it cleared all my acne and now I have perfect skin.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So these are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I still have acne; it is not a miracle cure, please don&#x27;t think that this will end all of your acne related problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. My acne seems to be less severe though. Not in that it&#x27;s cleared up solely using this product, BUT this stuff has visibly reduced the size of my pores and has taken the redness out of my face. So, even though I still have my acne this stuff has done other things that actually make my acne less dramatic. So a BIG plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. My nose has ZERO blackheads now. I have tried everything; from those little painful tools, exfoliating scrubs, those black head strips, proactive, other medications, to numerous home remedies - I could never get rid of the blackheads on my nose (oily skin, mainly nose). 5 days in and the pores on my nose aren&#x27;t even there (well of course they are there but I can&#x27;t see them) and no blackheads! I can&#x27;t even get anything out of it with the tool; so I am assuming my nose is &#x27;squeaky clean&#x27; !! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. It is RELAXING! I wake up with my other half every morning at 5:30am to get him out the door by 6:30am - I have an hour and a half to relax before I start my day (work from home, online school, etc). I use half an hour of that for my facial scrub and mask. I think it has put me in a better mood in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. It really does pulsate, and it really will freeze your face into whatever position you lie in for half an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. DO NOT APPLY IT THICK. The directions say to apply it I believe up to 1/2 inch... really? I use a soft bristled toothbrush from the dollar store (couldn&#x27;t find a brush), and brush a thin layer on my skin. Just enough for complete coverage and not enough for it to be caked on and dripping off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. TIP: if you have extra in your bowl after mixing it and have no way to store it (in otherwords your just going to throw it out) DO NOT rinse it into your sink. Just set it aside (I throw it under my bathroom sink) and in 4-5 hours it hardens up and I just scrape it into the trash. Remember, it&#x27;s mud - you don&#x27;t want to clog your sinks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps anyone reading this! I say it&#x27;s worth every penny. Your face will feel cleaner, fresher, and I believe it will VISIBLY help acne.brush), and brush a thin layer on my skin.

            <li> I like to use this once a week to clean my face and pull out toxins for quick removal.  To begin, I will steam my face to open my pores by applying a towel that has been moistened with hot water.  I mix a very miniscule amount of powder, maybe 1/2 tsp with bentonite clay liquid.  I figure, mixing liquid bentonite with powder bentonite can deliver the most amount of detoxifying properties.  Plus, the liquid is creamy and helps the clay to forms the smoothest texture.  I found that using water would either create something too runny or too clumpy.  I still do get some clumps with my method, so I apply the clumpy bits to areas of my face that are more acne prone.  I save the glass bowl with its remaining residue for the next treatment, so as not to waste any of it.  To prevent clogging my drains, I take a bowl of warm water and dip a towel into it for removal.  Then I dump the water outside.  My face always feels a bit tight and dry after use, but also clean and exfoliated.  To alleviate the dry sensation, I apply a mixture of olive oil and coconut oil afterwards.  This is an affordable way to pamper yourself and keep your skin in mint condition.</li>
            <li> The best! It smooths and firms better than my fancy clay mask I paid 3x as much for. The proof is evident after the 1st use.</li>
            <li> Omg! I used this first on my son, who is acne prone, and then on my self. I mixed equal parts of ACV and healing clay. Our faces became tight and began to pulsate! Ouch! I waited the full 20 minutes and washed off with warm water and then very cold rinse. Then finished off with a toner and moisturizer. My skin looked so clean and the pores were cleared.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to do this every week.</li>
            <li> Seems to  diminishing my acne</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with pretty severe acne since being a teenager. Birth control cleared my skin completely, but after getting off from it and in my early 20s I started to have hormonal breakouts. If you have ever been an unfortunate victim of such thing, you know that it is very , very painful. I have seriously tried everything. Proactive, Mario Badescu, Eminence Organics (which I love). Some of them did more damage than good (Proactive) and some of them are great, but not in my law student price range (Eminence). Anyways, I discovered this recently and it really, really works! I use a good vinegar with \\&quot;the mother\\&quot; and  bought the  Rosallini Packed 4 In 1 Facial DIY Mask Bowl Brush Spoon Tools Set ( under $4) and I use the brush to put it on evenly. I feel it pulsate and afterwards it&#x27;s red, but it goes away. I have very sensitive and other than the temporary redness afterwards, this is gentle enough for me! Sometimes I will use microdermabrasion afterwards (very fine grit) and a Tepezcohuite cream from ASDM Beverly Hills to moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;It sounds like a lot, but it has really cut down on my skin regimen and the cost. I love this stuff and everyday I wake up to better and better skin!</li>
            <li> A friend suggested this product to me and I love it. It&#x27;s the best face mask that I&#x27;ve ever used. A little goes a long way so you definitely get more bang for your buck with this product.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of this clay before. Once I did some research and read reviews I decided to try it.  It is excellent.  I use it once a month and it really keeps my skin feeling clean and smooth!  great.</li>
            <li> I love this clay.  I use it for me and also my teen age son who has a little acne.  It works wonders on his face and my as well.</li>
            <li> The consistency is hard to master, but I&#x27;ll get it eventually. I heard great things about this stuff, and it lives up to my expectations. It makes my skin super soft when I take it off. This stuff is great, I&#x27;ll definitely get more when I use mine all up.</li>
            <li> So far so good. It seems to clear up skin and you really can feel that tightening/pulling sensation. For a home facial? It&#x27;s worth the $10.</li>
            <li> I love that this mask is a powder. You really can feel the pulse as it dries on your skin. I try to use it weekly and absolutely love it. Because you mix it with water, this container travels easily and lasts forever. You can get a lot of uses out of this. I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Tried this out. It&#x27;s not that difficult to mix I used a psore bowl and plastic fork. Easy to dispos of after. I didn&#x27;t feel the pulse or pulling like people described. Just smelled like vinegar. Didn&#x27;t work magic for my face but didn&#x27;t hurt so I give it 4/5</li>
            <li> when i first received the product, i used it once a day for a week. after the first week, i used it once a week.&lt;br /&gt;it has been about a month or two since my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;the product doesn&#x27;t make my face &amp;#34;pulsate&amp;#34; and it doesn&#x27;t make my face red after removal, as many others have mentioned it doing. which is fine, i don&#x27;t really care about that.&lt;br /&gt;after removing the clay mask, my skin feels softer and cleaner, but it does nothing to reduce pore size or remove blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;the product also turns out pretty chunky when you first mix it; however, letting it sit in an airtight container or bag for a while (few hours, days, whatever works) makes it smoother.&lt;br /&gt;all in all, this product is only worth the price because of how long it lasts. otherwise, the quality and effectiveness is average at best.</li>
            <li> I like it very much. I am absolutely amazed at this stuff!This product is high quality and good values!!! good</li>
            <li> My skin feels great, soft,  and smooth. A little goes along way.</li>
            <li> This is mud. It works wonders and refines my skin. I finally started using this after I ran out of my regular mask which was discontinued but the packaging had said that it contained bentonite.  Bentonite is a magic ingredient. You should definitely moisturizer after using it like the other reviews mention. I gave it 5 stars because it is totally worth it for the price and benefits. However, you should know that rinsing it off can get messy. I usually put it on (back and face), let it dry-ish, and rinse in the shower. It will literally fall off in chunks. If you get frustrated, just touch your skin afterwards to be reminded of the benefits! Curious to try this on bug bites in the summer.</li>
            <li> This a wonderful product at a very&lt;br /&gt;reasonable price. I really like it and&lt;br /&gt;will continue to purchase it in the&lt;br /&gt;future.</li>
            <li> Use this with apple cider vinegar. Feels good. Looks Good. Great product!</li>
            <li> Came with easy instructions &amp; tools for installation. Can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s on there. Doesn&#x27;t affect touch screen at all. Only had a few days so we will see how it holds up</li>
            <li> got the recipe from an online blog for making healthy toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t have chemicals and such, so we&#x27;re using it now and so far so good, although can&#x27;t comment as to the long term benefit yet.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used it, and what the jar doesn&#x27;t say is that you only need VERY little clay if you&#x27;re just putting this on your face - probably no more than a tablespoon. My skin felt amazingly soft and clear afterward. I&#x27;m tempted to use it every day, but I&#x27;m sure my skin will freak out if I do. I would gladly buy this again, or gift it to a friend or loved one.</li>
            <li> I use this once a week and am amazed at how well it works! The deep cleaning leaves my face glowing and smooth and I have hardly had any breakouts since I have started using this a month ago</li>
            <li> I ordered this on a whim and I am happy I did. I don&#x27;t have many black heads but I can feel a difference in how clean my skin feels.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good cleanser. I use Bragg&#x27;s apple cider vinegar and I add more of the clay rather than the half to half ratio</li>
            <li> AMAZING clay mask, its not comparable to glamglow supermad but amazing</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used this a few times and I really like it. It tightens my pore without drying and it isn&#x27;t harsh. The only problem I had was getting it. It came off in pieces so it took me a little longer I love the results so I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I swear by aztec secret clay- it shrinks my pores and gives my skin a nice healthy glow. I&#x27;ve gotten all my aunts to use it and some of them , well into their 50s, have gotten amazing results after using it multiple times. The single most important thing to do after using this clay is to moisturize.</li>
            <li> Ridiculously awesome!!! My 49 year old skin loves this stuff every other week</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST mask I have ever found. You don&#x27;t have to use vinegar to mix it, you can use water, but it is best with vinegar. I use it not only on my face, but my legs as well, as I have circulation issues and it revives my legs. I have had a jar for years, as it takes very little and dries quickly.  If you have sensitive skin, do a test patch before applying it to a large area. I hope you love it as much as I do!</li>
            <li> It comes in powder form, then you just mix it with either water or apple cider vinegar.  The first time I used it I mixed it with water.  I was shocked to feel how strong it felt once I put it on.  My face felt like it was pulsing, in a good way.  After I took it off my face was really red, but it says on the jar it&#x27;ll do that.  The redness wears off in about 20 min.  I&#x27;ve also mixed it with apple cider vinegar, it mixes easier with the vinegar, but it seems both water and vinegar mixers work well.  Afterwards my skin feels great!  Love it!!</li>
            <li> I lOve this facial clay!</li>
            <li> Love this product and I recommend it, there is no reason for buying expensive creams to clear your skin, even my 18 year old daughter is using it twice  week and she loves it too.</li>
            <li> this feels so good on my face! has a cooling sensation. I have used this several times now, with water, ACV/water mix and just ACV. for my acne prone face, ACV seems to be the best. I have fairly sensitive skin and this hasn&#x27;t caused any problems, but it has helped clear up my acne!</li>
            <li> A friend and I use this for our weekly facials.  I have oily skin, she has dry skin, so this review is for both skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, this product works well for both.  For dry skin, I recommend mixing with vinegar diluted with some water and a very little oil (I add [[ASIN:B007VEPVZC Bel Essence - (2oz) 100% All-Natural, Organic Anti-Wrinkle Oil Treatment with Argan, Grapeseed and Avocado Oil]] - about 10 drops), it will not be as harsh on dry or sensitive skin.  For oily skin, add the recommended vinegar.  My friend uses a little less than the recommended amount and also adds about 5-10 drops of the oil, and finds that it has a softening effect on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product will completely clean your skin.  Whether oily or dry, your pores will be cleaned out and tightened and your skin will be bright and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT use a lot, a very thin layer on my skin works well, too much, and sometimes the clay falls off before it dries completely (and you go through the product faster, which isn&#x27;t necessary).  A little bit also makes it easier to get off your skin when it dries and you don&#x27;t have chunks of clay going down your drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both of us found that our skin was dry when we washed the clay off.  Even oily skin will be dry, and for oily skin, this can be a problem.  If you strip the oil from your skin, your skin will start over producing oil, so you end up making your oily skin problem worse.  You need to rehydrate your skin after use, and since you have completely cleaned your face, it will absorb any product quickly.  I recommend a great moisturizer.  I use [[ASIN:B00IIPI6CS Bel Essence Intensive Anti Aging Treatment - All-Natural Cream for Erasing Wrinkles. Lift, Firm, Tighten Facial Skin and Fade Fine Lines - 1.5oz]] because it is the best all natural anti-aging cream I have found, it&#x27;s oil based, so it gives your skin what it needs and doesn&#x27;t encourage over production of oil.  It also has vitamins, fatty acids, and omega 3s that your skin needs to build healthy skin - I especially like that.  My friend also uses it, and finds that after the facial, this gives her great results. I&#x27;ve used other big brand moisturizers, but they don&#x27;t have long term results.  The Bel Essence had given both of us great skin that has lasted for months. The clay keeps your skin clear, and then putting the natural moisturizer on your skin (and using a little of the oil in the clay), has given both of us amazing skin, soft, smooth and your pores are noticeably smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HERE&#x27;S THE BEST PART:  If you have lines and wrinkles already, within a couple of weeks of using the two products you will see a HUGE difference.  After a month of using both, the small lines around my eyes and on my upper lip were Gone Gone Gone.  And the deeper lines on my forehead, were well on their way of disappearing - started getting shorter, and less deep, after a month, instead of two deep, straight lines across my forehead, I had one barely there line and the other was a shorter, broken line.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what the clay and bel essence do after a couple more months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we first started this routine, we did it twice a week.  Quickly dropped to once a week because the effects of both the clay and the moisturizer lasted.  After a few months, I&#x27;m doing this between 3-4 times a month depending on my activity.  My oily skin friend still sticks to once a week, but sometimes will go a couple of days longer between facials.  The cream I use every day.  VERY little in the morning (I put make up on top of it, so don&#x27;t want to use too much) and then a normal application in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t overdo, your skin gets stripped every time you use the clay, so you have to give your skin time to recover.  I find that doing this routine at night before I shower is easier (you rinse off the clay in the shower), however, I usually wipe a lot of the clay off with a paper towel before jumping in the shower, just to be safe that I don&#x27;t clog the drain.  When your skin is warm from the shower, it absorbs the anti-aging cream even better.  This is an EXCELLENT combination.  My skin tone is even, and even better, the fine lines around my eyes, mouth and on my forehead are completely gone.  Same with my friend - her skin responded even better to the combination and her lines even on her forehead are almost gone.  If you want to put off aging, this is the way to do it!  My friend has fewer breakouts, and she has also found that her skin is not as oily between facials.  We both get compliments on our skin (friends ask me what foundation I use - NONE - because they tell me my skin is so great looking I have to be using a new makeup.  NO, just great skin care.)  What sells me on both the Indian Clay and the Bel Essence is that it works just as well on both dry and oily skin.  Can&#x27;t recommend this combination of products highly enough.r, it absorbs the anti-aging cream even better.  This is an EXCELLENT combination.

            <li> I mix this with apple cider vinegar like the instructions say and it makes my skin feel good. I use it on my face, chest, and arms. It feels good.</li>
            <li> I have used this product many years ago and recently I decided to try it again. I used the paste before but decided to try the powder this time. I absolutely love it. You can feel your skin tightening when it dries off on your face and when you wash it off you can see how clean your skin is. I use it on my face once a week for 20 mimutes and my skin feels fresh, young and clean.</li>
            <li> This clay really helps define the natural curl pattern of my hair and cleanses my hair as well. Also makes it easier to detangle. Very happy with the results!</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff, Because of health reason I take testosterone everyday, the result of this gave me a chest full of acne and shoulders sore with acne. None of that store bought &amp;#34;science&amp;#34; junk ever made a dent. Soon as i got this stuff and my raw apple cider vinegar, BAM! no more acne, my chest and back are healing up good and without being attacked by more acne. I recently even re-ordered some, bought the 2lb this time. Make sure to get the raw apple cider vinegar to go with it, makes a big difference and its worth it as well.</li>
            <li> I would give this stuff 10 stars if I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this because of the reviews &amp; because I have bad acne and not a lot of money!&lt;br /&gt;It showed up today and one pound is much more than I thought. It is literally a jar of dirt...MAGIC DIRT.&lt;br /&gt;I put some in a ziplock baggie with some water until some of the chunks broke apart..(It is pretty difficult to mix and get to a consistent texture, just work it around a little bit).&lt;br /&gt;It was a bit of a mess, so I suggest using a facial stick and bowl rather than a bag like I did.&lt;br /&gt;I smeared it on, easy enough, and waited for it to dry for about 30 mins.&lt;br /&gt;It tingled and after awhile, I could not move my face at all.&lt;br /&gt;At that point, I patted it wet with some paper towels. Once it was creamy again, I continued to wipe it off with paper towels and finally with a washcloth when there was barely any left..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and OH MY GOODNESS!! No blackheads at all and my skin was incredibly smooth. I am a person with oily &amp; dry skin with terrible blackheads and nothing seems to unclog my pores.. not fancy facials at the salon or anything.. but this did!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this forever! I love the way it makes my skin feel and I could not be more pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have blackheads and/or clogged pores, GET THIS NOW.</li>
            <li> OMG ! WHY DID I TAKE SO LONG TO BUY THIS ! THIS MASK IS TRULY AMAZING ! AND YOU WILL FEEL THE TENSE ON YOUR FACE WHEN YOU APPLY IT . MY SKIN WAS LEFT WITH A GLOW, AND MY ACNE IS A BIT VISIBLE , WHICH I LOVE. I WILL BE USING THIS MASK AT LEAST 2X A WEEK ! THANKS ! AND IT WILL LAST YOU FOR A LONG TIME .</li>
            <li> Omg This Clay Is Amazing. I Highly Recommend This For Anyone Insecure About Their Facial Features. This Clay Is Literally Life</li>
            <li> Now I know why the Aztec Indian civilization has gone extinct. They were killed for their &amp;#34;secret&amp;#34; healing clay. Now that we have this miracle product, you must use it! Don&#x27;t let the death of the Aztecs be in vain. Buy this stuff and put it on your skin. You will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it on two separate occasions. I don&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s very hard to rinse off, and my face felt itchy and irritated after I was done. It went in the trash.</li>
            <li> This product does everything it says it is supposed to. You can feel your skin tightening and it seems to clean your pores like it says it should.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne and decent sized pores and uneven skin tone for most of my life. Things like proactive and clean and clear just made it worse. This stuff actually works. By the time your week is up you notice your skin looking kind of sad and I have yet to be able to make it 100% smooth like most clay masks, which is why I gave it a 4. I suggest a zippy and usually add 3 times the amount of water to the amount of clay.</li>
            <li> it makes my skin feel amazing! you can use it all over your body, face, booty, chest, bnack, you name it!</li>
            <li> This is such a great value! The clay powder can be used so many ways and I especially like making a face mask by mixing it with apple cider vinegar- it makes your face tingle and feels amazing afterwards!</li>
            <li> This masque is extremely amazing. I&#x27;ve tried expensive ones from sephora and sometimes it&#x27;s a hit and miss but for $6-$7, this is the best masque I&#x27;ve ever tried. You could definitely get this at your local whole foods store for around $6 and I definitely recommend getting the Bragg&#x27;s Organic Apple Cider with it b/c it is much better than your regular vinegar (you could still use any brand vinegar but Bragg&#x27;s is the best). Other options would be water but I find that the vinegar gives it a better, smooth consistency than water (less clumpy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m honestly really happy and excited about this masque. It is all natural and it&#x27;s the cheapest thing you&#x27;ll find that actually does its job. The first time I tried it, it was extremely painful and left my face red (like all the reviewers have mentioned). It was so tight that I could actually feel my blood vessels pulsating. Prior to using this masque, I had some minor acne scars that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of and clogged pores by the side of my chin. I&#x27;ve been using this masque consistently (every two days) and now those scars are a distant memory and those clogged pores are no longer there. After every masque session, I use Thayer&#x27;s all natural Witch Hazel Rose toner (you can also find this at Whole Foods) and it soothes, cleanses, and closes up those opened pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;ve seen my face feeling tighter, less acne, smaller pores, and just overall feeling great. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been following Amazon&#x27;s customer rating system for over 10 years and I have never been dissappointed with a positive rating UNTIL NOW!!!!!  What a piece of junk!!!!!!  The blades bent on my on the first time I tried an onion.  I just can&#x27;t believe this piece of crap got such great ratings unless the company has really changed it&#x27;s product!  Save your money!</li>
            <li> very little is required to create a mask. can feel it working within minutes. very pleased with product. Fast service too</li>
            <li> I use this product off and on throughout the months, so I dont know if I use it enough to see actual benefits. When applying, it does tighten my face giving it a lifting feeling. It can be harsh though if left on too long. I left it on for about 15 -20 minutes on my nose, which caused it to peel badly. I would suggest looking this up on YouTube with how to actually apply and use this product.</li>
            <li> The aztec secret is the best clay facial I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I love this because;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;-You get so much for your money &amp; It actually works.&lt;br /&gt;-Its easy to make &amp; fun to use. I feel like Im getting a facial from a spa.&lt;br /&gt;-You can use it anywhere! I have used it not only on my face, but thighs as well ( It does wonders for cellulite.) And great to soothe bug bites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great substitute for vinegar is lemon juice. &amp; with the lemon juice, It brightens skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I can literally feel my face pulsing when it&#x27;s on there. It leaves my face feeling soo smooth. If I have a blemish it is gone 2 days after I use this. The only thing that doesn&#x27;t work for me is it doesn&#x27;t extract my black heads like other people say</li>
            <li> This mask is amazing. You can literally see and feel it pulling impurities out of your pores. I don&#x27;t put it as thick as they specify on the jar because it would take forever to dry. I do apply a good amount of it and leave it on for at least 30-40 minutes. Your face gets so tight that it almost feels painful but it&#x27;s totally worth it. Just one tip if you&#x27;re rinsing the mask off in your sink: after awhile, all that clay going down the drain will clog it, so what I do (since the mask tends to come off in pieces and not dissolve in water) is I take a full sheet of paper towel, like Bounty (you need a durable brand) and place it in the sink so that as I rinse, all the chunks of mask collect in the paper towel and I save my drain from getting clogged. Once I finish, I just gather the paper towel and the clay pieces and throw it out. Easy peasy!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, it&#x27;s a powder that you mix with either water or apple cider vinegar to make a mask consistency. If you mix it with water (hot or cold - it doesn&#x27;t make a difference) it doesn&#x27;t mix together. It&#x27;s chunky and gross and it doesn&#x27;t go on your skin right. If you mix it with the apple cider vinegar, it mixes very well, but you have to deal with the disgusting smell of vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the whole \\&quot;feel your skin pulsate\\&quot; or whatever everyone&#x27;s saying is more like \\&quot;feel your skin BURN.\\&quot; It freaking burns!! Thinking about your skin pulsating (at least to me) is feeling like your face is being massaged, not feeling like your skin is burning off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, washing this stuff off is a joke. If you mix it with water, it washes off a little easier just because it never formed a very good mask/paste so it&#x27;s a bit easier than having to scrape it off when you use the apple cider vinegar. I just spent 20 minutes with the mask (mixed with the vinegar) on my face and then another 20 minutes trying to wash the crap off. No matter how thick/thin you put it on, it still hurts to wash off (though it hurts worse if you put it on thin.. If you put it on thick, parts of it are easy to scrape/peel off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, the redness after using it is kinda scary! I thought I was having an allergic reaction the first time I used it. I have acne.. Pimples, zits, black heads, big pores, you name it. Well, it made the bumps lay down for a few hours (which was exciting at first because I had no idea they&#x27;d pop back up) and it kinda \\&quot;hid\\&quot; my black heads (I probably still had clay in my pores).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason this is getting 2 stars instead of 1 is because my skin does feel clean after I use it. To me, it&#x27;s not some magical awesome mask that&#x27;s gonna solve all your skin issues - it&#x27;s just a mask to clean your skin. And it&#x27;s not one of those relaxing masks you&#x27;d want at a girls night or during a massage (unless you like it when your face is burning and you can&#x27;t move it because it keeps getting tighter and tighter).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. I know everyone has different skin and it may work for other people in different ways, but with my sensitive skin, it&#x27;s not worth the trouble.ke it when your face is burning and you can&#x27;t move it because it keeps getting tighter and tighter).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. I know everyone has different skin and it may work for other people in different ways, but with my sensitive skin, it&#x27;s not worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> Takes away black heads, makes you feel clean and refreshed. I mixed mine with equal parks ACV. Highly recommend for anyone with breakouts or black heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product. A few things to note on usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Use Apple cider vinegar to mix it, if you use water it&#x27;ll clump and be difficult to mix/wash down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;2. Rather than try to measure out the amount of clay and apple cider and vinegar with a spoon, simply pour desired amount of clay and SLOWLY add ACV and mix with each pour until desired consistency is reached.&lt;br /&gt;3. More product used the thicker and stronger the throbbing action is&lt;br /&gt;4. It is very drying, so I like to first wash/dry my face and apply a layer of Extra-virgin Coconut oil for 15 minutes before applying the mask&lt;br /&gt;5. If it&#x27;s a very THICK mask, it&#x27;s best to just hop in a shower, whereas a thin mask may be washed off at the sink.&lt;br /&gt;6. Apply moisturizer after application of the mask&lt;br /&gt;7. Don&#x27;t use it everyday...&lt;br /&gt;8. I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in a DIY deodorant recipe, specifically to quit using standard retail deodorants which rely on aluminum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news: it works great!&lt;br /&gt;The bad news: the chemical formula for calcium bentonite clay is (Na,Ca) (Al,Mg)6(Si4010)3(OH)6-nH20.  Bentonite is an absorbent aluminium phyllosilicate.  The &amp;#34;Al&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;aluminium&amp;#34; both tell the bad news:  part of why it is effective is because of its aluminum makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are okay with absorbing aluminum into your system, by all means, use this product.  I, for one, will not use it as a face mask, and will NOT use it in future deodorant recipes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but for me the apple cider vinegar was too strong had to use aloe Vera juice it did it&#x27;s job did what I wanted it to do it detox my scalp my hair was on a stand before I used this I can Apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li> I  used this as part of my routine before my wedding and I still use it now to maintain optimum skin clarity.  I use it on my face, neck, shoulders, and chest to slough off all dead skin cells and make skin glow.  Amazing stuff! and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I began using this as soons as I got it. I am currently deployed and my skin is super dry and was not soft. after using this, i used water, and i felt it tighten and once i washed it off after 20 min i could feel th edifference in my skin. i will porbably use this once a week. i love it! just make sure you have a little scooper, and bowl to mix. i had to use half a water bottle with a little water but same . it really is a mud mask so be prepared to have a dirt face and some extra washing is required to get it off. put on before shower works great!</li>
            <li> Please make sure you dont rinse off this make in your bathroom sink as it comes off on clumps and it clogs your drain. The mask itself works well but the result is not friendly for pipes.</li>
            <li> I have tried hundreds of masque&#x27;s for my skin and this is by far the best one I have ever used! Finally! The search is over! I bought the DIY face mask bowl from amazon.com to mix the product and brush onto my face. It tightened, cleaned, smoothed, and purified my face so much my face was glowing!</li>
            <li> Seemed okay until I opened it to use a second time and it was MOLDY. Has this happened to anyone else?!</li>
            <li> Works awesome. Definitely better than any product I&#x27;ve tried before. It&#x27;s not a miracle drug even though it&#x27;s advertised that way. It works great on facial issues, blackheads, and also on dead skin on feet and athlete&#x27;s foot. Make sure to mix with apple cider vinegar for best effect (stinks, but whatever!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save 30 minutes for each treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been telling everyone about this magic clay; my skin looks radiant after using it! I also purchased the recommended Organic Apple Cider Vinegar. You only need about a tablespoon of the clay powder mixed with the vinegar for each facial...so this product will last a very long time!  Oh and I always get the nicest comments about my youthful skin after my clay cleansing!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It freaked me out the first time I used it because my face looked like I had a bad sunburn after I washed it off, but as the other reviewers have said, it fades within an hour. Just make sure not to use it right before going somewhere. It&#x27;s a great mask; works really well.</li>
            <li> Okay people - I always do my research before buying a new product. I read up, down, sideways, and backwards before buying this. I have been making my own facial masks for years, using ingredients that we all probably have located in our kitchens. Natural is the ONLY way to go in way of skin care, some people might disagree with my there, but to each their own. No one knows your skin as well as YOU do - you are the one living under there. Anyways, I am a licensed cosmologist, and unfortunately through the every day use of harsh chemicals found in everyday products, I developed a major allergy. All things from shampoo to lotion to body sprays, make me break out and itch, turning red from head to toe. It was quite embarrassing and annoying to say the least. Over the years, I have weeded out almost all of chemical products to replace them with things that are all natural, and that I can make on my own. Not only has this saved me lots of money, but I have almost completely rid myself of my skin irritations. I am always on the look out for new, natural products that I haven&#x27;t tried before. I came across this clay through Amazon, and like I said, I researched till I was blue in the face. I decided to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW. You really can feel the mask PULSATING against your skin, drawing out whatever lurks deep down in there. I have a pretty clean, chemical free lifestyle, but this mask was still able to reach down deep and draw out impurities. I peeled the dry mask off of my nose, and could see my blackheads coming with it, like you would in a Biore pore strip. It was pretty amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies and Gents, if you break out after using this product ONE time, please do not feel discouraged. Simple, as other reviews have stated, the mask is drawing all of the dirt to the top of the skin. Hang in there, it takes time for your skin and body to push out all of the  gunk. Give it a chance to really work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also use this product to take a detox bath, which I have yet to try but will definitely do so soon. You could also put it in a foot soak, make it thinner to do hair/scalp treatment, or put it over any part of your body you&#x27;d like to detox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next goal is to find a good food grade clay, to take to detox the inside of the body. People (and animals) have been detoxing with clay for centuries. Unfortunately, Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay, is not food grade, and for external use only. But I would 100% recommend for anyone to try this clay. Our skin and bodies are not meant to have chemicals slathered all over them from night till day! This really DETOXES you, so be prepared. Also - I would recommend to put a moisturizer on ASAP once you take the mask off, as it can be drying. I used organic jojoba, or my second fave organic coconut oil. Happy detoxing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****UPDATE 12/14/13****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still LOVE this mask, and I even got my man to used it. I must say....PLEASE do not OVER USE. I did make that mistake. My skin shriveled and dried up, and was very flakey. I got over excited at the wonderful benefits that I saw in my first few times using this product. This mask REALY gets in there and SUCKS out everything, so please do not over use. I would say after your first few times, maybe once every 2.5 weeks will be enough. The healing process took a while, but I was able to speed it up with my dry bush. After the flakes were gone, my nice healthy skin was back. I highly recommend, just please do not get too overzealous with this. Its far too powerful! Hope this helps :)h, which I have yet to try but will definitely do so soon.

            <li> Best face mask I have ever found. Great as a full face mask or just use it on your trouble areas. My face and pores have never felt/looked so clean!!!!!! I&#x27;m amazed</li>
            <li> Woah, this stuff is fantastic! I am sitting here as I type with it sitting on my face, and my skin is pulsating! It&#x27;s drying, at this point, and it&#x27;s really tightening... Mixing it was super easy- for a lack of apple cider vinegar in my dorm I used water- and application was a little messy, but not bad at all. I can also see little black dots of what is hopefully dirt and grime from my pores popping up on the mask, which is exciting... (Always looking for a way to get rid of those blackheads.) At any rate, this is a fantastic product; and cheaper from Amazon than it was at my local Whole Foods!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times now and I like it.  It&#x27;s a clay mask so get used to the pruning or tugging effect or what everyone else calls pulsating.  I&#x27;m still unnerved by the redness it causes, but it does dissipate within the hour and definitely by morning.  It does bring impurities to the surface so some may experience a breakout, but I&#x27;d say not many people will.&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to follow the instructions, don&#x27;t put too much product on your face and rinse off completely and thoroughly.  I think you&#x27;ll be pleased with results, especially with consistent use.  I use Kiehl&#x27;s Midnight Recovery Serum afterward to ensure I get enough moisture back into my face, but with a lighter touch than a heavy cream.</li>
            <li> This is a messy dry powder you mix with either water of vinegar. I have bought every clay mask sold old there. this is worthless in my opinion. Did not pull out any oil or blackheads, took forever to dry,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now and my blackheads are still there, there haven&#x27;t been any noticeable improvements to my acne scars. I&#x27;d say they look they same if I hadn&#x27;t been using this. It makes your skin feel good after using it but it hasn&#x27;t had any effects so far.</li>
            <li> This is awesome i have clear skin now</li>
            <li> I used this with raw apple cider vinegar in hopes it would get rid of my blackheads, but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t spend the time to write reviews but this product is so brilliant I thought I&#x27;d do one anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me begin by warning others that before you open the can that it is a VERY FINE POWDER. For some reason I was expecting something else and when I opened it I was not careful and it went everywhere. After my little ordeal, I tried another member&#x27;s suggestion of using a sandwich ziploc bag to kneed the mixture together. With water it was still fairly clumpy and I haven&#x27;t yet tried it with apple cider vinegar. Regardless, I went to paste it on and since it was my first time, it wasn&#x27;t very even and my mixture was a bit runny. As I let the product dry, I felt exactly what the product description said I would. My skin began to PULSATE and I could FEEL IT WORKING. After about ~20min, I began to wash the clay off my face. Looking into the mirror, I noticed my pores shrunk and that the oils, gunk, and whatever else was inside was literally being pulled out of my skin. After washing off the clay, I could see the gunk that had been pulled out from deep within my pores. After such amazing results I wanted to immediately do it again but I realize that this stuff is heavy duty and it probably wouldn&#x27;t be healthy to do it so often. I&#x27;m looking forward to my next mask!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and did my research on this product before I bought it. With my teenage daughter breaking out and my face oily I decided to purchase this product. We stared feeling the tingling, tightening and pulsating feeling in our faces so knew it was working. It really cleaned our faces and shrinked my pores. I love this stuff I will be ordering another jar when I get low.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t seen what all the fuss is about this mask. I used Bragg&#x27;s apple cider vinegar, left it on my face for 20-30 minutes. I felt the pulsating and my skin looked smooth with smaller pores right after both treatments I did. Then a few hours later, I am back to normal. Pores, blackheads, et cetera. Seems gimmicky.</li>
            <li> if you want the tingling effect, you must apply it on immediately after mixing the vinegar and clay--at least for me.&lt;br /&gt;It works pretty good.  Yes, it leaves a red mark all over face(almost like sunburn), but it goes away after a few hours.  Leaves skin soft and feeling refreshed.  I use about 3 times a month.  My pores do look much more refined and blackheads are less noticeable.  If you put on a lot of this mask--however, it will be a little harder to take off.  Sometimes, scrubbing is needed--as hot water doesn&#x27;t seem enough.  But, it is a good mask and I feel every woman should have this stuff in their household!  I will warn though, if you have sensitive skin (like myself), it does tend to burn in the beginning.  To avoid this, let the mix stand a minute or so or use water not vinegar.  I have some acne as well, so this could also be the issue.</li>
            <li> It hasen&#x27;t really made a significant a change in my skin I can&#x27;t say I love it but I can&#x27;t say I hate it... But as for my hair I loooovve it!!! My scalp has so much build up and I have sebhorric dermatitis but it  really does help with everything and my scalp feels extremely clean!</li>
            <li> thanks to this mask i dont have acne anymore&lt;br /&gt;after years of searching for a good product  i found this aztec mask i went to the best doctors in virginia but my acne continue when i found this a miracle happen.... my face is clear ✅</li>
            <li> first of all, i&#x27;ve seen people blaming real customers for being payed to write the reviews, well, i&#x27;m a real customer and this was my first time buying this because i was absolutely lost. i didn&#x27;t know what to do about my acnee anymore. i never had acnee as a teenager and now at 23 i was breaking out so bad because of stress and nothing i tried worked. i tried all the famous brands and nothing did anything for it. i bought this as a last try and HOLY CRAP it worked!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i used it with apple cider vinegar because it seems to work the best for acnee and black heads. when i first got it i used it every 2 days for 6 days until my acnee was gone. now i use it every week to keep my skin clean. i even use it on my husband. i could never make his black heads go away and when using it on him it worked in first try. 80% of his face was clean of black heads after just 1 use.. i don&#x27;t let it dry completely because professionals say it&#x27;s not ok to do it. i take it off when it&#x27;s still a little damp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my grandma has been using clay masks weekly for over 10 years. she&#x27;s 70 and no wrinkles at all, no saggy skin . this is the pure truth. she&#x27;s been teaching me to mix it with egg yolk, yoghurt, milk, and other stuff for different skin problems. warning though, when used with apple cider it WILL dry your skin. i apply a little coco butter or shea butter on my face after washing it off. also, never use it around your eyes and lips, the skin is sensitive and it WILL cause it to wrinkle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;im a very happy customer and will be continuing my clay routine from now on</li>
            <li> I use this once a month for perfect skin, I love this face mask.</li>
            <li> Great for my acne prone skin</li>
            <li> I have only used this once and I used it on my hair not my skin but it left my hair clean without any build up in it.</li>
            <li> After 1 application, I can actually see beautiful muscular features!  Shall return with fair assessment: I do believe it is the answers to my prayers in maintaining good facial contours.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I have all my friends hooked on it now. Make sure to use it with Apple Cider Vinegar and your golden. Cheap, natural and with instant results. 5+ stars. Try it ladies!</li>
            <li> Ive used this two days now with one day off in between.  It has caused a small initial breakout but I expected that from all the other reviews.  It does draw up the gross stuff from your skin....like if you have little cysts with the clear gunk that just keeps oozing....try this on them overnight.  It reduced alot of that oozing for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the smallest tub I could on here and its still like a 5 yr supply!  Excellent product for the money.  I paid under $8.00.</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrific!  I used to mix it with water and got lots of clumps.  I followed a fellow reviewer&#x27;s advice for mixing and now have wonderful results.  I put 1 tablespoon of the clay in a ziploc bag and add one tablespoon plus a smidge more of ACV (apple cider vinegar) and mix/knead away.  It mixes much more smoothly and completely with the ACV!  I have some ACV diluted with water 50/50 already in my bathroom and use this.  It works!  Then, I tear open the plastic bag, get the clay on my fingers and apply to my face.  When I have used all I want to use, I just throw the rest away.  There is not much left, so I do not feel like I am wasting a lot of this product.  Now I need to master ways to remove the mask from my face without the product going down my drain and risking a clog.  (I have very old drains/pipes!).</li>
            <li> Great mask, reduces my cystic breakouts overnight.</li>
            <li> Works well to shrink pores. Gets pretty messy, especially when washing it off. You get great results from using this product though. You can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> My face felt like a baby&#x27;s butt afterwards and that&#x27;s soft! This clay comes ALIVE on your face after you apply it - you literally feel it moving and getting it on with your skin! I&#x27;ve tried a few different clays and this one impresses me. I&#x27;m definitely tempted to use it more than the two times a week it recommends because it feels that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heads up: This product requires liquid (water or apple cider vinegar). Apple cider vinegar smells as repulsive as vinegar is expected to when you being mixing and applying it. You get used to it though, just be ready when you first try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this quantity will last a really long time. You don&#x27;t need that much at all with each use. I would say this will last years (unless you&#x27;re sharing it with someone else). I paid $7.99 for a pound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestion: You may try using Acnomel Acne Medication Creme alongside this product. I have adult acne and the two of these products feel like a godsend to my skin.</li>
            <li> I really loved it and used the whole thing for the family and they all had great results.!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the greatest, and its a nice big jar so it&#x27;ll last me a good long time. I usually dilute the apple cider vinegar they say to use in the directions because I just hate the smell of vinegar but it does a great job and your face feels so nice and clean after.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my face for about two weeks. A couple weekends ago I got some really bad sunburn on my face and legs. I used this on my face and had absolutely no peeling. It wasn&#x27;t even dry, although I do follow up with some lotion after using the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My legs were another story. Painful and flakey. Had I known this product was so effective on sunburn I would have slathered it on everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also amazing for acne. I discontinued use of all of my other products and just use this clay mask, Aveeno face lotion, and fresh lime juice as a toner. It has really increased my confidence.</li>
            <li> My younger sister and I tried this healing clay out as a facial and honestly, it really isn&#x27;t anything special or amazing by any means. It gets really hard on your face and starts cracking, soon all you&#x27;ll have is a big mess to take off of your face. Prepare to clog up your sink....&lt;br /&gt;I asked her if she felt ANY difference and she shrugged and said &amp;#34;eh not really...&amp;#34; Its just like Noxzema. But in my opinion Nox is better and less messy. Not to mention WAY less expensive. My skin felt smooth but not great or amazing. It really didn&#x27;t &#x27;unclog&#x27; my pores any more than any other generic facial cleaner. I can&#x27;t judge for insect bites or those other uses it claims to be great for. Hopefully it&#x27;ll pull through &amp; be a better use for something else worth spending 10+ bucks for.</li>
            <li> Made way too much the first go round, but have found it to be a very useful tool in my arsenal of tricks.</li>
            <li> This is a very strong powder not a cream.</li>
            <li> So as a 22 year old female college student, I break out here and there(usually stress or hormones). Sometimes a little, sometimes a lot. I figured I would give this a shot to complement with my current skin routine. I currently use epiduo gel from my dermatologist as a topical cream and a low dose pill for my hormonal acne. I mainly wanted to try this to give my skin a &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34; pretty much. I have never had a facial so I know this is probably the closest my skins ever gotten to a detox. What I did was mix 1/4 cup water and 1/4 clay in a plastic bowl and mixed it with a plastic spoon. It was very lumpy so I added more water but that didn&#x27;t help much. What I did was put the lumpy mix on my face/neck and rubbed it in circular motions. It ended up thinning out and looking like a regular mask that you would buy from the store. Still a few lumps here and there but mostly smooth once on my skin and rubbed in the circular motion. I sat and wait and let me just say - I definitely felt the &amp;#34;pulsating&amp;#34;. It was awesome. Then it got very uncomfortable about 5 min later. I couldn&#x27;t move my mouth or face! It was actually kind of funny. I put it on my neck because with hormonal acne, I get a few breakouts under my neck and jawline. Not a very comfortable feeling and I wanted to rip it off. But beauty is pain. I recommend laying down and watching TV with it on where you don&#x27;t need to move your face alot. I then removed the mask 20 minutes later in the shower with warm water and my hands. Then used a washcloth for the remains on my face. I followed with a gentle facial scrub. The results? Smooth &amp;#34;detoxed&amp;#34; feeling skin. I really feel like I experienced a facial. Well a &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; &amp;#34;somewhat uncomfortable&amp;#34; facial of course. I can&#x27;t wait to see what the results are in the next couple weeks. I can honestly say that you feel instant results of freshness and smoothness on your face. Not sure about the actual removal of acne and scarring but we will see!</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel smooth and clean ☺️</li>
            <li> Going in the trash! Not practical!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I actually buy it at the Whole Foods down the street but they told me that they have a hard time keeping it in stock.  It is painful in a weird sort of way and you really have to scrub to get it off but the results are worth it.  I swear I look a few years younger the day after use!  I don&#x27;t have many problems with acne anymore at my age (35) but I wish I would have known about this product 10 years ago.  Fun tip:  use this mask and then follow it up with a Biore blackhead strip.  You will be amazed by the results!</li>
            <li> I should start by saying I am a pretty even-skinned person to begin with. I tried this as a face mask and liked it overall. The &#x27;pulling&#x27; sensation they mention in the description is actually sort of uncomfortable. I think I will just use this as a replacement for the pore strips I used to use on my nose. Putting it on the rest of my face caused some dry patchy areas.</li>
            <li> she was inlove with this product ..she gave me a long explanation of what this was for and how well it worked for her ...she was amazed and that made me happy .thanks for selling such excellent products</li>
            <li> Great mask! I am an avid mask user, tried all kinds. This is wonderful! I have underlying pimples/bumps and this cleared them up immediately! Great product, use the cider and water. SUPER quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Excellent mud for cleaning your pores and exfoliating your skin.  Works like a charm.  Definitely worth trying.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use vinegar with it if your face is dry. Use the water method instead. You should always, always, and I mean ALWAYS test a patch of skin before applying over your whole face. Read up on things ladies! I never tried mixing it with vinegar cause I have google and before I try anything I research the tar out of it. This does work however, I have very oily skin on most of my face but my t zone is very dry so it dried it out even more. I didn&#x27;t cake a ton on just used a thin layer and it worked. Not the best I have tried for my face. Once a month would probably be fine. If you mix with water you shouldn&#x27;t have the lines like mixing it with vinegar. I will probably use this up and move on to something else. It was ok.</li>
            <li> 1. It does tighten once the mask starts to dry. It will crack and you can see (between the cracks)your skin being pulled.&lt;br /&gt;2. Since your skin it being tighten YES your skin WILL pulsate!.I like that feeling 😊&lt;br /&gt;3. Leaves your skin smooth and squeaky clean&lt;br /&gt;4. Overall an awesome mask.&lt;br /&gt;5. I started using it with apple cider vinegar (1st time) then added peppermint and tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;6. Not for everyday use. Twice per week is enough. It helps with oily skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this. I mix with a apple cider vinegar, activated charcoal, tea tree oil, and turmeric for an amazing facemask. A little goes a long way and I love it</li>
            <li> This is the mask I was looking for! I tried everything from mud masks to indian multani matti but nothing cleared my skin like this did. After just one use, I saw a HUGE difference. Use it wilth apple cider and it will do wonders for your skin! I will definitely be buying it again. I usually dont write reviews but this product deserves it!</li>
            <li> perfect&lt;br /&gt;super easy to use, apply with brush as I watch some youtube videos , that made it go on like paint or icing.&lt;br /&gt;i let it stay on until completely dry, ( a lite shade of green), appox 45 mins.&lt;br /&gt;it did however take some time to take off, as did not want to rush and irritated my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s seems good for a monthly treatment but a weekly treatment would be too harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> next time do not put a label on the english instructions. :(</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it really lifted all the dirt and oils frm my face but my blackheads were still there. I was really hoping it would take away my blackheads but I guess it didn&#x27;t and that&#x27;s the type of skin I have. It surely works for many other people. I will keep on using it because it leaves my face soft (:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this review in a few weeks. The clay just arrived earlier this week. I&#x27;ve been using it every night mixing it with apple cider vinegar and letting a good layer dry on my face for 30 minutes to an hour. I&#x27;ve been mixing 1TBS ACV to 1TBS of the clay in a small zip lock bag and it&#x27;s enough for 2 masks. I use half the first night and the other half stays fresh in the zip lock. I put it on so it&#x27;s just thick enough that I can&#x27;t see my skin through it.  I can feel my skin pulsate while it&#x27;s on. My face is a little red after I rinse it off but for no more than an hour...maybe.  And only slightly red. It does feel clean and refreshed afterwards. A little drying. Nothing bad. Some people complain about the smell. It is vinegar. And it only lasts for the first few minutes while the clay is starting to dry. And its better than any salon I&#x27;ve ever walked into. The product does what it says it will do and so far it&#x27;s great. I&#x27;ll update after I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of weeks to see if anything changes. I&#x27;m 27/m/combo skin/no real acne just slightly clogged pores.....if that helps.</li>
            <li> I have been seeing rave reviews about Indian Clay and how it can be used for a variety of things. My first use was a clay treatment for my transitioning hair. I mixed it with a little almond oil and apple cider vinegar. I tell you the end results have my hair and scalp feeling so much more clean and refreshed. I will be doing my clay treatment once a month from here on out. Next I will be using it as a face mask to clean out my pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this as a face mask, cellulite mask, and toothpaste. I&#x27;m not impressed. I don&#x27;t really get it I guess. I&#x27;m a big fan of essential oils and natural alternatives, but I&#x27;m having a hard time with this clay. All I did with it was make messes.</li>
            <li> I have never used a lot of skin care products except oil of olay and soap. recently I had a facial and deciced to achieve the same  results at home. this does a great job, mixing it in bagiie means I can keep it on the counter and not waste any. I used the vinegar and it was ok the first three times, then it was too drying! I like this stuff, and I wash it off in the shower, I get more mud on my feet from gardening.</li>
            <li> Definitely can feel the mask deep cleaning your face. I haven&#x27;t used it consistently enough to see results like everyone else claims, as it can be pretty hard to get off without using the shower or sink. Really dries out your skin to the point where it drinks up all of your moisturizer, but that&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li> Rinsing it off is somewhat of a pain since it can clog drains, but other than that it works perfectly! If it doesn&#x27;t completely remove the gunk in your pores (especially in your nose), it&#x27;ll definitely lift it out partially, so just rub the skin gently after you use it and it&#x27;ll come off and your skin will be really smooth.</li>
            <li> Cleans your pores and makes skin really smooth.I mis it with apple cider vinegar and water.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff... Clears up acne and scars, gives a glow and takes away dark circles. I&#x27;m half way through my jar of wonderfulness. Thank you</li>
            <li> I would give this product 5 stars, but it is a bit messy. I had to buy little disposable bowls and spoons to mix this with as it comes in a powder form to be mixed with water and hardens quickly. I worry about rinsing the excess down the sink as it may harden and cause clogged pipes. Therefore, having a disposable bowl and mixing utensil work better for me. I have combination skin so I only use it on the oily areas and it is very refressing and my skin glows, feels tighter and much healthier once I wash it off.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been consistent as I should be. But I love this clay. I&#x27;ve been experimenting and mixing it with different things. Have yet to settle on one that I&#x27;m religious with.</li>
            <li> I bought this on behalf of my daughter.  She loves using it as a mask to dry out oily pores but she has also found it works really well as a neutrally colored finishing powder.  It sets her make-up and absorbs oil and keeps shine at bay all day.  It comes in a fine powder, which she mixes into a paste that she applies onto her skin using a small paint brush when using as a mask.  She&#x27;s really finicky about her make-up and is always searching for the best setting powder.  It was a happy accident that this works better than anything else she tried.  Just dusts over her foundation with a makeup brush like any loose powder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in the beauty industry for over 13 years and my Sales territory has included Manhattan and surrounding areas. I&#x27;ve done Beauty trade shows at the Javitz Center in Manhattan, NY too so I know a thing or two about skin and beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product completely blew me away. First off, I haven&#x27;t given myself a mask treatment since I was a teenager and now I&#x27;m in my mid fourties. After just one use, my skin the next day was unbelievably different! I kid you not. I used the clay and water (figured I would try that first and then see if I needed the apple cidar vinegar) and then after rinsing off and patting dry, I applied organic unrefined shea butter (which I also purchased on here) on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so busy that I forgot about the facial but the next morningI was doing dishes and over my sink is a mirror (no kitchen window in my condo) and when I looked up at my makeup free face, I immediately noticed how much smoother my skin looked. You have to try it for yourself to understand exactly what I mean. If you have a nut or latex allergy I do not recommend using shea butter! I also use argan oil (on my skin) as part of my pre-makeup application but not on my eyes (Shea has more staying power and argan oil makes my eye makeup come off). Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Definitely use it with the Apple Cider Vinegar- it is pretty essential to the healing method. It does wonders on skin with large pores, Sebaceous Filaments, and helps to reduce acne and inflammation. This lasts forever too! I use about a tablespoon once a week or twice a month on my skin.</li>
            <li> Looooooooove this product. Makes my skin amazing and mask gets super hard. Cleans and then sone. You can feel it go deep in your pores and get everything out of your skin. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love the effects the clay mask has on my skin.  I use it about once a week and leave it on for about 20 minutes.  I mix the clay with water in a paper bowl with a plastic spoon, which you almost have to do if you don&#x27;t want to deal with a giant mess.  If you&#x27;re not willing to put in the time to mix carefully and clean up afterwards, stick with a pre-made mask in a tube.</li>
            <li> Really love this stuff.  Seems to work really well for both &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; and teenage skin.  I can see a difference in clarity and skin tone after three weeks of using the mask.</li>
            <li> Yep! This product is worth all the hype! You can not go wrong with a wonderful price like this one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about four days now, and seriously my skin looks better and better. I&#x27;ve suffered from acne for years now, I&#x27;ve tried Retinol creams, Proactiv, and nothing has worked. My acne scars are getting less visible, my acne is diminishing, my face looks brighter, softer, clearer, and most importantly, healthier. I use it every other day, i leave it on for about 20 minutes, and I mix the clay with Apple Cider Vinegar. For anyone who is considering purchasing the clay, you will not be disappointed, it is worth it! I will be updating this review soon!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the miracle mask i was hoping, perhaps because my skin is very sensitive and not oily. It left red blotches on my skin that went away but seemed to stress my skin out unnecessarily. I think if you have oily skin this would be perfect, but for normal to sensitive skin might be too harsh and drying. It did minimize my pores quite a bit though.</li>
            <li> Made my face a little red after first washing it off but it made it so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> It really does clear pores,I mixed some up then stored it in a plastic baggie in the frig for use whenever.</li>
            <li> The lady digs it, I do too. Mixing with Apple Cider Vinegar seems to kill blemishes and red spots that would&#x27;ve gotten worse or lasted longer. Feels crazy when it dries, it&#x27;s a cool rush !!</li>
            <li> Great! Didn&#x27;t work QUITE as well as I expected, but still a great product.</li>
            <li> product arrived on time.  I ordered this to improve the appearance of large pores and for acne prone skin.  I like the pulsating feeling you feel as the product is working!  I mix the product with apple cidar vinegar and a small amount of water.  Excellent product for the money!  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I see a lot of hyperbolic claims about this stuff&#x27;s miraculous properties, with none explaining exactly how rubbing glop on your face is supposed to kill the bacteria that causes cystic acne or whatever. I tried it. My face didn&#x27;t pulse so much as felt like clay was shrinking on top of it. I got a pimple the next day. I don&#x27;t think that was this clay&#x27;s fault, but rather a coincidence like all the accounts of people who rubbed it on and had a clear up.</li>
            <li> I was sceptic about buying this product because most reviews described it as feeling &amp;#34;really clean&amp;#34; but I love this product. After use I understand the &amp;#34;really clean&amp;#34; feel the other reviews referred to. It a bit hard to describe. My hair is natural and sometimes I have a habit of but a lot of product on it plus I like to co wash instead of constant shampooing so this product was great in cleansing all the build up without striping my hair and making if feel dry. It also helped my curls to look great right after. I deep conditioned after and my hair has new life to it.</li>
            <li> AWFUL!!! Please be careful if you have combination skin and are prone to whiteheads and rosacea!!! I put this on briefly for a few minutes on my face and I got the worst rash on my jawline!!! It&#x27;s been more than 24 hours and they have not gone away!!! I feel awful!!! My face is ruined. Just go with a more expensive mask instead of this. It may be cheap but it&#x27;ll make your face itch!!!!!!!! AWFUL PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! Pulls impurities from your face. I love the price too!</li>
            <li> Works great on my forehead. I don&#x27;t have any acne there except some old red and dark marks and this got rid of them by 3rd week.&lt;br /&gt;Great for:&lt;br /&gt;Leftover marks&lt;br /&gt;Drying any active pimples&lt;br /&gt;Scars&lt;br /&gt;Oily skin types&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a month now and it has done something to my scars, it won&#x27;t rid of them completely since mine are very deep but it&#x27;s worked well for my not deep scars and I feel it would make my not so deep scars gone with continued use for months. At first I used this 3x days in a row and it really dried up my skin. Give your face atleast 5 days before using this again, it works more effectively. I used it 3 days in a row and it just irritated my skin. I think it works amazingly on my forehead because it is very tight skin. The rest of my face is more elastic. I also think it&#x27;s great for oily skin because it will dry up your face but not so much and not cause a breakout. This has not caused me any breakouts when using and it&#x27;s almost guaranteed to kill some pimples that are active on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be gentle when removing this though it does get very hard to take off so DO NOT scratch or pull at any acne or scars because it could make them worse trying to get rid of the product. Wash your face with warm water then rinse off with cold water for 30 seconds so your face doesn&#x27;t feel dry.&lt;br /&gt;This is a really great product and definitely worth the try.</li>
            <li> Bought this to mix with some Apple Cider Vinegar for s face mask. I&#x27;ll update my review once applied.</li>
            <li> Truly the only purifying mask you will ever need !!</li>
            <li> Tightens face. Very strong. Easy to do. Nice baby soft complexion</li>
            <li> I have used several clay masks in the past, but the others can&#x27;t hold up  a torch to this one. This stuff is excellent. :)</li>
            <li> Oh yeah, I like this stuff!  I immediately tried it out after receiving it.  I did many of the other reviews before trying it out to make sure I was using it correctly.  From this product I was hoping to reduce the appearance of large pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I used Braggs Apple Cider Vinegar.  I wouldn&#x27;t cheap out on that, especially for how much clay you get for a great price!  The mixing ratio is an estimate, so I ended up needing to play with a little more vinegar and then a little more clay to get the consistency right.  I applied it to my clean face.  I accidentally read the directions incorrectly and started to leave it on for 30 minutes instead of 15.  Oops!  It didn&#x27;t make much of a difference, I don&#x27;t think.  I did experience some redness, but it dissipated after 30 minutes or so.  I used a good quality moisturizer after.  My skin did feel tighter and pores did appear smaller, but this is something that you&#x27;d really need to do weekly to get great results.  Results don&#x27;t last forever.  It&#x27;d be a great mask to do right before a special event to have the freshest looking skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably one of the few guys out there that will actually admit to using a face mask, let alone post it online with a picture.. All I can say is this stuff is amazing! My girlfriend has been nagging me for years about the black heads on and around my nose. I would use her exfoliating facial scrub from time to time and that would help, but it&#x27;s nothing like this. I work in construction, and am out in the florid sun most of the day, I usually try to cover up but the sun still has had adverse effects on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First we mix up equal parts apple cider vinegar and the healing clay in to a small Pyrex container the night before application. She then puts the mixture in the refrigerator over night.. After a long day of work I&#x27;ll come home and take a hot shower, my face is usually pretty hot and red from work, but a hot shower helps me relax a bit. After my face fully dries she&#x27;s applies a thick Mask to the both of us and we turn on the TV. The clay is so cool since it was on the refrigerator before hand, but it feels amazing on my hot skin. It&#x27;s so relaxing that I usually fall asleep within a few minutes of application. I generally wake up 30 minutes later to my face pulsating and my skin being pulled tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After it dries I&#x27;ve been filling up my sink with water and using a wash cloth to clean off the clay, I then smearing the larger chunks around until they break up in to mush so my drain won&#x27;t become clogged. So far it&#x27;s working, but I may look in to using a large Tupperware container of bowl to avoid any clogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I rinse off and pat dry my face I use organic coconut oil for moisturizer and let it soak in over night.. After just a few applications you will notice a huge difference. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used this three times now and I have down graded from the amount it suggests because there was so much left over and it was being wasted. I hate the smell of the apple cider vinegar but other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time yesterday. My skin was so dry and irritated before I used it. I almost wish I would have done a before and after. I could totally tell a difference in using this product. Skin was softer, moisturized, pores were smaller. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I try once, its nice with good results&lt;br /&gt;powder you have to mix with cidar vinegar</li>
            <li> I use the mask either once a week or twice depending on what my skin is doing. My skin loves it! I feel like it gives your face a fresh start. My skin looks and feels vibrant afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I have to complain about is it&#x27;s a little messy trying to clean up :)</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this and the first couple of times I used it, I used water to mix, and it didn&#x27;t work so well so I got some apple cider vinegar and it worked like a charm the third time around, when I finally got all the proportions correct too. It&#x27;s definitely a trial and error to get the process right so don&#x27;t be disappointed if it doesn&#x27;t work the first time. You aren&#x27;t supposed to leave it on for too long either, it will completely dry up your skin, which isn&#x27;t good. I looked up a lot of youtube vidoes too and did some research, some people add honey to the mix and it makes it a bit smoother and its good for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination oily/dry skin depending on the weather and massive pores. I had a huge pimple that wouldn&#x27;t go away for 2 weeks and was deep under my skin. After I did the mask it just came right out and healed within a day, which is pretty freaking amaizng. It doesn&#x27;t really peel black heads off like a nose strip, but it brings forth all that gunk to the surface of your skin and as I washed my face i could feel my skin was so much more smoother. Ideally I would do this every couple of weeks. It&#x27;s an important step to keep your skin looking clean and fresh especially if you have big pores that collect a lot of gunk no matter how many times you wash your face, you need a deeper cleanse every once in a while.</li>
            <li> This clay is the best face mask I ever used. I love the feel it gives when it&#x27;s in the process of drying, it&#x27;s kind of tingling and feels like its working. It had made my acne go away for the most part, make my scars fade, and makes my loves appear a lot smaller. It makes my face super soft and beautiful after rinses it off in warm water. 😊</li>
            <li> Good step to add in your skincare routine. I am a male and wanted to get pretty to find a lady. But now I am prettier than most of em.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. So far, I&#x27;ve used it three times in the past week and a half. My skin has been breaking out badly recently and today almost all of my acne has healed. I&#x27;ve been mixing the mask with raw organic apple cider vinegar as the directions suggest. When you mix the apple cider vinegar with the dry clay, the mixture bubbles almost like when you mix vinegar and baking soda. When applied to the skin, the mixture feels light, bubbly, and cooling. As the mask dries, you can really feel the clay pulling out the impurities from your pores. I struggle with both blackheads and cystic acne and this mask has seemed to improve both conditions greatly. I&#x27;ve used a variety of other products that have been much more expensive with half the results. I would completely reccomend this product to anyone looking to deep clean their skin, refine pores, and who wants a natural skin care product that actually works!</li>
            <li> This stuff has made my skin look and feel so much better! I look forward to my facial once a week. :) Even with my sensitive skin, this works great. Have even shared with my family and friends!</li>
            <li> This product unclogs my pores. It eliminates my blackheads. This is the best clay mask I have ever used. I use it in combination alternating between this and a moisturizing mask because it can be very drying to your skin if used too frequently.</li>
            <li> very good product, works as expected</li>
            <li> No fuss multipurpos good face mask. I always have a box of this.</li>
            <li> I really felt my face tighten up this stuff is legit</li>
            <li> What a great multi-purpose product. I use it in a detoxifying bath when I start feeling ill, and usually whatever illness I have never strikes full-force. It&#x27;s a great deep cleansing mud mask for the face. I also swear its extracting properties have saved me from a root canal, or have at least allowed me to postpone it, when I mix it with a bit of coconut oil and massage the sore tooth. It&#x27;s tasteless, so it&#x27;s easy to brush with, and not at all gritty.</li>
            <li> works and feels great</li>
            <li> Amazing treatment! I use this mixed with ACV, then an enzyme mask, followed up with a hydrating mask and my skin has never been better! I do this once every 1-2 weeks.</li>
            <li> It seems to work on acne fine, but that might be all in my head. Either way it didn&#x27;t make anything worse and they ship you a massive amount relative to what you will actually use. I&#x27;d recommend trying it for yourself</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 43 year old woman who has been pretty lucky in the skin department. I never had to deal with teenage acne and I have minimal signs of aging. I avoid the sun and always use Olay Regenerist moisturizer. That being said, I still saw benefits from using this clay mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought it for my daughter&#x27;s face and back blemishes. She used it 2 or 3 times a week and her skin cleared up quickly. This helped get her skin to a clarity that Proactiv alone couldn&#x27;t do. Besides clearing her skin, it made it baby soft so I decided to try it for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix it with apple cider vinegar, apply a tin layer and let it sit on my face for a half hour or so. It takes away the dry patches on my cheeks and unclogs the pores on my nose, so I don&#x27;t see the little black dots there anymore. I&#x27;m using this once or twice a week and it really makes my skin feel so much softer. It did a great job on my daughter&#x27;s acne, but there are benefits for older skin as well.</li>
            <li> i cannot feel any improvement after I used it</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin &amp; use thin layer as a rinse after washing with cetaphil cleanser. I also use Twice a week as a mask mixed with water &amp; leave on for 20-30minutes. So far so good. It&#x27;s helped me tremendously with my oil production which was the main reason why o&lt;br /&gt;Purchased. I use mattifier primers, makeup bases &amp; I still shine terribly, and this has helped me a lot with some of my shine. I will continue to use. It also dries out the occasional pimples I get. So that&#x27;s great too.&lt;br /&gt;Works better then Proactiv Mask. I just wish it was already premade, that would make it more wonderful!</li>
            <li> This mask is ok. Nothing special. I have tried masks from Walmart that did the same. How ever this mask is NATURAL and its results are not gonna happen over night. It does work but not the way some ppl are stating that its a mericle mask CUZ ITS NOT!!! Its natural tho and very safe even for the most sensitive skin. Store masks are harsh and have lots of unknown crap in it that is not natural.</li>
            <li> I use this clay on my hair and it leaves it feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I have insanely sensitive skin. This stuff made my skin irritated and red for days after using it. However, other people I know say they swear by it.</li>
            <li> Only used it once. Seems fine I guess. Nothing magical.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, if you are using it as a face mask with ACV be sure to only use a tiny bit as a little goes a long way. Also don&#x27;t put it down the drain. Works great for a face mask!</li>
            <li> Came as described and sealed</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product. It does remove gunk from my face. I whisk even 1:1 powder with Apple cider vinegar. The smell can be a little intense as your putting it on your face, but let it completely dry. I apply 2 times a week in the evenings and leave it on for about 15-30min. I rinse in the shower because this stuff practically glues and dries to your face. Warm water and a wash cloth will do the trick. Follow with a moisturizer.  I am somewhat red after but glowing the following morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: if you search this product elsewhere than Amazon, it&#x27;s about $5 for the same bottle. Hence reason for 4stars.</li>
            <li> My face has tiny breakouts due to a detox I was doing and this cleared my face the day after. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> Never had a product tighten my pores so much.  Only had it a short while but I feel it is making a difference for the better.</li>
            <li> I did not like the product because it may dry skin and cause redness and peeling me</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it does what it says it does, but I sure do love it. I actually bought this as an ingredient for a homemade organic deodorant recipe. Not so great for that, no. The original recipe also called for baking soda, which I eventually became sensitive to. I changed the recipe several times, and found that I very suck at that. I can&#x27;t blame this clay for my failure on that endeavor, but it DOES turn your armpits green, at least while you&#x27;re wearing it. I cannot report any staining of clothes, but I wouldn&#x27;t swear that it can&#x27;t, either. I just know I&#x27;m not going to a club with green armpits in a sleeveless top. That being said, I&#x27;ve discovered the joy of using it as a facial mask. You can make it as strong or weak as you like (by mixing it with water, apple cider vinegar, or a combination of both). I&#x27;ve paid as much for ONE clay mask as this whole jar contains! My grown daughter and I love to play spa from time to time and this is just wonderful, it really is. I suffer from SEVERE Generalized Anxiety Disorder and this makes me feel pampered and relaxed. I&#x27;ve used it as a mask (and shared with friends) maybe 8 times (and wasted most of it each of those times, even only using a Tablespoon each time) and the jar is still full, including what I wasted on making deodorant (though my mom still loves and uses that deodorant and even bought some of her own just for that).</li>
            <li> I saw this on youtube heard so many good things about it. It works AMAZING! My face feels and looks so much better after using it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a month in I love it when I first used it I was scared cause I never tried anything like it before and the first week or two it was making my acne worse but once I got past that second week my skin started looking really good and clearing up i was told the first week or so thats normal cause it was pulling all the nasty stuff from my pores :) but definitely make sure you&#x27;re using face moisturizer after so your skin doesn&#x27;t get dried out!. But stick with it its a great product!</li>
            <li> its a process but it really works to help pull curl pattern out of your hair</li>
            <li> I am beyond impressed with this product.  It does exactly what it stands for.  It is the greatest mud mask and a true miracle for my face.  I always get acne breakouts.  This time my face looks refreshed and clear.  Unreal!!!  Two thumbs up!!!</li>
            <li> I really love this clay. I got oily skin and use makeup everyday so it&#x27;s important I keep my face very clean to avoid breakouts. I use this once a week. I mixed it with apple cider vinegar until it&#x27;s a creamy consistency and apply on my face. Then wait for it to dry, remove with water and feel how tight and clean my skin looks after. Make sure to super moisturize after as this can make your skin dry. I think this is such a good value for your money.</li>
            <li> I feel good knowing that there aren&#x27;t a ton of ingredients in this, and mixing with ACV provides great benefits as well.  Not noticing a huge difference in my pores/blackheads/breakouts, but I&#x27;ve only used it twice since receiving it about a week ago ;)&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I have very oily skin and large pores and wasn&#x27;t really seeing results OR feeling the &amp;#34;pulsing&amp;#34;, so I made a small adjustment to the mixture (a teeny bit more ACV and a teeny bit less clay) and am finally feeling and seeing what this mask can do!  My face is slightly red after removing, but it fades within the hour.  Really, really liking this product!  Added fifth star upon editing :)</li>
            <li> Received yesterday, used last night for the first time. Im blown away! I wish I would&#x27;ve bought sooner.</li>
            <li> I used this one time so far, and I love it. It left my skin smooth and soft after just one application. It is kind of hard to wash off your face because it does get really hard and you can definitely feel it pulsating your skin. This mask is amazing so far, going to keep using it and see what more it can do! Thank you</li>
            <li> After seeing so many stars and reviews for this product I had to order it and see for myself.  I opted for using the apple cider vinegar mixture.  For some reason I thought the consistency was going to be much thicker.  I tried several ratios and experienced a somewhat runny mixture.  I really like the product and use it once weekly.  My skin definitely feels like impurities have been removed after using it for 30 minutes.  I have not experienced some of the problems other users have commented on about clogging their sinks.  Give it a try ... it&#x27;s really a great product.</li>
            <li> I can can feel it working.</li>
            <li> I try to use this once a week, mixed with honey and water. It gets the cracks out of my feet and makes my face feel softer than a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li> You can feel the mask doing its job when its on your face. This product is super strong</li>
            <li> When people say this stuff takes everything out of your skin, they mean it. I never realized my skin could be so tightened up. I&#x27;ve used other masks before but this stuff is very, very powerful. The real test is how it helps my skin during PMS when my breakouts are the worst. So far, so good! I guess you could use it every day if you wanted to - as long as you use an oil to fill in those empty pores once it&#x27;s off your skin. I repeat: get an oil like jojoba (which I just learned was ho-ho-bah, not je-jo-ba.) You can use a moisturizer, but I highly recommend oil before moisturizer - just a little bit. It tricks your skin into thinking it&#x27;s already produced enough oil to sooth your skin. Hence, avoiding overproduction and subsequent acne. I take away one star because of the clean up. This stuff is MUD, literally. So - you have to figure out the best plan of action in getting it off of you without putting it down the sink. DO NOT wash down the sink. Seriously. Don&#x27;t. Once it dries, you can gently peel it off a little bit at a time, or scrape it off gently. I suggest putting down a newspaper or paper towels and gently peeling it off in small pieces onto that, and then rinsing off - only the residue - in the sink or shower. A good daily cleanser (acne.org has a great one), a good exfoliator in between mud applications (anything with a variety of skin acids like glycolic, lactic, citric, malic, etc - pH of 4.5-5), mud once or twice a week, and oil/moisturizer every day is working wonders for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Protip 1 for those with acne: 1. apply benzoil or sacylic to pimples you feel coming (you know when they&#x27;re in there!) 2. cut open a pill of acetaminophen and wet it with a little water to create an acetaminophen paste. Dab onto the unaffected (yet!) area. Continue this two step treatment process on that zit that&#x27;s just waiting to erupt under the skin. It should disappear. You can definitely prevent those long-lasting zits entirely if you catch them in time, depending on how deep they are. Some pop up overnight and there is no way to zap them before they appear. Even with those, the acetaminophen will decrease redness and swelling dramatically. It&#x27;s an anti-inflammatory - it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Protip 2 for those with acne: use neosporin on those zits AFTER they have gone down/popped. I never thought of it, but it is reducing my scarring by at least 80% - and very, very quickly. I risked it and gave it a try wondering if it would cause more breakouts, but it has only improved my skin and become part of my regimen.how deep they are.

            <li> 1- Apple Cider Vinegar vs. Water: I would strongly recommend apple cider vinegar for oily skin; unless you do not like the smell of vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;2- Waiting Time: The first few times stick with the instructions (specially the first time); however, I would recommend waiting longer and let the mask dry completely on your face.&lt;br /&gt;3- After Application: Moisturize your face with an organic moisturizing oil such as coconut oil or rosehip seed oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus tip: Apply the mask with a disposable knife!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. But even though it says it can be used with water, I don&#x27;t recommend it. It takes like 15 minutes to mix with water, but if you have something like apple cider vinegar, it takes less than 3 minutes, and the consistency is even smoother, and it spreads way way easier. The overall results are a lot more pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use this with several different liquids, and I can say that all are amazing, and after 3 months of 1-3 times/week use, my complexion is noticeably clearer and my pores are smaller.</li>
            <li> First off I was desperate for an acne medication. I searched acne on amazon and this came out first. I searched it up and bought it at Vitamin Store for 6.49$. It works SO well!!! It really does pulse! the formula I do: 1 tablespoon clay mix 1 tablespoon RAW Apple cider vinegar. This will make more than enough clay mixture for your face. I will do an update on this in about a week.</li>
            <li> I love this clay mask. After about 3 weeks of using this mask in combination with Insta Natural Age Defying serum my face is free of acne and black heads. I use it with apple cider vinegar (the smell is not great but the results are worth it!!). I am in my 30&#x27;ies and have always battled acne. This is the best product that I have ever used. Results are fast. I saw a difference the first time i used it. I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li> After one use my face was softer and it cleared some of my blackheads. I would recommend this to everyone. It smells bad with the apple cider vinegar, and makes your face red after the use, but it really works. I noticed a difference, and it makes my face feel clean and clear. I would give five stars, it even came a day early but, its very messy to mix.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teen daughter.  She loves it, and I&#x27;ve seen her using it on her boyfriend.</li>
            <li> I have a sticker placed directly over the directions so I can&#x27;t make out how much clay, water, and apple cider vinegar to use. I am going to attempt to use a small portion of each after reading the reviews but my tip to the seller... put your advertising stickers elsewhere!&lt;br /&gt;I will rerate this product after I use it but have read amazing things!</li>
            <li> We use this for saddle sores (cycling) and various other skin eruptions and it works greatly!!  Love the natural aspect of it!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all these rave reviews.  Perhaps it&#x27;s employees of the company.  But this is by far the WORST mid mask I have ever used.  It falls off the face while you are waiting for it to dry.  It clogs the drain whe. You wash it off and it dries your skin.  It&#x27;s extremely harsh and leaves your skin looking as dry as the Sanara.  I would not recommend this trash to my worst enemy.  There are much better products on the market.</li>
            <li> messy, messy, messy and I don&#x27;t really think it worked too well.  The mixing and applying, it&#x27;s all too much ,just to clear your pores.  I would choose one of the other many pore cleansing options out there..  Sorry, I had hoped I found a great pore cleanser, but I would not recommend this product to others...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say it&#x27;s great for cleaning pores but I would advise to buy something to mix it with instead of water. I have a very sensitive face and I literally feel it cleaning my pores - but to the point where I can&#x27;t really have it on for more than 5 minutes because I start to feel this itchy sensation. It doesn&#x27;t leave my face burnt or anything though which is what makes the product so good and I definitely feel my face cleaner after I wash it with the mask.</li>
            <li> I think it works fine on the face. I haven&#x27;t been consistent enough to notice a difference but I used it on my hair once and it completely dried out my normally straight and silky hair and made them completely unmanageable. Whatever you do I recommend caution with using it on your hair.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel clean and fresh</li>
            <li> It works amazingly for my skin and cleansing my hair just added Apple cider vinegar and grape seed oil. I loved it and it was delivered in a timely fashion</li>
            <li> I like this mask.  I should store it beside a small bottle of apple cider vinegar to promote myself to use it more often.</li>
            <li> This stuff does not mess around, it truly purges your skin and can be alarming at first.  Make sure to follow the instructions, and do not wash down the drain.</li>
            <li> Acne scars or breakouts never went away, but my face did feel clean after. Won&#x27;t buy again, just didn&#x27;t do anything special. I wish i had the results like what everyone else is talking about..</li>
            <li> I love using this mask. Especially with the water mixture as my skin is prone to acne whenever I use the Bragg AVC.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels smooth, soft and tight. Will continue to use until it&#x27;s all finished. Best results for not making a mess.&lt;br /&gt;Wash off in shower......</li>
            <li> Awesome product, I use 3 times weekly. I wash my face, apply a toner to remove excess dirt and then apply clay (mix with apple cider vinegar) I leave on for about 20-25 minutes and rinse off with warm water. Do not be afraid if you look like an ape while waiting for the mask to dry, it pulls your skin so tight, it almost disfigures it until you rinse it off. Once I rinse off, my skin is so soft, I finish with a night cream.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and will continue too use it . I am 58 and look 40 . It really keeps your skin and pores clean along with removing dead skin . Sometimes the simplest things are the best things . I mix apple cider vinegar instead of water . Will continue to use for many more years . Great Price and a Great Product .</li>
            <li> My daughter has been picking her skin for past 6 years, even though she has no acne. Can you imaging her forehead. Results (healing) were visible after 1 (ONE!) day. She feels so encouraged that she&#x27;s stopped picking for now. I hope it will continue.</li>
            <li> I got this clay after reading tons of great reviews. I was looking for something to deep clean my pores, and shrink pore size. I used this one the night I got it and woke up already seeing a difference. It really cleared up my redness and a few blemishes I had. I am using it again tonight (2 nights later).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of application, it is messy like most clay masks so just pin all your hair back and you&#x27;ll need to do some serious cleanup after. For the price this product is amazing!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  It does turn your skin a little red after using it, but it definitely helps improve skin tone/clarity and helps refresh your complexion.</li>
            <li> My skin felt very soft after using this. I&#x27;m not 100% sure it actually was a deep pore cleansing mask but like I said I could definitely feel a difference in how soft my skin was afterwards. It warns on the side that you will feel your skin pulsing while wearing the mask and although I have SUPER sensitive skin, I did not feel this. The directions suggested using 1&#x3D;1 parts clay and apply cider vinegar or water. I used water. Going back to the sensitive skin issue, I cannot use anything that isn&#x27;t hypoallergenic, I get awful rashes. This product didn&#x27;t give me any issues at all so if you&#x27;ve ever struggled with having allergic reactions to masks this would be worth a try.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how she uses this but she says she loves the product, it is value for the money and it makes a difference in her skin. So she said to rate it five stars. I will tell her to update this review or if there are any questions about this item She said she would recommend it because it helps take the oil and dirt out of her face and it is not that difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! Not only did it clear my blackheads and tightened my pores in one week&#x27;s use, it also brightened my skin, and makes me look 10 years younger! I&#x27;m sold!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Had seen reviews about it and decided to try it. It is a great mask for my face. It pulls out my blackheads and my face is soft and smooth after. Gonna try it on my hair as we&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li> I have used this once a week now for a month and my skin is looking better.  It is very messy but I followed instructions from a review and it has been less mess.</li>
            <li> This came soooo fast, I almost couldn&#x27;t believe when I found the package on my doorstep in what just felt like three or four days. Very pleased with this transaction and I love the product as well of course. The healing clay has worked well :) I&#x27;ve taken to using it once a week and it has provided me with a great natural glow. I also use it on my hair! Great for cleansing the scalp and promoting hair growth.</li>
            <li> used with apple cider vinegar in a baggie and it was pretty clumpy but it was my first time mixing it. I didn&#x27;t feel any pulsating like it said I would but it felt really tight when it was dry. made my skin texture way smooth when I washed it off.</li>
            <li> I love this. My ex came back from over seas and just before we broke up he gave me a fungal skin infection, follicolitis. I took antibiotics, had a special shampoo to wash with and the infection on my upper back would not clear up. I bought this as a facial mask after the reviews. I then decided to apply it to my upper back on the infection site figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt, and medical treatment had failed for a year. This cleared it up after a week. When first using the mask for a facial your skin will start a purge so you may notice more breakouts to help speed this process, use it 2 days on and 1 day off until the purge is over. This can take 1-2 weeks depending on condition. Also it does not need to be as thick as they recommend. And wait for it to dry completely. A good moisturizer is needed afterwards. I love aveeno night cream, the soy is amazing for it. Mixing can be tricky, I measure out the powder first and set it aside. Then with the same scoop I measure out my apple cider vinegar into a bowl, then I add my powder and mix fast as it bubbles. Also the price on here is a bit high, I found it cheaper on vitashop and it only took a few days to reach my doorstep. One full tub has lasted me 4 months and I use it on my body at first, and more often, now I use it once a week.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this. I tried it 3 times and after removing the mask each time I would use a cotton pad to swipe on some Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel. Although I liked the way my face felt during and after wearing the mask, the next morning I&#x27;d wake up to 3-4 pimples on my forehead and I don&#x27;t usually get pimples on my forehead. Perhaps it was just pulling dirt from deep within my skin. Whether that was the case or not, I&#x27;d rather go without the clay mask to avoid future breakouts. Too bad though because it did make my face feel squeaky clean after I washed it off.</li>
            <li> My face hasn&#x27;t been cleaner ever since I started using this product!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice clay mask! Cant really be beat for that price. You really only need to mix about a teaspoon and a half with some apple cider vinegar or water, and that will cover your entire face. I usually mix enough for two or three applications in a Tupperware container. The left over mask does not dry out in the plastic container and is just as effective as the &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; batch.&lt;br /&gt;I used different clay masks before ranging from very low price to very high. This one is the most effective and of best value in my opinion. I have combination/oily skin and also work as a Make Up artist. I have used this product on clients before and so far none of them reported irritations or sensitivity to the clay mask. My skin is very sensitive and I used to have problems with some mild to sometimes severe acne. I tried very expensive products to get rid of my acne, but my skin reacted very badly to salicylic acid (broke me out even more), benzoyl peroxide (very drying!) and fruit based acids (literally burned my skin off!). Those three ingredients are found in most acne treatment creams and face washes, so I had to steer clear of those. The clay mask cleans out my impurities, leaves my skin very soft and I now have skin that I am comfortable enough to walk out the door with without wearing make up (this is a big deal for anyone working with make up ;-)&lt;br /&gt;I usually use the mask two times a week and leave it on for 10 - 30 minutes. To take it off I get a bucket of warm water and a clean wash cloth and gently wipe the mask off of my face with the damp wash cloth. You can pour the muddy water down the toilet and it won&#x27;t clog your pipes .. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend washing the mask off over the sink or shower drain on a regular basis, as that might clog the drain. Your skin might experience some redness, but it doesn&#x27;t last long in my case or when I used it on clients. I usually wait about ten minutes before putting anything else on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin care routine is very low key -- I use Bioderma and Neutrogena face wipes to take off my make up (only on days that I wear make up), then I use the clarasonic mia and cetaphil daily face wash to clean my skin. Sometimes, but not every time, I will use Weleda Almond facial cream or Cetaphil daily moisturizer, but usually I just use a cotton pad and raw apple cider vinegar as a toner on my face. Especially for combination/oily skin I found the less skin care products I sue, and the less ingredients they have the better my skin looks. I do want to mention that I used and tried everything there is -- from Olay to Dior and expensive microdermabrasion treatments. I found that this mask in addition with my skin care routine works wonders and is easy on the wallet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first time buying the clay mask on amazon, but I&#x27;ve been using it for two years now and never had an bad experiences with it. It also works well on dry skin to smooth out some unevenness and get all that junk out of your pores, but I would recommend using a thick moisturizer afterwards in that case.ow key -- I use Bioderma and Neutrogena face wipes to take off my make up (only on days that I wear make up), then I use the clarasonic mia and cetaphil daily face wash to clean my skin.

            <li> By far, this about the best facial mask I have used because it does an incredibly nice job of cleansing and tightening the pores. It can&#x27;t be beat, and mixes incredibly well in raw apple cider.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on the fence about this clay.  I mix it with apple cider vinegar and leave on for about 35 minutes or so each time I use it and although I did see a difference in my skin, I&#x27;m not sure its completely because of the clay.  I do love the cool pulsing sensation you get as it starts to dry...makes me feel like its sucking out the impurities in my skin, but after a few weeks of use, I was hoping some specific skin issues I was having would have been cleared up, but they were not.  So...I dont know.  I&#x27;m going to continue to use it because it cant hurt but I&#x27;m not necessarily raving about it.</li>
            <li> I only tried it once but I like the result after using it. I think it does what it supposed to do: deeply clean my pores.</li>
            <li> I mever thought this facial mask is really good for my sensitive/dry skin but oh gosh it&#x27;s amazing! Now i know why the people are being all gaga about it. I ordered this with just a hinch because i never read the reviews or how it works. I just wanted a facial mask that&#x27;s it.  And i was suprised that the seller add some vitamins in the box! Thank you i&#x27;ll surely buy from you again..</li>
            <li> This clay is a little too harsh for using on my hair or skin alone.  However, if mixed with other ingredients it is a wonderful detox tool.  I use it in my detox bath recipes and homemade toothpaste.  This is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I was excited for this to come in the mail and when I finally got it I put it on my face and it made my face very itchy and I tryed it again another day and the same thing happened and I was surprised because I feel like I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely AMAZING! I haven&#x27;t tried the combo of mixing this with anything other than water, but my skin completely loves this stuff. Now be forewarned, if you are mixing this with water it will be clumpy. So if this bothers you, look into a good mixing agent such as ACV (apple cider vinegar). A little bit also goes a long way, so be careful when you are separating it out to mix. It&#x27;s very easy to be over zealous and end up with a lot left over. Other than that though, I highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first mask of any kind, so I was not really expecting too much wow factor. After mixing it and letting it sit (I waited until it was completely cracked, aka &amp;#34;can&#x27;t move your face at all without splitting it&amp;#34;) and then washing it off (which as other reviewers have noted, will take a bit of time but just be gentle and use warm water) my skin was INCREDIBLY smooth. I&#x27;m talking apply way less makeup the next day - smooth. My skin tone was also visibly evened after I washed this of. You definitely get that &amp;#34;lit from within&amp;#34; look with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this about 10 times since purchasing, I&#x27;ve definitely seen an improvement in my skin pigmentation and my skin is generally softer overall. I&#x27;d highly recommend this for anyone who is wanting to lighten some lesser acne scarring (full disclosure: I&#x27;m using other products to help with the deeper toned areas) or just wanting a softer and smoother appearance to their skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing this again when my jar runs out.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  I try to use it once or twice a week as a mask to make my skin feel a bit firmer and smooth.  You can really see the difference after washing it off even if it&#x27;s only temporary.  I also use this as a spot treatment for my cystic acne - it really helps with the pain and seems to even bring them to a head after a day or two or just makes them smaller and disappear quicker.  It can be a bit messy to apply and mix, but I don&#x27;t mind with the results I get.  Also, I can usually only take about 10 minutes before it starts to sting with the tightness of the drying mask.  It seems like this will last months to a year or more depending on how frequently it&#x27;s used.</li>
            <li> Very great product and works well for people with super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Loved it. Made my skin look and feel smooth and made my pores appear smaller.  Will recommend for sure.  Easy to use and didn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive skin(my eczema).  Gave my skin a tighten appearance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been into beauty products. I have tried and tested makeup and skin care goodies from high end stores to cheaper dupes at target or walmart. I have also tried the home made remedies with ur usual kitchen ingredients. I have been using Boscia peel off face masks for the last two years. About $40 for 2.8 oz.. It&#x27;s a little steep but I always prefer the peel off treatments rather than the wash offs so I can actually see any impurities. Anyways, so I saw the reviews bout this clay mask n I tried it out. I NEVER do reviews, but oh my, this product deserves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I have really good skin. No pimples, nice tight pores, not oily and not dry.. Not too sound like I&#x27;m bragging or anything, but it&#x27;s difficult for me to try a product n notice any difference since I&#x27;ve never had any real big issues or anything. But the reason I continue to put so much care into my routine is to maintain it. My entire family suffers from acne and pores so big you can see from afar. So, Im predestined to have bad skin as well..  but because I&#x27;m so anal about my nightly and weekly regimes, I&#x27;ve been blessed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, this clay mask is a miracle! I just used it for my first time, and my skin is baby bottom smooth. I would highly recommend this to everyone!! Just a reminder, though, you don&#x27;t need a lot.. I had used a 1/4 of clay with a 1/4 cup of vinegar n threw a lot away. Next time I will probably just make a tablespoon of each. But yes, please do try this!! I&#x27;m one of those customers who once they find a product they like, they remain loyal to it forever. I&#x27;ve used the same makeup for the last ten years (bare minerals), The same makeup remover for the last 6 years (ponds cold cream), even the same toothpaste! So it&#x27;s very hard for companies to sell me onto something new if I&#x27;ve found something I&#x27;ve really loved. This is definitely one of those products!</li>
            <li> One of most acne solutions you must try!</li>
            <li> arrived  last week. after  first  use, I seen I  big difference. I&#x27;m 38  and always had a great completion.  so I hardly ever wear makeup.  but lately I&#x27;ve been showing signs of  aging.  enlarged  pores,  laugh lines. I&#x27;ve gone through  several  brand name products  and nothing. I think my search for the perfect one is done.  week later  and face is still  soft and smooth as a  baby&#x27;s bottom.  really wish I came across this sooner. I  WILL  be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Came across this product while I was searching for something to \\&quot;really\\&quot; clean my face. I&#x27;ve tried so many cleansing products claiming to do all great things to your skin. It has been 3 weeks and I must say that this clay mask works like no other. It really does feel like it&#x27;s sucking all the impurities. Once I&#x27;ve washed to off it leaves my skin feeling so smooth.another pro to this product is the price. Can&#x27;t beat it. I highly recommend this product. It will take me months to finish it! There are clay mask out there that comes with such a high price tag and it will only last days maybe even weeks. If your looking for something that will work well and at an affordable price then this product is for you.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say It a huge difference but the best clay masque I&#x27;ve found and especially for the price I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Only used it once so far and it has made a difference. I didn&#x27;t feel super tingly but maybe that was because I used water.  I&#x27;m excited to try it for the other uses as well!! Who knew this stuff could be so useful? I will update later on my face and how everything else goes.</li>
            <li> Let me first say I have a very hard time finding something to use on my skin that does not cause problems.  Thus getting a good cleaning has always been a problem.  I used this the day it came.  I used apple cider and the clay.  It was amazing.  My blackheads and dry skin spots were gone with one use.  I used some on a acne breakout on my chest and it cleaned that up in one use.  This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> It arrived unusable all the powder was in the box in the bag wasted money. They should invest in a more secure closure</li>
            <li> I can almost guarantee your face will be a glowing canvas if you let this dry for about 30 minutes or more. It&#x27;s worth it to use apple cider vinegar as well as water, because the vinegar really amps up the effectiveness of this product. Waiting for your face to pulsate is the best way to determine when it can come off.</li>
            <li> Really like this, it worked great to add in homemade shaving soap or as a face mask. Made a huge difference on my skin, really liked it. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I just received this today. Put it on my face and convinced my roommates to try it out. It leaves the face so soft and you can really feel the product pull all the bad stuff out.</li>
            <li> Had a random few break outs this week. Used it for 2 days and was amazed at the diminished appearance of the pimples and black heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an all natural kind of person. No artificial anything. This product is great.</li>
            <li> This a decent product that provides a great expoliation mask for the face. Works well for both men and women. One of the cons of the product are that you skin may be colored a tint or red. It&#x27;s not permanent and goes away during the night. It doesn&#x27;t stain sheets. The labeling is a bit vague on how much you need to use to mix. My best results work with a plastic bag and 1/4cup of mix with 1/8 cup of water.</li>
            <li> The ancient Indian seceret helps cleanse pores to the core it helps seal them up not all the way since I have big pores but it definitely helps out I love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of a process and it&#x27;s messy. It&#x27;s powder,  so you have to measure it out with the water to form a paste.  Not my favorite mask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read numerous reviews about this product and finally had to bite the bullet and buy it. Thank goodness I did. Whenever I feel a zit coming on I make a little paste out of this and put it on for about 1/2 hour. Works wonders! BTW, I use water to make it into a paste not apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> I had a really deep blackhead in my cheek that I could NOT get rid of. I thought my last resort was gonna be to spend a bunch of $$$ getting a facial or going to a dermatologist. I read about this stuff on Pinterest and WOW I am so impressed. It really makes your face pulse when it is on and the FIRST time I actually saw the blackhead come out of my cheek. I could not believe it… This stuff is amazing. I ordered my sister one and am swearing by this stuff for deep cleansing face mask. You can feel it working and it got rid of the blackhead. Great product and its so cheap. Win Win.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, super fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for cleaning your pores.  It dries real hard.  Your skin feels fresh and glowing when you rinse off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no faith in this product at all. After I tried it I was hooked. I used it with white vinegar and it just makes my skin look so smooth. My pores actually do shrink. My mom and cousin also love this product. It lasts forever too!</li>
            <li> REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT, IT TAKE A VERY LONG TIME TO DRY DEPENDING ON HOW THICK YOU MAKE IT.  I USE ACV WITH IT AND LEMON JUICE AND IT NOTICE FADING OF MY DARK SPOTS.  ITS VERY CLEANSING, IT DRAWS OUT A LOT OF IMPURITIES BUT NOT EVERYTHING. I USE IT ONE A WEEK. I MIX IT IN A PAPER CUP WITH A PLASTIC SPOON SO WHEN I&#x27;M DONE I JUST TRASH EVERYTHING ALL TOGETHER, CLEAN IS REALLY EASY.  I WASH IT OFF IN THE SHOWER.  HADN&#x27;T HAD ANY PROBLEM WITH DRAIN CLOGS SO FAR.</li>
            <li> THIS IS GOING TO BE A VERY LONG REVIEW BUT PLEASE, PLEASE TAKE JUST 5 MINUTES OUT OF YOUR LIFE TO READ THIS IF YOU SUFFER FROM ACNE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow. Where do I begin. Really, where do I begin. First, let me just say I have dreamed and prayed, literally dreamed of the day I can write a success story of my own in regards to acne. Any acne sufferer has tried hundreds of different products, read thousands of Google searches/reviews/blogs, and experienced an endless amount of frustration, pain, and confusion. I don&#x27;t use the word embarrassment or humiliation, because you shouldn&#x27;t be embarrassed nor should you be humiliated if you have acne. I have read thousands of reviews with writers saying they don&#x27;t want to walk out the door or that they&#x27;re embarrassed to face the world. You are who you are. These things happen. Acne is normal, it&#x27;s everywhere. That shouldn&#x27;t affect who you are as a person. Yes, it can be difficult to face the world. I can relate. But frustration and confusion are the best terms. Frustration because we don&#x27;t know how to cure it. After trying every given product or method, it just doesn&#x27;t go away. And confusion because sometimes we have no clue what is going on that causes all that acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, let me get some facts out of the way. I&#x27;m a 21 year old male, college student. I&#x27;ve been suffering from acne for well over 8 years now. About the time I reached 13, obviously because of puberty and the typical growing phases, I was one of the unlucky ones plagued with pretty bad acne. It didn&#x27;t get worse till about high school, but again high school is a time when we all go through improvements so having acne is not as bad. People get braces and go through other various stages during this time so it&#x27;s no biggie. But in college, you really expect by about the time you&#x27;re 18, your acne should be dissipating. And for most it does. But let&#x27;s face it there will be and always will be a select bunch that still walk around with red spots all over their faces. Don&#x27;t let that put you down. There are people out there who don&#x27;t have proper vision, hearing, or worse disabilities. Now, I don&#x27;t want to go into a pep talk lecture here, so let me get right to it, but I just want you all to know that 1) don&#x27;t let this acne put you down.. and 2) THIS product will change your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the thing, I always read those reviews that say \\&quot;this product may not work for you as everyone is different\\&quot;. I hate those reviews. That&#x27;s rubbish. It&#x27;s crap. It&#x27;s true but that&#x27;s the reason I hate it, because it&#x27;s true. Every product may not work for you. BUT.. THIS product in particular is for everyone and doesn&#x27;t present different, adverse effects on different skin types. Why might you ask? Well, it&#x27;s simple. It&#x27;s 100% pure dirt. Good ol&#x27; natural dirt. Literally that&#x27;s what it is. The reason those OTHER products react differently on different skin types is because those are all products that contain chemicals, and different ones at that. So you can imagine. Obviously everyone&#x27;s skin will react differently to various chemicals. Some good, some bad. This, however, is pure clay/dirt that will literally dig into the pores and flush out whatever gunk you may have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I view acne at 3 different levels. Minor, Moderate, Severe. But on each stage there are another 3 levels. In other words, you may have Minor acne but may be on level 1, 2, or 3. A Minor acne sufferer with a level 3 may have worse acne than a minor level 1 and 2, but not as bad as one who would be listed in the Moderate acne stage. Same goes for if you are for example a Moderate acne sufferer but a level 3, you may not be so bad to the point of being a Severe acne sufferer, but in the Moderate stage you are still worse than others. If this makes any sense, I put myself at Moderate acne Level 2 and 3. On rare occasions, I hit Severe level 1 with a deep cyst or two, but haven&#x27;t experienced that recently. Right now, my face is continuously at a Moderate level 2. Severe acne sufferers are those whose faces are literally clustered with severe red acne on every area of the face. Moderate would be one or two major sections (my two cheeks). Minor acne would be a small area like chin or just nose, or no major breakouts but a few pimples here and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all my life, like every other acne sufferer I have tried any and every acne remedy known to man. I kid you not. In the beginning (in my early teens) stages I tried the basic Neutrogena, Clean&amp;Clear, basic drugstore crap. No effect there. As high school came around, I tried Cetaphil which proved a bit of an improvement, but again no cigar. I tried St.Ives peach apricot scrub for a while and that did some good stuff, but again nothing that could really vastly make an improvement. I tried masks, lemons, honey, yogurt, I mean you name it I tried it all. Don&#x27;t even mention Benzoyl Peroxide. I tried a 3 step system and it screwed up my face. Anyways as I got to college, I came to face with the fact that I&#x27;m just going to have to \\&quot;let nature run its course&#x27;. But still, I couldn&#x27;t just let my face sit there and use lame cleansers. I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how many hours I&#x27;ve spent doing acne research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My freshman year in college, I gave a shot at the AcneFree system and used Benzoyl P. again which again burned my face so I realized I&#x27;m allergic to it. For some, it may be useful. Not for a soft sensitive skinned fellow like me. So then I realized I may need to spend some money on high end products. Keep in mind I&#x27;m a college guy... I started getting on Sephora and looking at the hundreds of different products they offer. Oh and let me just add that my acne in college was the worst it ever got unfortunately. It seemed like every year from the day I crossed paths with acne, it just got worse and worse. Ok, so back to sephora. Over the span of a year or 2, I spent hundreds of dollars on different products (and I tried each for a few months to give it a true trial)... some worked, some didn&#x27;t. But I can never tell what products truly \\&quot;work\\&quot; because it seemed like every week I would get a few whiteheads and ugly red, swollen pimples. The worst issue about my acne is that I also have serious hyperpigmentation from all the years prior. So I tried things like Bio-oil, hydroquinone, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried even more extreme methods like chemical peels, and even spent $750 on a 6 week session of microdermabrasion. The microdermabrasion REALLY improved my right cheek and forehead, and today it&#x27;s quite clear because of it. But for some reason I still would get major breakouts on my left cheek. After I stopped the microdermabrasion sessions, again my breakouts started coming back (even on the right side and forehead). I tried more stuff like Dennis Gross peel pads and Peter Thomas Roth pads. I can go on and on about the products I tried, but the point is.. none of them made the difference I wanted to see, or prevented breakouts. Best put, preventing breakouts is the ultimate goal. That wasn&#x27;t happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to this product. I decided to give this a shot about 3 weeks ago, just because once again desperation led me to another product. Because of the really high reviews and people writing success stories, I was filled with hope. I read one guy&#x27;s review who mentioned that he&#x27;s a college student male and puts it on his face every night and isn&#x27;t even embarrassed because it prevents his acne. I am in the same boat as him. I put this on every night. Sometimes I skip a night, but regardless I get this stuff on my face 5 out of 7 days. Do it at night so that your sleep can recover the skin and in the morning you&#x27;ll look like a million bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never thought there would be a miracle product, because we&#x27;ve always been led to believe there really isn&#x27;t a miracle product. But let me just tell you, THIS IS IT. I kid you not. Like I said, it&#x27;s not a chemical. Of course no artificial/machine made product is a miracle product, but thisfine clay dirt that&#x27;s been around for centuries is... Oh let me just add I came across a prescribed professional line called M.D. Forte. It&#x27;s quite pricey. I started using the M.D. Forte III 30% Glycolic Cleanser last December, and it has done wonders for my skin. It&#x27;s oil free, soap free, and very gentle. Now, every night I cleanse my face with the cleanser and use the mask (I leave it on for about 30 minutes). My skin after feels like a baby&#x27;s butt. No kidding. Then after the mask, I cool my skin with 100% witch hazel (no alcohol). and moisturize. and Voila. That&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;My acne is not 100% diminished, because like I said my skin has taken toll after years and years of acne. It will take time, but I KNOW I KNOW that this is the product that WILL and IS doing that. It is almost May. I will update this review in July and post some before/after pics. My before pics are ridiculous- it really shows how bad my acne has been. I can already tell this product is paving the way for success after 8 years, and hopefully with use of this I will be at ease. I will use this for the rest of my life. No joke. I&#x27;m going to really stock up on this stuff. I hope they never stop providing it for us. Right now, any pimple I get is completely halted after a night of this stuff.. even the deep cysts. Let me just warn you, the first week you will breakout. I broke out pretty badly (shows how all the other products never got the gunk out of my skin).. but I kept going because I read on it that it will happen and you should keep going. Week 2 came around and seriously my skin recovered and took the quickest 180 turn, even from how severe week 1 was. Now I&#x27;m in week 3, heading into week 4 and I don&#x27;t get any major breakouts but any small (or large) pimple is completely healed by the next day. This literally flushes ALL of my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I&#x27;d just say use whatever cleanser (GENTLE cleanser) works for you.  (oil free and soap free)&lt;br /&gt;Make this mask (with Apple Cider Vinegar-- i forgot to mention.. very important. use apple cider vinegar)&lt;br /&gt;Leave it on for 15-20 mins or 30.. depending on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Use witch hazel with cotton pads (trust me on this) gently wipe skin with it&lt;br /&gt;Moisturize with whatever moisturizer works for you (oil-free)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try this regimen for a month and if you don&#x27;t see major improvements, email me or contact me somehow and you can vent to me about your situation, but I promise this will work for ANY skin type because again it&#x27;s completely natural there are no chemicals.. besides your cleanser and moisturizer, but that&#x27;s why I advise using a quality, gentle cleanser. no drugstore brands please. they ruin your skin. go to Skinstore.com or dermstore.com and do some research on a gentle cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a final note, for some of you applying the mask every night may be too harsh. I&#x27;d say aim for 3 times every 7 days. I don&#x27;t know how to end this..

If you have any questions or comments just reply a comment to this review, I will check periodically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, my face is not clear JUST yet.

I&#x27;m excited to say this is a GREAT positive update. I&#x27;ll keep it short and sweet since my review itself is a novel...&lt;br /&gt;I wrote the review a little over a month ago, and if you read my entire review and understood the whole acne minor/moderate/sever stage level thing, let me just proudly say that I am now a Moderate Level 1 and haven&#x27;t had any severe or crazy breakouts at all! I used to be Moderate Level 3/Severe 1 as I mentioned. My forehead is completely spotless, my nose is spotless, my chin is spotless. The only two areas are my cheeks which as I mentioned were pretty bad from all the years of acne prior. I deal with hyperpigmentation (not scarring, but post red acne marks that linger for months), and this mask is seriously seriously even healing and brightening/lightening my hyperpigementation. All my red marks have reduced by shades of about 15 to 20% I&#x27;d say. This is such an exciting product. I also want to add that because I&#x27;m a DJ, I travel quite a bit and recently I was in New York for about a week and didn&#x27;t get to use the mask at all. The entire week in new york I didn&#x27;t use this mask and I didn&#x27;t break out ONCE! This product clearly keeps acne/pimples at bay. I think by July as I mentioned, I should be significantly clearer.. which I cannot wait to see! Also, I should add that I just purchased a 20% Vitamin C Serum that I came across on Amazon (link below) and it has seriously great reviews and helps with brightening and moisturizing etc. I will be applying it every night as well pre-moisturizer.

            <li> Yes, it definitely pulsate as the clay dries up.  I imagine that&#x27;s how it would feel if you slather wet cement on your face, it will tighten your skin up.  I&#x27;m not sure if it made a difference on my pores because I would definitely need to get 10x mirror magnifier, but I don&#x27;t see huge difference on the large pores that I can already see.  I don&#x27;t love that it can get quite messy when you clean up your face.</li>
            <li> I have used this product a couple of times and it does not work. I did not notice a difference after the first, second, third, fourth, or fifth use. I read a lot of the reviews on here and bought it because the product had some great reviews but it does not work. Maybe it worked for others but for me it did nothing. I am very disappointed because I was hoping it would clear up some acne and help reduce my breakouts but it did not. Try if you want but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a week and people have already noticed a difference in my skin!!! I&#x27;m so exited to keep using this product.</li>
            <li> I havent seen result yet but so far I like how it makes my skin clean.</li>
            <li> I used it once since getting it a week ago.  The paste come out lumpy using hot or cold water.  Applying is a tad messy.  Gives a cool tingly sensation when applied. No change noticed.  No change expected in that short time. I may give it a try some other time...</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Amazing. You have to work with the clay a little, adding water here and there. I made some and stuck it in a tupperware container. I have a big German nose, with big pores along with it. I used to do the whole toothpaste trick which would help, for a few hours. Biore Pore strips, yep, all of that worked for a couple hours then back to the old giant pores. I used this stuff, showered (it is crazy getting this stuff off) and sat down to watch our nightly shows. My husband looks over and said &amp;#34;Damn, where did your pores go?&amp;#34; I had no idea what he meant so I went into the bathroom....and was shocked. I had &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; gorgeous skin! Which lasted....up to 3 days. He was so jealous, we both did a mask the next week. This stuff is amazing. Buy it. Just do it.</li>
            <li> its not some miracle but its a good mask. i honestly dont use it that often and the reason why is because its a complete pain to take off. thats why i gave it 4 stars. its a lot more of a hassle and i prefer my mint julep to this anyday</li>
            <li> I bought this clay because I found an article on mixing Aztec clay with a touch of apple cider vinegar and rubbing it on your face to unclog pores. It works well.  I dilute mine with a bit of warm water, I found it to burn my face.  Now I use it twice a week, and my skin looks much better!</li>
            <li> This will prob last me a year+</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about using the product on my skin because I have eczema but I&#x27;m so glad I made the purchase! It helps with acne as well as rashes or even bug bites!  Having irritated skin is the worst, especially when you can&#x27;t control it, knowing that I can make this mask and &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; a rash or irritation is amazing! I have dyshidrotic eczema all over my hands but using this with apple cider vinegar rebalances the ph level of my skin giving it healthy vibrancy and speeds healing. I used to scratch my hands in my sleep until I was bleeding constantly. I was afraid of infection and decided to do research and found that balancing the ph of your skin is extremely important to the healing process and it led me to this jar of gold!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon, but I had to review it. I bought this product two weeks ago and the difference in my face, its smooth all the scars, bumps are disappearing.  The ladies in the office saw the difference in the 2nd application so they are all running to the store to buy it. I will keep  using this. its the BEST!!!</li>
            <li> For people who are using this for the first time, make sure you test it on your hand first before you use it (just in case it feels uncomfortable). I used 1 part clay and 1/2 ACV and 1/2 water. I kept this on for about 15 minutes and it felt so weird! When you keep it on for a long time it will tighten your face into the center and you will feel pulsing on your face. When you wash it off though, it feels amazing!! I suffer from acne and I have a lot of acne scarring. I heard from many people that this can help with both. Also, this comes in a tub that will last a long long time.</li>
            <li> works really well. It can be a little bit messy and hard to mix sometimes but it does work.</li>
            <li> This mask feels so cool! It took a couple tries to get the right consistency but I&#x27;ve got it down now. It&#x27;s extremely messy but cleans up easily as long as you don&#x27;t use a nice towel. It penetrates nicely and I can feel the clean but I wish it did blackheads better. Even with regular use of twice weekly, my face is still full of blackheads. I&#x27;ll need to find something else to take care of that.</li>
            <li> 1. I recommend Bragg&#x27;s ACV (you&#x27;ll eventually get over the smell)&lt;br /&gt;2. Use a plastic bag to mix! Turn inside out to apply to avoid using utensils.&lt;br /&gt;3. Removal: Some people have difficulty removing this as it&#x27;s really thick. I suggest cupping some water and pressing it to your face. This will soften the clay and break it up.&lt;br /&gt;4. Do not wash again with a cleanser! allow the remnants to work their magic.&lt;br /&gt;5. Moisturize. I use cetaphil on my eyes and around my nose and mouth. And olay for the rest of my face~&lt;br /&gt;6. Use 1-2 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;7. Use at night time to avoid red face when going out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:-) Minimizes pores, purges your skin of impurities and expedites the healing process for pimples. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> As soon as you apply this clay you can feel it working. I mix it with Braggs Apple Cider vinegar until I have just the right consistency and leave it on for about 15-30 minutes and as soon as you rinse you notice and feel a difference. I actually saw blemishes that I didn&#x27;t even know I had after the mask. I oil cleanse and this has been a great way to sort of flush and pull dirt out of my face again at the end of the week. I&#x27;m not too fond on using commercial product on my face and like to keep it as natural as possible, so this has been perfect! I&#x27;ve been using this mask for several months now and have had amazing results- it&#x27;s a wonderful staple to my overall beauty regiment.</li>
            <li> This clay is fantastic even if you aren&#x27;t using it for acne- it will also give your complexion a nice glow if your are going somewhere special. Just be sure to allow an hour or two between using it and leaving the house if you have fair skin like me, because for awhile after rinsing it off, you will look like you&#x27;re wearing a bright pink mask with white eye holes. Also, once totally made my UPS guy&#x27;s day by being caught wearing it while having to sign for a package :-P</li>
            <li> Bought this for the acne treatment combined with the apple cider vinegar.  Results not as good as others reported.  Will keep trying though, it seems to do some good, but nothing like the other reviewers claimed.  I wish!</li>
            <li> I think I got this whole tub for about $5.  LOVE IT.  My face feels incredibly clean for weeks after using this product, and it is all natural, feels great on your skin, and mixes well with apple cider vinegar which is SO SO healthy for you!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.  Your skin will thank you with a beautiful shine :)</li>
            <li> This works great for masks, washing hair and purifying bath water. The only problem is getting it smooth. It clumps up when you add liquid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to clear severe acne or anything, but it&#x27;s a decent facial mask for a good price.  It&#x27;s useless when you mix it with water; just clumps and pebbles.  You have to use vinegar, hot vinegar is best.</li>
            <li> I am a 24 year old male who doesnt take the best or the worst care of his skin. My nose has a nasty amount of blackheads and i wanted to see if this would cure it since any dime a dozen facial scrub seemed to only be worth the trash can i threw them in. This stuff was intense and made my face feel baby smooth. I didnt make enough so i recommend making sure that you use more than what the directions tell you. I made mine in a sandwich baggy so maybe that had something to do with it. I realized i didnt make enough halfway through applying it to my face so i made sure the majority went to my nose since it was the most important area to attack. I waited for it to harden, bout 25 min, then rinsed off. Im sure i did something wrong but only a few blackheads were gone. I read that you have to use this a couple times the first month you get it in order to kinda turn your face around to the right direction. I plan on using it again soon so i feel good in recommneding this to others. Id say go for it, especially since it is so cheap.</li>
            <li> Just got this product and when I mix it with water it forms clumps like cottage cheese. How can I prevent this or is this what&#x27;s supposed to happen? Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this face mask, It has cleared my pores and my face looks smooth and clean. I have tried so many high-end products to minimize my pore like Murad, philosophy etc, but none have worked wonders like this product. I use this with Apple Cider Vinegar. I would defintely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> A review for the \\&quot;HEALING\\&quot; part of the Indian healing clay.  My husband had a sore on his knee that was infected, it was surrounded by very pink skin and it was hard underneath.  The first night we put tea tree oil on it, that&#x27;s usually my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; medicine for treating infections.  By the next day there was no change, which alarmed me, then I remembered this clay.  I made up a small amount (using water vs. ACV) that had the mud consistency and placed it on the sore and surrounding pink area of infection.  We let it dry and then applied a large bandage to cover the whole area.  He slept with it and kept it on the next day while he worked.  When he got home and I checked it I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.  All of the pink skin was now a normal color, it wasn&#x27;t as sore to the touch and the hardness underneath was not as hard.  It had drawn out the infection.  So keep this in mind and use it for infections on yourself, your children, and even your pets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this product as a facial, I mixed in apple cider vinegar.  I definitely felt a tightening affect while it was on my face.  When it came time to rinse off, I used a bowl because I did not want this going down my sink since it is mud.  I poured it down the toilet.  I&#x27;m glad I was not in a hurry to go anywhere because it took 30 to 40 mins. for my skin to return back to normal.  My face was a bright pink after the facial and when I saw how pink it was I made a note of the time in order to see how long it would take to return to normal.  After 30 mins. it wasn&#x27;t as pink, after 40 mins. it was back to normal.  So if you&#x27;re going to use this as a facial leave yourself plenty of time.  I gave myself a facial today and used water to mix instead of apple cider vinegar and the drawing and tightening effects were the same except that my face was not as pink as when I used the ACV.  It took 5 to ten minutes for the pink areas to disappear from my skin.</li>
            <li> First time using the clay mask, I used ACV, mixed together and within minutes the clay hardened. So much so that my nose tightened enough to make my breathing different haha. This is awesome, beats any other mask I&#x27;ve ever tried....even the expensive facials I get. Makes those spas look like amateurs!</li>
            <li> This clay is working pretty well. If there are breakouts - it calms it down and even remove. I haven&#x27;t seen noticeable effect for the blackheads - but I using it only 3 weeks. But the cleaning effect is indeed there. It is hard to remove the mask  - I suggest to sell it with some silicon pads - removers.</li>
            <li> Great results! Really leaves skin feeling cleansed and refreshed! A little uncomfortable as it dries, but then so is ALL clay-based masks! At least THIS one leaves me with great results! And the quantity lasts a LONG time!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have any vinegar so I used witch hazel with a little lavender essential oil and it was great. Can just as easily be used with water with the same effect. I use on my face, neck, and decollete.</li>
            <li> I loved the difference that I saw in my face right after using this but after a few hours the fresh, clear complexion seemed to vanish.  My skin was back to how I had looked previously with very little, if any improvement. Will continue to use it regularly and change my review if I see a difference long term.</li>
            <li> I had no bad reactions afterward, but the intense itching sensation really didn&#x27;t make it feel very therapeutic. I did notice a decrease in how oily my face was along with using olay&#x27;s oil minimizing toner and using african black soap but this one negative really outweighs the positive... Sigh I don&#x27;t know..</li>
            <li> The only mask to use for sensitive, acne prone skin.  I use it with Apple Cider Vinegar</li>
            <li> Like everyone said, this is awesome. I like mixing in tea tree oil, aloe vera juice, apple cider vinegar and active charcoal, for my face. I also like using the mud for my hair, adding coconut mana and not adding the active charcoal. I actually purchased the one pound tub at my local health food store for $6. Look around before buying!</li>
            <li> I like this, it&#x27;s a great deal. I know that this tub will last me a long time. A little messy but I can feel my skin become tighter and cleaner after using it.</li>
            <li> My pores are practically invisible after using this mask. Yes it is messy but for how well it works, it&#x27;s definitely worth it. I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere for a good face mask and nothing works like this stuff. After only two uses I swear by it!!</li>
            <li> Works as it says everything it says is true!</li>
            <li> A dear friend introduced me to the clay almost 2 years ago while I was recovering from Breast Cancer, and I&#x27;ve never stopped using it since. While in treatment, I was tired and looked run down. Enter the magic clay. I did a mask using raw organic apple cider vinegar and felt my face pulsing so much, I looked in the mirror to see if it was moving. It &#x27;sucked&#x27; out so many toxins, I looked years younger. After completing radiation therapy and waiting 8 weeks for the full treatment to run its course, I made a giant tub of the clay using vinegar and water until it was smooth and runny, mixed it into a warm bath, grabbed a big bottle of water and rested for as long as I could take it. It was so intense, I did feel sick and had to lay down for the rest of the day. I&#x27;d read it could pull toxins out of your body and one shouldn&#x27;t touch anything left behind in the tub after the water drains. I wiped it down with a paper towel and to my shock the residue was made up of black and metallic particles - it looked like glitter. I&#x27;ve done face and body masks with it regularly ever since. My skin looks beautiful. I rarely have a breakout. I feel energized. Most of all I&#x27;m happy with how I look and feel. One tub lasts about a year with weekly use. If using in a bath, mix 1 1/2 cups with enough water and vinegar to break it down to a liquid. Don&#x27;t use with anything metal - I keep plastic forks handy to minimize lumps. Can&#x27;t recommend more!</li>
            <li> Great stuff! I use it once a week. Don&#x27;t use as much as they say to. I used a teaspoon full and mix with water until it can smooth over my skin.</li>
            <li> This product works like a charm. I had noticeable black heads before I started using this product and now my skin is much clearer.</li>
            <li> Gritty and clumpy when mixed properly with oils. It does have desirable astringent properties though. However, this is not the clay to use in your shaving cream/soap recipes.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me...used it for couple months. Lately it&#x27;s left my face very red and irritated.</li>
            <li> I like it. Make my face clean and stuff, but it&#x27;s does get kind of annoying when trying to take this stuff off your face, since you can&#x27;t just wash your face in the sink, because it will clog it.</li>
            <li> This is the best beauty product I have ever used.  I always make it with boiling water.  They suggest a consistency on the jar, but it&#x27;s so hard to know what they&#x27;re talking about.  I came up with a formula and method I use myself, but I&#x27;m sure everyone does it differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I boil water in a tea kettle, put it in a bowl, and slowly add clay (whisking constantly) until it is like butter-cream frosting.  I do NOT suggest adding water to the clay, it absorbs really fast and you&#x27;ll end up with clay balls, no matter how long you mix it.  I don&#x27;t worry too much about the amount, because I save extra in a food storage container.  Next time, I put some in a pan on the stove and whisk until it&#x27;s smooth and steaming, then whisk until it&#x27;s cool enough to put on my face.  Use it as hot as you can stand.  Test!!!!  Very easy to burn your face.</li>
            <li> This product does just what it states it will do. I brought it for my hair and face. I tried it on my face and it gave me a really clean feel. The review on youtube stated  it is good for the hair and it give a great shine. So I will try on my hair and see if it works just as good as it works on the face. It arrive very quickly and was packaged securely.</li>
            <li> This product saved me, my face was getting bad. i bought this as an add on item with a facial spinning brush &amp; both of these items are working miracles. it does get messy but if you find ways around it you can avoid that. its a must buy!</li>
            <li> my skin is a little sensitive, but it worked out great as a facial mask.</li>
            <li> has done a great job clearing up my skin and has made it softer (when mixed with apple cider vinegar. im not sure if it works as well with water, but you can try it out for yourself). make sure to not leave this on too long if you&#x27;ve got sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is okay for a face mask, the first time I felt nothing but the uncomfortable tightening from the drying clay, second and third time I felt a little tingle, but I am not sure it made a huge difference if anything after the last time I used it I got two HUGE soft cyst like pimples one on each temple and the are still there over a week later &#x3D;/ I really guess I thought it would keep my skin pure but I don&#x27;t see that happening, I have been mixing the ACV as mentioned on the directions so maybe I will try with just water.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look younger.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels AMAZING after using this product.. wowzers!!</li>
            <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t find the work of this product to be as worthy of the praises people speak of. It&#x27;s a mask and it cleans, but I found that the Neutrogena Cleanser/Mask hybrid was a much more powerful mask to use and there was no alchemy involved before application. If you prefer less work and have stubborn acne to fight, go for the Neutrogena mask. If you don&#x27;t mind-- give it a try. I had to mix with only water because the scent of the vinegar was too much when I tried that option.</li>
            <li> AMAZINGLY. Made my face so soft and tight. Will probably only use like twice a week. Definitely make with ACV.</li>
            <li> Works very well as a body mask/wrap. However, I am not able to use it as a facial. I followed the directions (for sensitive skin), but still got severe inflammation.</li>
            <li> Really helped shrink my pores</li>
            <li> This is all sorts of awesome! But only use it if you&#x27;re staying home for the night as it makes your face red for a while after.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only tried it with apple cider vinegar as ACV is just generally great for everything beauty-wise.&lt;br /&gt;It makes your face pulsate and tingle in a quite pleasant way which I like to imagine means that it&#x27;s busy sucking out all the crap from your pores.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect a miracle after the first use, it takes a few applications to start seeing results. But when you do, man do you ever!&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful when you&#x27;re washing it off as it can hurt if you rush it. I use a washcloth soaked in warm water to start loosening it first.&lt;br /&gt;Also, remember to moisturise after.</li>
            <li> This mask is so soothing.  I can&#x27;t get the lumps out when I mix it, but that&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li> YAY... product arrived quickly once again. Really happy with the results... I&#x27;m finding I get exceptional results when I combine the Indian Clay with Refresh Phytoceramides.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because they had a very good review but didn&#x27;t work at all for me!!! I used it for 2 months but my face looks the same (still have a acne).&lt;br /&gt;but it wasn&#x27;t itchy or smelly whatsoever, the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was to much work to do. mixing the powder to water etc...&lt;br /&gt;I rather use some other face wash from the local store and works better</li>
            <li> Bought for gifts, so I haven&#x27;t tried it but I did place product in elegant glass bottles. The clay is very well milled. Not at all clumpy.</li>
            <li> I began using this mask 3-4 times a week with vinegar b/c I have acne prone skin. It seemed to be working, but I had to change to  water because I noticed my skin drying out. When I start breaking out I use the mask and it helps shrink my acne. It has not cured my acne, but it helps. Its a great product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This clay is the best I&#x27;ve used to date. Just buy it and you will not regret!!</li>
            <li> This is a great mask when I can get the consistency right, which isn&#x27;t hard.  The only thing is, around each time I use it, my face breaks out with cystic acne, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s from this mask or some other factors.</li>
            <li> Used it only once since I just got it but u can feel it working and tell a difference after first use</li>
            <li> The clay works but be careful if you have oily skin because it can take up to an hour for the clay to dry. Also I recommend using a mixture of water and clay in a Ziploc bag to mix and store.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff. It&#x27;s kind of hard to mix together. It takes a few times to learn how to get the texture just right. It&#x27;s a sulfur mask so it kinda smells gross but once it;s finished my skin is super soft and it feels really clean. I have very very sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t bother it at all. I have bought expensive sulfur masks in the past and this is a great alternative. It works the same. I just mix it with water and do not use vinegar,</li>
            <li> Just received it today, and just used it ONCE. Not only did it clean my pores, but it brightened my skin...My face has never EVER looked so bright. I&#x27;m 26 and it has my face looking like how it did 6 years ago. I am glad I tried it...AND for ANY new buyers that want more information of my experience, I would be MORE than happy to help!</li>
            <li> This clay feels so good on your face, as long as you use ACV with it. Does what it says. It didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. Followed the instructions. Trying to use once a week. I have large, clogged pores that occurred after moving to desert. Skin always oily in T-zone. No breakouts since using clay, but still have clogged pores. Will keep trying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money. It really doesn&#x27;t do much. I really don&#x27;t recommend this product because it doesn&#x27;t pick of most dirt and blemish you would hope it would.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - I add 1 cup to a bath from time to time and use a few tablespoons with organic raw apple cider vinegar as a face mask (instructions on label). I tend to have dryer skin and it didn&#x27;t cause it to become more dry like other face masks can, which I appreciated. There are a ton of uses for bentonite clay (also, there&#x27;s a difference between sodium bentonite and calcium bentonite. I found a website that had helpful info about bentonite uses, differences, history, etc: http://www.eytonsearth.org/clay-baths.php)</li>
            <li> I have only used this a few times so it&#x27;s difficult for me to say whether or not it&#x27;s really helping with my acne.  Purchased this based on the good reviews here about how it helps with acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a tip: people talk about how difficult it is to wash this off since you don&#x27;t want to wash it off and drain your clogs.  I place gauze on my face and then apply this mask.  If you wait until the mask is fully dry, the mask wil cleanly peel off with the gauze.  There will still be a little powdery residue left, but you can actually just brush that off or rinse off.  If you try to pull it off before the clay is dry, then only the gauze will pull off and the clay will remain on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this method to work the best. The gauze is porous enough that the clay rests on your face.  And applying a thick layer means that when it dries, it will pull off in one piece.  When I apply the clay straight to my face, it makes my face get red, especially as I wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like to add some essential oils, such as niaouli, clary sage, and frankincense.  Mix with clay and apple cider vinegar.  Sometiems I also add a MSM capsule.  I don&#x27;t know that it makes my inflamed acne disappear overnight, but it definitely makes my skin feel really soft.  Of course, that could be the apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Feels amazing! Mix with Apple Cider Vinger for the best results &amp; texture!</li>
            <li> This stuff definitely tightens the skin! But for me it didn&#x27;t clean out my pores. I would recommend it though! Makes the skin feel great!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve struggled with acne, you need to give this a shot. It works, and it works fast. Just try it.</li>
            <li> So far the BEST!!!&lt;br /&gt;Better than many other expensive mask on the market.&lt;br /&gt;The secret is when you mix it w the apple cide vinager..MAGIC HAPPENS AFTER!&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful skin!!</li>
            <li> I love this mask.  Takes a little practice to get the preferred consistency.  Too thick and it won&#x27;t dry evenly.  It makes my face feel like butter.  It really helps clear up my occasional acne/oil bumps without drying my skin.  I have very oily skin.  I use it on my enitre face 2 - 3 x&#x27;s a week and spot treat any stubborn areas.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a friend and I&#x27;ve followed it&#x27;s use and I&#x27;m loving the results I get. Watched many youtube video instructions on how to use and it works well.</li>
            <li> AMAZING. I am 20 years old and still have issues with my skin and am constantly looking for something to clear out and help my conplexion. I use this mask about 3 times a week and it has been such a miracle for me. My pimples have decreased by a tremendous amount and leaves my skin feeling clean, smooth, and clear. I am so thankful I found this mask and would absolutely recommend this!!</li>
            <li> My friend introduced me to this on our girl&#x27;s trip. It is amazing. I love how my skin feels after and I have seen such a difference since using it!</li>
            <li> I mixed the clay with water because I have combo skin and was worried apple cider vinegar would be too drying.  It works wonders!  It either cleared out the pores on my nose or shrunk them substantially.  It feels good to put something natural on my skin versus a ton of chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It was very good for my natural hair.  When used as a facial, i give it two thumbs up. it left my skin soft and clear.</li>
            <li> This product left my face red, inflamed and dry for 3 days! I bought it a few months ago but had been waiting for the summer to try it out on my vacation.  So glad I waited! It took Aloe Vera gel applications every hour the first day and every three hours the next to get rid of the burning sensation and the redness. I think this product peeled the top layer of my skin.  I&#x27;m just beyond words.  Please be careful with this product.</li>
            <li> I mixed this with ACV as recommended. My skin did look a bit clearer after continued use but it did not bring out blocked pores like it did for some other people.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and love this stuff. Use it every weekend to &amp;#34;reset&amp;#34; my oily skin, and will take months to use it all! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It tightens pores, but with Queen Helen&#x27;s Mint Julep Mask, I don&#x27;t have to mix it up! Plus, you get the minty scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is too messy.</li>
            <li> Since there are so many reviews on the product itself, I thought I share one way to remove the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Rip a paper towel to a size that can cover your face.&lt;br /&gt;2) Wet the paper towel and lay it on your face.&lt;br /&gt;3) Gently press the wet paper towel against your face with your hands to allow water to seep into the mask.&lt;br /&gt;4) Press it for 15 to 30 seconds or until you can feel the mud can move on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;5) Slowly wipe your face with the paper towel. You can easily remove a good chunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) Turn on your faucet and let the water run very thin.&lt;br /&gt;7) Close the stopper and try to open it very very very slightly so only water can escape.&lt;br /&gt;8) Wash off the remaining mud that is left on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;9) Turn off the faucet. Leave the sink the way it is.&lt;br /&gt;***The water will be drained between the tiny gap while tiny mud pieces and particles will be plastered on the wall of the sink. *****&lt;br /&gt;10) Just take a paper towel and give a sink a good wipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this may help a few people.</li>
            <li> Great stuff to shirk pores and make skin soft.</li>
            <li> I mix this with some Braggs Apple Cider Vinegar (any with the mother would do) and put it on a couple times a week.  I have adult acne and this has really helped when all kinds of prescription meds did nothing.  It leaves my face feeling very smooth and soft but the lessening of breakouts make it well worth buying.  I will be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> love this stuff, it&#x27;s like any other facial mud mask u would put on just tat you have to mix and apply which can be messy</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff, its as good as anything else you could use, you can mix it with different things depending on your needs. Did it change my life? No, but it gave me nice fresh skin, calmed some redness and preformed as well, if not better, than products that are much, much more expensive.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews and bought this on the basis of skin clarifying, pore shrinkage, etc.  I was absolutely astounded to see, after ONE use, its lifting effects.  I looked 10 years younger!  These were to be seen on my entire face, but the most powerful effects were on the areas above the eye, you know, those puffy places beneath the eyebrows that begin to droop over your eyelids as you get older.  I mixed and applied this according to the directions on the jar, using [[ASIN:B001I7MVG0 Bragg Apple Cider Vinegar Organic Raw -- 32 fl oz]] (mixed up WAY too much, 1/2 cup of each, maybe even less, would have been MORE than sufficient).  Anyway I applied it liberally in that area, and also in the eyelid crease and lightly on about the upper half of the eyelid itself.  Absolutely unbelievable, puffiness and droop GONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasted 2-3 days.  I&#x27;ll be curious to see if repeated use of the clay makes that effect more permanent.  But even if not, who cares, this is the first product I&#x27;ve found that does that.  Bear in mind that everyone&#x27;s different, I tend to have crepey, loose skin (rather neglected, I&#x27;m afraid), so perhaps it won&#x27;t have as pronounced an effect on those who&#x27;ve strengthened/treated their skin all along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I&#x27;m absolutely delighted with the lifting, energizing, and skin rejuvenating effects of the mask, I must say that I didn&#x27;t see any sign of it dissolving or DRAWING gunk out of pores (let me hasten to add that all my pores are not full of gunk (!), I use one of those super-magnifying mirrors and I can see the few problematic pores here and there that do tend to accumulate it, I made a special point of looking at those).  Years ago my grandmother had some special \\&quot;drawing salve\\&quot; that pulled out gunk, even dissolved blackheads, they don&#x27;t seem to sell it anymore.  The clay DID tighten and refine pores in general, however.  Next time I think I&#x27;ll steam my face and squeeze those problematic pores BEFORE applying the mask, to shrink them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would add is that I was really surprised at the POWERFUL tightening effects of the mask as it dried, so strong I couldn&#x27;t even talk after it dried.  I layered it on thickly (likely too thickly), then worried since it dried like veritable concrete that it might not come off, but it did, quite easily.  I say all that because I used very warm water to ensure it would come off.  Next time I plan to use cold water, because I&#x27;ll bet the lifting effects will be even more pronounced, and may last longer that way.  I&#x27;ve used other clay masks, NONE have evinced the effects this one did, FANTASTIC!br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would add is that I was really surprised at the POWERFUL tightening effects of the mask as it dried, so strong I couldn&#x27;t even talk after it dried.

            <li> I am madly in love with this mask. I was having THE WORST acne of my life (at age 25) and adding this product alone to my routine has changed my face. Before, I had cysts all over my cheeks and hundreds of tiny bumps on my skin. Each time I use it, me and my boyfriend immediately notice that my acne scars are more faded. The healing of my acne has sped up, and I am having less breakouts. I started using it once a week, but now I am using it every other day and my acne is almost gone. I don&#x27;t have ANY of those tiny bumps anymore. I have a few healing cysts, but I haven&#x27;t had any new ones for at least a week. My face doesn&#x27;t look bumpy anymore, all I have now are a few healing scabs and a few fading acne scars. My boyfriend was so impressed with it, he started using it too. His face practically glows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a thin layer (rather than the thick layer they recommend). I find it dries faster, and when it dries I feel a tingly sensation all over my face. And a pulling sensation. I leave it on anywhere from 10 mins to 30 mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit hard to mix, it likes to be chunky. And then it likes to clog my sink. Those are my only qualms with it. But small price to pay for the miracle of no more acne!!!</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product. I am a beauty junkie. The downside is the clay is messy to use and messy to take off. However, it is the best mask I own. I use it with a combination of water and organic cider vinegar (it makes a cool fuzzy sound when mixed). Leave it on until almost dry. Works beautifully with aging, complicated skin (dry and acne). ​</li>
            <li> I was honestly not even going to write a review because my praise is just going to get lost among the other 4,000 reviews on this but honestly, this stuff is insane. I&#x27;ve only used it for 2 days so far and the few pimples I had are gone, some of them where cystic. My scars also look smoother. For the last year I couldn&#x27;t walk out of the house without makeup on. My skin looks so good I&#x27;m not even going to bother today. Going to buy tubs of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Pretty neat concept. A little hard to mix. Expected a ready to use product. Still giving it a chance to live up to it reviews. Not too bad a purchase for an add on item. Wouldn&#x27;t mind if it turned out to be fantastic.</li>
            <li> Felt great during and right after using, but then caused horrible break-out a few days after. Used as directed, so not sure what happened! My skin is typically normal with no break-outs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m natural this is great for hair as well as a full body mask. Helps clear pores an give my hair great curls pattern</li>
            <li> I always had great skin.  I barely ever had acne.  Then I got an IUD.  Once I got that I started getting back acne.  It was so embarrassing!!!  I tried everything to get rid of it.  Pills, creams, the dermatologist.  For a while I was paying $60 every two weeks to get back facials.  After two years of failed attempts I was getting married.  That is when I went into full battle mode!  Backne was not going to be there on my wedding day!  Every day I used Aztec Secret.  Every day without fail!  My back started getting worse...  For two months it still looked horrible.  I read that it gets worse before it gets better so I continued.  By the third month my acne was gone.  GONE!!!  The scaring was hidden by a little makeup and I wore a strapless gown on my wedding day!  Thank you Aztec Secret!  Now I use it once a week to make sure nothing more happens.  The scaring is almost gone!  It is truly a miracle!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this a few weeks before my wedding because my skin was just getting more and more out of control, and I felt like it made a difference. As some other reviewers have noted, nothing drastic happened the first week, if anything I felt like I was breaking out more, but after the clay pulled everything out of my face, it calmed down, was smoother, and less oily. I don&#x27;t use it regularly now for lack of time, but when I start getting breakouts again, I&#x27;ll use it for about a week and it works like magic. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I do not use this as regularly as I should... but really, it is great for oily and acne-prone skin. When I get one of those painful, bad pimples in the middle of my forehead, I heat up my face with hot water, mix 2 spoonfuls of this with apple cider vinegar, and dab it onto my face. Several hours after taking the dried mask off, most of the pimples calm down and start receding a little. Don&#x27;t expect miracles with this, but I think it does some good for my skin.</li>
            <li> After my hormones started righting themselves after my kids were born, I was gifted a nasty bout of adult acne.  I don&#x27;t want to make it seem like it cleared everything up over night, because it doesn&#x27;t, but if you use it regularly it does a great job at clearing out your skin.  And holy moly does your face pulse!  I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.. Makes your skin feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once so far and I love it already! I have major acne prone skin so I get huge cystic acne and nothing has been able to cure it. Not even any dermatologist I&#x27;ve ever been to. I used it one night and the next morning I woke up and the cystic acne had shriveled into almost nothing. I still had a few pimples here and there but nothing like the night before. This stuff is miracle clay! I can&#x27;t wait to keep using it and see what it does for my skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars because I&#x27;ve gone through various treatments for my acne (prescription and nonprescription) and it has truly improved my complexion after the first try. I was told by my dermatologist that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to shrink my large pores. I&#x27;ve used this mask twice and have noticed my pores shrinking and my face has gotten clearer. My advice would be to apply a thin layer (1/8\\&quot; or so) so that it would dry quicker and enable pulsing.</li>
            <li> Used it as soon I received it. It does feel like you face is burning and the clay as it dries gets very tight on your face. After I rinsed it off. My face felt amazing. Smooth and in the morning my face didn&#x27;t feel dry like it does in the mornings.</li>
            <li> My skin has been so healthy, clean, and balanced with the Indian Healing Clay! It has even helped to even out tone. Also really great as a detoxifying hair mask, it works wonders on natural curls</li>
            <li> this works much better with apple cider vinegar I love this powdered mask.....I instantly notice a difference after i first used it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it too often, because my skin feels squeaky clean and dry afterwards...but my pores feel and look clean.  My husband had something weird and very gross looking on his face.  I had him use this mask and it completely removed whatever it was, leaving a small portion of clear but slightly discolored skin where whatever that was had been on his face.  In a few days, his normal color came back. I gave some to my very critical mother and she loved it too (which is a huge compliment because she complains about absolutely everything!!!)  Hands down this is the best mud mask that I have purchased thus far!</li>
            <li> Excellent product , make your face smooth</li>
            <li> i love clay in general. instructions on this one recommend mixing with water and apple cider in equal proportions which i have never done to my lay masks before. i think cider does add up to this tingly feeling but you really can&#x27;t go wrong with clay, no matter what you mix it with. i love clay, i use clay and i will always use clay. there just can&#x27;t be nothing wrong wit it ever. it works for both cleansing and whitening my skin, which i just love and every woman should have some clay in her beauty drawer. bottom line)</li>
            <li> Works great for my skin, fast and simple to use.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product a few days ago (a total of two times) and I can already see the difference. My acne isn&#x27;t completely gone, and I&#x27;m still getting a few new ones, but compared to before they&#x27;re smaller and easier to hide. I&#x27;ve always had the type of acne where you don&#x27;t get many but the ones you do get are HUGE so this is a nice change of pace. Plus, the areas in between my healing acne are softer and smoother, with the blackheads around my nose almost completely gone. As a nice bonus my skin is getting a nice and even skin tone as well, which has boosted my confidence ten fold. I have little doubt that if I continue to use this product my acne and skin problems will disappear completely. I first noticed this product because of the almost absurd number of great reviews and I was skeptical at first, but after trying it I feel like I might&#x27;ve just jumped on the bandwagon too 😊</li>
            <li> Instant results. Cleared out my blackheads. Forewarning: increases oxygen flow to the skin, so my face was extremely flushed for half the day.</li>
            <li> Very great prouduct. It will help to reduce the facial lines, reduce acne and even tone skin</li>
            <li> This mask does a great job of drawing out excess oil and preventing breakouts. I mix with apple vinegar and it really gets the blood flowing in my face which creates a glow after the mask is off. Great product! My skin is combination and acne prone and I have tried everything under the sun. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Dealt with acne my whole life. A LOT of money on dermatologist visits, prescriptions, and over the counter products. Everything! Some stuff worked a little, others made it worse. I started a healthier lifestyle which gave me better results. Accidentally stumbled on this and gave it a try. Using once or twice a week for 20-30 minutes people started complimenting my skin. Great feeling. It can be drying if over used. Leaves skin feeling soft and a noticeable glow. Awesome stuff! Can also be found at your local vitamin shoppe.</li>
            <li> This is great not only fora news prone skin, but also dry skin. I use Retin A and boy, do I have dry skin at times. This clears the pores the best of any product I&#x27;ve ever used. I mixed with ASV and a little honey. Make sure you use plastic utensils to mix.</li>
            <li> I grew up using the Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque and loved it until I discovered this magical stuff.  The first time I used it, I just mixed it with some apple cider vinegar like it tells you too, and it worked great.  I have been making homemade lotions and scrubs, and figured I should mix up some of those ingredients to make a super mask.  Here is what I use now:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[I don&#x27;t really measure, I kinda just add a little of everything]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base is mostly the apple cider vinegar, but in addition to the apple cider vinegar, I add some pure aloe vera juice and some rose water.  I also add a little bit of aloe vera gel from my plant.  I will also either add eucalyptus oil and/or tea tee oil, as well as some Vitamin E oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is amazing, I have shared this mask with my friends and they all want the recipe.  I am someone with pretty yucky skin.  I was lucky enough to escape acne as a teenager, but now that I am in my early 20&#x27;s I am making up for lost time.  After using this concoction, I have noticed smaller pores, moisturized (neither oily nor dry) skin, and it is quite soft. I have also noticed that my skin tone has evened out and is less red.  I am amazed that after years of trying everything on the market that THIS was all it took.  Yay for stuff from the earth! &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> i like this product i mixed it apple cider vinegar i got from walmart. my first try was last week it felt stinging at first but once you get used to it you&#x27;ll love it. i put the mask on every other day an hour before i take a shower(i leave the mask on my face for an hour), it feels great on its like your face is being sucked haha..after 45 minutes your face will feel like its pulsating. yesterday i looked my face in the mirror i noticed my pores are getting smaller some of them disapearred. i will keep using this product !!</li>
            <li> I look using this as a weekly mask.  I has really helped to clear up my skin and made by skin glow.  This is a very generous amount for the price and will surely last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have never had something work this amazing for me. For years i have broke out along the jaw line and forehead,nothing has worked for me not even a trip to an expensive spa. But let me tell you i&#x27;ve been using the clay daily with organic ACV for two weeks and it has improved not only my skin but my acne scars as well i look amazing without out makeup now it seems to smooth out my complexion. I also use this as a body wrap to improve cellulite it&#x27;s working out for me,I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who would like to take years off the face. I convinced my husband to try it and he also has been amazed. Don&#x27;t wait any longer try it you will not be dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> this mask is really great. It pulls impurities out and replenishes. I use it a lot. I have not had any skin sensitivity issues. I will say this, it pulls your face as it dries (fish face) but it does not hurt. when washing it off use a drain protector, it might clog the sink.&lt;br /&gt;  Great product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.  I did have some red patches on my face but they went away within a half hrs.</li>
            <li> Used this and was like &#x27;whoa!&#x27; because it totally made every little bump or blemish deminish! A friend of mine was over and was bummed about a zit she was developing on her chin before we were going to go out for a night on the town, so I told her to try it. She couldn&#x27;t believe it either, but that zit not only went almost completely away after she washed it off, but her skin looked so great after that she used hardly any foundation and she looked radiant! This stuff is impressive.</li>
            <li> Ouch! First time using this last night and it felt &amp; looked like I had a bad sunburn. It did however extract the nasties from my 28 year old acne ridden face like nothing I&#x27;ve ever used before! This morning my face no longer looks or feels burnt and I&#x27;m looking forward to using it again next week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife used it 2 nights ago and LOVES it. Highly recommend for anyone wanting to clear the pores. BTW, the directions say to use 1/4 - 1/2 inch on your face, making 1 pound good for 15 treatments. Not true and probably not possible. Just put on an even coverage, 1 pound will probably do a good 40 treatments.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this and I always use it with Bragg&#x27;s ACV. However, I used it every week for a while and never saw any difference. Fortunately it didn&#x27;t burn (I was worried because I have VERY sensitive skin), but it didn&#x27;t do much else either. I have acne-prone, combination skin. I switched to the QH mint julep mask and it does great things for my skin.</li>
            <li> leaves your face a bit red, but exfoliates and sucks out all sorts of things I don&#x27;t want in my skin. great price, great product, so glad it also lasts forever!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it often for one reason or another, but when I do I like the results. In one instance I used it two times within a week (2 days apart) and on the second time I noticed that I was able to easily remove the black heads on my nose. Even though I&#x27;ve read not to use your fingers when removing black heads, I didn&#x27;t even have to squeeze at all and the black heads came right out. My New Year&#x27;s resolution is to do this mask at least once a week to get the full benefits long-term.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and decided to get this product when I saw a pinterest post suggesting it pulled oil and dirt from blackheads. I wouldn&#x27;t say that all of my blackheads are gone, but I think it did clean some gunk from my pores. The best thing about the product is actually wearing it, because it feels like your face is being sucked... It&#x27;s a weird, quasi-painful but kind of awesome sensation that both my husband and I enjoyed.</li>
            <li> while it leaves my face glowing it has a very funky smell, also remember to moisturize after you put it on because it can dry out your skin! its pretty messy too but works great</li>
            <li> I love this, it leave my face so smooth. My mother and I used it once a week and i have no problems. sometimes i even leave it for more that 20 mins and it doesnt leave my face red at all. Recommend. I will most definitely use more in the future. I use organic apple cider with it, and although at first the vinger smell is a lil, ugh but i got used to it.. would use vinger instead of water.</li>
            <li> I used this with apple cider vinegar. It&#x27;s not as stinky as I was thinking it would be.. I really like it. I want to start using it twice a week but I find myself not doing it as much because I have to do it before I take a shower or else it takes forever and a day to wash off my face. I have yet to feel it make my face pulse was kinda looking forward to it but it leaves my face super soft and dewy. Oh and it leaves my face red for about 15 minutes . It looks like a sunburn in the shape where I put the mask but it disappears and it doesn&#x27;t hurt or anything like that. And also. When you prep your mask don&#x27;t use metals for mixing or measuring.</li>
            <li> So nice, I like to use this for a little &#x27;me&#x27; time.</li>
            <li> These works really well for cleaning out my pores. My nose has been a huge problem my whole life, and i have tried everything. Literally. Nothing works like this stuff. Though it doesn&#x27;t completely solve the problem (my pores are clogged again within the hour) it does clean them out completely in the moment, and I have never had that before.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product, works great!</li>
            <li> this thing really opens pores. i wear mine for an hour, cuz i have tough skin and this gets dry but by the time i wash it off my skin is so fresh. id recommend. i have tough skin and wear it with the apple cinder vinegar. i love this stuff</li>
            <li> Great for home made products.  Great quality - will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> This Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay Deep Pore Cleansing is awesome. Excellent product and Excellent price! : ) This product will last for a long time. You can mix it with water or apple cider vinger and make a paste for your face. Put it on.....your skin gets really tight and it pulses on you face. AWESOME</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!!! :D</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I found this inexpensive gem! I finally found something that helped my annoying, adult acne! Just when I was about to give up, this stuff saved my skin!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 27 year old, female.</li>
            <li> It was pretty ok. It is a messy product, it helped my skin heal a bit. I probably won&#x27;t buy again. It did make my skin a bit lighter though.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really help as far as my acne goes. Felt like it made it worse.</li>
            <li> Best product ever... Love it so much.. Money well spent</li>
            <li> Such a fabulous clay mask for such a cheap price. Don&#x27;t leave it on for too long or your face will feel like it is being ripped apart. It gets VERY tight, but does wonders for your skin if you use it on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and great price! Will add more comments to this review after I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> Most Amazing experience! Brought all my clogged pores out and made my skin look nice and bright and not oily. You can use water or apple cider vinegar I tried both water did nothing to my skin and was hard to mix together but the apple cider didn&#x27;t AMAZING!</li>
            <li> This product delivers!!! If there was a way to give a 10 star rating, I would. I do not have acne prone skin; however, I still experience minor facial mishaps--a pimple here, a zit there, etc. In addition, the pores in the corners of my nose are quite large. I followed the instructions on the label to a T and my skin thanked me for it! My face was oh so soft and smooth. I noticed the results after just one use--my face appeared refreshed and brighter. The pores on my nose seemed smaller and after I rinsed, I didn&#x27;t feel the need to apply a moisturizer as I do with the OTC cleansers. The ONLY downside is the fact that the tightening effect can initially feel a bit itchy and somewhat uncomfortable...but the discomfort subsided as the clay dried.</li>
            <li> Unless you have terribly dry skin (add some glycerin to your mask, it will help DRAMATICALLY)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IDK how this can hurt anyone. I do everything from facial masks, sprinkling this on my toothpaste....and feet soaking&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be creative, it&#x27;s a pure product and high quality.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! I loved it so much I had to leave some feedback.  I went to the dermatologist right around the time that I bought this.  I used the mask twice and saw a difference.  I  stopped the mask to see if the prescription meds actually helped my skin.  I started breaking out again on the prescription stuff so I went back to my mask and it almost instantly cleared the bumps on my face to the point that my coworker asked &amp;#34;what I was using on my skin because she could see a difference&amp;#34;.  I use the mask every other night now.  I&#x27;ll come back and do an update.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a replacement for Glam Glow.  It is a 1/10 of the price but does not in any way compete with Glam Glow.  If you are using as a face tightner or for a temporary lifting effect this did not work for me as well as glam glow.  It just turned my face red.</li>
            <li> Pure clay. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love using this stuff. It really has improved the health and vitality of my skin. It is worth it for anyone willing to try it. I mix mine with vinegar and I use Burts Bees Daytime Radiance skin cream in between the times I use the mask. I&#x27;m very happy with this!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this clay! It&#x27;s amazing! Although it stings for a few seconds while drying, it left my skin feeling so soft and clear!</li>
            <li> i never had my skin feel so soft it use to be bumpy and ruff i thank it works very well</li>
            <li> Very nice product I am enjoying it I will keep using it and then order again when I run out. thank you</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  You don&#x27;t need a whole lot of product for your face!  Just mix 2 teaspoons with some water enough for a thick paste. Then spread on your freshly cleansed face and watch the magic happen!  Feels really tight when the stuff dries.  I peeled off some chunks to find that the stuff in my pores have risen to the surface.  I have good skin, but occasional break outs.  I used just water as vinegar is too strong for me. The area that broke out (my chin) has cleared up in only 2 uses.  You need to apply serum and moisturizer right after rinsing the clay off because your skin will feel quite dry.  Your skin will feel firmer and tighter.  A must-have all over or spot-treatment for problem skin!</li>
            <li> This stuff works! It totally tingles as its drying. I Suggest using the apple cider vinegar or else it clumps.</li>
            <li> Its beautiful!  I mix this with 2 table spoons of apple sider vinegar and water. I let it sit for 10mins and then wash it off in the shower. After removal, I follow up with a green tea moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Put on a thick layer of the clay.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this at Vitamin Shop.</li>
            <li> What an incredible product. I really wish I would&#x27;ve found this sooner. It would&#x27;ve saved me a lot of trouble. This is honestly the best product I have ever tried and trust me, I have tried many. From over the counter cleansers to &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; creams, nothing works like this. I have suffered from acne since I was 13 years old. It only got worse as I graduated high school and began college. There is nothing more embarrasing than having red inflamed spots build up on your face as you watch it slowly destroy your confidence and ultimately, your face. I couldn&#x27;t even look people in the face because I was embarrassed of the condition of my skin. Forget about leaving the house with out a timely makeup routine. I was so upset about my skin I was one shot away of resulting to acutane/isoterorin. I am now 21 years old and I cannot believe how amazing this product has worked. My family is in shock after suffering with me for 8 long years. My face is the clearest it&#x27;s ever been and it&#x27;s all because of this mask. Do not hesitate to buy. It should be worth more than the price listed. I recommend using with organic apple cider vinegar instead of water for better results. I have really oily skin and I use this product every other day and I use Noxema acne solution pads ever single day (morning and night)</li>
            <li> Good stuff works well</li>
            <li> This is the first deep pore mask that actually does what it says and&lt;br /&gt;I could feel it working.  I look forward to it all the time.  Leaves my&lt;br /&gt;sking looking so much younger......so they tell me!</li>
            <li> I am really loving this so far. I have used this about 4-5 times in the 2 weeks since I got it. I can really feel it working while I have it on. After I wash it off, my face is a bit red for a few minutes, but extremely smooth. I put on some face cream and my face feels so great. My overall skin appearance has improved.</li>
            <li> I think this product clears acne well and remove some clogs in the skin. However, I feel it does make face look dull for a couple of days. I am sure some of the stuff it remove from the skin are good things.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for month, once to twice a week, my face gets so soft, clean after using it. I first tried with water it did not came out well, highly recommend to use apple cider vinegar as the instructions said. Use just 1/4 spoon of the power is good enough for my whole face, this product is gonna last forever, and works forever. Love it.</li>
            <li> When I read the reviews for this products, I was honestly convinced by the fellow who wrote his review as an honest advertisement. So I had to try it. AND WHEN I DID, it was everything as everyone described. HECK, even the jar describe what I would be feeling when I applied the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you feel the pulsation of your skin, the instructions are very clear on how to apply and take off the product. I have never felt my face so clean and smooth without having to exfoliate and with a scrub or brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The swelling of one of an emerging zit went down significantly and it was no longer hurting. I love this product and even though I have only tried it once, it was by far shown me more results in 1 day than any face wash or acne medicine I&#x27;ve ever used in weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will most def me buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> great product, I purchased it because of overwhelmingly positive reviews.I have used it for about 2 months now and have received compliments on my skin. I mix with equal parts of apple cider vinegar. Very dense so you only need about 1/2 teaspoon for your face and neck. I use it about 3x per week. It is clay so you don&#x27;t want to rinse a lot down the drain.</li>
            <li> WOWZERS!! This stuff is AWESOME...Why am I just hearing about it? I got mine in the mail Saturday to use to detox my arm pits before starting on my Soapwalla Vegan deodorant to avoid the horrible irritation that the majority of people get with the natural stuff. My pits have never been more dry...I sweat A LOT. This clay really does pull the impurities and toxins from your skin, and at the same time allows you to immediately use the natural deodorant without causing discoloration and irritation. I can&#x27;t say enough about it!! I then used it on my face. I mixed it with raw organic vinegar and it made my face feel so clean and soft. I definitely can&#x27;t use as a facial more than twice a week, but I don&#x27;t need to. This stuff is amazing..if I could give it 6 stars, I would. And the price? you can&#x27;t beat it! I&#x27;m a customer for life!!!!</li>
            <li> Get this, I break out from everything, but not this. It is really a good product to use. Once a week, toner, and a good moisturizer, very good product. Only complaint your face will be tight after you rinse, but moisturize, and no break out.</li>
            <li> I bought it based on the reviews... First application and voila! my face and my scalp turned two different colors, redness/burn all over. I hope this goes away by tomorrow morning, I look like a monster</li>
            <li> I always feel flawless after using this mask, it will leave your skin looking brand new. The tingling sensations are enjoyable, as well as the pulsating you will feel.</li>
            <li> I am really glad that I read majority of the good reviews, I had terrible acne and blackhead and this has work really well for me . I even used a little on my teenage daughter face with her acne and it help her as well. I use my with water and not the apple cider vinegar, it does give a slight irritation but barely once you can bare it for at least 10 mins and then wash it off. It does not clog my sink when I wash it off .</li>
            <li> Need I say more than what my title states. I really love how this product makes my skin feel after I have used it. I don&#x27;t use it everyday, I usually use it every 3-4 days depending on how my skin feels. If u know ur skin very well u should be able to know when it starts to feel congested as if it has to much build up and junk in it. Me I start to feel as such every 3-4 days. But go with what feels right for u. Some use it every day others once a week. All in all everyone&#x27;s skin is different and what work for some may not work for others. I used to be the kind of person to be so inpatient with new products and wanted fast result so I would go crazy and try products such as this one, everyday. But I found that it would make my condition worse. So I learned to calm my crazy obsession for fast results, and actually listen to my skin. I know that this product states you could mix it with water or apple cider vinegar. I tend to mix this with only acv. I could def. do with out the smell but it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> So far I like it, my face was pulsing!! I&#x27;ve only used it twice, the first time I put too much, trust me less is more. A thin layer is all you need, you&#x27;re wasting product if you use the recommended amount and it takes longer to dry. I&#x27;ll update my review the more I use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother, which she used with white vinegar to make a scrub.  She had said over again that she will continue to buy this product. You can make different scrubs for your face that leave your face feeling smooth and cleansed. I used it to make a body scrub as well with worked to smooth my skin.</li>
            <li> It initially makes it seem like acne is getting worse, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. It&#x27;s just pores getting cleared out. In 2 weeks (daily for 20 min), this clay cleared MAJOR acne.</li>
            <li> Can we say Oh My God. Best mask ive ever used. Never actually saw results from a mask. This was suggested by a friend who swore by it so I thought it can&#x27;t hurt to try... I&#x27;ve been battling skin issues for the past two years. After a few hours all the bleak heads in my face started to head. It was amazing and gross I can&#x27;t believe how much it pulled out of my skin. A week later it&#x27;s still improving. Definitely my new go to. My pores are so much smaller and suddenly not a single black head left on my face. Does make face red for a bit afterwards so just be aware that&#x27;s norml</li>
            <li> My Grandma would get this stuff in the mountain. I would use it all the time for my face, burns, bites. When she past away I did not know where to get it. My husband recently got a bite of some sort on the back of his ankle. I kept saying if I only had the clay my Grandma use to give us. He put some ointment on it and it help it but it still had a bump in it and was red. I found this clay in the meantime and put it on his leg at night he took it off about 12 hours later and the bump and redness was gone. And it has not came back. This stuff is amazing just like Grandma always said</li>
            <li> This stuff is nothing short of a miracle product. Im a male on a quest for well-being and what I got was a jar of just that. I love that they package it as pure powder so you get more bang for your buck by not being sold useless additives - TAKE A NOTE health/beauty industry. I feel refreshed and cleansed on an indescrible level, but best of all its 100% natural. Next time ill order 10 lbs.</li>
            <li> Buy this and Apple Cider Vinegar</li>
            <li> the closest thing to a miracle in a jar! I made a major mistake with buying Walmart brand pink grapefruit cleanser instead if putting out 8 more bucks to get the Neutrogena pink grapefruit cleanser. the absolute worst break out in my entire life. it&#x27;s like there was no real cleansing agents or salicylic acid in the Walmart knockoff. terrible terrible acne that turned into large cysts. very red and painful. I simultaneously made the switch back to Neutrogena and started using the healing clay 1x a day everyday for 1 week. sweet baby jesus!!! seen dramatic results after day 3 using apple cider vinegar as toner and medicated moisturizer and no make up.. fantastic results and they keep getting better</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT REALLY CLEANS GOOD AND TIGHTENS WRINKLES. I USE TWICE AWEEK.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for overall skin tightening but my black heads remain. I&#x27;ve since added biore strips and their black head face wash and so far my holy trinity is working. This tub will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> I saw all the great reviews, but I have to add one more thing about this product.  I keep it on my shelf at all times because it is a godsend if you get diarrhea.  My sister has had ulcerative colitis for a long time, and she gets diarrhea that lasts for as much as 10 days or more whenever she has a flare-up.  I didn&#x27;t know this for years, but one day we were talking long distance, and she told me she had ulcerative colitis and was having a flare-up that showed no sign of abating after 10 days.  Whatever her doctor gave her was not working.  I told her to take a tablespoon of the Aztec Clay and mix it with water, juice or whatever she liked and drink it before it congealed.  I had a hard time convincing her to take it, but she was just desperate enough to try it.  It stopped her diarrhea dead in its tracks.  She just couldn&#x27;t believe that something that simple would work.  She went to her local health food store and asked them about it.  They told her yes, that it would stop diarrhea, but it is not advertised that way.  This is a little known use, and it is not on the jar label.  There are other clays that will do the same, but why pay more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those who are having acne problems I would recommend that you look at a web site called demodex.com.  I have had amazing results from their products.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I received my order in the mail and could wait to use it. It was simple and easy to use. I could feel the mall tightening as it hardened and the information on the website was correct, I could totally feel my pulse under the mask. It met all my expectations and I can&#x27;t wait to use it again.</li>
            <li> My skin has NEVER been more clear.  I 100% recommend this mask to anyone and everyone.  It seems too good to be true.  I&#x27;ve always struggled with problem skin and since starting with this mask, I&#x27;ve stopped using topical acne treatments and I just wash my face with the normal cleanser at night, witch hazel toner in the morning and use the mask twice a week.  I use it with organic apple cider vinegar (1/2 tbsp each) and I wash my face with cetaphil normal skin facial cleanser. I also use cetaphil facial moisturizer in the mornings before putting on make up.  I&#x27;m honestly so shocked by how well this product works!!  Also, my acne is the huge, under the skin, painful welt type acne around my mouth and nose with occasional &#x27;normal&#x27; pimples in the T-Zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, my skin is smooth, no bumps! Please try this product out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I just need to find a way to get rid of all these spots and scars!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to make your face look crystal clear but it does get rid of a lot of acne</li>
            <li> I just used this product for the first time and I love it! My skin feels baby soft and it&#x27;s spa quality for a tiny fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> So far this stuff is great! Cleans pores really well and skin feels tight and rejuvenated afterwards.</li>
            <li> This works exactly as they say.  I mixed it with raw organic apple cider vinegar and saw immediate results.</li>
            <li> I broke out every time I used product.  Both with water and vinegar.</li>
            <li> It clears but also dries. Just know how much and how long you wanna keep it on your face. Don&#x27;t recommend to people with dry skin. As for me, my skins pretty normal so it worked just fine.</li>
            <li> This wor k s great! Love it!</li>
            <li> This mask does the trick!  You can tell it does get out a lot of the impurities in your pores.  I do breakout some after, but nothing bad.  My face looks and feel fantastic after using it!</li>
            <li> I am a long time bad acne sufferer (I&#x27;m talking nodular and cystic type of acne). Through a rigorous and strict skin care routine, I manage to prevent my face from looking like a pepperoni pizza. However, it&#x27;s never 100% clear, especially during that time of the month when I would suffer a bad breakout. I started using this clay as a mask because reviews were very positive about how it helps with acne problems. Unfortunately for me, using it made me break out worse. I did mix it with apple cider vinegar. I put this mask on 2x/week. At first, I ignored the new pimples because I believe it&#x27;s the purging. However, after 2 months, my faith was crushed and I realized it was still getting worse (not even leveling). I couldn&#x27;t handle the depression of looking at my pepperoni pizza face in the mirror anymore and stopped using this. Luckily after another 3 months, my face finally recovered. So! Lesson here is be careful if you want to use this to help with acne. Realize that there are different types of acne (blackhead/whitehead/papules/pustular/nodular/cystic), and maybe those with nodular and cystic type like me won&#x27;t benefit from this clay :(</li>
            <li> Works, you can feel your skin tingle great to use once a week</li>
            <li> Great product.  But did not arrive on date as state.</li>
            <li> great dirt !  this is the best face wash, mask, whatever you use it for.. it works.  ** only put a small amount into ziplock bag, add water, and mix that way.. its easier, can be used later, and stays clean.. this stuff is dirt, so it gets messy if you dont use zip locks. ***</li>
            <li> Did a facial with just water, burned a bit but I like the results, I have very oily dark skin but I&#x27;ll be using this on a weekly basis, will also use as a hair mask</li>
            <li> I have purchased about 3 lbs of this product and I just can&#x27;t get enough of it.  I regularly use this especially when I feel a pimple coming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure my review will be buried under the masses of rave reviews, but I do have some helpful tips if any of you get a chance to see this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, this stuff is pretty sweet. After quite a few trial and error, I&#x27;ve found a few things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. BEST TIP - if you have any left over protein powder plastic scoops (c&#x27;mon I know you have a stash hidden somewhere that you swear you&#x27;ll find a use for someday), you can just use one of those suckers to mix this mask in. Granted, you cant use a thimble sized scoop. Just use a regular one if you have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Next, just take your scoop and gather a small amount from the clay jar. Then you can just pour in the Apple Cider vinegar in a 1:2 ratio (1 part ACV to 2 parts clay).  It takes a while to find the right amt to get the desired consistency, but it&#x27;s not too hard.  NEXT just take a wooden chopstick and stir.  Stir a lot . It&#x27;s pretty neat cos once you pour in the ACV it all starts bubbling and snapping at you.  When mixed thoroughly it has a kind of \\&quot;whipped\\&quot; consistency.  Then you just smear all over your face/ back/ arms/whatever. Then you wait until it starts pulling and burning yo skin! This stuff burns my face as it tightens, then itches like crazy, then feels like someones throwing ice cold water at my face. I dont normally get a pulsing sensation, and maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong, but I enjoy it so leave me alone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhoo, I find the plastic scoop method works the best, and leaves minimal clean up, as opposed to using a kitchen bowl and spoon which tend to leave quite a bit more mess. Usually I can just get all the last bits of the mask out of the scoop with my finger, leaving the scoop almost totally clean, then just wipe the chopstick off on a body part to get all the excess off. Real classy like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always see how long I can keep this stuff on; usually 20-40 min. It tightens your face to the point where you cant even open your mouth, so it&#x27;s kind of a hassle if your significant other is home, and you can&#x27;t do anything but whimper at them like you&#x27;re a pre-oiled Tin Man.  I highly recommend doing this when you are home alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clean up is the only crappy part of all this and I have yet to find a good (and easy) solution, save from hosing myself off in the back yard :/  I really hate the idea of using all the paper towels we own just to wipe it off, and I don&#x27;t like the idea of using a bath towel (since that goes in the washing machine, and who knows how  much that&#x27;ll clog up the machine).  As of today my solution to this issue is getting half off with paper towels then jumping into the shower and pretending like nothing will harm the plumbing.  Sometimes I try to rinse off equal parts in all 4 of our sinks, just to distribute the mess evenly. Once again also pretending like that will not clog up our plumbing... I think the pretending is working!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. pro tip with the paper towel clean up - soak the towels in hot water, then lay it over your face for 10 seconds, then slowly drag the cloth down your face. If you just jump right in and smear the cloth over your face you&#x27;re going to scream like Macaulay in Home Alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. When I first received this product, I used it 4 days in a row. Normally, using any kind of product that many days would wreak havoc on my skin, break me out, and dry the eff out of my face.  Surprisingly enough, no damage has been reported. I have naturally dry skin that is insanely flaky, so after I clean the mask off I just apply a thick coat of Look, No X Ma! cream.  I use that stuff religiously, and after the mask it works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results!  I do see it working on my face.  At least, I hope it&#x27;s the mask. The right side of my face had a TERRIBLE disgusting break out for like, 3 months. I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was causing it, and have tried everything natural to get rid of it... all the products only agitated it more, which was infuriating. After I used the mask 4 days ina row, I saw things clearing up a bit. Then I got lazy and quit, because the mess is just such a hassle, but now my acne&#x27;s gotten a bit worse.  Back to the mask!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH also, DO NOT LAUGH while this mask is drying. I made the mistake of watching SNL once to pass the mask drying time. once. Never again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, we now have a thin layer of grey, green clay coating over everything in the house (mainly the computer desk). But fear not, this stuff wipes right off anything. No biggie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I saw people complaining that this clay is a greenish grey color, which they took to be \\&quot;impure\\&quot; because it wasn&#x27;t white (racists!) WELL I read on a website from this super knowledgeable person that the white stuff is actually the over-refined/bad quality clay, so THERE.  I mean, they seemed to really know their stuff, so I&#x27;ll just choose to believe them over researching it more.  It&#x27;s the American way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hoped any of this helped .. someone. Just one person, even. That would be worth it. ...a row, I saw things clearing up a bit.

            <li> I am from India and have used this clay ( In India it is called as multani mitti or fullers earth) since childhood through teens and adulthood. Its cheap and very effective clarifying mask. It also regulates the oil production and minimizes the appearance of pores. I have combination skin more on oily side esp my t zone. few of friends also use it to wash the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I soak the clay in water for 4 hours and it gets really soft to mix and applies well on the face.. I also add some rosewater (get it from any indian grocery store).&lt;br /&gt;I use it 3x week.&lt;br /&gt;Most of indian friends use it as regular mask.</li>
            <li> I have been having problems with my skin, breakouts, hyper-pigmentation, etc. etc. I was a tad iffy about ordering this, but I&#x27;m so glad I did. My face feels cleaner than it ever has! My pores are smaller, my face is soft and smooth. I love it, and I&#x27;m looking forward to using it again, and again, and again. The facial itself is intense (I used water, will try Apple cyder vinegar next time) I could feel my skin getting tighter, and it felt amazing. It feel great, and really soothing. I don&#x27;t know yet if it has helped, with my hyper-pigmentation, or my acne, but I&#x27;m going to keep using it. I let it stay on for 15 minutes, and I enjoyed every moment of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re having problems with your skin, or you&#x27;re just looking for something that will really clean your face I recommend this! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for years and my kids love it too. Works well with Apple Cider Vinegar for acne prone skin. Whatever your skin type, you see results after just one use. My experience is that it is great for shrinking pores, reducing oily-ness, smoother texture and eliminating blemishes and impurities. Healing other skin conditions with this works well too. Just don&#x27;t leave it on too long, it can irritate the face because it is so powerful. Just follow the directions and you are safe.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! I not only use it as a mask for my face I also use it as a hair mask! It&#x27;s amazing and leaves my hair and skin feeling super soft and clean. It last for quite a while too!</li>
            <li> Was very excited about this purchase, but it burned my face. I have mildly sensitive skin, so if you do I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST product I have EVER used on my face. Mixing it with vinegar makes it twice as powerful. You will see a dramatic difference in your skin appearance immediately after it is rinsed off.</li>
            <li> I guess after you have to get through the wiping and cleaning of your face. Which was a bit of a hassle, my face felt great.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t perform miracles, but that&#x27;s not what I expected. I wanted a detoxifying mask, one that would make my skin feel supple and smooth, and that&#x27;s what I got. One star off for how hard it is to clean up. You can&#x27;t put this stuff down the drain, you have to get the mask wet and then gently rub it off so it can fall into a bowl.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. The pulsating that happens is like a facial massage. I love the feeling. Your face may be a little red and irritated afterwards but moisturizer will take care of you. I have really oily skin and the next day is like a breath of fresh air for my pores. Makes it way less oily for a few days. I recommend using this only once a week or once every two weeks, especially if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I was lucky to never have acne as a teenager, unfortunately right now at 22, I am suffering from adult acne. It&#x27;s not too bad, I get zits every once and awhile, the real problem is the acne scars. I&#x27;ve tried countless products that have made my skin feel smoother, but there hasn&#x27;t been any noticeable change, until now. I was searching through amazon and I came across this product. I read the reviews and then searched the internet for other reviews, everything looked positive. I decided to buy it, I mean, the price is really cheap, so why not? I&#x27;m blown away. I&#x27;ve only used it four times, but my skin has never felt and looked this good. I have an acne scar on my cheek that has bugged me for years, but this product has made it less noticeable, and it continues to fade with every use. I will warn you that this mask is powerful, it definitely tightens and pulsates. It&#x27;s extremely uncomfortable, but it&#x27;s worth it. It does leave my face red for about 45 minutes after use. I have already recommended this product to all my friends. My younger sister who suffers from horrible acne started using it, I&#x27;m hoping she has the same positive experience that I&#x27;ve had from using this product. If you have wasted a ton of money on products that seem to not be doing anything, I would advise you to try this one out.</li>
            <li> Great stuff... leaves my incomparably skin smooth for days, and helps prevent breakouts!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! Make sure you don&#x27;t have to go out anywhere for at least 45 min though because you will be red for a little while after use.</li>
            <li> It seems like a farce. But it&#x27;s true, this stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use for face masks, and the only reason I don&#x27;t think I would ever need to buy it again is because it comes with so much product. A little goes a long way to use it on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix about two heaping teaspoons of clay with ~1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar and it makes a good muddy consistency that&#x27;s perfect to rest on the face for 15 - 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face feels very clean and purged after this mask, and I moisturize thoroughly after.</li>
            <li> As someone who has cystic acne, this was a life saver! I used this once or twice a week and I felt like it helped me deep clean throughly. If anything, i felt like it just bring up blemishes to the surface instead of being underneath your skin and being all bulgy, so that it can heal faster. After my skin adjusted, I started to notice I was not getting cystic acne anymore... I noticed I got a tiny pimple or two, but nothing compared to before. I&#x27;m barely on like my third week so I&#x27;m sure more results will come :) but make sure to moisturizer after you use it! It dried out my usually oily/sensitive skin the first week.</li>
            <li> Only thing I can say is AMAZZZINGGGGGGG</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how effective it is against acne, but my skin feel clean, smooth and tight after doing the mask for 20 mins.  It does have a tingling feeling while dries and hardens on your face.  It is way better with Apple Cider Vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;You take 1 tablespoon of  each and your stir until you get a creamy consistency. You put on a thin layer and leave it one for 20 mins. Then wash it off with warm water.</li>
            <li> I want a refund.  This did nothing for my pores or complexion.  Yes mixing it with vinegar made it FEEL like something was happening...but nothing ACTUALLY happened.</li>
            <li> STING, burn, pulsate ... feels more like my skin is being pulled off of my face!!!&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s powerful voodoo stuff that&#x27;s for sure.  I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about this yet.  Follow the instruction I added 1part clay 1part ACV, it fizzle and then died down.  I make sure my face was clean and apply the concoction to my face.. 1min in I felt it pricking and burning like there are thousand of needles being jab at my face!  OK no pain no gain I thought so I kept it on and the pain got worse, it really burns when it say pulsate believe me it PULSATE to the point of tuck and pull the skin right off of my face while having a mask of burning needles jabbing at it all at once.  I really am not exaggerating. After 4 min I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore (and I can tolerate pain, I&#x27;ve given birth to three  8lb kids) I had to wash it off.  I started off with warm water as instructed but it burns too much so i switched to cold water, the stuff washed off fairly easy, but the burning and pricking keeps on coming even after the stuff is washed off.  MY face is the color of ripe tomato but I figure it&#x27;s suppose to be like this.  And how in the heck could anyone keep this on for 20MIN!!!!  OK the worse is over after fanning my face for 30 minute it&#x27;s finally felt like my face isn&#x27;t melting off my skull.  Afterward my skin felt tight and smooth but, my cheeks are really red and looked almost burn.  I put a lot of vitamin C serum on but it was super dry.  So I put on several more coat of vitamin C serum, it all soaked into my skin as fast as I put it on.  still sting at this point but not as bad.  I then added coconut oil to my skin to moisturize it.  The next morning my skin felt tight and clean but my cheeks looked like it&#x27;s been sunburned, or healing from a bad bad bruising incident.  I&#x27;m going to wait a couple of days in hope that this will clear up.  I&#x27;m so concern that this will be a permanent scar on my cheeks.  Please let me know if you have similar experience and weather it cleared up for you.p for you.</li>
            <li> This clay mask is really nice for my body, but it is way to strong to use on the sensitive skin on my face. It works wonders for ingrown hairs on my legs though!</li>
            <li> Works very well and makes skin look and feel great, but it can be very hard (and messy) to remove. If you make it really thick it&#x27;s like trying to wash cement off and you end up having to clean the sink or shower to get the &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; out since it is in big chunks. I recommend mixing it on the thinner side for easier removal.</li>
            <li> After using this four times now I can say I am happy with the results. My pores have gotten smaller and my skin looks bright and has a beautiful glow which I get compliments about now. I&#x27;ve been using this along with a Fenugreek mask I learned from FarahDhukai on youtube and this little routine just might be the BIG MAC!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have super oily skin so I leave it on for up to 2 hours...at which point the pulsing of the mask can be uncomfortable, but when I peel it off I&#x27;m amazed at how much gunk it&#x27;s pulled out of my pores. If you do leave it on for more than the recommended time (30min I think) be prepared for a reddened face, but if it&#x27;s a cheap and deep clean you desire, this works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> After hearing so many good things about this mask, I decided to give it a try. My skin actually looks better after one mask, which was very surprising. So far I totally love it! It&#x27;s the first product I&#x27;ve tried in ages that actually gets makes the SFs (sebaceous filaments) on my nose look better. Hooray!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find that my blackheads were lifted out like it works with other people.  That said this is a good powder for other stuff.</li>
            <li> I have only used this twice, but judging from other reviews, if it&#x27;s going to work it works quickly, and that was not the case with me. also it made my face really itchy while it was drying. I will give it one more chance, but it&#x27;s not looking like a miracle product.</li>
            <li> Ok, so let me start out stating that this product works, it works ridiculously well. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone to has acne problems, oily face, or even pop marks. I read over tons of reviews before purchasing the product and took all the advice I could to execute a proper use. I tried tons of different methods and this is the most efficient way I have personally found works. It&#x27;s a bit of work, but it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;1) Get a bowl (I use a cereal bowl) and a whisk. Add the powder, then water (or apple cider vinegar, but I found it to be overkill with drying out my skin). Keep adding water/whisking until you get it to be a smooth paste. Heads up though, it will take a lot of elbow grease to get all the lumps out&lt;br /&gt;2) Set it in the refrigerator and cover it. It will take FOREVER for the clay to dry itself out. I usually mix up a large amount. I found when you apply it on cold it will grip on your face and apply much more evenly. Avoid doing it warm, the results are far better when its chilled.&lt;br /&gt;3) Get a bucket, and a old wash cloth. Fill the bucket up about a 1/3 of the way with water. You&#x27;re going to want to avoid any of the clay going down your drain, it WILL clog it, and it is not fun trying to get solid clay out of your plumbing. So when you&#x27;re ready to take the clay off, just keep wiping all of it off with the cloth and wring it out in the bucket. I do everything in my shower, and I have a mirror I can look at. This stuff can get everywhere so stay away from carpet, walls, furniture, etc. At the end, i&#x27;ll just take the bucket and dump the clay water somewhere in my backyard.&lt;br /&gt;4) Acquire a fan with a good amount of power. I use a 14\\&quot; box fan. When you apply the mask, put the fan on full blast, and it will hasten the process so you can get on with your life&lt;br /&gt;5) Everyone says to apply a thick amount. It really isn&#x27;t necessary when it&#x27;s cold. It will grip your face like an octopus, and the pulsating, tightening feeling is amplified in front of the fan. This clay can be applied anywhere on your body, and it&#x27;s insanely cheap so don&#x27;t be stingy. Your face will be red afterwards, it&#x27;s normal, it&#x27;s the blood being pulled to the surface of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;6) If your skin is drying out too much from it, just moisturize right after, it&#x27;ll leave your skin ridiculously soft. I find this product to be much more effective than any chemical face wash, such as Clearasil, pro-active, etc. And i&#x27;ve had less irritated skin when I stopped exfoliating it.an.

            <li> Try it for yourself. It&#x27;s an inexpensive add on.</li>
            <li> I ordered this mud mask from the description on the container and the rave reviews it got. I was disappointed. It was just like every other mud mask I&#x27;ve used. Except this one smelled like vinegar! I tried it with vinegar and with water and never once did I feel my face pulsating. To me, this product is like any other mud mask on the market. Just stinkier.</li>
            <li> After I read the reviews on this product I decided to get it. I got it in yesterday and used it with the apple cider vinegar.  I put quite a bit of it on just from what the directions said.  I think I probably put too much on because as it started to dry, I looked like a golem that was falling apart. I had a clump trail through the house.  Haha... I think I&#x27;ll try an 1/8&amp;#34; layer next time.  Otherwise, this stuff is awesome.  I have oily skin so it definitely helped clean and tighten my pores.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful if you breakout. I have breakouts on my cheeks due to hormones and this mask speeds up the process of extraction. Its great for just spot treatment as well. I have not had any redness after I take the mask off. It really does deep cleansing and leaves your skin smooth and squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> works great for a cleansing mask-I mix it with vinegar and water both-work better than those otc masks that come in a tube</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product a few times and i like the way it feels on my face. It closes my pores and makes my skin feel smooth and looks clearer. I have very sensitive skin and I am able to keep it on until it completely dries with no issues (using apple cider vinegar). It&#x27;s definitely clay and looks like it once it dries on your face. You only need a little to go a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this facial clay. It goes deep into my pores and cleans eveRything out. I look forward to using it once a week!</li>
            <li> I have only used this product once, so it is a little early for me to form an opinion. For the one time, it did seem to work well. I had a little trouble deciding on the consistency and don&#x27;t think I got it right yet.</li>
            <li> Admittedly I&#x27;ve only used this once so here&#x27;s my review based in that! After reading other reviews I decided to mix with Bragg&#x27;s ACV. The mix was clumpy&lt;br /&gt;As well as watery. It wasn&#x27;t smooth to put on,  it was a mess to clean out of the bowl and it was a chore to wipe clean off my face.  However being that I did My research going in I fully expected all of that!  I accidentally got some on the thin skin under my eye,  I reccomend you don&#x27;t do that Bc it&#x27;s quite uncomfortable.  I didn&#x27;t experience the pulsating, but my pro tip is to sit in front of a fan!  I had a bit of itching I&#x27;m sure though that the breeze of the fan helped distract me from most of those sensations. Here&#x27;s my next pro tip I read  to after wiping your face clean to dab witch hazel on your face using a cotton ball then moisturize.  I however found my face looking alarmingly red and beginning to burn for a few minutes afterward, and the witch hazel was not as soothing as I&#x27;d hoped. Fully expecting some burn as though, I applied some after sun aloe I&#x27;d stashed in the fridge! So so soothing! And now after the redness and tingling have subsided my complexion is great the skin is soft, and I can&#x27;t wait to do it all again. this probably sounds like somewhat a cocky review. I just see some reviews giving low stars to this product for reasons that had they done their research, would have known to expect itching, or redness,  burning whatever. So if you decide the risk is worth the reward go ahead buy this awesome jar of dirt! &amp; kudos for being smart enough to read reviews first ;)</li>
            <li> Love this, My mom uses it now as well with the Apple Cider as the mixer with me and we are hooked!!</li>
            <li> WOW. This stuff is so awesome. You literally feel it pulsating and sucking impurities out of your skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It pulls all the toxins out of your face leaving it fresh, clean and clear after a mask. I add it to my bath water for an all over spa-like effect. It&#x27;s inexpensive and yet it does more than more expensive masks. Another plus? It&#x27;s all natural! Love it!</li>
            <li> I used this mask in conjunction with Braggs ACV and I loved the way my skin felt after I used it for the first time. So much in fact that I decided to use it again the next night - that was a mistake. After using it twice in a row I broke out pretty bad, but its my own  fault because this is meant more for a weekly use anyway. Be sure to moisturize afterwards,</li>
            <li> great but you have to have some sort of scrubber because it sometimes kinda stays on your face and if you rub too hard it could lead to a abrasion.</li>
            <li> love this! very good for deep pore cleansing. Smells horrible with the vinegar but it is worth it. Even my boyfriend likes using it!</li>
            <li> I have severe plaque psoriasis.  Medications make me sick and truly do not help.  After two weeks my eye lids, elbows, legs, back and under my breast were in compete remission.  My scalp took 3 weeks.  This is the miracle answer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it does it but it sucks the white heads right out of my face as unusual as that sounds. This is only my second time using the mask but I had about 5 active pimples that I refused to pop because they&#x27;d end up four times worse and here I am a few times after using the mask and there&#x27;s no more white tips on them. It appears that all the puss and dirt in my pores is gone. The first time I used this product mixed with raw apple cider vinegar it made my face break out which is what you want. That means it brought the dirt to the surface and the second time like I said, it removed them. As everyone else is saying, this does cause your face to become red from the blood rushing to your face, You&#x27;ll feel is pulsate, like a heartbeat is under your skin and it may become itchy. It&#x27;s uncomfortable but you&#x27;ll get through it. I&#x27;ll update on how this has worked for my face a little later on. So far I&#x27;m in love. Do it every week is you&#x27;re acne prone!</li>
            <li> So far it seems pretty good. My face doesn&#x27;t get red or anything and maybe that&#x27;s cause I use water and not vinegar. It is a little hard to mix it up but I think it&#x27;s pretty worth it!</li>
            <li> This is a good home made mask that actually works. I use it every weeks to get a spa facial at home. One small tub will last more than a year.</li>
            <li> Sorry Amazon I love your company and order stuff from you literally every other day,  but my first loyalty is to fellow consumers.  Perhaps this is a misuse of the the review feature, but right now (9/12/2013) the Vitamin Shoppe has this product on sale for 4.99 plus 20% of your entire order PLUS free shipping for orders over $25.  They figure this on your total AFTER the discount though.  So I just added a bottle of my usual hair conditioner, which I essentially got for free because it gave me the magic number I needed for free shipping. HTH</li>
            <li> I just used this clay for the first time and had very high expectations based on all of the great reviews.  Well, needless to say this clay this clay is absolutely awesome.  After rinsing it off, my face felt softer than a babies bottom.  This product will most certainly be a mainstay in my collection of toiletries.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. It is inexpensive and works like a miracle. I have combination skin. I put it on, a thin layer, and use a very warm, wet wash cloth to remove it. It doesn&#x27;t take much and even a think layer works well.&lt;br /&gt;I use it once a week. I am 62 and people are always commenting on how great my skin looks.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who tries this and still has bad skin must have other physical issues going on. Possibly improper eating habits, lack of hydration, cig smoking, lack of vitamins, etc.  there are a long list of reasons why skin will erupt and look bad.&lt;br /&gt;Good skin begins within the body. Whole foods, water, and healthy living will increase the beauty of one&#x27;s skin.&lt;br /&gt;I would encourage anyone to try this product. It works better than any of the $100.+ products I have tried. As recommended, use a good moisturizer after the pore cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;I also use this in my bath water to exfoliate my skin. I add a little lavendar oil and soak for 20 - 30 minutes. A good brush or exfoliating sponge will remove ALL dead skin. My body feels like a babies bottom when I have completed this routine.</li>
            <li> Me, and both my teenaged son  and daughter use this product. It works well to control problem skin. I have seen such a great improvement in some of the acne and other skin problems we all experience.</li>
            <li> Holy Crap it works.&lt;br /&gt;But not with water, apple cider vinegar is needed. Or just an acidic liquid, like lemon juice. The clay is alkaline. But Bragg&#x27;s Vinegar is also good for your skin, so it&#x27;s a go-to.&lt;br /&gt;Also, twenty minutes doesn&#x27;t do much for me. The redness you get after taking it off? That&#x27;s where toxins were taken out.&lt;br /&gt;I thought for a second, maybe it&#x27;s just the vinegar making my skin red, but if that was the case, then taking the mask off when it was still moist would result in red skin. That&#x27;s not true.&lt;br /&gt;The mask starts working when it dries. Leave it on until completely dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would repurchase, as I have already ordered more after the second use.</li>
            <li> I wish I had ran into this product earlier, I love it.  It leaves my skin feeling so soft.  I received my order within like 4 days I was very happy withthe service and plan to order from them regularly.</li>
            <li> 100 Facials in 1 bottle (even though the description on the back says about 10-15), keeps my skin clear. I love this!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even put this on my feet for an added bonus for my pedicure and it was AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Did not erase black dots</li>
            <li> I ordered his on line after watching reviews on youtube. I am very happy with his item. It works well and you get a lot of product. Only if it didn&#x27;t take so long to mix with water.</li>
            <li> I tried mixing it with water the first time in case my skin would be sensitive to it, and no improvement.&lt;br /&gt;The second time I used apple cider vinegar, hoping to clear my blackheads. Still no improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Giving it 3 stars because it still feels nice and it would probably last for years even with weekly use - you only need about 1 Tbsp for each use.</li>
            <li> Def. is tightenin of the face and pores but I wouldn&#x27;t say its a miracle at wiping away all dirt and oils from pores. I think you have to use more than once a week to see big results. For the price I got a lot for my money&#x27;s worth and will use it all. I doubt I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Works well, but it REALLY clogs the sink.  Where do you get rid of the rinse water?  It&#x27;s been a real challenge to unclog.  TOO BAD...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this clay much at all. And if I do, it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m in major need of a deep cleansing! But from my experience, this clay does exactly what it&#x27;s described to do. It takes all the impurities away from your skin. After about 5-7 minutes, you will literally feel the impurities and toxins pulling away from your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For first timers, this may feel weird, especially if you&#x27;re not used to getting facials, but give it at least 15 minutes on your skin. I&#x27;m going to start using this again in the spring and summer because my face is already dry from the winter months. So I don&#x27;t need any extra dryness. But this is a great product for any one and any type of skin. It&#x27;s all natural! Can&#x27;t beat that!!</li>
            <li> Three teenage daughters, and they&#x27;re all seeing the difference. We&#x27;ve tried several products....including the highly publicized &amp;#34;P&amp;#34;, but this has proven to work the best. A little goes a long way, so this will last us forever. We&#x27;re using it with the Bragg&#x27;s raw apple cider 50% of the time for greater results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 36, with regular (but not cystic) acne, large, colors pores, oily skin within a few hours of washing, and a few scars. Simply put, I have bad skin. Regular, practically religious, soft washing and daily application of Benzoil Peroxide has been the only, proven, and doctor-endorsed method of keeping my skin regular. I have tried pretty much every thing else, from fruit extracts, to toners, creams, diet, etc. Still, the benzoil-peroxide routine not only works (if you stick to it) it works for most people according to doctors. And yet, with large pores and the occassional breakout  (because I dont; stick to routine) I seek out products like these. Get sucked into the hoopla of fake reviews, that spawn real reviews from people moved by the power of suggestion, and the need to defend their purchase.And then there are the people that see and believe... but they don&#x27;t understand.&lt;br /&gt;When asked, my dermatologist specifically rejected the idea that clay would solve my problems. She said i can try, the the effects would be superficial. It would inflame and dry the skin, which immediately would shrink pores and reduce oil output. It would also close powers that need to breath, extract, are that size for a reason. It would be only a matter of time until the skin recovers and I would be back to normal. That would be within a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;But look at all the reviews from people I don&#x27;t know! It&#x27;s curing people with skin like mine! Some people are curing joint pain! It works on poison ivy, and it can seal cracks in the basement wall! People even eat this stuff and it cleans their poop! It must be amazing! So i ordered 2 pounds of clay. A good time to mention, I have a degree in Environmental Science, studied clay and its formation, properties and uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excited to finally have a cheap product that will salve ALL my problems. I even bought into the &amp;#34;Braggs Organic Apple Vinegar&amp;#34; BS  and mixed up a batch for my first go. I applied it. Waited. Waited... it&#x27;s drying. it&#x27;s shrinking. It&#x27;s pulling my face with it! It pulsates and my body tries to flow blood into the area the clay is tearing apart. I&#x27;m gonna be cured!!!! I&#x27;m gonna be beautiful!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This crap dries slow. Even in my low humidity apartment in the middle of winter with the heater making static electricity out of everything, the 20 minute dry time is more like 1 hour and 20 minutes. What an inconvenience. Then add in the torturous time i takes to peal and watch this crap off. Don&#x27;t let chunks go down your drain or you will need to call in a pro to snake it out. It&#x27;s messy and it&#x27;a annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So afterwards, there is my red, inflamed, pulsating face. I close look in my bathroom mirror and my pores are smaller! Yay! After one use, my pores are noticeably smaller and looks cleaner! A miracle! I look great! Of course bathroom mirrors and those frosted globe lights places just above them are designed to make people look great. The next day, as my face recovered (and broke out as usual) look at my skin under daylight, under fluorescent work lights, nothing has really changed. it&#x27;s tighter and there&#x27;s a layer of dry-dying skin that the clay decimated. But the pores are naturally the way my genes intended, my skin is still putting out the oil my genes tell it to, and i&#x27;m looking a bit more wrinkly because of that top layer of skin cells, now dying from getting the moisture sucked out of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried again. Every night for 2 weeks. For sure it was just going to take a regimen to clean out those pores (yes clay does swell greatly in water, and when it dries, it can pull in moisture, oils, organics from its surroundings. But clay does not discriminate. It pull sin moisture from healthy cells. And it pulls in oils and organic chemicals natural to your skin. Simply put: any claims that this just pulls in toxins is scientifically false. It pulls in pretty much everything it can).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The verdict: It does a great job of cleansing skin. Which is enough to show improvements in a lot of people that don&#x27;t clean their skin properly, or just use a poor soap. It dries skin, which will temporarily reduce the size of pores and for some people reduce lines, for other people, create lines. It&#x27;s a complete mess. It&#x27;s a mess to make and apply, it&#x27;s a mess to have on your face as it can take up to 2 hours to dry completely (the act of it drying is what cleans but also kills those top skins cells with dryness and makes people believe its actually shrinking pores). It cleans. It really does a great job of cleaning. It won&#x27;t get deep into pores to clean out junk, but it does a much better job than most cleansers. TI does not do as good of a job as a cleanser with AHA  (alpha-hydroxy acid), which can dissolve the gunk in your pores, and is usually prescribed/recommended by a doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it does dry, tighten (and make it look like your pores are smaller until you shed that dry skin), and deep clean skin. For some people, the cleansing and drying is enough to battle acne. For others, this clay will cause acne through inflammation (probably for most people). But at what cost? Al that time to mix, apply... not touch anything, wait, wait, put your face on a space heater to speed it up. Then peel, wipe wash, clean, dry, moisturize, repeat? Just go see a dermatologist.ich is enough to show improvements in a lot of people that don&#x27;t clean their skin properly, or just use a poor soap.

            <li> Wow, where do I start?? This is one Deep Pore Cleansing mask that lives up to ALL of the positive reviews and is impressive. I just happened to be searching for an at home treatment mask and found this based on the top reviews....I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect because I read both 4/5 stars as well as 1/2 stars...Of course, as with many products on Amazon, I decided to take a chance. This is an amazing product -- the first time I used the mask I mixed with water and it scared the living HELL out of me with how it tightens....Yes, you FEEL this one working...I thought OMG my face is gonna be all red with blotches, what have I done???!!!! Well, it turned out just fine, better than, MORE THAN....I use it once every 2 and three weeks. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on how bright and clear my skin is ---- and that&#x27;s NEVER happened, EVER....I ended up giving my bestie a sample of it and soon after SHE ORDERED it! Yes, Buy it NOW...</li>
            <li> ALL these reviews are fake. This is a bogus product that didn&#x27;t do a thing. Go dig up mud in your yard and put it on your face. I believed the reviews...... pay attention to this one. BOGUS.</li>
            <li> Just got it. I first tried it on my arms and chest to test it. Oh my gaaawd it made my skin so smooth. Gonna try it on my face but still fearing that it will cause a break out.. Which is kind of what it&#x27;s supposed to do at the beginning. We&#x27;ll see</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product twice but am thrilled by the results. I have acne on my cheeks/jawline/chin and was hoping this mask would help unclog pores and shrink the sizes of my zits like I&#x27;ve heard. Totally satisfied! I took before and after pictures and was shocked at how much my blemishes had improved after one use. After two uses those blemishes were completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it with Bragg&#x27;s Apple Cider Vinegar (which you can also purchase here on Amazon) and used about 4 tsp of each for my whole face, although I think you could get away with 3. I didn&#x27;t experience any clumps in the mixture as I&#x27;ve read some people who used water have. (Beware, though: the smell of the ACV is a bit gag-worthy, but a very small price to pay for the results.) I mixed them in a ceramic bowl with a plastic spoon because apparently you shouldn&#x27;t use anything metal with this clay as it messes with the ions or something in the benzonite?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry skin and I heard you shouldn&#x27;t leave this on for too long or use it too often if you do. I leave it on for 8-10 minutes, and then hop in the shower to wash it off my face with water (no soap/cleanser necessary.) I&#x27;ve used it once a week since I got it and haven&#x27;t experienced any dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to see how much my skin improves with more uses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been slowly switching all my chemical laden products into &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; products. I am using this as a tooth powder along with a few drops of OraWellnes! So far, I love it, and I feel like my teeth are just as clean as the fluoride stuff.I&#x27;ll also be using this to make a face mask. I would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> *~*  So I absolutely love this stuff!  I use it to make a mud wash/cleanse for my scalp (or shampoo, since that&#x27;s what most people feel comfortable calling it).  My hair &amp; scalp absolutely love this clay.  Whenever I have product buildup from hair products I simply mix this with apple cider vinegar, aloe vera juice (homemade: water &amp; aloe vera blended or I leave the aloe vera soaking in the water overnight) coconut oil, and an essential oil into an applicator bottle and I have an AWESOME cleanser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*~*  Now that I&#x27;ve explained how I use this clay, let me explain why I love it so much.  The first 3 reasons are superficial, meaning they can be felt &amp; seen by others than just myself:&lt;br /&gt;1. When I apply this to my hair it becomes softer, after rinsing it out and the days after.&lt;br /&gt;2. My hair looks extremely shiny, which is pretty amazing considering that I have pitch black natural hair (natural meaning textured &amp; of African ancestry)&lt;br /&gt;3. After use, my scalp is completely clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*~*  The 4th reason is pretty important to me &amp; those who suffer from something similar or maybe worse.  So even though this might seem a bit long it&#x27;s worth reading still, for those who&#x27;d like to know.&lt;br /&gt;  My Dad, as far as I can remember, always had a weird fungus on his scalp.  It wasn&#x27;t psoriasis, but it was pretty close.  Thankfully I never inherited this from him, but, when I was about 9 or 10 he used one of my combs to pick out his hair without my knowledge.  And yup, I ended up having that fungus on my head as well which made my mom furious with him.  For the rest of that month my mom used a whole shampoo bottle of Nizoral on my scalp &amp; effectively got rid of practically all the fungus except for two little parts on the nape of my scalp.  Fast forward to 2013, I saw &amp; read (through youtube &amp; blogs) about some people doing a mud wash on their scalp to help them get rid of product buildup, dandruff, and psoriasis or to keep the psoriasis at bay for a while.  So I figured, maybe it could help my nape area....Geez was I one happy camper after I used this for the first time!  I&#x27;ve noticed that each time I use it there are less &amp; less areas affected by the fungus I once had...AND THEY DON&#x27;T RETURN!!!  I&#x27;ve only done this mud wash twice so far!  I haven&#x27;t tried it on my face as yet, but I will pretty soon since I&#x27;ve heard nothing but great things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*~*  I hope this review helped someone or anyone dealing with a scalp fungus, psoriasis, or just plain old dandruff, &amp; product buildup.  Regardless, I think this is waaaay more effective than regular shampoo.  At least it is for me!So I figured, maybe it could help my nape area....Geez was I one happy camper after I used this for the first time!

            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with milia for as long as I can remember.  Milia are those hard, white bumps on your face that won&#x27;t go away - they are not acne, they&#x27;re clogged pores layers deep in your skin.  I&#x27;ve been to the dermatologist, tried a prescription treatment, facials, you name it.  I am reluctant to extract because they may scar.  I finally found an expensive product that works (Elemis Cellular Recovery Skin Capsules.)  At around $100 for a month supply, plus the slow-going of getting rid of these wretched things, thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  It is working and I do see a difference.  I still use the Elemis capsules, but no longer daily.  I use this clay all over my face once per week, and do spot treatment once per week.  Pores are noticeably improved.  I have sensitive skin, but the clay didn&#x27;t irritate.  I did build up to the 20 minutes.  Also, I originally used water as I didn&#x27;t have organic apple cider.  It&#x27;s really hard to mix. I switched to the vinegar and for me, the difference was night and day.  Easy to mix and it worked noticeably more (much more humming on the skin.)  For the price, I absolutely recommend.  I have one pesky milia spot that I can&#x27;t get rid of.  If this product does the trick, I&#x27;ll update and say hands down, it works on this problem.</li>
            <li> It was alright, just a little messy. It cleaned my face, when it dried I loved the feeling of the hard clay cracking.</li>
            <li> Other people basically said that this was a miracle mask in their reviews.  I didn&#x27;t really get anything from it.  It was a fine pore-cleansing mask that was light on the face, but I didn&#x27;t feel like it had rid me of zits or extra deep-cleaned anything.  After trying this a few times, I purchased a sulfur cooling mask made by Peter Thomas Roth and loved it (see: [[ASIN:B0006BDO5G Peter Thomas Roth Sulfur Cooling Masque 5 Ounce.]]).  The sulfur mask really felt like it was working my skin.  I had a nice healthy glow after using it that I didn&#x27;t get from the clay mask.  My skin just seemed tight and happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clay mask is fine.  But I&#x27;m going to give it a 2 stars because I immediately found something else that I liked a lot better and probably won&#x27;t bother using anymore of the clay mask and felt I sort of wasted my money on it.</li>
            <li> This really does clean your skin and pores well. You can actually feel it pulling out the inpurities off your skin when left on long enough. I hated it for cleaning my scalp, however. It left residue and caused serious itching.</li>
            <li> I really did not think I this product would work for me, but for the bargain price of 10 or 11 dollars, it really was worth a shot.  I mix mine with organic apple cider vinegar, and then I leave it on for about 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is softer and smoother.  I noticed it on the first try,  but now after a month or so of using it twice weekly,  friends have noticed it as well.</li>
            <li> Although I added this as a &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; got get free shipping on my total order, I had tried it before. It works wonderfully as a face mask.</li>
            <li> My skin like looked great after use....</li>
            <li> Amazing! If you was to clean out your pores this is for you, be sure to moisturize after</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> This works good but I think its the apple cider that you use with it that really has the effect. Don&#x27;t really need clay to help your skin. I have found cocunut oil has really helped me since my skin is dry from a laser procedure. It has anti-inflammatory properties and anti-bacterial! Look it up! If you&#x27;re afraid to use oil like i was, just try a small section of your face where you can hide it if you break out like near your ear ;)</li>
            <li> This is like a vacuum cleaner for your face. It almost makes you look like you got a facial at the spa. I think it helps clear your face and appear rejuvenated when combined with ACV.</li>
            <li> great i use it only once a week and my skin is so soft</li>
            <li> Kind of a pain to do and requires some work, and I haven&#x27;t been sticking to it for this reason..</li>
            <li> You can feel the suction as it&#x27;s pulling impurities out, and one container lasts forever.  I think it&#x27;s even better than the pore strips.</li>
            <li> Gave me a facial hicki....you can feel it sucking and pulsating. I love it.</li>
            <li> my skin feels great after using this product but&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure this really cleanses my pore or not.</li>
            <li> wow.  if you want to feel old and wrinkled this is the stuff...</li>
            <li> Why do I keep buying stuff on amazon to hope one day I come across a magical product for my scars and acne. This product sucked, made more pimples come out. Used it on my chest back and face. It also sort of hurt. It made my skin dry. Only thing I found from amazon that works is dermaroller and this cinnamon mask. Amazon you are totally persuading and wasting my money. Oh and one last thing this product sucks. Might work for you idk</li>
            <li> I am in love with this mask..I use once or twice a week!I definitely recommend this to everyone. I also use it for spot treatment and sleep with it(do not sleep with it on entire face)&lt;br /&gt;Received in a timely manner. The ups just threw it in my yard.But it didn&#x27;t damage anything.</li>
            <li> Idk what the big fuss is with this product.  This product sucks doesn&#x27;t do a damn thing</li>
            <li> I ordered this to help clear out my pores,  especially in my T-zone. The directions said to mix it with water. I mixed it with apple cider vinegar instead and I love the results! My skin is clearer!</li>
            <li> Great value- just add water and apple cider vinegar for a great facial mask</li>
            <li> Pretty good product made my skin feel brand new.  The only aspect I didn&#x27;t like was the mess.  Take everyone&#x27;s advice and use the apple cider vinegar and also mix it up in a zip lock baggie.</li>
            <li> Ehh doesn&#x27;t do much for pores, it is very refreshing tho.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s made any improvements to my skin, I&#x27;ve used it twice only because for some reason it makes my face so itchy to the point where I can&#x27;t leave it on no longer than 5 minutes. So it makes me not want to keep using it. The itch is unbearable. I read most of the reviews and I don&#x27;t see many people having issues with itching so maybe it&#x27;s just my skin not sure but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I am so sad, for some weird reason this makes my face break our really bad,&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was a breakout from my skin not being used to it but the second and&lt;br /&gt;third time same thing happened.&lt;br /&gt;:O( i thought i found the solution for my moderate acne...&lt;br /&gt;but i would still recommend it.</li>
            <li> Ordered it in the morning, received it next day. First time I&#x27;m using it and I love it! I can feel my skin throbbing underneath but it also feels fresher! Love love love!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  Works good.</li>
            <li> this would change your life im a new person now</li>
            <li> We use this for my 12 year old&#x27;s complexion and now it&#x27;s a date routine on Sunday nights.  i was even endorsed in front of him by our dermatologist.  Great price &amp; great product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! Feels a little weird, but it does tell you that you will feel your skin pulsating. It leaves your face red after wards for a while so I suggest using it at night.</li>
            <li> great for oily/acne prone skin</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I mixed it with water, it clumped so bad it was hard to put on smoothly. This time, I used regular vinegar and it was a million times better. This stuff makes your face feel amazing and works well. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works in clearing the skin and especially the black heads</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for almost a month and i see no change in my acne whatsoever. I like how clean my face feels after but it does not work with mild-severe acne.</li>
            <li> Absolutely Amazing!!! I use this once a week and it cleans my face so well. I recommend this to everyone I know. Just mix with water, use plastic gloves to apply to face, and allow to sit for 20 minutes, and use a hot wash cloth to clean it off.</li>
            <li> I use this probably once monthly. I love the end results.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Definitely use it with organic ACV (it doesn&#x27;t mix with water very well). It helped clear my skin up after only two masks. My skins looks much better, clearer, and tighter. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Wife liked it. She has not complained so if mama&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Very hard to take off. Otherwise, I feel it did the job.</li>
            <li> I use the product as a hair clarifying treatment as well as a facial mask. I add about 3/4 to 1 cup of organic apple cider to 3 scoops of the clay. I stir until all lumps are out of the clay. I then section off my hair into 4 parts and apply liberally from scalp to ends. I leave the mask on for about 15 minutes or until the mask dries. Once I rinsed out the mask, my curly, dry, chemically processed hair was softer, more manageable and cleaner than ever!  I followed up with regular shampooing and conditioning. Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it for a face mask about once a week</li>
            <li> Love to use this in the mornings . My skin is all oily in the morning and this helps it sooo much</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s alright. No big difference to the skin after using it ..</li>
            <li> Too messy an application for me to love. But if one is used to that it&#x27;s ok. I didn&#x27;t feel a difference though with my pores.</li>
            <li> I feel like this makes my skin glow ! The first couple times I used it I was feeling like just another product to clutter my bathroom but by the 3rd week I really feel like it&#x27;s refreshing my skin. It&#x27;s inexpensive so I say try it ! It says you can mix it with water or apple cider vinegar . The first week I only used water and it didn&#x27;t mix well very clumpy (maybe that&#x27;s why it took a couple weeks for me too see results hmmmm) anyways then I used 50:50 water and apple cider vinegar and it worked flawlessly. I only gave 4 stars because I don&#x27;t think it helps acne too much but definitely gets rid of that dull skin for a brighter refreshed me 😊</li>
            <li> The reviews completely sold me.  I applied it yesterday night after washing my face with a cleanser.  I accidentally created a mixture that was too much so I basically packed it on thickly.  Its better to apply it thinly I think.  Anyway, after a close inspection of my skin following the removal of the clay, I saw many pusses that have come very closely to the surface.  (I totally popped them lol).  I was content.  The entire process was pretty cool.  My face was definitely pulsating!  The next morning, I saw many pimples that have come to light...Big ones too.  Im not too discouraged though because I realize that the clay was pulling the impurities out.  I&#x27;ll definitely leave an update review.  Maybe weekly I&#x27;ll post a review.  But all in all, I do like this clay.  I have confidence in it.  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I was breaking out like crazy after I tried the Oil Cleansing Method using coconut oil.  Its been 2 weeks since I have stopped and my skin is definitely clearing up with the help of this mask.  It minimizes the sizes of the pimples and leaves my skin feeling clean.  I also notice my skin is not so oily anymore during the day!!!!  I can already tell that by the end of August, all the pesky pimples will be gone!!!!!  I think this clay really is good!!!</li>
            <li> Hands down best mask I have ever tried :)</li>
            <li> I got this product because I wanted to get rid of my blackheads. I have had blackheads for 5 years and was not able to take them out. When I started to use this mask once a week on the weekends I saw that they didn&#x27;t come out on their own, so I had to use a tool to extract it and it worked!! After doing my routine for a couple of weeks my nose and cheeks had little to no black heads! Using this mask made it easier to take them out. After I took out my blackheads I washed my face with a face towel and dried my face. Then I put jojoba oil on my face then got ice from the freezer and closed my pores. I think this works well for people that have a lot of blackheads. In my case I suffer from black heads more than pimples. But also keep in mind that to get a result I had to do every weekend. It made me feel more clean and more confident in my skin!</li>
            <li> I used this clay to do my own DIY of the glam glow face mask which has worked wonders so far! Only need to use once a week so you don&#x27;t over-dry your face. It&#x27;s also a lot of product, so it&#x27;s really worth the price too.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Definitely recommend using it with apple cider vinegar over water; also recommend adding a drop of tea tree oil</li>
            <li> You need to get this-then you&#x27;ll know what it does!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it makes your face soft. The only downside is the redness you get after for a little bit and it smells like wet clay so don&#x27;t be to surprised it doesn&#x27;t have a nice smell.</li>
            <li> Excellent Products... It does what it said it would do!</li>
            <li> I have only tried it a couple of times. But I have noticed a difference!</li>
            <li> I use this with Apple Cider Vinegar to make a wonderful facial mask once weekly to keep my skin free of blackheads. It will last forever because it only takes 1 tsp clay mixed with 2 tsp vinegar.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical, but after the first use the amount of gunk that came to the surface was horrendous. In a few days, they were dried up and my face started clearing up. I exfoilated and used an acne peel. Got my whole family using it.</li>
            <li> It says to mix with apple cider vinegar for the tingling feel.  It isn&#x27;t the &amp;#34;healing clay&amp;#34; that tingles...its the ACV!  I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin and have used a few times.  The ACV isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;tingling,&amp;#34; but give a burning feeling.  I switched out with willard water and still not impressed by the clay deep cleansing my pores.</li>
            <li> For the price, this can&#x27;t be beat.  I can&#x27;t quite figure out how to not have clumps.  I sure would welcome any tips other commenters have on how to avoid clumps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How it works: It is AMAZING.  It is much better than any other clay product I have used. I do like that it has no water in it - it keeps the price way down, I&#x27;m not paying for the shipping of the heavy water!</li>
            <li> This is amazing for both my face and hair. I usually buy it from Whole Foods, but this is slightly cheaper</li>
            <li> Makes  your face really  tight! Works great I love this  stuff works great with vinegar!!</li>
            <li> Never used a product like this before, but I&#x27;m using it for making remineralizing tooth paste. I&#x27;ll be trying it for face mask eventually. Thanks for the great prices!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I have sensitive skin and could keep it on my face for up to 30mins, really helped clean my face, helped with pulling up blackheads and dirt!</li>
            <li> Clay tightening face and help reduce oil production on my face for several hours. Awesome product!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! SO HAPPY I FOUND THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Like it, but its very messy. Wish it was easier to use.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of masks since I am acne prone (thank you hormones). This clay is easy to mix with water (or apple cider vinegar) and easy to apply. It&#x27;s rather thick, I usually put it on in the morning before I shower. Then I take a wash cloth into the shower with me to wash it off, works better than simply rinsing over the sink. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this.  It makes my skin soft and clearer looking.  My daughters use it for acne.  Not sure of their results since they don&#x27;t use it regularly enough yet.  Even my daugher&#x27;s boyfriend likes to use it as he says he likes how soft it makes his skin feel.</li>
            <li> I never really understood when people said that this mask makes your face vibrate but it is so cool. I like it and it makes my skin feel clean. I have to take a shower to get it to come off and so I don&#x27;t have all the clay in my sink. I also did what another person suggested and put it in a plastic bag and mixed it together and then used it as a glove to apply it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Love the way it makes me skin feel. It is has a pulsing effect while the mask in on, slight redness once you take it off, and immediate softness in skin. It is all natural as well, I would reccomend trying it out.</li>
            <li> This is very strong clay and will clean all your pores. You mix it with apple cider vinegar and leave on for 10 to 15 minutes. When you wash it off your face, it takes some work getting off but your face will feel so much better. It&#x27;s the tightest mask I&#x27;ve ever had on my face. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell of the vinegar but it&#x27;s good for your skin. I would recommend to everyone who wants a deep pore cleaning.</li>
            <li> Bentonite clay is the same stuff companies use to manufacture kitty litter and more expensive prepared masks.  You could hypothetically get kitty litter and crush it but this is a very finely ground powder.  Any leftover will dry into flaky clumps.  I tried to reused this, which albeit easier than kitty litter, and it is never quite the same as the original batch.  Only make enough to use for one sitting.  You can add things like apple cider vinegar, substituting for part of the water, and it will compliment the effects of the clay.</li>
            <li> My skin felt so tight and soft that I couldn&#x27;t believe it was mine. If you add more layering on any spot with blackheads and peel it off, it removes them all. It was so gross yet so cool (weird acne fetish) but I can&#x27;t even recommend this enough.</li>
            <li> Such a wonderful product. It got rid of almost all my blackheads, and tightened my pores! My face feels so clean and silky after use!</li>
            <li> I liked this clay, it&#x27;s OK. Makes my face super soft but I also started to break out :( I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a temporary side effect, I stopped using it. my mom loved it!  She doesn&#x27;t have any complaints at alI, my face is dry and my moms is oily, I guess it all depends on your skin type.</li>
            <li> this stuff already has amazing reviews (thats why i tried it) and i can say it does do a good job after your first use, if you are using it for acne, you might get breakouts but after that (using 2 times a week) it should just make your skin glow and look good. my friend used it who doesnt get acne and right after there skin looked great and the day after was glowing.&lt;br /&gt;give it a try!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really help for on-spot pimple treatment as others have noticed; for me, it seems to aggravate the pimple more, but I will say it does bring it to a full head (maybe that means it&#x27;s speeding up the healing?). I sprinkle this in a bath sometimes, and as a face mask. Don&#x27;t use before going out, it does make your face red. Also, don&#x27;t talk with this stuff on as it hardens when it dries and can stretch the skin if you move too much with it on. I use it before bed and make sure to moisturize with a face lotion afterwards. I do notice I have a bright, nice glow after using.</li>
            <li> comes in a powder form, was thrown off and still haven&#x27;t reopened it because you have to mix it a certain way with water.</li>
            <li> This is clay. It is great for the skin. Works great with apple vineagar and/or water. Good product. I recommend it</li>
            <li> DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS SELLER. It&#x27;s been more than a year and I still haven&#x27;t received my purchase. This was my first and only rip off. Great item, very cleansing. Order it from someone else.</li>
            <li> what can I say I love how it pulls my pores and the very next day black heads come to the surface and even 2 to 3 days later love it</li>
            <li> I must say I am a verrrrrrrrry happy customer with my recent purchase of the Indian Healing Clay!!!! I have been using this product for 1 week now and it is truly remarkable!!!. I still can not believe my eyes or skin! From the first day I applied it I saw  improvements in the appearance of my skin, but waited a while longer before posting a review to make sure I am satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My story -&amp;#62; I&#x27;m a 25 yr old female, been suffering from Type 2 - Moderate Acne ever since puberty and I&#x27;ve exhausted all possible options in an effort to rid my skin of this ailment. From proactive, clean &amp; clear, Clearasil, sulfur bars, spent thousands of dollars at dermatologists, home remedies, I mean everything!!! Can&#x27;t believe that all this time the Indian Healing Clay has been out there, I must say a best kept secret until I stumbled upon it here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I have never been so happy in a longest while with my skin, because i&#x27;m always self conscious about my skin and how it looks, acne pimples sticking out all over and my entire face covered with scars from picking the filthy pimples!! Now just in 1 week all that is history!!! OMG!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to this product;&lt;br /&gt;No more acne&lt;br /&gt;No more will I have to pick pimples (AWESOME)&lt;br /&gt;Scars are disappearing (AMAZING!)&lt;br /&gt;My face is now smooth like a baby&#x27;s bum&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels renewed (TOTALLY NEW SKIN!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m absolutely happy and I recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s suffered from acne like I have,DO NOT HESITATE -JUST BUY IT and start using it as per instructions YOU WILL NEVER REGRET. ENJOY NEW AND RENEWED SKIN NOW!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Thank God I found this product. I like it very much. give it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it with and without the apple vinegar and it works amazing. If you buy the nose strips, you should switch to this because it works better and this giant jug will probably last for longer than a year. You don&#x27;t need much of the clay for your face so definitely an awesome value. Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is the best mask I have ever used. It deep cleans, exfoliates and rejuvenates my acne prune skin. Since I started using it my acnes are few to none. Love it.</li>
            <li> Do not use water as it does not mix well.  Almost gave up on it but the I bought some apple cider vinegar.  Pretty good mask! I use it once a week.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product. I read all the reviews on here about how it works so well, and I thought I might as well give it a try since I really have nothing to lose. My skin is oily, pimply, disgusting. I&#x27;ve had acne since puberty hit (which was a loooong time ago) and nothing has ever really worked. I&#x27;ve decided to switch my routine to all natural products and for the first time in YEARS my skin is clearing up. Before this I used the Queen Helene mint mask. It was all right, but after using it my skin was still clogged up. I was using apple cider vinegar as a toner already so I liked the idea that I could mix it with this mask. It&#x27;s simple. I mixed my apple cider with this-- I have to say it&#x27;s taken me a few uses to perfect the amount of vinegar to clay ratio, so you would have to try what&#x27;s best for you. If you have sensitive skin, I would recommend you use water, because this will turn your face red. Bright cherry red. But it says that it will do so on the container, and it does go away after 30 minutes or so, but maybe if you use water it won&#x27;t be so bad. I can feel the oil being sucked out, because as this clay dries it gets tight, if you leave it on too long it gets tight and itchy and really uncomfortable. This is not a mask you use to relax, this is the kind of mask that means business. I&#x27;ve used it for about a month now about 2-3 times a week, and the results are amazing. The first week I used this, my skin went through a purge. A lot of pimples and whiteheads that were underneath the surface started to come up, so I did panic a bit. But by the second week of using this, my face began to clear up. After a month I have a few pimples left over, but nothing to the extent of what it was when I started. Also to get this off, I have to use warm water and a wash cloth, and slightly soak the clay before it gets soft again. Because it doesn&#x27;t want to come off. My skin is the best it&#x27;s ever been and getting better. I think you should definitely try this out, and for the price, you really have nothing to lose., and for the price, you really have nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> The reviews for this product really made me think I was getting some kind of skin miracle.&lt;br /&gt;I did NOT feel any pulsating. There was tightening, but no pulsating. Tightening is expected for every other clay mask, so it is not anything special.&lt;br /&gt;It DID shrink my pores... for a few hours...&lt;br /&gt;I did NOT see any improvement with acne or overall skin clearness.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not that impressed with this product. I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this mask! It makes my face feel so smooth after I use it. And this bottle lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Amazing! It takes a bit of practice to get the right amount and make the clay paste just right, but the results on the skin are really visible! Soft, almost pore free skin! I LOVE IT! Gonna keep buying it, for sure!</li>
            <li> Works great. Only used it twice, but my face feels smoother instantly. There is some redness after use, so I just use it before going to bed at night.&lt;br /&gt;I use a used yogurt cup (washed) and put a couple tablespoons of vinegar. Then I use and old makeup brush to dip into the powder and slowly mix into the water to make the desired consistency. It took me a while to stop making  a mess with the powder. I apply it with the brush to get an even application and use less, so it lasts me longer.</li>
            <li> Drying but smoothing to the skin</li>
            <li> I love this. I use it on my face and on my bf. I fell asleep with it on and thought my face fell off but my skin was so soft and clean and it sucked the oil right out of my skin!</li>
            <li> Will last you a lifetime!</li>
            <li> The only mask that makes my skin feel clean. I have oily skin with large pores, and blackheads. This is the only mask that leaves my skin feeling clean. I use the organic raw apple cider vinegar, but I&#x27;ve used plain water too. One tablespoon of clay is enough to cover my face. I does give a pulsating sensation for a few minutes. I&#x27;m so glad I found this product. I will be repurchasing this product.</li>
            <li> Great for cleaning and for my facial mask. I love this product. Jdbbfbfjejjejejke hehhebd ehhehdbe ehhehhehr hehebhe shhebebe ehhebbe ehhebe ehhebe</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! My face started pulsating and I freaked out thinking it was eating my face, but once I rinsed the clay off my skin was brighter and refreshed! Try not to smile or laugh because this stuff will crack!</li>
            <li> Found cheaper at Whole Foods (hence 4 stars), but they were out, so I bought online as a gift for a friend. Love this product. I bought the 2lb tub for myself. I use it for face masks w/ apple cider vinegar, and sometimes in a bath as a detox.</li>
            <li> This mask feels great on your face. Both my wife and I enjoy it. Sensitive skin types should do research before applying. Always skin test. Both of us have had 0 problems with this mask though.</li>
            <li> I had been reading reviews with people raving how good this product was for acne and finally decided to purchase.  Thus far I&#x27;m glad I made the decision.  Ive been mixing with water but will eventually try with ACV. No complaints thus far and would recommend.</li>
            <li> So, I bought this especially for my pre teen with blackheads that are multiplying by the day.  She&#x27;s been using proactive for about a year and they aren&#x27;t getting worse, but aren&#x27;t going away, either.  The dermatologist scoffed when I told her what we&#x27;re using, because she said that the ingredients in proactive aren&#x27;t any different than what&#x27;s in drugstores... people are just more vigilant about using it so it seems to work better...&lt;br /&gt;but about the clay... I used it on myself to get an idea about what to expect.  I a 42, with combo skin, large pores in the t-zone that are a struggle to keep clear.  I mixed a tbsp of clay with 1 1/2 tbsp acv with \\&quot;mother\\&quot;.  I foamed and made a whipped, wet, frothy mixture.  I put a THIN layer on my face and sat down to watch tv.  The layer was thin, mainly because I mixed it thin...not the 1/2 in thick like the directions say... just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to do it!&lt;br /&gt;I waited for the tightening and tingling and forgot to watch the clock.  The jar says about 10 minutes, but it took longer for it to dry and tighten/tingle, so it was closer to 15... and that was a thin layer!  I can&#x27;t imagine what a thick layer would need to dry.  The tightening was similar to what I&#x27;ve experienced with masks.  The tingling was expected, but still peculiar.&lt;br /&gt;After 15 minutes, I rinsed gently with warm water... I didn&#x27;t want to scrub.  I followed with a cool rinse.  My skin looked pink at first and got progressively redder... exactly in the borders of the mask. Thank goodness I didn&#x27;t slosh some on my eye area!  The pinkness turned progressively redder and took over an hour to disappear.  Then I realized that the acv is an acid... I am remembering all my salad dressing making and how an acid is needed.  Now I&#x27;m wondering if the clay is just used to hold the acid on the skin and if in fact, I just gave myself a acid peel!  My skin looks the same as it did before.  The pores look the same and all it does feel smooth... as if I just exfoliated.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t use it on my daughter... too harsh and I guess I was expecting miracles.  Reading the 3, 2 and 1 star ratings was very illuminating and made me too nervous to use it on her, considering my redness.  I&#x27;m not using it again... Just threw it away.  Can&#x27;t risk it.  Too nervous about what the next few days will bring!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update in a couple of days if I have any breakouts associated with this.  Picture day at school is coming up and I hope I haven&#x27;t screwed myself into having a zit filled picture with my students!r /&gt;I won&#x27;t use it on my daughter... too harsh and I guess I was expecting miracles.

            <li> this was the first time i mixed my own facial and i absolutely loved it. it made my skin soft and was was really good on my pores.</li>
            <li> nothing great about this product.  It is simple and pulls unwanted debris from your pores.</li>
            <li> Really tightens up and cleans pores!!! Love it! Affordable and works!  It isn&#x27;t too harsh, and it is natural.  A must buy!!</li>
            <li> This is the best purchase I have ever made for my face. Mix it with apple cider vinegar and it will completely clean out your pores. Dramatically improved my acne, made my skin feel silkier, and I saw results after the first use. USE THIS!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;I am very much into natural organic health remedies. I dont use chemicals. I use this product at least once a week and it takes away any blemishes. I have also noticed my skin is much more smoother. I use this along with my oil cleansing method. I highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I love this mask. It does everything it says it will do. I have trouble with blackheads and clogged pores and I have only used the mask 3 times, thus far. But, I can already see a difference in the blackheads. It does bring them to the surface and I just exfoliate as normal and my face is very smooth and looks better. I have not noticed a decrease in pore size, but it is still early. The only downfall is rinsing off the mask and trying not to let it go down the drain. From what I have read, it could settle in pipes and clog the drain. Other than that, great product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!!! It made my face really soft. My skin looks great after using it. I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. A little is all you need. Keeps my skin soft and break out free. Huge container. Lasts forever</li>
            <li> I am 28 and after 3 weeks of daily use, I have the clearest skin I&#x27;ve had since I was 12.  Buy Bragg&#x27;s ACV, it does make a difference than using non-organic.  Using hot water is a waste of your time, it will be clumpy. Using Bragg&#x27;s creates a creamy mousse like texture. It feels amazing on my skin and when washed off, my skin feels tight and refreshed and my pores are smaller.  This has a couple thousand great reviews for a reason.</li>
            <li> I love this product, its great on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my face, teeth, pits, and feet!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s wonderful &amp; it arrived on tim &amp; in great condition!</li>
            <li> Pretty good so far. Used with organic raw apple cider vinegar. U really do feel tightness and ur face pulsing... But in a GOOD way. When u finally wash it off it will hurt like the dickens peeling the clay from around ur nose and be ware this stuff will clog up ur sink so wash it off in the shower. The package says only use it once or twice a week. And I think that would be good enough for me. So far so good.</li>
            <li> I wish I knew how to post a picture of the before/after but it&#x27;s amazing. I recomend not being cheap and buying Braggs raw organic apple cider to use along with it * taking a shot of the apple cider alone once a day will help you shed weight too* but this mask is fantastic. I&#x27;ve used so many different ones and heard about this one one reddit /skincareaddiction and I love it. Will continue to use on my acne prone and oily skin every other night until I die.</li>
            <li> Talk about a miracle. My skin feels and looks so amazing after this product.</li>
            <li> Works really well to help suck up oil from my skin. Helps dry up small blemishes. You must mix with Apple cider vinegar, it gives the mask a Mousse texture and no clumps. I add activated charcoal and a few drops of lavender oil. Love this mask.</li>
            <li> I like that a company has conned me to purchasing mud for a decent amount of money. Sure it&#x27;s more pure than what&#x27;s out back and has less worms, but it&#x27;s just dirt. Did the facial and definitely felt something, don&#x27;t really know if it works, I&#x27;m not one of those health nuts that will praise the stuff but it seems to do what it says it does. Felt face stretch as it dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff makes a mess and I&#x27;ve had it for 3-4 months and used it twice the first month. After that it wasn&#x27;t worth the cleanup, the product had lost its allure for me. If you want a facial mask I&#x27;d suggest it, but if you were on the fence I&#x27;d say don&#x27;t buy it at all.</li>
            <li> It got ride of my very small bumps on my face. It takes about 5 uses. Mine is not that serious.</li>
            <li> Feels like mud eating me.. So I guess it works!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  Need to be careful mixing it up, but once you get it right, it is perfect!  I can feel it working, and my skin is wonderful after it is removed.  Very affordable, and very effective.</li>
            <li> The clean up with this is the only reason I cannot give 5 stars. Due to it being mud and you cannot wash it Down the sink. I fill a large bowl with hot water and use a wash cloth. Then dump it outside and rinse everything with he hose. But it give a great clean feeling. Leaves my skin feeling absolutely baby soft. I also used in on an infected mosquito bite that hat healed after 3 weeks. After the first use all surrounding redness was gone!! Pain gone. My bite is now healing. Used as a avail mask it does leave your face very red immediately after but goes away, so best to use in the evening</li>
            <li> This did not irritate my sensitive skin - Very deep cleansing</li>
            <li> i tried everything to treat my acne but with the clay my acne is almost gone. LITERALLY THE BEST PRODUCT IVE EVER USED!!!</li>
            <li> It was for my girlfriend. She didn&#x27;t complain, so I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Best mask out there. Huge container for a small price, what&#x27;s not to love</li>
            <li> I love you so much, it is helped improve the texture of mine and my husband skin so much. I just wish that you didn&#x27;t have to use something acidic to balance out how Basic(lol) the clay is. The smell of apple cider vinegar is off years after washing off of my face, but I will deal with it for the amazing results I have seen already. Your face will get tomato red if you are pale but it is well worth it just wait for your face to the back to normal and then use a heavy moisturizer afterwards. Sometimes I apply lush cosmetics catastrophe cosmetic on top of the redness. this combination is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s skin is different and will react differently to different products, good luck!!</li>
            <li> Love these with apple cider vinegar! Really clears up the skin. My boyfriend loves them too so we introduced weekly masks... highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Only 4 stars because of how clumpy this clay is. I mix with water in a sandwich bag for easier clean up and wash off in the shower or bath tub. Even with water, I can feel it vibrating or pulsating my skin. My blackheads are gone. Only use it about 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> My fisrt time using a clay mask. Amazing result</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  Works like a charm!</li>
            <li> This is excellent stuff and you can&#x27;t beat the price!  I mix it with apple cider vinegar--it doesn&#x27;t smell or look pleasant, but works.  I have acne prone, extremely sensitive skin and really like it.  One jar will last a very long time and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great with water. Apple cider vinegar doesn&#x27;t work with it because the alkaline in the mud and the acid in the vinegar neutralize each other, like baking soda and vinegar. With vinegar I didn&#x27;t feel anything or have any effects, with water it was very deep cleaning and amazing</li>
            <li> There is nothing I can say to express how much this saved my skin. I&#x27;ve struggled with acne since I was a kid (25 and still struggling). I tried every rip off cleaner/clenser/toner known to man, nothing ever held up, always end up breaking out worse. After almost giving up and just dealing with my horrible skin, I found loads of testimonies about this clay. I researched and researched untill I broke down and bought this as well as some Apple Cider Vinegar, the raw mother! Holy hell this really cleans your skin! After you get the right consistency down, you&#x27;re good to go. A little goes a long way trust me. After you apply, let it set for around 15-30 mins, depending on how long you can take. You literally feel your skin pulsate! Removing it is a chore in itself, but the results are well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve struggled with crappy skin and don&#x27;t know where else to turn, give this a try. You wont be disappointed!</li>
            <li> We have used it with only a tingling and it seems to work.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! This truly works to get your skin clear and pores tight. Great value!</li>
            <li> Amazing! I love the way it makes my face feel and look!</li>
            <li> Oh wow.  This is the first mask I&#x27;ve bought that I actually feel like DOES SOMETHING, besides just feeling good.  Truth be told, this one is a little uncomfortable, especially if you leave it on longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me: dry, hormonally-acne-prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask: ruthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are people really mixing this with water?  Really?  I use it as directed, with ACV (Bragg&#x27;s), and whip it.  I do NOT understand why the directions indicate applying it 1/4\\&quot;-1/2\\&quot; thick.  I tried that the first time and it fell off in pieces.  I recommend applying after a good 10 minute facial steam.  Open up those pores and make the clay WORK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, you may or may not feel the pulsating, but hopefully you will feel the tightening.  Woo.  Sucks your face right in.  The \\&quot;black-hole\\&quot; comments crack me up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is messy though!  Boo!  I am afraid of it clogging the drain!  I just don&#x27;t tell my roommates, and try to get as much of it off before hitting the shower.  I dab my face with a warm washcloth, filling a basin with water, and try to get the majority of it off there so I can dump it outside and not deal with the possible clogged drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive, and natural.  Bentonite is really great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for another mask containing bentonite, try Concha Nacar&#x27;s Bleaching Cream #3.  It&#x27;s not a bleach and it&#x27;s not a cream; lost in translation, it&#x27;s a refining mask.  Gentle, but does contain bentonite as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> It worked for me. When you apply it your skin gets tight and when you wash it off it feels so soft. It is a good product and the price is great. I have not made a dent in my jar it is big. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> used it once and it cleared up my face within a few days! made my skin very soft and no more blackheads! yay!</li>
            <li> This is as close to a miracle mask for my face as I&#x27;ve ever come.  I like the results even better than the Proactiv mask, which was my go-to mask before this.  I mix with ACV as directed and put on a thin layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have noted, this stuff can be messy to remove.  I use the mask while I soak in the bath.  When dry, I put my face under the surface of the water and rub gently with my hands and it comes off in the water.  Makes a mess in the tub, but it&#x27;s fairly easy to rinse down the drain (no clogged pipes...yet).  My skin is oily with the patches of dryness that come with almost 50 years of age.  I still get acne sometimes and also have Rosacea affecting my cheeks.  This takes care of the acne, seems to even out both the oily and the dry skin, and BEST OF ALL, lessens the Rosacea redness and veiny look the next day.  Doesn&#x27;t make it go away, but makes it look better for a day or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This mask will probably make your face red for a little while after use...maybe about a half hour but after that goes away, all your left with is great skin. Removed all my blackheads..I even ordered one for my sister in law after using it. She likes it also. I have sensitive skin so irrated me for a little while but went away shortly after.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews and I am pleased. Not the MAGIC that everyone exclaimed here, but good enough for me. I use this product about once a week or every other week. I mix the dirt (clay) with a little water, enough to spread a thick layer on my face, and I put it in a small plastic bowl and keep it in my bathroom for easy use. I make sure to put extra water in the container to keep it from drying out in the cabinet, and it seems to be doing well (for the past few months) and I just add to it here and there. I have to make sure to moisturize my face after with lotion as this does dry my face out, but it definitely makes my face BABY soft. Love it. A great mud mask.</li>
            <li> Good product. I would read the review comments regarding reconstituting the powdered clay into a workable mask. Can be a bit difficult. I used apple cider vinegar and it seemed to come out more consistent than when I attempted to use water. Oh and don&#x27;t try to use apple cider vinegar to reconstitute and then put it in a sealed jar and shake... Needless to say I had a huge mess. The apple cider vinegar caused it to bubble and fizz releasing gas and kapow, messy bathroom sink and mirror. Despite my mishap I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This product is definitely one of those I can&#x27;t live without.  I have been using this product for 2 or 3 weeks now and it is amazing.  I mix it with bragg apple cider vinegar, apply and wait 20-30 minutes until it is almost completely dry.  Get hot wash cloth and wipe off.  The results, WOW. I am a smoker, so I apply extra thick layer around mouth and nose area.  Rough patchy skin, gone.  Blackheads, gone. Sunspots, fading. I am left with dewy, smooth, firm face.  I apply tiny amount of Nutiva cocnut oil, done.  Can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the foundation of youth but it&#x27;s the next best thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people with sensitive skin, dilute vinegar with water or honey or just use water.  You will feel your skin get tighter and tighter, the longer it sits.  Around the edge of my face burns a little after I take the mask off but the coconut oil soothes it right out within a minute or so.</li>
            <li> I use this product once a week and my acne is completely gone..my face is smooth and I get a ton of compliments on my face..one jar can last for months so this product is very reasonable...after using expensive proactive for years and still dealing with acne this mask cleared my skin up in less than a month and I have not had one breakout since..this product is amazing but I do not recommend that u mix it with water apple cider vinegar is what gives it that pulling effect.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this VERY highly, she has been using this mud for years. After reading all the reviews, I was a bit hesitant but I am so glad I bought it! It really uncloggs pores and removes the top layer of skin - skin feels smooth and refreshed. It is a bit...intense...but def not painful or anything. To wash off after it has dried I take a wet washcloth and wet an area before scrubbing.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly.&lt;br /&gt;I used this after cleansing with Adovia Dead Sea Body and Face Soap Bar.&lt;br /&gt;I have slight acne problems and the next morning with the Soap my skin was blemish less:)&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff !!!</li>
            <li> Love this product--used it before years ago.  I will see what other products this company has to offer.  I use this several times a week and it really cleans out my pores.  Wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with this product! Just tried it yesterday for the first time and it certainly lives up to its reviews.  I have the largest pores anyone could have and many blackheads on my nose. After using it yesterday, as instructed with apple cider vinegar, I couldn&#x27;t see ONE pore on my face! I couldn&#x27;t stop staring. It&#x27;s the smoothest I&#x27;ve ever seen my skin! I just reapplied it today and tried the brush effect someone mentioned...mixing and applying with a makeup brush and I must say this is a much cleaner and smoother application than using your fingers. It&#x27;s not clumpy if you add enough acv, real smooth creamy texture. I don&#x27;t have acne per se, but my pores are ridiculous and still show with makeup or powder. But this morning they didn&#x27;t, yaaayyy! Nobody recommended this product, I came across its reviews by accident and I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li> I love love love it!  I have used so many of the more expensive products out there and this one is no joke. My face does pulsate as the mask dries and pulls.  I am a bit redfaced after I wash it off, but after that subsides, I am SO SHINY clean! I KNOW it pulls the dirt out of my skin.  NO other product that I am EVER used makes me shine they way this does.  I swear by it now and tell all my friends to throw out the expensive stuff.  This is the bomb diggity and I have no problem claiming it to be the best skin detox.  Twice a week with the apple cider vinegar is my routine.  I join the rest of the hundreds out there that love this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, and love it. I use it either every night, or every other night and my skin has not reacted like when I&#x27;ve used other masks in the past-which would be getting heavy breakouts due to \\&quot;bringing up the bad stuff\\&quot;. Also, if used the way I&#x27;ve been using it (continue reading on tips for mixing) I expect this tub to last me at least a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very oily skin and large pores that I absolutely hate...I read a lot of the reviews along with the description of the product and was specifically interested in what it could do about that. Well, it works. Maybe after some prolonged use, I&#x27;ll see a long lasting effect on this front; but what it does do instantly is completely shrink your pores to the point of them being nearly non existent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As stated in other reviews, it is NOT necessary to use a super thick layer of the product. I&#x27;ve found that a nice, even layer enough to cover your skin is all that&#x27;s needed. Your entire face dries within about 30 minutes and I keep it on as long as I can...However I can&#x27;t help picking at it as I&#x27;m watching TV...Eventually a nice, cool wash cloth takes it off really well and your face is tight and feels super clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got it, I tried it out on my face, neck and chest. OUCH. My face was not bothered at all by the burning-which is a really itchy sensation but my neck and chest were. Apparently MY face can take the burn \\&quot;pulsating\\&quot; effect more than my body can, but that&#x27;s just me. I don&#x27;t have the issue of my skin getting really red after using the mask, but again-that&#x27;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a few tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Mixing this super fine powder w/o getting clumps in a bowl is really hard, like-REALLY, REALLY HARD. I don&#x27;t care how slowly you try to do it-clumps happen and are nearly impossible to get rid of. It&#x27;s wasteful AND you have fat chunks on your face that don&#x27;t dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the other reviewers mentions putting it in a zip-lock type bag and THANKS to that awesome tip-it made the process much easier. Use a heavy-duty freezer bag, you don&#x27;t want it to rupture when your squishing. Rub it between your hands and really squish the mixture so it&#x27;s really smooth. It really is the best way to mix it...But I took it a step further. I decided to see what would happen if I mixed a lot of it and then refrigerated it so I wouldn&#x27;t have to deal with the process each time. I&#x27;m glad I did! It works great, stays fresh and you have a supply ready to go whenever you like. Each time, you have to squish it up a bit in case some little clumps formed but it&#x27;s very minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**If you&#x27;re like me and have super large pores that would like them to disappear before you leave the house, but don&#x27;t have the time for a full mask routine added to getting yourself ready for the world, then try this: Put a small amount where your pores are the problem, a thin layer is all you need, then use your hair dryer on cool until it dries, wait another 5 minutes then wash off. You get THE EXACT same results in the tightening of your pores as you would with the typical method of letting it sit until it&#x27;s all cracked and ready to wash off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Because the clay is very messy and has a drying effect, I would suggest using a glove to apply, it works best with a tight medical glove. No dealing with getting it out from under your nails or drying your cuticles. &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your smoother, tighter, pore-less skin!a zip-lock type bag and THANKS to that awesome tip-it made the process much easier.

            <li> I like this stuff, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really that great. I have fairly mild acne. I get occasional little pimples and on rare occasions, I&#x27;ll get a cystic pimple (I suppose this wouldn&#x27;t do much to help with those kinds anyway) and I didn&#x27;t really notice this help with my acne very much as I&#x27;ve seen other reviewers say. It&#x27;s also kind of inconvenient to mix up every time. I guess if I liked the product enough, I would feel like this isn&#x27;t too much of a chore, but since I just think it&#x27;s okay, it feels like something I would rather not do. Consequently, much of this stuff is still lying around my bathroom. I did try the plastic baggy trick that another reviewer mentioned, which did make it a little easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems other people like it a lot though. Maybe the product just doesn&#x27;t work that well for me. I don&#x27;t know. I just think it&#x27;s easier to use other face masks that are already mixed into the form ready to apply and also find that other face masks leave my face feeling kind of the same afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say though, that this stuff does get incredibly tight when it&#x27;s almost dry on my face and makes my face red for a little while after I take it off. That&#x27;s what got me thinking that maybe it&#x27;s doing something special. But, as I&#x27;ve said, my mind has yet to be blown by it :/</li>
            <li> I love this stuff...it&#x27;s so versatile...I use it in my hair and on my face...</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my chronic acne. It did make my face feel smoother, but didn&#x27;t not help with my cystic acne or acne scars. It actually made my acne scars worse and standout more.</li>
            <li> deep cleans pores! I use it like once a month and I love how I can feel it working...it pulls everything to the surface...&lt;br /&gt;and you get so much for your money! this will last me forever!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but I am pleasantly satisfied with this product. Cleans amazingly well. Best mask I ever used! I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Love this mask.  I mixed it with vinegar and the mixture was silky smooth and easy to apply.  It made my skin feel heavenly smooth.  Economical and fabulous.</li>
            <li> this takes way too much time and effort to mix to a good consistently. I regret that I didn&#x27;t spend more for a better product. I accidentally ordered two jars.&lt;br /&gt;Toothpaste does a better job of cleaning pores.</li>
            <li> Boy this stuff WORKS!!!!!!  I do not recommend for older skin, but if you do moisturize, moisturize, moisturize!!</li>
            <li> I like this because it pulls oil from my face very well, without drying it too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t do it better and beyond what other products will, but for the price, its excellent.</li>
            <li> I liked it . It cleaned my skin and made it shinny</li>
            <li> I really like this product it does leave your face red only few minutes. You only use once a week my face feels and looks better helps control oil. Packaged good will order more</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for my acne.  Maybe it would work for others, but I have black heads and white heads that are impossible to get rid of.  I was hoping this would dry them out, but no.  :(</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for this stuff but it made my acne worse. I have combo skin and usually mild acne. I kept using the clay because I thought it was drawing out toxins or impurities and bringing them to the surface. I have little white bumps all over now and a few cyst like bumps (both of which unusual for my skin). After continued use my skin never improved. It did make the pores appear smaller initially but it didn&#x27;t last all day. It made my skin slightly dry. Wanted it to work so bad especially because so many ppl sing it&#x27;s praises but ultimately a big jar of powdered crap.</li>
            <li> Makes an incredible face mask when mixed with ACV (don&#x27;t use water, it clumps)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels tight and a little weird when using but worth it! It works wonders for blackheads.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use. I mix it with water and a few drops of tea tree oil. It definitely cleans your pores. Good price.</li>
            <li> Does everything it promises... smooth clean skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would def recommend it to others&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix with Apple Cider Vinegar and apply for about 30 minutes. Face is a little red after, but goes away</li>
            <li> I have used this clay twice on my face.  I mixed it with Ginger Juice.  Makes my face feel great.  I love it.  I was expecting RED clay but this clay is not red.</li>
            <li> I drink this clay every evening before bed it really helps with elimination. this is a good product for cleansing, masks, and baths.</li>
            <li> very good aztec secret indian !! I love it !!! not expensive and my favorite. I advice this indian secret.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this clay for years and I can&#x27;t say enough about what it will do for clogged pores, it is just amazing. Mix it with apple cider vinegar in a plastic bowl (not metal), a little goes a long way, apply it thickly and wait for it to dry completely and when you wash it off you won&#x27;t believe how clean your skin looks and feels!!!</li>
            <li> Great product! It works miracles!</li>
            <li> It is as promised - deep pore cleansing!  It is for all skin types, as well.  I used it and it really drew out impurities.  My pores looked smaller after just one use.  My teenage daughter, who had a terrible breakout on her forehead, also used it.  She loved it because it drew out impurities and seemed to exfoliate.  I would have given it 5 stars except it is very messy, and I was afraid to wash it off in the shower for fear it would clog my pipes. Still...worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this mask. I love how clean my face feels after. I&#x27;ve mixed it with water and apple cider vinegar, I have to say the best mixture is with the vinegar. I found that it is very difficult to mix with water. It remained very lumpy and I couldn&#x27;t get a nice layer on. The clay mixes very easily with the vinegar and I was able to get a nice, thick layer on. As it drys your face does pulsate and it makes your face feel like its getting very tight which I love. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to people who don&#x27;t like that tightening feeling. Overall very satisfied with this product. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> great for t zone and spot treatment for acne, not whole face or neck (it causes redness on thin skin parts).</li>
            <li> Acne scars are beginning to fade and I&#x27;m getting less beak outs. I only mix this with apple cider vinegar (GNC brand) and use it once a week. I leave it on for about 25 mins and your face gets tight as others have mentioned. You also do get a bit of redness around your face, but once you wash the clay off it&#x27;s usually gone after a few minutes. I can&#x27;t believe that for $8 this thing did more to improve my face than what all the other products I have used put together. For here on out this product will be the ONLY one I put on my face and spend my money on.</li>
            <li> One of the best beneficial products I have purchased for a skin care mask!!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. It&#x27;s hard to believe because it&#x27;s so reasonably priced compared to most skin care masks but it&#x27;s amazing. Have only been using a few weeks now and I already see differences in pore size and some stretch marks! If you purchase, try it with apple cider vinegar, in my experience it seems to be more effective with ACV (with Mother) than with water.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use it once a week and I notice the difference immediately after use.</li>
            <li> Very good product to clean out the pores.  I use it for face, neck and upper back.  It feels great!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I broke out two days before a special event. I had a giant pimple right in the middle of my forehead. I couldn&#x27;t pop it cause it was one of the under the skin pimples. But after using this mask, the pimple noticeably reduced in size. Washing it off is a little messy so I would recommend putting it on before a shower. I mixed mine with water, but I&#x27;d like to try mixing it with apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> I can really feel my skin tightening when I use this.  And my face feels really clean after.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mask off and on for years and it is truly one of the best products out there!  You can literally feel your face pulsing (especially if you mix it with apple cider vinegar, but it&#x27;s best to mix half water and half ACV as it doesn&#x27;t tighten up as much as straight ACV does).  I use it weekly as part of my facial routine and my skin always feels amazing after.</li>
            <li> SO. GOOD. I love this. it makes my skin appear so bright and clear after just using it once. Since you only need a little bit, I can see this tub lasting a really long time. Be warned though: It&#x27;s recommended that you use apple cider vinegar to mix with the powder so if you have an aversion to strong smells, this might not be great for you...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 24 and started using this to pull out the blackheads on my nose and cheeks. I have been using blackhead pore strips but nothing would come out on the strip. I realized those suckers were deep in my pores and needed to be lifted to the surface. I used this clay about 3 days in a row and already if i grazed my nose with my finger i could feel the blackheads that got raised up to the surface. I also noticed two small pimples on my chin (i assume it&#x27;s from all the dirt and underlying pimples getting pulled to the surface from the clay).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided i&#x27;d try out a blackhead pore strip and this time the strip was filled with blackheads! I&#x27;ve gotten facials and steamed my face to open pores, but i feel like theres just no way you&#x27;re going to extract all the dirt and gunk in your face without actually pulling it out to the surface and thats what this product does when you use it consistently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this 2 weeks in a row and have decided this is a weekly regimen for me now.  My adult acne has cleared  and my skin is very soft. The first time I used this I noticed how soft my skin was but had a few new breakouts after use. By week 2, my complexion was clear. I had very little redness -gone in 15 minutes.  Use a paper towel/plate in the sink to catch the product upon removal to keep your drain clear.</li>
            <li> great product, helps immensely with my itchy scalp. however since this is an add on item id half to buy another $17 worth of products from amazon  to be able to check out. this being the case ill be taking my business elsewhere.. 5 stars for the clay but 1 for amazon</li>
            <li> This is the best face mask ever! I use Biore pore strips on my nose and they work well, but your pores look sort of gaping afterwards. This thing took everything out and made my pores look normal and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I bought this was because it was a bestseller beauty product. There is a reason it is a bestseller. I don&#x27;t even need to do Oil of Olay microdermabrasion before because it just seems to miraculously fix everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not apply a 1/4 inch to 1/2 inch to face because it will take forever to dry. You really just need to apply it like a regular mask. One teaspoon of this with one teaspoon apple cider vinegar is all you need. The first time I tried it, I used 1.5 teaspoons and slathered it all over my face and it took forever and a day to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be a staple in my closet from now on. I actually think that my pore strips and microdermabrasion products will gather dust and cobwebs since this seems to do everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the pulsating thing happens far into the drying process. The pulsating feeling comes from the skin being pulled taut. If I had to go door to door and sell any product I have bought on Amazon (and I have bought lots!) it would be this one!</li>
            <li> Shipping was great so 5 stars for that. I give it 4 stars because it is messy. I also read in a review to try it with oil not good just crumbles every where. In my opinion its best to just add water and do not mix it just let it sit for a sec and then apply to face. I have fair skin, did not cause any redness or irritation.</li>
            <li> LOVE this clay! I bought it for my consistent acne use and haven&#x27;t been disappointed. I do not use this everyday though-just 1-2 times per week does the trick. I leave it on for about 30 minutes each time. It dries quickly and forms a solid mask. It is sometimes difficult to remove and you have to be careful that the remnants do not go down the sink. I just put a paper towel in the sink to catch the left over mask. I use this with warm water to remove. You will feel your face start to pulse as the clay starts to work. It was alarming at first, but I&#x27;m use to it now. My face is really red for about an hour after use, but it goes away. The ultimate soft feeling that is left behind is ideal. Softest my face has ever felt! I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Really potent stuff! I love how tight and strong it felt. It was like a deep message on your face. Truly a timeless beauty secret!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!  Made such a big difference.  But as the other reviewers have stated it will clog your drain, it makes your face crazy itchy while it&#x27;s drying and it does make your face red.</li>
            <li> Love this mask. I can feel it working and it&#x27;s done alot to help reduce the appearance of my pores.&lt;br /&gt;Also great as an emergency over night spot treatment when I have a break out.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and as advertised</li>
            <li> When used with apple cider vinegar, this product is incredible. Yes, it will make your face red and even burn a bit, but when I wake up the next day, not only has all of the redness from the mask gone away, but the redness from blemishes has been reduced. I see a huuuuge difference in my complexion every time I use the mask. It didn&#x27;t completely cure my acne, but I saw a considerable improvement after using it a couple of times a week for a few weeks. I now have a prescription for acne that has gotten rid of most of it, but if I break out, this is still my go to product.</li>
            <li> Pros: Leaves skin feeling very clean and tight. Can be mixed with vinegar or just water to make the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Can&#x27;t remove in shower or sink because the clay will clog up the drains</li>
            <li> Wow, it is definitely the strongest mask I have ever experienced.  Bought it for my mom and I and did several facials.  Definitely reccomend this product!</li>
            <li> Product works as expected. Very good natural mask!</li>
            <li> A friend of mine who is a holistic health and wellness professional told me about this product when I asked her to recommend a natural mask without too many chemicals. When I found this online I thought it was too cheap to be good, but boy was I WRONG!!!! It is amazing and I use it on a weekly basis. You only need about 4 tblspn mixed with water or apple cider vinegar (I use ACV) and mix it into a thick paste - and then you spread it on your face to the thickness desired. I leave it on thick because I like the feeling of it. As it dries, your face gets pulled really tight and it really does throb/pulsate a little bit. After anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes you wash it off with a warn washcloth. As I learned the hard way, do not let the little dried pieces go down the sink, as it will get clogged. Your face feels really dry afterwards and gets really red, but will wear off after 5 to 10 minutes and then feel really soft. It feels as if after using this for several months, my skin definitely feels detoxed and clean. Also - it lasts forever!! Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a more natural face mask that is not expensive, and detoxifying.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and truly excellent product.  Tightens up on face like nothing else made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And will last forever, one doesn&#x27;t need to use amount stated on label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin but a friend reccomended this to me... it feels awesome, and my skin feels great after using it. I will def continue to buy. I&#x27;ve seen some mud masks try and sell for WAY more than this too that really aren&#x27;t compatable with my skin. This does leave your skin a little red after but that&#x27;s totally normal and goes away after it&#x27;s rinsed off.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne for a very long time.  I have never had cystic acne, but I have always had many black heads and white heads, as well as closed comedones.  As anyone with closed comedones knows, they are very difficult to get rid of.  However, this product works great for all three of my problems.  It does feel very tight and pulsate as it claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed it with equal parts organic apple cider vinegar.  If this is too strong, it may be a good idea to dilute it slightly with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards I was extremely red because I am very pale.  So do not plan a date immediately after because you will look like a tomato on a human body.</li>
            <li> Love it it reminds me of the glam glow mask but a lot cheaper i have three jars that&#x27;s how much I love it</li>
            <li> This stuff if used consistently made my skin clear up, like if I was using it every 2 nights or so, but if I only use it once in a while, it actually makes me break out. Also I hate the smell of vinegar so sitting there with it near my nose for a while kinda sucked but that&#x27;s a persona problem. Makes your skin really soft and definitely clears up pores.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best clay ever.....I use it once a month and it keeps My skin looking clear</li>
            <li> WORLD&#x27;S MOST POWERFUL FACIAL is accurate. It&#x27;s hard to describe the sensation. Take your hands against your cheeks and pull your face back. now times that by 1000. My new favourite mask</li>
            <li> I heard this stuff is magical, and how right that was! It&#x27;s just wonderful, and you get so much!</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time. I love this clay. It&#x27;s great for face mask. My skin looks great after using it. I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I loved this produced</li>
            <li> Read the fine print...and use as directed..cause it works perfectly !!!&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this product !!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! You can make your own recipes, do what you want. I found this clay to be mild, cool, and soothing. I was a little scared from the label that it would be too strong. I think most of that pulsating action happens at the end when the mask is really drying up.&lt;br /&gt;After 20 minutes, my mask was still moist when I cleaned it off. I&#x27;m not really interested in pulsation, just smooth clean skin.</li>
            <li> horrible, don&#x27;t recommend using this product. mixed water and it forms a lump. hard to apply on face. don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Ok I love this stuff. I have very problematic skin and this stuff calms it like magic. The first time around I used water and it was a lumpy mess. The next go around I used raw apple cider vinegar and omg, it was a whole new product. It was smooth and and dried even and was a tighter feel on my skin. After two treatments in a week I had several bumps dry up and my scars were lighter. I couldn&#x27;t believe it myself lol Maybe its a fluke, who knows. I just know my face is clearer in a week and feels overall better. I also use rose water afterwards so maybe it the combo.</li>
            <li> It works well, my skin felt tight and really clean after use. It did turn my face bright red for a while, definitely don&#x27;t use it if you have to go anywhere soon. My only problem is that it&#x27;s extremely messy and a difficult texture. I feel like there are premixed products that work just as well, though maybe not for this price.</li>
            <li> Hmmm I dont know what it is about this product, but it is just not working for me. I gave it about 3 weeks to a month and all I kept seeing was breakouts in the areas I applied it. I was greatly disappointed, mostly because everyone raved about it. When my skin goes back to being less acne-filled, I will give this another go, but on a smaller part of my face - the chin or something.</li>
            <li> Made my pores shrink, smoothed my skin and made me look younger in seconds !</li>
            <li> Makes a good mask when used with water.  Even better when you mix with some apple cider vinegar.  Really gets down into those pores for a deep cleaning.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing! Even my husband noticed how clear my face was the day after my first time using it. My acne is disappearing and I can now confidently go outside without wearing foundation.</li>
            <li> I love the way this cleans and tightens my skin.  After one use everyone was raving about how good my skin looked.</li>
            <li> I love this. I want to love this. It did remove most of my scars but every time I use it, I only leave it on my skin for a while. But it still gives me allergic reactions, so I usually have to take medicines before using it. Overall, I love how this has made my skin look flawless and poreless, but I&#x27;d love it more if it didn&#x27;t give me allergic reactions! So, sensitive skinned girls, this product won&#x27;t be for you if you have problems with &amp;#34;allergy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Works Amazingly! Only thing that really got rid of my daughters acne without the irritation.</li>
            <li> Deep cleansing -- you can feel it!</li>
            <li> Works just as described.</li>
            <li> This product is great, it help stop the little breakouts I would have from time to time. I mix mine with a little apple cider vinegar, I believe this is the best way because it makes it easy to mix and the ASV did assist with the clearing of my skin. I never did have an acne problem so I use the mask twice a week at most. This product does exactly what it says and is a great buy.</li>
            <li> It sucks all the oil off from your skin but I&#x27;m not sure about it healing acne. If you have oily skin it will work okay for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting this skin forever, and it&#x27;s largely in thanks to this product that I have it. People have even commented, and said how glowing and &amp;#34;beautiful&amp;#34; my skin is--before this product, no one ever said anything like that. I&#x27;ve been wearing absolutely no makeup for about a year now, but finally feel confident without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skincare routine: CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser morning and night,  CeraVe Moisturizing Cream morning and night (&amp;#60;3), Neutrogena Clear Face sunscreen morning, and I use this mask once a week (with apple cider vinegar to mix). Before I added this to my routine, I was still getting some regular pimples in my t-zone, and still had some noticeable blackheads. Since adding this two months ago, I have had maybe two pimples that went away quickly, and my blackheads are way, way less noticeable and fewer. Not only that, my skin tone seems to be much more even and nice looking. Added bonus: my face feels awesome for days after I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously magical, I love it.</li>
            <li> Made my skin soft, but didn&#x27;t really see an improvement for my acne</li>
            <li> Takes forever to dry and it makes my face really dry! Cleaning results on the nose is not so ideal</li>
            <li> Very strong pulling sensation. May dry out skin, use in moderation- About twice a week.</li>
            <li> I tried this product several times and it made my skin break out terribly!!!  And not a detoxing break out from the product extracting the garbage from my skin, but a clogged pore break out that was heavily exacerbated by this dreadful product.  I&#x27;m 31, so I have adult acne, and very sensitive skin.  Perhaps it works for teens, but not for me.  I would never recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Works great! It really pulsates your skin as it says but its not a terrible feeling to me. Its easy to remove. And it leaves my skin feeling firmer, soft and refreshed. I didn&#x27;t experience any redness that didn&#x27;t go away, itching, break outs or dryness. This a an awesome mask. And it works great mixed with Bragg&#x27;s apple cider.</li>
            <li> I used it on my hair and it made my natural curls pop! Last night I used it as a facial. My skin appeared less oily and actually felt as though it had been detoxed. I love this clay!</li>
            <li> so far nice product.  I need to use more frequently to leave a decent review but kinda tricky when mixing it since comes in a powder form.  I really like how little ingredients are in it.  Face feels nice and clean and pores do seem cleaner and nice and  tight afterward</li>
            <li> BUY THIS!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combo skin and I get the ocassional pimple. The problem are was my cheeks. Hated my pore size &amp; the constant black heads. So after reading the reviews I thought I&#x27;d try the clay.  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this twice a week (Wed &amp; Sun). I mix with ACV which I highly suggest. ACV is a natural astringent &amp; toner. A little clay goes a loooong way. Application is easy as well as clean up. I am able to keep on for 15mins I feel the pulsing which just means the mask is tightening as it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do experience redness afterward which goes away after about 15mins. My face is clean with reduced pore size. I love this and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! Right afer I use it my pores look smaller.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does itch like heck as it&#x27;s drying and I just want to jump around and yell, but it leaves my face really smooth when I wash it off. Washing it off is kind of a pain though. I have to basically scrape it off. I can also never get it to mix without chunks. Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong. PLEASE read the instructions before use because it does state to NOT use metal utensils for mixing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problematic skin since forever- oily skin, serious blackheads, really stubborn acne of all sorts, scarring etc. When I was younger I tried wearing make up and different acne medications (both drugstore and doctor prescribed) nothing worked OR it just made my skin worse. For years I did nothing to my face and had to deal with whatever my skin decided to look like that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This winter break my skin decided to go all out - I became fed up and was not about to go back to school with my face full of acne and blackheads. I tried Queen Helen&#x27;s Mint Julep but found it only works for BIG zits and if I put it all over my face it&#x27;ll cause more breakouts. I&#x27;ve also tried Freemans Cucumber Peel but it&#x27;s way too sticky, messy, and I find the it only takes off what&#x27;s on the surface- not whats in your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing A LOT of research I found this product. Here&#x27;s my view:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a powder that you have to mix with either RAW Apple Cider or Water (I&#x27;ve heard you can also use Cranberry juice if you have SUPER oily skin but I haven&#x27;t tried it). I personally like that it&#x27;s a powder because it&#x27;ll last a lot longer- I can just mix the right amount I need just for that moment. However, the process can be prettymessy. The instructions say not to use metal tools because it&#x27;ll react with the clay. I used some plastic measuring tools from the dollar store and plastic mini disposable cups from walgreens (unless you want to be washing out bowls extensively I suggest using disposables).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I poured in an equal part of Raw Cider and the clay began to fizz - it freaked me out a little but I continued to mix and it went away. I applied it to my face as instructed and waited. At first I didn&#x27;t feel &#x27;pulsating&#x27; but it definitely was sucking my skin to the point where my eyes and lips looked bigger. You do not want to peel this off- use a face towel with warm water. The first time my face had some redness- which is normal after a few minutes it went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really shocked at how clean and light my skin felt. Even though I don&#x27;t wearing makeup it felt like I was wearing heavy foundation or something before. I literally couldn&#x27;t feel any icky-ness or heaviness on my face whatsoever and my pore were substantially smaller. I did it another two times- my black heads were almost completely gone and my acne was begin its healing process already! The bad part is that it left the rest of my skin really dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited until the next day to use it again and found that I had smaller breakouts beginning to emerge and blackheads emerging as well. I did a &#x27;steam&#x27; on my face to open my pore and only placed this clay on my acne areas and blackheads. After putting it on my blackheads a second time my nose was COMPLETELY clear- it was shocking. At this point I do feel pulsing when I put the clay on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE AWARE that this only cleans out your face ( I mean REALLY cleans it out) it does not PROTECT your face from impurities getting back into your skin. So you have to find a lotion or moisturizer that&#x27;ll keep all that bad stuff out. I used Neutrogena Acne Lotion which is okay for a day or so- I may switch to another. Your skin will be really dry afterwards so make sure you have a moisturizer at hand even if you have oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest you use this once or twice a week on your whole face and then however often you need it just on those problem areas. I wouldn&#x27;t say use this at night before you go to bed because it won&#x27;t do any good- a cleanser works much better for before-bed routines. This is more of a morning or emergency treatment thing when you need immediate or drastic results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for acne scarring it really doesn&#x27;t do much, in fact it may actually make them more apparent so a scar treatment or good exfoliator is a good idea also if you have issues with that.t away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really shocked at how clean and light my skin felt.

            <li> THis product is fantastic. I use it with the apple cider vinegar and it is amazing how well it cleans my face. I have really oily skin and I use this once a week to deep clean. Just try it and you will notice the benefits right away.</li>
            <li> This is a great clay mask that works really well. The best time to use it is right after a shower, when your pores are steamed open. Mix it up with apple cider vinegar (it says you can also use water, but it&#x27;s a waste of the product to use it - doesn&#x27;t mix properly/react with the dry clay) and slather it on your face (or anywhere else I suppose). The sensation of the clay &amp; apple cider vinegar is weird - pulsating, sucking sensations and it dries very stiff. Use a washcloth to get it off when it&#x27;s dry as it&#x27;s harder to take off than a normal clay mask. Your face will be a bit red-looking for ~15 minutes after, but it calms down. Really clears the pores, and is fun!</li>
            <li> Read all the reviews and was so excited to try this on my skin which has been breaking out lately. Used it 3 times in the first week. 2 times the second week. Skin feels nice after I did the mask, and the pores on my nose do look smaller. I saw no difference in my pimples. For the price its a great mask, but do not expect this product to work miracles.</li>
            <li> Wow, my face is other since i use the Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay Deep Pore Cleansing....The only thing is the apple cyder vinager, the face turns red for an half of hour and feels burns but after this, worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the best face mask ever. I have oily skin prone to acne and it works on my skin. My sister was using it and she told me about it, so I tried, and I am not buying any other face mask but this one.&lt;br /&gt;Its cleans my skin perfectly. I am leaving it on my face for 15min max, because then it starts itching. When I remove it, my face is like a baby&#x27;s face, but is still red for about 10-15min, so I am using it only evening, before I go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;This is a miracle mask, love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I recommend using this product with the apple cider vinegar and not mixing it with water. I tried mixing it with water and it came out very clumpy even after mixing and mashing thoroughly. The fizzing action of the apple cider vinegar helps the powder to dissolve fully. Using the recommended portion on the instructions makes waaay  too much if you intend on using it as a face mask only. I usually use 1 tablespoon of the clay mix, and 2 tablespoons of the apple cider vinegar, and there is still leftovers. It does smell pretty awful when mixed with the vinegar, but gets better as it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other reviewers about the burning sensation. It feels like I am having an allergic reaction of some type, to describe the burning sensation. It&#x27;s not extremely intense but manageable. It goes away after taking it off. The best way to describe the \\&quot;pulsating\\&quot; is like your pores are suffocated of oxygen and you can feel a \\&quot;heart beat\\&quot; pulse over your entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has made my pores smaller, and my acne more manageable, but it hasn&#x27;t completely solved that issue. I only use it a couple times a week though, because it is very drying and can cause irritation, which is why I took off one star.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy it because of the review do the research first,  there are many company who pays people to write the product good review don&#x27;t fall for it</li>
            <li> I am a firm believer in the healing power of healing clay (bentonite clay).  I use this particular brand to give to my dog, along with topical usage (skin issues, baths, etc.).  It is a good product and is sold at a good price.</li>
            <li> Aztec the best brand for pure, reasonable priced, calcium betonite clay..A way to detox and a great first aid item(beauty and medical); this may be dirt, but dirt worth every penny. I noticed it is perfect for shrinking pores and just really drawing out impurities in the skin(even boils and stings), like other reviewers have mentioned(rather creatively(-:).  I am happy to have found this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  I use it three times a week on my face, hands and my arthritic knees.  My skin is smoother,  softer and stays moist.  I use it on my knees at night and it helps ease the painful inflammation.  I recommend this wonderful product for true results!</li>
            <li> This is the best mud mask I have ever used!  I mixed it with organic apple cider vinegar.  It made my skin glow.  I also like that you can mix as much or as little as you need.  BLOWS Mint julep mask away!!!  Left my face noticeably softer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one to do facials since my skin is so sensitive, but I wanted a product that would give me the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This definitely lived up to the hype! It was a little messy to mix together, but once it was applied to my face, it felt good &amp; dried quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I rinsed it off, my face was much more tight, closed pores, and felt fresher!</li>
            <li> This mask is very very powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has helped my skin so much. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just hate the fact it is all powdery, it gets a bit messy and annoying to put on.</li>
            <li> Finally got to use this and my oh my was i surprised at the way it made my skin feel and look.&lt;br /&gt;Its leaves your skin looking very healthy and extremely fresh too will be using this a lot more from now on.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it for people with large pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years on my face, neck &amp; hands &amp; I&#x27;ve always loved the results.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but I figured for the low price it was worth a try. I LOVE this mask. I use it once a week with the apple cider vinegar, and it&#x27;s made my skin softer, pores smaller, and kept away breakouts. I did get a bit of skin redness immediately after use, but it goes away in a few minutes after I toned and lightly moisturized.</li>
            <li> Well to start off I am a 24 year old female... I&#x27;ve had acne on my face since my middle school years. I&#x27;ve tried everything from proactive to prescribed lotion to prescribed antibiotics to lasers to well like I said anything... you name it I&#x27;ve done it. At one point I time I&#x27;ve even spent close to 3000 combined on my face by doing the treatments of photodynamic therapy. My acne is anywhere from white heads to those annoying under the skin pimples... Yes, very annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only time I ever had clear skin was when i was pregnant... So I know I have hormonal acne but even the dr can not control it. I was getting desperate for a remedy that could work on me so There I am on Pinterest trying to find something that could work on my horrid face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across the clay n immediately googled it then went on amazon to see if it had any reviews n yup, sure did. I read about ten before I was convinced n went ahead and bought it shortly after realizing WholeFoods sales it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day I went to the store and bought it n there I go trying it on me. I have been using it everyday. Sometimes if I feel my face needs it ill use it as night until the clay dries up completely even after the 20 minutes they tell you to leave it for. You feel your whole face pulsate n it&#x27;s an awesome feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about 2 weeks since I&#x27;ve used it and WOW. My acne has dried up completely. The pimples I do have now are only bc I got my menstrual cycle but they are very small. The redness on my face and the bulging pimples are no longer there. If I put on make up after a good cleanse with the clay my face looks almost flawless and all bc of this 10 dollar miracle. I do however recommend buying the dessert essence jojoba oil to put on afterwards bc your face will get dry and also open up your pores by steaming your face with very hot towels then applying the mask so it really works. That&#x27;s what I did the second week I&#x27;ve used it and I saw way more improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t pass this up. This is coming for a girl who would cry sometimes bc I thought I would never have clear skin ever. I&#x27;m not saying it is clear now but for the two weeks that I&#x27;ve been using it my face has improved drastically and I can just imagine how it will look like in 2 months ;)rovement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t pass this up.

I&#x27;m not saying it is clear now but for the two weeks that I&#x27;ve been using it my face has improved drastically and I can just imagine how it will look like in 2 months ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 weeks now. I use it 3-4 times a week &amp; my blackheads are continuing to decrease and my pores are becoming smaller. I usually wash my face before, put it on for 10-15 mins &amp; then use a toner after I wash it off. Highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li> This mask cleans my pores and refreshes my face. I prefer to use it with apple cider vinegar. My face feels so soft and clean after using. I will say this is easier to clean off in the shower as it can get a bit messy for the sink. I also have acne prone skin and this mask does not irritate or cause my skin to break out. This size tub is lasting me for ever, it&#x27;s worth every penny and I will be repurchasing in the future.</li>
            <li> Product is easy to mix, makes skin feel soft. It will shrink your pores permanently if you use it consistently.  I put it on some bug bites and the cool temperature of my Apple Cider Vinegar made them stop itching instantly!!!  This can prevent scaring from itching bug bites too much which is a quality thing to have in a medicine cabinet too!&lt;br /&gt;I research and read a lot about skin care. . . I mostly use Paula&#x27;s Choice products and try to practice good skin care rules (like Np smoking, No tanning beds, No picking at skin, No sleeping in makeup, No abrasive scrubs, No alcohol on my skin, using daily sunscreen etc.)&lt;br /&gt;That being said I still find use for a good clay mask. I am 34, female and lately I have been noticing larger pores around my nose which I hate.&lt;br /&gt;I watch a lot of dermatologist video blogger (Veronica Gorgeois) who recommends using a clay mask that is 100% natural calcium bentonite clay, like this product.  You can mix it with a toner or apple cider vinegar.  (I use raw, organic ACV.)&lt;br /&gt;She recommends to not let it dry to an uncomfortable level where it irritates your skin too much; skin is sensitive so you shouldn&#x27;t be roughly scrubbing your face to remove the mask.  Just like you shouldn&#x27;t be using abrasive scrubs on your face either!&lt;br /&gt;The key to healthy skin is consistency in your regime.  Watch this video where she talks about clay masks, I love her (but I don&#x27;t work for her or benefit from promoting her!) or Youtube &amp;#34;Veronica Gorgeois&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Fs75J0v-RwA</li>
            <li> Best mask ever.  Leaves my skin smooth and glowing.  I love that you can use vinegar to mix in if your skin is oily, or water if it&#x27;s dry.  I can feel it working hard without the usual chemicals and fragrances that can easily irritate or burn my skin.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to buy this, but wow! This is amazing and i do it once a week. My mom also uses it and people have started to noticing out skin ! It could get a little dry but wow! Must have ! I have it for a couple months now because you don&#x27;t need a lot! You can definitely feel the pulse on your face! Amazing stuff</li>
            <li> This stuff works incredibly well. I was very broken out and after using it twice a week for two weeks my breakouts are almost gone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. I use apple cider vinegar with it.  It smells bad but it works wonders.  I do it every few days before bed and then put on a moisturizer. It takes about 30 minutes to dry and then I rinse off in the shower. Face is red after but goes away shortly after. Who knew putting some clay on your face would be so helpful? Also I&#x27;m a straight  guy  and there is nothing wrong with caring for your face.</li>
            <li> Best facial ever!! I noticed a difference after one use! You can feel your face tighten! Worth  it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I did this with 50/50 vinegar and water, and I cannot remember the last time that I had skin this incredibly soft.  Probably since I was like 8-9 years old!  I will definitely be doing this every week from now on.</li>
            <li> works great ,but take it off outside,lol</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff. Really gets out impurities</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! This should be in everybody&#x27;s medicine cabinet! Every time I feel like my skin is getting nasty, or starting to break out more than I control, I mix some of this with some ACV and water, leave it on for 5-10 like it says on the back, and in the next few days my skin goes back to it&#x27;s normal, healthy, glowing self. How I lived so long without it, I&#x27;ll never know!</li>
            <li> I did not find any difference after using it</li>
            <li> Fantastic mask it cleared my breakouts.</li>
            <li> I like it… My skin feels really smooth and soft after using.</li>
            <li> Wow....just....WOW! Mixed 21/2 teaspoons of clay powder with 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar in a plastic bowl (don&#x27;t use metal with this product - it deactivates the clay and renders it useless); stirred it up with a chopstick and applied it to my face with a paintbrush. Wow! My face was pulsating and I could feel it pulling out the impurities. I waited 25 minutes and rinsed it off with warm water. My face looked sunburned  - which is completely normal - I waited 10 minutes and moisturized with organic coconut oil. My skin has never looked better. Buy it!!</li>
            <li> The mask arrived on time as promised. The tub is pretty large so I am pleased with the amount. I mixed the mud in a glass bowl with water and apple cider vinegar as directed with a plastic stirrer. I made way too much, and I only used three capfuls (cap from the vinegar bottle) of water and cider. It made enough mask for me, my daughter, and my reluctant teenage son... and I still had some left. So this is going to go a long way! When you add the mud to the water/vinegar mix it fizzes a bit, but that goes away as you stir. We applied the mask with our fingers and let it stay on 15 minutes. My face tingled and got really tight. Really tight!. I used a warm water wash cloth to rinse off the mask, and it came off easily. Our faces were a bit pink for a little while after, but the result was great! My skin was so soft. My pores were smaller and my skin glowed. This was my first ever mask like this, so I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but I was thrilled. I am definitely glad I bought this and plan on using it once a week.</li>
            <li> I agree with all the positive review of this clay.  It does wonders to your skin!  Have not experienced anything negative after a month of using the product.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this. Great face mask. Great product.</li>
            <li> Really loved it. I hate facial masks. cuz my skin is super sensitive but i heard many times about this mask, so i decided to buy it. And thank god its amazing i didnt regret!!! . But u really need to follow the instruction cuz theres many problems happened for (ppl who left it long time/ used it many times per week) Just follow the direction and u will be super happy with the result :P</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this mask, or whatever you want to call it. As someone who struggles with oily combination skin, I felt like this mask was too astringent and drying, which is weird because my skin produces so much sebum. After washing the mask off, my face always got dry and patchy even after putting moisturizer on. Maybe it just wasn&#x27;t the product for my skin, which is actually kinda delicate. I&#x27;d suggest something gentler if you have sensitive skin, or even normal skin, because it just seemed too harsh. Don&#x27;t ever use this during winter months, especially if you live up north. After applying it, when it was drying on my skin, I felt itchy. After a few days I started to break out. I was so disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;However, do try it if you know your skin isn&#x27;t sensitive, and even if you hate it, you only spent 10 dollars at most :)</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders! I don&#x27;t leave on for more than the time it says. Tightens as it drys and cleans out all my pores. Leaves skin soft and smooth. Use a moisturizer right after use, because it does draw everything out of pores. You only have to use a small amount. I see this jar lasting me a very long time!! Great price! Love it!</li>
            <li> Oh My God. I did not expect the sudden and very noticable results. I mixed it up with apple cider vinegar just like the directions said, and left it on for a good 20 minutes. I honestly didnt think it would be so effective since I have used every treatment under the sun and my skin is very tough because of it I believe. But once I washed it all off, my pores were completely clear. Something that hasnt happened since I was 10. My blackheads were gone and my face was smooth and beautiful, both my sister and my boyfriend noticed the difference immediately. This stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> As a woman in her 30s who recently developed troublesome skin, this stuff is a lifesaver!  I love it!  As other reviewers have mentioned, I do think that using the ACV is best rather than water.  ACV alone has many benefits for the skin.  It does tighten up rather intensely, you can feel the pulsating in your face (at least I can!), and it can get itchy.  I do a mask once a week for about 20 minutes.  My skin is very oily, especially in the summer, and this stuff does a great job of balancing my skin out and clearing up acne fast.  Also, this is a HUGE tub for such a great price!  I use a 1:1 ratio of the clay to ACV, only about 1 tablespoon of each per mask, so this stuff will last me a very long time!  Would definitely recommend - old or young (well, teenager at least), male or female.  It&#x27;s great stuff!</li>
            <li> I love mud masks, but this just didn&#x27;t seem worth it to me. It&#x27;s a pain to always have to mix up a new batch every time, and most of the time I can&#x27;t get all the clumps out so it goes on weird. Also, I don&#x27;t see it doing any &amp;#34;deep pore cleansing&amp;#34;. Not worth it... :(</li>
            <li> I bought this item a few months back and have waited to write a review. I wanted to get a real sense of how well this works before writing a review: the wait was well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have struggled with body acne (mostly my back) since my teen years. This has hindered me from wearing swim suits, backless dresses, cute tank tops, etc. It has limited my clothing choices and has made me insecure when it comes to exposing my back (which is a shame, as I am in great shape and it would be a good asset otherwise).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I am happy to report that the healing clay has FINALLY cleared my back! I&#x27;ve recently purchased super adorable backless shirts and tanks as a celebratory notion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acne is GONE and my large pores have shrunk. Yep. This stuff is cheap, easy to use and it, most importantly, ACTUALLY WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the body washes for acne. I&#x27;ve eliminated heavy conditioners in my shower routine. I&#x27;ve tried rewashing my back after shampooing and conditioning. Nothing has worked...except for *this* product..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply buy apple cider vinegar (I use Bragg&#x27;s) and mix equal parts healing clay in a plastic cup or other plastic device of your choice. I don&#x27;t over complicate this: I simply use my hands to apply the mixture. Your palms might feel slightly taut afterward, but that&#x27;s about it. I see no need in spending any extra money on application devices, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll actually *feel* this product working. It&#x27;ll tingle, evoke a cooling sensation and get tighter as it dries on the skin. I leave it on for about 15 minutes per application. Once dried, I simply use a washcloth and warm water to scrub it off with. It is THAT simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this a few times a week. Like anything else, it is a balancing act. You just have to find out what your particular skin type needs. If you&#x27;re oilier (and the back tends to get very oily--hence the acne problem...), then you&#x27;ll need this more. I image that this product is rougher on the face than on the body; I&#x27;ve yet to try it on my facial skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: Your skin will be red after using this item. You might even experience redness that is literally similar to a sunburn or a rash. This can be alarming at first, but rest assured that the redness *will* subside in 15-30 minutes time. The first time this happened to me I did freak out a bit! I just feel that potential buyers should know about this. I&#x27;m presuming that it is due to the pulling of the clay as it dries...and/or the vinegar. I don&#x27;t think it is a harmful effect as much as a minor annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;Buy this now if you&#x27;ve experience body breakouts. I can nearly promise that you&#x27;ll be happy with the results.the face than on the body; I&#x27;ve yet to try it on my facial skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: Your skin will be red after using this item.

The first time this happened to me I did freak out a bit! I just feel that potential buyers should know about this. I&#x27;m presuming that it is due to the pulling of the clay as it dries...and/or the vinegar. I don&#x27;t think it is a harmful effect as much as a minor annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;Buy this now if you&#x27;ve experience body breakouts. I can nearly promise that you&#x27;ll be happy with the results.</li>
            <li> A pulsing face I have experienced for the first time by preparing 1 teaspoon clay with 2 teaspoon organic apple cider.</li>
            <li> I was amazed by the price and previous reviews but this is actually legit- I use it monthly now when I need a pick-me-up! It never pulsated the first few times but did last time and was kinda cool! can&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
            <li> Ive only been using it for two weeks, one day on and one day off.  First time i used it, i mixed it with the suggested viniger.  Yes it does pulsate when it starts drying.  It feels like your getting a massage.  Makes you want to fall asleep.  When it starts to dry, you can feel your skin tightening, its awesome!!! It doesn&#x27;t itch to me as others claimed it did.  I leave it on for 20mins.  I wet my face and whipe it off with wet paper towels, and then wash my face.  It pulls all the gunk out of your pores, dries up all your pimples, and then fades your acne scars.  I use this on my face and neck.  This product does not minimize your pores though.  I highly recommend it.  I have an oily face, and after using this it has minimized the oil, and leaves my skin very vibrant and soft.  Make-up is easier to apply and makes my face look fresh and renewed.</li>
            <li> I recently bought Aztec Indian clay mask. It was very good especially for those who have oily skin. Try it. You will never regret that. Trust me.</li>
            <li> OMG THIS STUFF IS AWESOME. You can literally feel your face pulsate. It states it on the bottle but you will never know the true feeling  until you try it. I started doing it everyday but then only every few days. You can literally see and feel results within the first couple uses.  I had black heads on my nose and even after the first use it pulled all the dirt and grime out.  It even is starting to make my pores on my cheeks smaller.  It took a few times for me to kinda get the right texture for the clay because i was afraid of using too much water. But more water was actually good. I read that it was better to use apple cider vinegar but i just use water. A lot goes a LOOONG way. BUY IT NOW (;</li>
            <li> My skin is constantly breaking out with acne. I used this product last week and my face has been clear. I can’t wait to incorporate this product into my weekly beauty regime. So far I love this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, honestly nothing special though. It&#x27;s not a waste to try.</li>
            <li> Me and my Mother used it today and it works, afterwards our skin was soft and tighter. Recommend  to any and everybody!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used anything like it, it&#x27;s very strong. In the past I used the Queen Helen mint julep mask, but this stuff tightens x10. I use it mostly in the summer as a facial mask mixed with the apple cider vinegar when I think that my pores need some tightening after all the heat they endured. I use it maybe once or twice a week depending on the weather and my oil production. I have combination skin so it can be drying on the cheeks. After some tries, I figured out that it&#x27;s best to put on a THIN layer rather than a thick layer because the mask will take too long to dry. If you make a thick layer it&#x27;ll start drying out fast at the edges first, which results in pulling on the skin on the edges. Since my goal is to tighten my pores evenly (especially the face center, or nose area) I make sure that I put on a pretty thin layer. I think it also helps with blood circulation to the face. Oh, and it&#x27;s quite fun to see how my face changes (esp eyes and lips) as this dries hahaha</li>
            <li> This is amazing clay.  I used it for a bath - which was kinda messy.  But I think that is to be expected since it is clay!  It felt great.  I also have used it as a mask - face all the way down to my collar bone.  It is a fantastic mask!  Love it and would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I developed some millia (those hard white bumps) on my face. I was thinking about going to a spa to have a facial to have them professionally removed. I didn&#x27;t have the time or money to do that so a Google search led me to this product on Amazon.  After one treatment, my milia disappeared. YEAH!  After a few treatments I noticed the pores on my nose getting smaller. One caveat is not to leave it on too long. I lost track of time while working on my computer and when I took it off, my face felt like it was badly sunburned.  I put Aloe Vera juice on it and within 45 minutes the heat and redness were gone.  Aside from that one incident, I haven&#x27;t had any bad reactions to the clay. I mix it in a Corelle bowl with my fingertips and apply it also with my fingertips. I make sure that I use lots of water to rinse out the bowl and to rinse my face when finished. It is after all clay that could clog the pipes if it&#x27;s not diluted well with water.</li>
            <li> Serious cleanser! This has been one of the best facial healing cleansers ever made. I would strongly suggest this product for those who want to remain naturally young looking.</li>
            <li> I heard about this from a holistic health practitioner. I am always nervous about putting new products on my face because I have sensitive skin. However, I took the plunge since it is natural. It does a great job although it will leave your face a bit red for about 30 minutes after you wash it off. Using it once a week works great for me.</li>
            <li> Just got this, used it once and yes I did feel my skin pulsate!  After one use, my pores appeared smaller and left my skin soft, not dry feeling.  I mixed it with water, I think I will try organic vinegar as recommended.</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin so this is a bit harsh for me but not too much to stop me from using it. I always remove it within 10 minutes - just 5 isn&#x27;t enough time for it to try much but anymore would leave me very red. I am sometimes a little red the next day but nothing terrible. I use this only when I feel like I&#x27;m breaking out more than usual and it does always seem to get the problem under control. It really pulls all impurities to the surface of your skin and allows for a very deep clean. My only real complaint is how hard it is to take off! It&#x27;s a bit stubborn and also clogged my sink drain once because it&#x27;s so thick so I collect most of the clay to throw out now, which can be a little annoying.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions to skin perfection!!! I also love the seller, the mask got here so stinking fast and .... oh I could go on but I won&#x27;t bore you. Great for acne and oily skin. I use this every morning while I fix my husbands breakfast and my coffee and the results are amazing!!!!&lt;br /&gt;  Happy shopping! X</li>
            <li> Awesome!  Cleared up my skin and made it feel tighter:). I&#x27;m addicted!  Love it!  I highly recommend this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> my 14 old son has been using this 1 time a week since we bought it and his pimples seem less..he mixes and apply it to himself and showers it off..</li>
            <li> First of all I have been using this product for about two years so this review is long over due. This is a phenomenal product. It feels like a suction cup once applied to the skin after mixing it with apple cider vinegar. All I can say is I can attribute my now clear skin to the continued use of this product. It cleans out your pores where bacteria builds up which causes acne. Give this product a try. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin because I have Seborrheic dermatitis and have not found a product to clean my face without major irritation.  So, I used this clay on my face and was expecting it to turn red BUT IT DIDNT&#x27;T.  It actually soothed and healed my face. Truly amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I was very impressed by the review I read online.  However, I&#x27;ve only used this product twice and it has made my acne worst.  Not only that, I&#x27;ve also developed more acne.  Think carefully before using this product as it my not work for you.  It certainly did not work for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try ultraceutical products.  My acne have not disappeared but it has lessen my acne.</li>
            <li> really useful and make my face clean and tight. good product love it. and also good for men.  my friend love it</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It is like a mini face lift! After using this I told 3 of my friends and they all felt the same way! It has cleared up my skin, made my pores smaller and took care of a little patch of eczema I was having. You can really feel your face pulling, which is a weird feeling at first but it goes away after awhile.&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you are doing this with a friend you will not be able to talk while doing the face mask, it really tightens up your pores and makes it hard to move your face. It is all worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do use the organic apple cider vinegar, it stinks a little when you put it on but you get used to the smell after awhile and it is worth it. I also suggest doing the mask for a full 30 minutes to get the true effects of it.I call this stuff my magic face fixer, so worth the money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mask four times now, using it every other day. It really does help draw \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; (ie. black heads) to the surface for easier cleansing. I am in the midst of a pretty bad breakout, and though I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s done much for the existing acne, I think it may be preventing the breakout from going any further, since it&#x27;s purging my pores each time. It may be slowly helping and I&#x27;m just not being patient enough.  What I can say is this... my face (where not broken out) feels absolutely amazing after using this mask. It&#x27;s smooth and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not find this product hard to use OR hard to clean up. I mixed it w/ the Bragg&#x27;s Apple Cider Vinegar and would recommend that you do it this way, since the vinegar alone has been known to help clear acne (if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for... I have began putting the vinegar alone on my face at night; we&#x27;ll see how that goes). I put on a semi-thick (1/4\\&quot;?) layer and let dry for 30 minutes. At the end of the 30 minutes, you are ready to have the stuff off of your face, but it&#x27;s not extremely uncomfortable, either. I can see where people get the &#x27;black hole&#x27; thing, but it&#x27;s honestly NOT that bad.  It&#x27;s different; that&#x27;s all.  Just a different sensation than what you&#x27;re used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I remove the mask is by wetting a wash cloth with very warm water, and gently pressing it against a large area of skin for a few seconds. Then I gently rub, rinse the cloth, and repeat until it&#x27;s gone. It takes less than 5 minutes. I have not had issues w/ it staining towels or anything. You get a LOT for your money. I&#x27;ve been using 1 tsp mask &amp; 2 tsp vinegar per mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a pretty great product. I would recommend it as a \\&quot;maintenance\\&quot; skin care product, because I really do think it does what it says regarding removing gunk from your pores.</li>
            <li> Great mask.  Closest thing I have found to the pre-mixed Mudd masks I used to buy.  Makes a very smooth mix that is easy to apply evenly.  Made my face very red (the package said this could happen) but it went down in a few hours.  Would recommend doing this at night for this reason.  Great value.  Will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> this stuff is greater then great you actually feel it pulling at your face you can&#x27;t even open your mouth or move your face around I mix this with bragg&#x27;s Apple cider vinegar and bam your face looks gorgeous</li>
            <li> My son uses it along with Apple Cider Vinegar (Organic) to make into paste and put it on the face.&lt;br /&gt;I really help him with facial cleansing and remove acne.</li>
            <li> I saw this product on acne.org because I was looking for a clay mask like the one Oil of Olay used to make. And this was the first product to come up. So I went to the location Vitamin Shoppe and purchased it, it was $7.49. I used it offically 20 minutes ago. I tested it on a small area of my face before I used it and it&#x27;s entirety. In that ONE area I felt it. It literally does pulse, it almost feels like a kick. So after dinner I put the mask on my WHOLE face, and wow, it does hurt, but its more of a good hurt, and it does stink. After 20 minutes you can&#x27;t talk because it is soooo tight. I just took it off, and my face is soo soft. My problem area is my chin, and the zits there are all dried up now, it literally sucked it ozze out of my pimple on my chin. My face glows, and it looks soft, too. So bottom line, do buy this. it&#x27;s SOOO cheap, and the container is HUGE, I know this will last a while.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this clay, and i have to say I am 100% satisfied. I mixed it with bragg&#x27;s applecider vinegar and about a 1/2 table spoon of olive oil, it took me about 15min to apply and I left on an additional 10min after that and after entire process of rinsing it out my hair, my curls where so soft and defined!</li>
            <li> Honestly this makes me break out in little pimples all over my forehead. They do clear up soon but it is still aggravating.</li>
            <li> Great clay! Easy to mix, doesn&#x27;t clump if you start it off correctly and with the right amount. It will last a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a couple times but it doesn&#x27;t seem to make as drastic of a difference as I read in some of the reviews. I also don&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;pulsating/tingling&amp;#34; feeling some people say that got. It just really really really itches if you leave it on too long. But my face does feel really smooth after I take it off!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a plethora of facial cleansers, from proactive and over-the-counter remedies, to prescription creams and pills. NOTHING has worked as well as this clay. Maybe it&#x27;s just the perfect solution for my particular type of skin but it cleared my problem areas of acne and blemishes within just a couple uses. Within two days of the first use I noticed my skin clearing up. I use it in conjunction with an organic moisturizer because otherwise my skin would be extremely dried out after using it. There&#x27;s a link below to the moisturizer, it seems to be the perfect compliment to this clay. Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G0EJYFW/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
            <li> I have recently been trying to find a more natural and organic skin care routine. I have combination skin that can be a bit sensitive. I also have an uneven skin tone.For awhile now I have been using this routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr Woods Black Soap with shea butter as a facial cleanser and body wash&lt;br /&gt;Witch Hazel for a facial toner&lt;br /&gt;Burts Bees Radiance Day Cream as a daytime moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip Oil for a night time moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use an Aztec Clay Mask once a week for a deep clean.&lt;br /&gt;Coconut Oil for an overall body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;And I use a Konjac Sponge for a more natural version of a loofah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so far really loving this routine. And to be perfectly honest, the only reason I am using a separate moisturizer for daytime and nighttime is I already owned he Burts Bees Day Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Black Soap is a castile soap. I find it makes my skin very clean and surprisingly soft. The smell is okay. It smells like...well, soap. It does not smell like you are in a field of flowers or surrounded by mangoes like most beauty products do, but I am okay with that. I do not find the smell bad at all, just different then what I am used to from more normal products. It can also be used to wash your hair, but I have yet to try that. I have however tried it as a cleaner while doing the dishes and I found it worked well as a household cleaner as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love witch hazel. It is a great toner. It feels refreshing and exactly like any other toner I have ever used. But it is better as I feel a sense of joy everytime I use it as I know I am not putting any weird harsh chemicals on my skin when using it. If you don’t use toners, I highly recommend it. There are plenty of websites out there that show all the benefits of using a toner between a cleanser and a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Burts Bees Day Cream. I love the smell, it is in a cute little bottle, and my skin feels ready to tackle the day after using it. I am a big fan of most of the Burts Bees products so it makes sense that I like this too. I will however attempt to just use rosehip oil as a moisturizer once this cream is gone, simply because it would be more simplistic to just have 1 and it will save me some money. If that doesn’t work, I will gladly reorder this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip Oil is my new love when it comes to beauty products. It has recently gained popularity when model Miranda Kerr admitted to using it nightly on her skin. The smell isn’t good or bad. Meaning that it doesn’t smell wonderful like a perfume, but the smell isn’t bad and take away from the awesomeness of this product. If you don’t like the smell of it, don’t worry. It absorbs very quickly into your skin and the smell goes away once it does. It makes my skin so SMOOTH! And as I said, it absorbs very quickly which I love. I only use around 2-3 drops a night to cover my whole face. SO it will last quite awhile. I also love all the benefits it has. Again, there are plenty of websites out there that preach the amazing reasons to use this essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure by now we all know the lovely product that is coconut oil. It makes a fantastic lotion. My skin has never been more smooth in my life. The only downside in my opinion is it does not absorb quite as fast into my skin as the rosehip oil does. So I usually put this on first and let it start to work and then do the rest of my routine( hair, brush teeth, face, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Aztec Clay Mask is such a simplistic face mask, yet it works better than any I have every used. It is especially useful for people who struggle with acne. I simply mix it with some Apple Cider Vinegar and put it on. I think go do a few chores like the dishes or starting laundry. I wash it off in the shower. Some don’t prefer to do this, but I haven’t had any problems doing so and I prefer to do it this way as it makes less of a mess in my opinion. I strongly encourage you all to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The KonjacSponges are a new addition to my routine. They are made from a plant root and another natural ingredient. They are expected to last around 3 months. Even longer if you take better care of them. They are so soft! And I can already tell it helps make my skin more smooth. I find them to definitely be a positive addition to my skincare routine and will be buying more. I use the pink clay facial sponge for my face cleaning. The pink clay helps with dry skin and uneven skin tone. There are a lot of varieties of different ingredients added to the sponges, so I am sure you can find one that works best for your skin. I then use the red clay body sponge for the same reasons. I have really dry skin and these help. I also feel a bit indulgent every time I use them because of how soft they are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this has helped if you are like me and looking to lessen the amount of chemicals you put on your skin. Next I plan to try and make a more natural hair care routine, and then find natural alternatives for deodorant and toothpaste.Sponges are a new addition to my routine.

            <li> I am an African-American with combination, clear skin and almost never get any breakouts. I used this product for the first time last night. I was immediately turned off by the fact that when I opened the jar this product did not come with a protective cover that cosmetic items normally have when they are brand new. The powder substance immediately spilled all over my bed and dresser which was totally unexpected. I mixed two spoons of the clay with 3 spoons of APV which turned out to be too much for my face and neck. I felt my skin tighten up while I had the mask on and when I rinsed it off my face was very red. The instructions say that this is normal, however the next day I really did not notice that much of an improvement in my skin. I will indeed finish the rest of this mask until it expires because I don&#x27;t want my money to go to waste however, anyone who is thinking of buying this you would be better off doing a DIY mask.</li>
            <li> This clay mask does all the wonderful things people say it does! I love it.. Use it once a week because it can dry your skin if you have sensitive skin like me but once a week is perfect! Clear skin!</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it! So amazing! I love when it tightens  on your face. Definitely recommend and it&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
            <li> My skin does get red if i keep teh mask on for more than 20 min, but it cleans so well. Magical. I even start putting it on my husband&#x27;s face and I do that maybe once in a month and I can see his face glowing. I can almost not see any black heads.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing is I had to try it once to see how less to use.&lt;br /&gt;Trick to removing it: Take a paper towel wet it just a bit and put it on your face/ tao some water and wet the dried up mask, once its wet enough it ll slide off easily - Wipe it clean with the paper towel to avoid sink clogging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried showering it off but same problem - this sucker clogs the drain, sink, shower anything. Just use a wet paper towel to remove most of it and then wash off.</li>
            <li> this is the first reveiw I&#x27;ve ever written, I just cant keep how much I love this product to myself. When you put this mask on you feel your face pulsating and getting tight, nothing I&#x27;ve ever felt before in a face mask. My skin got red and dry after using it but I applied lotion and waited a half hour as instructed. After waiting for the redness to go away I knew I was in love with this product, I have bad adult acne and acne scars and this clay evened out my skin color and took away my acne. Everyone around me could tell I did something different. I feel amazing when I use this product! A must buy!</li>
            <li> I am 56 yrs. old and this is the best mask I&#x27;ve ever found.  Very happy with it.  : )</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how affective this mud, sorry - clay, really is, but it sure feels fun. This clay - let me just call it &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; since that&#x27;s what it looks like, makes the skin looks nice and fresh after you leave it on for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying takes time to learn: I recommend mixing it with water in a small skilled bag and then simply applying to skin with hands on skin. Give it 15 minutes +- and wash it off (I just rinse in the shower, so far no clogs). Usually you end up making much more mud then you need, so If you mix it in a bag you can save it in a cool place and use it afterwards, even a week and more later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quantity here is huge and I gave a lot of the &amp;#34;sand&amp;#34; / powder as a gift to friends and family, who loved it too.</li>
            <li> When I was a teenager starting to develop oily skin and large pores on my nose an esthetician working a beauty counter at a mega store in Mexico introduced me to a green clay mask that worked wonders on my skin. When I was back in the US, however, that product was no where to be found. I&#x27;ve tried countless clay masks since then with only so-so results. Fast forward to today, 15 years later, I ran across this product on Amazon and bought it on a hunch. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased that I did because this is exactly like the green clay mask I used so many years ago and just from two uses it cleared up the skin problems I&#x27;ve been fighting with for these past 15 years. My skin is so much smoother, my pores are so clean and my skin is hardly oily at all. The only downside is that this product doesn&#x27;t come ready to apply. Because it&#x27;s a very fine powder it&#x27;s easy to get it everywhere when trying to mix it. I highly recommend it, though. I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have had no problem with this mask. The jar is super full and it makes my face so clean and smooth!</li>
            <li> Using this mask with just water or apple cider vinegar will definitely give you noticeably smoother skin for a short while but I didn&#x27;t find it anything spectacular.  Not one to needlessly waste anything I&#x27;ve purchased I decided to figure out some ways to improve this mask.  I used up a whole tub of this clay trying many different ingredients and have come up with a few I am really fond of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LIQUID&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;APPLE CIDER VINEGAR- The traditional way to use this mask.  Others have extolled it virtues so I won&#x27;t go into detail here, but it is a universally great choice for many skin types.  ACV makes the smoothest and easiest to apply mixture as well.&lt;br /&gt;ROSE WATER - This is currently my preferred way to use this mask.  Rosewater makes your face beautifully soft and it smells divine.  Even better, rose water is anti-inflammatory and full of antioxidants.  It is also balancing to both dry and oily skin.  If you can&#x27;t find plain rosewater a rosewater and glycerin toner can be used just as well.&lt;br /&gt;WITCH HAZEL - I use witch hazel when I&#x27;m battling breakouts.  It&#x27;s a mild astringent that doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like many other astringents have a tendency to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ESSENTIAL OILS - I use 2 drops of each oil and generally use 1-2 oils per mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TEA TREE - Perfect for those looking to use this mask as a way to control acne.

            <li> Bought it as a gift for my sister and she swears by it</li>
            <li> No specification on this product as far as how to use it.  You have to &amp;#34;Google&amp;#34; it.  If you know what you&#x27;re doing, it&#x27;s ok, I guess.</li>
            <li> really good for my skin!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!  I make a batch in a plastic air-tight container and leave it in the fridge.  This works really great at clearing up problem skin and excess oil.  Definitely contains enough clay for more masks than the packaging claims.  I used vinegar per package instructions...</li>
            <li> My skin was left dried out so most def. put cream on it afterwards ! My skin feels great and you really do see a difference</li>
            <li> By far the best deep cleansing toneing mask I ever tried! I mix with Apple Cidar Vinegar with Mother and make a paste. I paint it on with a brush and let it completely dry. Be sure to put a paper towel over your sink so the clay doesn&#x27;t clog your sink. I continued to wipe of with damp paper towels or facial wipes. Then I apple toner. My face feels so refreshed and clean. You can see the difference right away. Your pores are open and clear! Wonderful product. It goes a long way. Will last for a year!</li>
            <li> BEST FACIAL MASK EVER: mix it with apple cider vinegar. You&#x27;ll feel your face pulsate and detox! I use this stuff once a week and my skin looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have large pores. My face itched and tingled when it was drying so I was a little worried at first. I looked in the mirror when it was done drying and laughed hysterically at myself because it dried so tight that my eyes were open as far as they could go and it gave me Angelina Jolie lips lol. I washed it off with warm water, patting first to soften the clay back up. I was AMAZED at all of the gunk and junk it drew out of my face. EVERY single black and white head I had was sitting on the top of my face ready to be washed away. I used my Toilettree face brush and black soap to gently scrub them all away and then rinsed with ice cold water to close my pores back up, followed by witch hazel cucumber toner to calm my face down. The next day my makeup went on my face so smoothly and my pores were looking much better. I have only used it once but I can tell you now I will never use anything else from now on!</li>
            <li> I would like companies to be aware when they sell their products to either use easily removable labels or to place them in a spot on the package that does not sit on top of the instructions!</li>
            <li> bentonite is what this is made of, harmful in the powder from especially and when adding liquid even more harmful. Please read before you buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> Leaves skin clean and soft.  Use with water for more sensitive skin or apple cider vinegar for deep cleansing.  This mask is non-irritating and like it says in the directions, it may make some portions of skin red after use but I have found it goes away pretty fast.  I have medium-sensitive skin and it works fine for me.  I used it once with apple cider vinegar but it makes my skin a little too red but still non-itchy or irritating.  I have even used it on my feet to soften cracked heels and detoxify.  I will buy this item again.</li>
            <li> I got this for my face and my thighs. When i work out or sweat, i get huge bumps on my inner thighs. I also get cysts a lot, I have folliculitis so i always get bumps. Anyways, it works great, in two days I noticed a huge difference in swelling and pain. I also noticed on my face as well. I had a huge pimple on my chin, and instead staying for a week, it was gone in a couple days. Glad that i purchased.</li>
            <li> This clay is FANTASTIC...I get a swelling reaction when bitten by mosquitos..I was VERY surprised when I put the Indian Healing Clay on. Within 1/2 minute, the swelling was down and the itch gone..I tried that with Terramin clay, and to no avail...I have been using it as a facial also, and I have seen noticeable results in the tightening of my skin...And Terramin Clay is much more expensive..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought Terramin Clay because it was advertised that the \\&quot;astronauts\\&quot; ate a little every day for minerals, while in space..Don&#x27;t believe the hype..You pay for it...</li>
            <li> amazing product! strongly recommend</li>
            <li> It works great and shipping was pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this mask from Whole Foods for $6.99. They also sell organic apple cider vinegar for $2.99. Overall i liked this product especially it being so reasonably priced. I had an extraction facial right after i used this mask and i&#x27;m very pleased with the results. the only down side is that it took more than 30 min for the mask to dry. I&#x27;ll definitely keep using it. I hope it will keep my acne under control.</li>
            <li> I mixed this with ACV, 1 Tablespoon of each is plenty for your face. Mixed it well in a glass bowl W/chopsticks and applied a smooth, thick layer to my face. It does make your face pulsate a bit, but it feels good. After about 25 minutes, I got into the shower (it would have been taken forever to wash off in the sink,)and rinsed off.  My skin was a little red, but felt clean and smooth.  I was able to clean up pores around my nose, easily with the proper tool, because of this prep, and I then followed my usual skin care routine.  I intend to do this 1x per week, my skin really looks and feels both smooth and glowing! I even mixed a tiny bit up for the beginning of a zit and it stopped it from developing and cleared it up.  Healing Clay indeed!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this but it made my face itch like crazy :-(</li>
            <li> This is a good price for this stuff. All it is is green clay powder. I mixed it with apple cider vinegar and this stuff reallly tightened up, I could barely smile.</li>
            <li> I am 27 years old and have been suffering from moderate to servere acne since a teen. Ive tried everything under the sun and the healing masks has finally cured my acne trouble. i use the mask two or three times a week and follow it with a few drops of jojoba oil because it does dry my skin. overall iam so happy with the results and i recommend this product to anybody who is dealing with acne.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. You don&#x27;t feel your face pulsate at first, but as it dries, it gets stronger. If you have sensitive skin, you may have a reddened face after applying this. It will fade. You might want to try just leaving it on for 5-10  minutes. I can leave it on for about 30 minutes and I&#x27;m fine but my friend&#x27;s face looked like she was badly sunburned after leaving it on for 20 minutes. It can be messy to take off but it makes my skin feel amazing! People actually commented that I had a glow the next day!</li>
            <li> When I got this is in the mail, I was ridiculously excited! I tried it as soon as it came in. I didn&#x27;t see results right away but after trying it 2 more times I saw the difference. It definitely makes your pores smaller. I have dry skin and after using the mask I notice that it makes my skin a little dry. I use argan oil or coconut oil after the mask. Its definitely worth it though. This product really is good. Will buy again. Good luck everyone!</li>
            <li> I mix this with lemon juice &amp; it works well. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin &amp; helps to even out my skin tone as well as decrease blockages.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product. I&#x27;ve been using it in a homemade toothpaste that has healed my receding gums.</li>
            <li> Ive used this several times on my clients and have noticed a huge difference with blackheads and acne. Always remember to use a very good moisturizer can be drying. Would not use on dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love how clean this makes me feel. I can even say that this is my favorite deep pore cleasing mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is the trouble I have to go through to make the mask. It&#x27;s powder inside the container, so you have to add water/solvent to mix with the powder and eventually make it a paste. It is a PAIN! It is a pain to make it a consistent paste, and it is a pain to clean the sink and counter afterwards. But then again, it works great...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish that there were an easier way to use this.</li>
            <li> Good stuff!  I&#x27;m an esthetician and this is a great mask at a great price.  If you have blemishes or oily/acne prone skin, mix it with white vinegar or lemon juice for extra exfoliation and to kill bacteria.  It&#x27;s great stuff.  WARNING: It is a bit of a pain to get off.  try applying water to your face for a bit before taking it off so that you don&#x27;t have to scrub too hard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product 2ce but I can see a huge diffrence on my face.</li>
            <li> I suffer from acne and wanted something that would clear my face. I will tell you this is not going to happen overnight. Your face will feel so much clean from all the oil and dirt. I have mixed it with water and apple cider vinegar though I prefer the water. If you are debating upon buying this and notice a lot of people saying how it clears pimples that is if you doing this every other day. I love applying this product every once a week. It clears my blackheads too! It’s a win/win! The down bringer? When you mix this with water your face will freeze and become so stiff. Your face will be red after washing your face. You cannot wash your face over a sink and you must wash it over a bowl. You do not want this mud going down our drains for you will clog them! I tend to get very warm water two hand towels. I slowly wipe away the mud from sections and then pat dry with the dry hand towel. This product is simply amazing and I recommend everyone to buy it! Yes whole foods even sells it for about 8 dollars. So if you cannot wait go to whole foods and buy it or order it off here.</li>
            <li> Put this on ur face and ur entire body!! You&#x27;ll look crazy as hell before it dries HOWEVER once it&#x27;s dry (I do 20mins for face and body) your skin will feel and look renewed</li>
            <li> Seriously I have had acne all my life (I&#x27;m 23) and recently quit smoking and started to have massive breakouts for no reason. I searched and searched and finally found this an decided to order it. I&#x27;m so thankful I did because after 1 month of facials 2 times a week I&#x27;m basically acne free!</li>
            <li> Works as it is described.</li>
            <li> Clears up ur face and body and leaves a glowing affect</li>
            <li> I use it for external and internal it works great with my skin as well as detoxing my body from heavy metals, i put one teaspoon in a glass of water and mix it up, i do this every morning before meals and it had helped me wonders with stomach problems as well, make sure you it doesnt come in contact with metal it will decrease its power.</li>
            <li> It seems like it works, but it is too inconvenient to use frequently.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing multi-purpose product. I use it to cleanse my skin, dry out pimples, and as a soothing mask. I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This clay is terrible! My acne is worse now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using it recently because I have acne ridden skin. My dermatologist recommend this to me &amp; since I have severe acne, she told me to use it everyday until my acne clears up &amp; then twice a week after. This is my third day &amp; I can already see my acne starting to fade out. I&#x27;m so excited to see the end results! The only thing I will say is that DO NOT make it too thick. It&#x27;ll tighten your pores way too much &amp; the dirt with stay trapped. But this stuff is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Tried this and was amazed. The mask really cleaned pores when mixed with the vinegar as described.  I am sold on this and at age 60, that is saying something. Plus it&#x27;s as good as the expensive masks. I use high end skin care as a rule. love saving money on this.</li>
            <li> This product definitely tightens the skin and leaves it feeling nice and cleansed.  I am trying to use more natural products and stay away from chemical-based items, for that reason this product appealed to me.  I followed the directions and it can be a bit of a mess but one reviewer had the right idea in saying to put it on in very thin layers. I purchased facial wipes that I could throw away after wiping it off because the mud can be messy.  I left it on the 10 minutes as suggested and I couldn&#x27;t leave on any longer because my skin did start to burn.  I take it off as soon as it starts to burn and it does not leave any type skin of reaction... Others might not have experienced the burn but I have fair, sensitive skin.  Overall a good product and I will continue using since it does not damage the skin.  I would give it five stars if it wasn&#x27;t for the burning sensation.</li>
            <li> I love this mask. It keeps my skin flawless</li>
            <li> Exactly as described - great quality - perfect for the job and really easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> You have to mix the mask yourself which can be a little tricky. Applying it with fingers is difficult because it just slides around on your skin. I end up applying it with a spatula. Do not over apply-- it will never dry! You can feel it pull on your skin, sucking out all the impurities. My skin looks and feels amazing after using it.</li>
            <li> You can wash with it, and it is a great exfoliant. Add a few drops of tea tree oil and coconut water and you have the perfect hydrating mask that sucks out all the nasties. It&#x27;s great for stings and bites too! Perfect scrub for that baby&#x27;s bottom smoothing and to clean up hands and feet.</li>
            <li> Works great. I used once a week to keep my skin clear and refreshed</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews, I was extremely excited to try this out. Unfortunately, it is a huge hassle to mix(clumps, splashes, etc), and I have tried the vinegar mix as well as the water mix with identical results; it does help with pimples and blackheads, but it is no miracle worker, and when used as instructed it dries out my skin during use to the point where it begins to burn, and leaves my face red and ultra-sensitive for the rest of the day. If I had a HUGE problem with acne, I would continue to use this product and probably get decent results, but for someone who just wants a weekly deep cleanse, I would highly suggest the Queen Helene Masque or the (more expensive but a godsend spot-treatment) Mario Badescu Drying Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I use this to make my own glamglow mask dupe. It works well mixed with other ingredients (activated charcoal, turmeric, etc), or by itself with some apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> I have not used this however, I was told its a very good product. I plan to use it one of these day. Thanks amazon for your services.</li>
            <li> This product feels great and after a few minutes it dry&#x27;s up and forms a mask. I have only used it a few times so I am not sure how well it will work for your acne; but what I do know is this healing clay feels great for a mask!</li>
            <li> I was hoping for anything - cleaner skin, a refreshing feeling, clearing up of pores, etc. Instead, there was no effect. It didn&#x27;t make my skin worse, but it didn&#x27;t improve it either. I didn&#x27;t like the texture as the solution (mixed with water) was not homogenous. You had solid clumps of clay/mud and then a watery solution. Putting it on my face and cleaning it off was a huge hassle. I wish I could get a refund.</li>
            <li> Just used it once. I have very sensitive skin and I didn&#x27;t have any irritation or breakout.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, definitely mix this in a small snack zip lock bag.  I use apple cider vinegar, the smell takes time to get used to but does make my skin feel better after.  The clay will get stuck in your drains if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> This product did not work as well for me as it apparently has for so many. I was very hopeful for this product. I have oily - combination skin that is acne prone. I am 29 and still struggle with skin problems. I have tried most of the popular acne kits/products. I chose to go ahead and also buy the Bragg&#x27;s vinegar that everyone recommends. I mixed the vinegar with the clay and used it as a mask. I left it on for just over 10 mins until it mostly dried. When I washed it off I was shocked to find that my skin was extremely tight and had turned a bright red color near all the edges where I put the mask. I don&#x27;t know if I was somehow allergic to a component or if my sometimes sensitive skin overreacted,  or if perhaps it dried my skin out too much. I would be shocked of it were an allergy. I would also be shocked if it dried my skin out since I have truly greasy skin. I&#x27;m not sure what went wrong, but my skin did not look or feel better after using the mask. I am willing to give it a try one more time and will update my review if I see different results. I gave 2 stars because I do at least appreciate the simplicity of the product. Hopefully I have better luck next time.</li>
            <li> it will make your skin very dry.</li>
            <li> Bentonite clay is the best thing i have found to draw the toxins out of my skin. it works better than any acne medicine i have ever used. BEST PRODUCT EVER.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit hard to mix with water into a smooth paste, so I recommend pre-mixing a batch in a cup or bowl and letting it sit overnight with saran wrap over the top of the container. After that, the texture of this mask will feel like butter! Another tip is not to leave it on your skin too long--the clay will start to PAINFULLY pull on your skin. (It really hurts, man). This mask is more drying than any clay mask I&#x27;ve ever used. However, I&#x27;ve liked it so far and it&#x27;s quite a bonus that it&#x27;s dirt cheap (no pun intended haha).</li>
            <li> A gift from my friend! I love it!This stuff is pretty sweet.Skin is so clean after using. I use this once a week and get great looking healthy skin!RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> I really like this as I feel when I use this ( which take a while since I put it on the thicker side) it really is drying and cleaning out my skin. I like it as it call to mix with vinegar in a small dish. Both things are good for cleansing. After I put a moisturizer on.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with how quickly I seen results with this product within 48hrs I seen a major difference in my skin. My skin was smoother softer and almost completely acne free. I&#x27;m 25 I&#x27;ve dealt with acne since middle school. My breakouts were a little more serious than minor but not exactly dreadful. I did this facial for a week straight I mixed it with tea tree oil n water, it is a powder u have to mix urself, but I like that because I can create my own consistency. Be sure to get a moisturizer because after cleaning your face it will be dry. But not the harsh and irritating type of dry. Definitely cleans every inch of dirt possible out of your pores while tightening your pores. You can actually see the dirt trapped in the residue of the mask when rinsing your face. Way better than any prescription I&#x27;ve ever been prescribed. I will recommend this product to any and everybody, to clear up acne and maintain a clear face. After your acne is clear you can do this facial once to twice a week and continuously have beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price!!  I bought this and tried it out with a friend.  I think I applied too much of the clay (a little bit goes a LONG way here) and waited the time listed on the jar.  I didn&#x27;t feel the pusating that were in other reviews, but my skin was noticiably different after washing the mask off.  BUT my friend waited about 5 minutes longer than I did and felt the pulsating!  Next time I know just to wait a little longer - or maybe use a little less product from the start.</li>
            <li> Bentonite clay plus apple cider vinegar equals the best facial you have ever!!  Product does what it says it can.</li>
            <li> For those seeking a truly natural product that produces amazing results, go no further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the excellent reviews detailing application tips and tricks and you will experience the pulling and tightening sensation promised by this product.  Pay close attention to the condition of your pores before and after treatment to see the cleaning and shrinking effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this is the top rated Amazon facial cleanser for a reason ... try it.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny, just don&#x27;t leave on for too long or your face will look sunburnt for hours. Definitely have a nice face cream on hand after washing this stuff off.</li>
            <li> So super messy that its disgusting to use.</li>
            <li> I like this product. My face was very smooth after only one use. I followed the directions but the consistency was not what I thought it should be. The next time I use it I&#x27;ll make it thinner. Also, I don&#x27;t think it is possible to apply it as thick as they recommend. Aside from that I do like this mask and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic. Better than expected. Work great to clear pores and leave skin healthy. I highly recommend this Aztec healing clay.</li>
            <li> My skin got better in just two days! :-O&lt;br /&gt;AWESOME! Dont hesitate, this product will save you guys, I have a hormonal acne arround my mouth because of taking off my birth control and this is just miracle. Nothing helped me by now. THANK YOU AZTECS! :D Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I mix it with coffee &amp; milk when out of apple cider, store in a ziplock in the flidge and heat up under hot water before applying. Follow up with toner and moisturizer (I use bio oil or help oil) afterwards, usually in the middle of the week to prevent stress-induced breakouts. Noticed a difference within a month.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a local health store for around $8.  I marked on my calendar the day I started using it-which was June 3.  I used a teaspoon to place scoops in a plastic bag, added the ACV, and squished in the bag until I got the texture I wanted.  When I did use it I didn&#x27;t always get the &amp;#34;squeezing&amp;#34; feel that it advertises.  I wash it off in the shower.  I used it a few times a week.  It is now August 19 and I can say with certainty that this product has done nothing to improve the appearance of my acne.  Apparently it is helpful as a deep conditioner.  If I&#x27;m brave I may try that on my hair-I still have a lot left.  But overall very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this product while looking for petal rose witch hazel and cannot believe I haven&#x27;t heard about it before. I read a lot of the good and bad reviews but ultimately decided to get it because, for the price, I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt. I had purchased other products to help w/my sporadic, stress/hormone-induced acne for much more and hadn&#x27;t seen any lasting results. I watched a few YouTube video tutorials on how to mix it/apply it and let me tell you, it was helpful! I use 1 Tablespoon mixed w/the same amount of raw apple cider vinegar from Trader Joe&#x27;s and it&#x27;s plenty for my face.  I&#x27;ve been using it every other day for 30 minutes and am already seeing my nose pores smaller. This is one happy customer (:</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted - arrived very fast.  The product is some of the best bentonite clay out there (and without the sodium added to it).</li>
            <li> I love it, it really cleans your pores and your skin feels softer. I&#x27;m usin Olay hidratating cream also, because it&#x27;s always good to use everyday.</li>
            <li> GREAT FACE MASK! i love this face mask. I&#x27;ve been using it for approx. 2 years now and it always leaves my face smooth and blackhead free, feels great and isn&#x27;t harsh on sensitive skin. ****make sure you&#x27;re using it with the recommended Apple Cider Vinegar to get the right effects.</li>
            <li> I only write reviews if I really love a product or really dislike it. This I LOVE! I&#x27;ve only used it once and am 100% happy and satisfied with the results. I used the apple cider vinegar and made it a little thick. I am 27 and after having children started getting breakouts around the time of my cycle, my pores are usually huge and I&#x27;ve tried everything to the point that I just started getting used to it. I figured maybe some people just always have huge dirty pores. I was unsure of what to expect with this mask but just wanted a really clean feeling face. I used this as instructed and my pores are so much smaller and my face is so soft and clean. I plan to use this every week. I experienced no drying, my skin is usually pretty sensitive but i did not have any redness and wouldn&#x27;t really mind if I had.  The little bumps on my face that tells me I&#x27;m near a breakout were gone after using the mask. I would recommend this to anybody and I realize maybe not everybody would be as amazed as I was but if you are looking for something to get your face deep clean give this a try!</li>
            <li> If you have severe acne as I once did, this product did help improve my skin (it did not cure my acne or blackheads). However, if your acne is extreme, the real solution is the dermatologist. After treatment from the dermatologist, I started using this more frequently and it is amazing. It really removes blackheads with ease and calms any signs of acne. Sidebar: It does leave the skin red for a couple of hours.  Really, the price is right and it does the job much better than any other product on the market...stop thinking about it and go for it because you really won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Let me just say this is the best stuff in the world I am truly satisfied with this product I don&#x27;t understand how any one could give less than 5 stars</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for 20 years. It lasts a really long time. In fact, I just bought a new jar after having the old one last for 16 years. It&#x27;s a fantastic mask especially mixed with apple cider vinegar. I can feel it working when I use it. My face does pulsate. I really like this product and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I used to use this a few years back, and I remember loving it. I decided to buy it because I needed a deep cleansing mask. It really feels like all the nasty gunk is being pulled out of your pores  when it &amp;#34;pulsates&amp;#34;. Definitely recommend for bad skin days. However..those with dry and or sensitive skin should moisturize heavily after and use sparingly..can be a bit drying and you may look a bit red after.</li>
            <li> I love love love this mask!! I tried it once and fell in love and I made the mistake of using it every day and it made my face...raw I think is the word for it. It stripped my natural oils. But once I started using once a week I saw all the real benefits. I love it!</li>
            <li> I guess I was secretly hoping for some magical effect, but I should have known better. Although it will not give you amazing skin in 3 days, it will do the following from my personal experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-lessen the inflammation of incoming pimples, especially those ones that are large painful ones&lt;br /&gt;-reduce scarring and speed up healing.&lt;br /&gt;-reduce white heads with proper gentle exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will also bring up dirt under skin that u didn&#x27;t know was there, thus creating more pimples in the beginning phase of use. Too frequent of use will hinder its healing effects, it doesn&#x27;t get proper time to do the healing. I suggest once or twice a week, no matter how much you want to speed things up. Most importantly, use some quality skin balancing oil like Jurlique brand to rehydrate skin after use.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic. You end up with a comfortable smooth, clean, clear complexion. I do think that for such a simple mud mask compared to the major brand GLO, this is a no brainer. It&#x27;a work horse without all of the fancy packaging. Kind of messy though. I suggest not washing it off down the drain first, but removing it with a makeup remover towelette first to get it started in the removal process. I have dry skin and thought it would be drying. It does feel drying while wearing it, but once it&#x27;s removed your skin feels invigorated.</li>
            <li> I got Rashes on my face from this maybe I&#x27;m allergic but I didn&#x27;t get rashes when I used water, honestly I don&#x27;t see no difference in my skin</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see the effect yet but seems to be very effective</li>
            <li> Tip on clean up. If you want to keep your plumbing clear and save on paper towels, put a medium to large bowl (like a large salad bowl) in your sink and fill it with warm water. Then use a wash cloth to wipe your face, and repeat using the water from the bowl until your face is cleaned. It&#x27;s a quick process and the heat of the water helps easily dissolve the mask, as well as the friction from the wash cloth. The bowl catches the debris and you can just toss the used water outside. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the efficacy of the product, I just started using it again yesterday after about a year of ... Not using it. But in the shower last night, while washing my face, I wasn&#x27;t even thinking about having used the mask earlier, and noticed how smooth and clean my pores felt. It was a definite noticeable difference. Am looking forward to using more frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if your skin isn&#x27;t as beautifully clear as you&#x27;d ljke it to be, for me, after years of trying just about every product out there (well so it felt), hemp oil has helped me the absolute most. My skin is almost 100% clear now, and it seems to be helping with fade the hyper pigmented scars left behind. I really encourage anyone to try it. I buy mine from Amazon. I use it at night to remove my make up in the shower as a face wash, and moisturize with it after. And then I use it in the morning, just as a moisturizer with tea tree and lavender oils but I don&#x27;t think they are necessary for this to help. (I don&#x27;t wash my face again in the morning, I just put this on). My skin is the consistently best that it has been in a very long time, probably since using hormonal birth control (which I discontinued years ago). It&#x27;s natural, moisturizing and cost-efficient. I have also started taking it internally and feel more mental clarity and more hours in the day of energy, less need for sleep. So far, I love hemp oil-- okay this turned info a hemp oil review ;) but I also am pleased with the Amazonian clay mask, and will update this review of the results continue to impress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your day and think positively in the pursuit of clear skin. As funny as it sounds, I think positive thinking has also helped, and if not, it has led me to some of the most helpful skin products I&#x27;ve yet discover.update this review of the results continue to impress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your day and think positively in the pursuit of clear skin.

            <li> I love this product. I will always use this mask. Why is this product so hidden. Should of found this years ago.</li>
            <li> does bring blood to the skin surface / did not notice cleaning results yet / used it every day for a week . now once in three days ..</li>
            <li> Amazing! It definitely works.  I had my husband, three sisters and mom try it and they have all fallen in love with it as well.  Leaves my face soft and clean.  I can feel it working as soon as I apply it.  Beware though, it will leave your face bright red for about thirty minutes so don&#x27;t put it on right before going out.</li>
            <li> Great Product, use it once a week. And my face feels refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> I am officially a believer! I read all the reviews and decided to give it a shot. I am in my late 20&#x27;s and still struggle with acne. I have oily skin and different types of acne (cystic, etc). My skin varies in degree of acne depending on my cycle, so when it is really problematic, this stuff is great to have on hand. I use apple cider vinegar and leave it on for about 20-30 mins. I know some people expect immediate results, but it&#x27;s best not have these expectations, as it&#x27;s unrealistic. I did experience the following after one use, however:&lt;br /&gt;-Minimized swelling of acne&lt;br /&gt;-Minimized swelling of pores&lt;br /&gt;-Smoothed skin&lt;br /&gt;-Made skin look more healthy overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it can be VERY mess and clogs drains, so I&#x27;ve tried numerous ways of taking it off (wipes, washcloth) and it still makes a mess when I take it off. But overall, very pleased!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. My skin feels wonderful after I use it. Your skin will be red for about 30 min after you wash it off. Totally normal.  I&#x27;m thinking of buying this as a Christmas gift for a few people who appreciate good skin care products.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!!! I cant believe how hard the mask gets on your face - you can def tell that it&#x27;s PULLING the dirt out of your pores. Only thing is - you might breakout a little bit because its actually lifting all the junk out. But its totally worth it and goes away...the more you use it the cleaner your pores will be</li>
            <li> This is literally the best face mask I have ever tried, and I&#x27;ve tried everything from high dollar chemical peels to organic Dead Sea minerals. About a month ago after having my son, I developed severe cystic acne on every inch of my face. I was completely mortified every time I looked in the mirror. In an attempt to save my sanity my boyfriend purchased this for me, and I gotta say that I love him so much more for it. Within the first application I noticed that it either pulled the pus out of the cysts or brought them to the surface. After a hours they were significantly flatter! Not only did it take care of the cysts but it also seemed to get rid of the blackheads on my nose. This stuff (as well as a strict skin regimen) is truly responsible for building my self confidence up again. At first I was a bit skeptical because of some reviews, but don&#x27;t knock it till you try it! Be sure to use a good moisturizer afterwards and follow the instructions!</li>
            <li> Used as hair and facial mask, worked well.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! My whole family has been using for years and is an awesome facial mask at such a good price! I like to mix with apple cider vinegar instead of water.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really do anything for my skin, my pores were the same size, my acne and blackheads looked the same, but my face felt and looked refreshed and clean. For the price, I recommend the product. It will last you a long time!</li>
            <li> A little messy and inconvenient to mix and prepare, since you can&#x27;t use metal materials, but I still enjoy this product and the results I get from using it.</li>
            <li> I like this. I was looking for a mask to help me clean my pours and this does the trick.</li>
            <li> Im in college and i suffer from bad acne this really helps like in the 1st week i noticed changes in my skin and also other people throughtout the college and co workers i love it.</li>
            <li> Item received as described.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised! I have super sensitive skin &amp; whatever I put on it irritates it. I figured I would give it a shot &amp; it made my face soo soft. It gave me a little redness afterward but I read that that&#x27;s normal and it was gone in 15mins.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the price for one pound, I&#x27;d honestly pay more for this stuff. Works perfectly! Just used it for my first time and my skin feels amazing, my pores are virtually gone.</li>
            <li> I love this mask, not to harsh. Wish i could use it everyday! I mix it with braggs apple cidee vinegar and it leaves my pores looking smaller and my redness goes away as well. I recommend this mask to people who have some acne.</li>
            <li> Good mask, dries right up and leaves skin smooth. But my skin is already dry, so not sure this is good for people over 50.</li>
            <li> I have minor blackheads that I&#x27;ve wanted to clear up for a while. I&#x27;ve tried blackhead strips to no avail--if anything, they left my skin feeling weird and looking the same as it did before use. When I saw this product and its great reviews, I figured, &amp;#34;why not try it?&amp;#34; After only one use, I&#x27;m really impressed. I mixed the clay powder with apple cider vinegar as directed and applied a very thin layer to my face. Within a couple minutes, I felt the tightening sensation. Not only did my skin feel refreshed afterwards, but my blackheads were nowhere to be seen! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> great for removing dirt , leaves face feeling very clean. you can use this and actually tell your face is clean. works better when mixed with ACV(apple cider vingear)</li>
            <li> Only been using it for a few days, and so far so good. Skin is a lot smoother.</li>
            <li> Amazing results for tightening the skin and beautifying the complexion. I highly recommend this to use with apple cider vinegar (the high quality kind) to make a make a paste. Really remarkable results - takes years off. Love love love! Will always use this trick.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it keeps my face from being so oily(which helps prevent acne) and it closes my pours which makes my face feel soooo soft. The only problem I have is taking it off. I don&#x27;t have wipes around the house so I took a paper towell, dampened it, and used it as if it were a wipe. Bad idea. I have really sensitive skin and doing that made some spots on my face feel raw and made it red. And since this will clog your pipes, using a wipe would be your best option. Other than that. This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> This cleansing mask works so good, it leaves my face looking so clean.</li>
            <li> My sole purpose for using this mask was to get rid of all the dead skin which accumulates on my face because I&#x27;m on topical acne meds and they speed up my cell turnover rate. So as a result of the meds, my skin has been looking a bit dry and I have been constantly seeing dead skin all over my face and coming off on my towels. I tried scrubs but none that I have tried have ever been really effective at removing the dead skin flakes, it seems to only make it worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried this scrub tonight and whatdoyaknow! All of the noticeable dead skin was gone after I washed this mask off. That meant no scrubbing my skin and risking tearing holes and rips into it from scrubs which is a plus. I mixed it with ACV and it created a silky texture. I then smeared it on my skin and left it on for 20 mins. At that point, it began to pulsate and I had to wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a love/hate relationship with the pulsating. Some people love it, I don&#x27;t necessarily like it but at least I know that when my face starts to do that, something great has happened. Another plus about this product, it seemed to make my skin glowy and even-toned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will forever be in my life.</li>
            <li> Great product. The only negative thing I have to say about this clay mask is it itches my face while it dries. I know it&#x27;s strictly this mask because I never have this issue with any other mask I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using this product with apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> Very good product! I love how my face feels after this mask! What I do is I will only take a table spoon of the product and a few drops of apple cider vinegar mix it till its the right consistence (not too runny or too thick) and leave it on my face for about 30 minutes. Your face will definitely look fresh and clean and I think if you do it weekly you will see great results (I don&#x27;t do it every week because I forget).</li>
            <li> This stuff really helped clear a few problem spot on my face. I feel it working on my face about 10 mintues after wearing it, it&#x27;s the coolest mask I&#x27;ve ever tried. I bought some for my fiance&#x27; and he loves it too!</li>
            <li> I just got this clay last night, and Ive already used it twice. The first time, I mixed it with water; and like others have said, it does make the mixture clumpy, but it still works. The second time, I mixed it with apple cider vinegar. THIS IS THE WAY TO GO! The mixture is smooth and applies very easily. There was a noticeable difference after removing the mask both times. The texture of my skin appeared more even and my pores even looked smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product after my face broke out terribly after using Oil of Olay Pro X Acne Protocol, and clay mask definitely has been undoing the damage Oil of Olay caused on my skin. I had a deep cystic blemish from using Oil of Olay, and the mask brought it right to the surface. Today, the blemish is gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying more of this product in the future. Ive already started recommending it to friends!</li>
            <li> I tried this because someone said it was better than glam glow.&lt;br /&gt;I got mine today still waiting on the raw acv so I  used it with water - already my skin feels so soft. I left it on for 15 mins moisturized with coconut oil. OMG its a miracle. Can&#x27;t wait to see what my face will feel and look like at the end of the month. I will order more just incase they run out, increase price or discontinue. I will do an update</li>
            <li> After washing this off, my skin looked so good!!  I loved how it felt. I applied coconut oil as moisturizer so it doesn&#x27;t feel  smooth anymore until tomorrow :D&lt;br /&gt;I used witch hazel after and then moisturized my skin with coconut oil.  Before I go to bed, I might apply invisible acne from Alba or w.e.. it is a natural spot treatment gel. Will only use on zits. I hope this regimen works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update &#x27;cause it was my first time using, so I can&#x27;t say if it helped with breakouts. I will use this 4-5 days a week &#x27;till I clear up and then will minimize the intake to once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I am using this everyday because it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin or make it red. I see huge improvements.. I did got some tiny bumps, but I guess that&#x27;s &#x27;cause this clay was doing its job. My skin looks so smooth.. feels so smooth like a baby..  I also saw improvement on redness.. my forehead was a mess and it looks almost clear. I&#x27;m still using Witch hazel ( 100% all natural one) I then apply acnedot spot treatment from Alba which is a new product.. has 2% SA. It is natural.  It does dries pimple very quickly. I also apply aloe vera (fresh) on scars and redness to speed up the healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE #2: So I broke out a bit on forehead and got 1 new small pimple on cheek. I guess this is normal since this is a deep pore product so it cleans, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to use this less, I used it 4 days in a row.. my left eye got a little swollen and it did hurt a bit... so I will use 3 times a week. My skin looks very smooth though.. when I touch it.. it is as smooth as a baby face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 3: Weird.. my skin is a little oily .. I don&#x27;t even moisturize &#x27;cause it isn&#x27;t dry. I&#x27;ve been using this product almost everyday for a week. I also use witch hazel toner and my skin still isn&#x27;t dry.  Skin is looking OK.. I did broke out with some tiny bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4: I decided to apply this twice a week! I think my skin was product a lot of oils because my skin never went dry and I&#x27;ve been applying this everyday and used witch hazel after which is good for oily skin.. but my skin still remained a little greasy. I started applying coconut oil as a moisturizer and is helping.&lt;br /&gt;Skin is becoming less oily.skin never went dry and I&#x27;ve been applying this everyday and used witch hazel after which is good for oily skin.. but my skin still remained a little greasy.

            <li> I do not recommend this product if you have sensitive skin. After 5 minutes, it started to make my face itch a little. Before ten minutes, I was running to take it off because of the irritation.</li>
            <li> So let&#x27;s face it, this stuff looks really hokey. I wasn&#x27;t even searching for something like this, but it came up in the results and I saw how high the rating was. Curiosity piqued, I checked it out and was compelled to buy it. The packaging was pretty funny to me, with claims about feeling your face move, the most powerful facial on earth, etc. Not expecting much, I gave it a whirl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really works. You really do feel movement and the clay working its magic. It was so tight, I barely moved my face once it dried, not wanting to crack it. It&#x27;s definitely weird, but it sure does the trick. My pores are terrible, and I have what seems like permanent blackheads all over my nose. Not super noticeable, but it&#x27;s something that bothers me personally. I also tend to get shiny skin very quickly. Just in the very first application, it&#x27;s wiped out a ton (but not all) of my blackheads, tightened my pores, and given my skin a great tone. It looks so clear! I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does with continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also point out that I&#x27;m lazy, and did not want to bother with the complicated mixing. I just put some of the dust in my palm, made it wet with water, and slapped it on my face. No worries about vinegar or a non-metal bowl, just super-uncomplicated application. I will probably even try it in the shower sometime.</li>
            <li> Best clay mask ever! Love this! It lasts a long time because u use just a small portion of the powder to mix with water or vinegar to apply to your whole face. Take a while to dry. Once it dries I put a hot towel over my face for a minute to soften the mask and it comes off easier. It feels like a spa treatment. My face is always bright red for about a hour after I use this mask. It feels like all the blood is rushed to the skin and is refreshed and healthy</li>
            <li> Hate this.  Feels horrible on my skin and I can&#x27;t wait to wash it off.  My skin does not feel good while it&#x27;s on or after.  There are much better products out there.  Or better yet, invest in a good micro-dermabrasion brush</li>
            <li> First of all, lower your expectations; this is not a magic powder taken from the fountain of youth. Now understand this; each and every one of us have different skin type, different circumstances and many other variables, what works for me may not work for you and not necessarily means it&#x27;s a bad product, it only means; you have to try something else.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind buying from 3rd parties as long as it&#x27;s processed and delivered by Amazon, of course my item arrived as described and on time.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, don&#x27;t be shocked, the container could not look any more ghetto; a crappy label that seems printed off an inkjet printer at the library with an Aztec pyramid clearly taken from a coloring book belonging to a little kid.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the idiot proof directions, painted my face green/gray with the stuff and chilled, just as promised as it started to dry out I could feel tightening and sucking, it feels kind of nice, fresh, relaxing, cooling, I was happy already, I did get frustrated at removal, I think that final battle to reclaim your face may be the cause for the irritation which in my case was very mild. Moisturize now.&lt;br /&gt;One note: the first time; I applied way too much and did not get the consistency right while mixing it thus really crippling its potency.&lt;br /&gt;I can feel and see my skin cleaner; I&#x27;m confident and happy to add this to my routine. The results are subtle but there and accumulative with time.&lt;br /&gt;Still reading? Well, did you notice it&#x27;s only like 8 bucks (shipped) for 1lb?  Try it, don&#x27;t like it? Toss it, move on and try something else.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mask based on the glowing reviews it received. I mixed it with apple cider vinegar as directed. Yes, it got very tight. No, I didn&#x27;t \\&quot;feel my face pulsate\\&quot;. It is merely a basic mud mask. My daughter and I applied it together and her face was slighly flushed afterward. Mine looked unchanged. We both left it on for 30 minutes without any notable effects afterward. Pores appear unchanged. Since I have an entire container of this product, I may try it again, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed nor do I understand the high marks it received. Somewhat disappointed and will continue to shop for a better mud mask.</li>
            <li> works clears my blackheads!!!</li>
            <li> I was in a panic as my face completely broke out five days before I saw my long distance boyfriend.  Of course.  I read the hundreds of reviews on this healing clay and thought to give it a try since it is so cheap.  I applied the mask and I used water instead of the vinegar, and waited for something to happen.  I had almost given up hope about 5 minutes in, but then my face started to heat up slightly and pulsate.  I left it on for about 20 - 25 minutes (durring which time you cannot speak as the mask is SUPER tight) and when I rinsed it off my face felt incredible!  The pimples I had been depressed over were much smaller and some were completely smooth!  I woke up the next morning and my skin looked great!  I did another mask the following night, but didn&#x27;t leave it on as long, and my skin is just getting better and better!  Talk about a miricle in a bottle-thing.  Get this stuff!</li>
            <li> I received this a few days ago and have used it twice. So far, so good. I always break out on my cheeks and It seems like this product has helped to keep that in control. I don&#x27;t know why I hadn&#x27;t heard of this product previously but it is amazing and I am sure it will last me a while.</li>
            <li> Simply amazing.i just tried it for the first time.I&#x27;m in love with my skin...it&#x27;s so soft and really clean. I feel like it would absolutely help my adult acne.my teen son likes it too.</li>
            <li> Really love using this product as a facial mask so far. The mixing part is a little tedious and the smell of the apple cider vinegar gets a little getting used to, but that&#x27;s why it states you can use water as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely huge pores, and oil pours out of them excessively. It&#x27;s a little too soon to tell, but I love the pulsing effect this gives off so I&#x27;m hoping my pores will shrink a bit. I have extreme problem areas with acne on my chin, and this product has dried them up right after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing the amount of product to use on one face takes a little trail and error. For me it only takes one and a half spoonful of the product and equal amounts of liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best clay mask you can get, it works well and it&#x27;s also inexpensive.</li>
            <li> It was a decent mask but clearly overhyped</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work at all and all it does is burn your face leaving you with a red rash for weeks!...</li>
            <li> I only used water as I read about the problems with it mixed with vinegar. I could still feel the pulling and it felt hot even after cleaning it off.</li>
            <li> Love this! Recommended by a friend and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait awhile before I reviewed this, to give myself some time to use it a few times. Make no mistake, you really feel this stuff contract and pull at your pores, you&#x27;ll literally feel like your face is pulsating. I have huge pores and tons of black heads, and I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable reduction in black heads on my nose and cheeks. After about 2 weeks using it, my face is really soft. For the prce</li>
            <li> Face feels so clean so good.</li>
            <li> Like any other clay face mask really.  Perhaps I haven&#x27;t used it enough to be wow&#x27;d.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! It&#x27;s Bentonite Clay for a really great price. There&#x27;s a lot of it in a jar so it will last you a long time. There are recipes on the brand&#x27;s website here: https://www.aztec-secret.com/pulsate.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially, mix with equal parts liquid (water or apple cider vinegar). For best results, use raw unpastuerized apple cider vinegar (Bragg&#x27;s is a popular brand). Some good recipes also use a bit of raw honey. Mix using no metal (the metal reacts with the clay and reduces effectiveness) and apply. Wash off when the mask dries out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is excellent for treating acne and drawing dirt/oils out of your pores. It reduces inflammation and breakouts. However, it is VERY drying. Apply moisturizer liberally after a good cleaning. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it more than once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> Feels weird and cool, sometimes uncomfortable. I don&#x27;t know how much it&#x27;s working. Hard to tell because I didn&#x27;t do before/after photos.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Not exactly the awesome product I expected. Gets really hard and sort of painful to get off.</li>
            <li> My skin feels really tight and fresh after I used it the 1st time. I&#x27;ve used it twice since and love the feeling and how dewy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Aztec Clay Mask since my 20s. I&#x27;m now about to turn 53, and I STILL swear by it.  For a deep cleansing, detoxifying, skin tightening mask, I just do not know of another product that can beat this.  I&#x27;ve tried others (including professional facials) and for the money, and the result you get, there is nothing like the Aztec Clay Mask that I know of on the market.  It is truly an amazing product, while being affordable and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be a bit drying, so make sure you moisture after.</li>
            <li> Ok I&#x27;m going to start off by saying that I&#x27;ve never really had pimple problems... Even during puberty I would maybe have 5 small pimples at worst. I am in my mid-twenties now and loooovvveee masks for my nose blackheads, so being the cheapy that I am, ordered this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it back in December 2014  and have tried it several times all with disappointing results... First few times all it did was make my face super dry and I had to exfoliate and apply moisturizer, which sucked but I kept wanting to love it so I would try again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last time I tried it was in June 2015 and I have had rashes SINCE. First around my mouth and nose, (now that has mostly healed) but it has moved to my cheeks close to my eyes! Scary stuff y&#x27;all!! I pretty much evaluated/tested my skin for every other factor the rashes could be from, but I could not find any indicator of it being anything else .... I am throwing this product away....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or maybe I&#x27;ll just unscrew the lid and use it as a dehumidifier in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I have had oily skin and acne problems my whole life.  After going to many dermatologists and trying tons of different things (both over the counter and prescription) I went on acutane for a year in High School.  That did help, for a while.  Now that I am an adult (I think it had something to do with after my pregnancy), my acne has started flaring up again and the oil came back just like before the acutane.  So I was so frustrated after trying even more expensive cleansers and creams and medicines that all promised to help.  Nothing worked and I was thinking I&#x27;d have to go on acutane for a second round as an adult (I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s).  Then I saw some reviews on this stuff and thought that it was worth a try.  It is way cheaper than all of the other stuff I&#x27;ve tried, so I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was blown away by the results!  I have NEVER had a product do this to my skin.  It takes away all of the excess oil and dries out all the acne, leaving my skin wonderful feeling and clear.  I have a routine now where I use it about once a week, maybe twice during a stressful week, and it has been awesome.  I just cannot believe it took me 30 years to find this stuff and that after all the expensive &amp;#34;scientific&amp;#34; stuff, it was ancient aztec clay that worked!  Go figure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely pulls out any oil you have in your skin, so if you have dry skin or combination skin, I am not sure if this would be the best for you.  Afterward my skin feels dry, but I love that feeling because it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve never felt before!  But I could see how if your skin was dry to start with, it might be a problem.  All I know is that if you have oily skin, this will be PERFECT for you!  Buy it and have it shipped expedited to you because this stuff with change your life ;)</li>
            <li> I applied this after mixing it with just water. I haven&#x27;t tried it with the apple cider vinegar yet but it formed a hard mask that pulled my skin and was a bit itchy towards the end of it. I literally could not moved my face muscles, and if I tried it would&#x27;ve probably very uncomfortably cracked the mask. I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash my face off but when I did, my poors were noticeable smaller and my skin still felt just as tight as when the mask was on, but with normal muscular mobility.</li>
            <li> I really, really enjoyed this face mask. I mixed it up with ACV and after using it I felt like my face looked so much nicer! I&#x27;ll definitely be making a habit of using it, and would buy from this seller again. I made way too much mask the first time, and it hardly made a dent in the tub of clay so that&#x27;s nice as well.</li>
            <li> Great Product exactly as described</li>
            <li> I am 38 years old woman I try practive and many more acne product I use this one for 2 weeks and I am so happy</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my teenage daughter having long time acne problems. We mixed it with apple cider vinegar and left it on for 15 minutes. After the first application her face was definitely smoother and the days following I noticed the acne problem was clearing up a bit. Tonight is the second application and after we applied to her face there was plenty left in the bowl so I decided to try it out myself. I left it on 10 minutes then washed it off....my face is baby smooth...I LOVE IT! Honestly I&#x27;m very impressed and will make this part of my weekly skin routine. I would highly recommend it. If you&#x27;re wondering how many applications is in the jar, I&#x27;d say at least 20 as I only use 2-3 teaspoons and that was plenty for the both of us.</li>
            <li> Love this item for regular masking!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Pulls so tightly that after rinsing my skin thinks it&#x27;s a teenager again. I just stand the smell of it after mixing with  Bragg&#x27;s apple cider vinegar because I know the results will be more than worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; when I get bad acne and the acne spots  disappear after applying this mask</li>
            <li> Tried it and felt the difference in how my face felt on a very first time! Amazing facial!!Mix it with apple cider vinegar  (not water)to get the desired results! Will be buying more for presents to family and friends</li>
            <li> I have very bad cyclic acne. Every week or two I use 1tsp clay with 1tsp vinegar or lemon juice. This really is a miracle product. I haven&#x27;t found many other products that work as well.</li>
            <li> Unlike many people on here, I did not receive this for free in exchange for a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+&lt;br /&gt;+Easy to mix and store for later&lt;br /&gt;+No offensive smell&lt;br /&gt;+No serious skin irritation&lt;br /&gt;+Lasts a long time and is inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;+It&#x27;s pampering and maybe I notice slightly brighter skin...honestly, I notice no difference except a fresh feeling and for that day my nose is not as oily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;-Does nothing significant for my skin (I get ugly pimples sometimes and have oily skin all the time and this did nothing to improve either)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s best to whip fresh batches a day before using so you can stir out the clumps and make a smooth paste the day of use.&lt;br /&gt;**A high quality paper towel over the drain to avoid clogging.&lt;br /&gt;***Add an oil to the mixture if it&#x27;s overdrying or too hard to take off.&lt;br /&gt;****Wet entire face with a hot rag (just hold it there for a few seconds and gently press down) before removal to loosen the clay and a warm, wet rag makes it easier (and potentially messier) to remove the clay. Shower makes it easier too but harder to control the caking of clay in the drain</li>
            <li> I love it, definetly tightens skin. Can feel a little burning sensation sometimes when I use, but not always. I just rinse right away when it burns, doesn&#x27;t leave a mark, nor lasting pain. I have oily skin, for at least a few hours aftyer using this I am dry and clear.</li>
            <li> Worked a whole lot better once I started using it with apple cider vinegar instead of water.</li>
            <li> i was hoping for this t do wonder since evryone says is great and is a dupe for glam glow but it really didn&#x27;t do much for me. but i do recoment for you to use small amounts since it will be a lot for your face and also using a moisturizer after you take it off since it can be drying for your face i will also recommend using the pose strips after the mask since it pull out some stuff</li>
            <li> Wish this stuff wasn&#x27;t so messy but otherwise I like the product. It&#x27;s not something I use every night just because it&#x27;s pretty time-consuming but when I have the time and when I feel my skin needs it I will definitely pull it out and use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I like to mix mine with apple cider vinegar. It does Dry up pretty quickly on your face and it can be messy taking it off. When it&#x27;s ready to take off I like to take a bigger bowl and fill it with warm water and then grab a rag and slowly take off the mask I let everything fall into the bowl and make sure you dump it outside and not down your drain. The powder will turn into Clay and clog up your drain so beware !</li>
            <li> I bought this product simply because nearly every single review was stellar. Nearly every comment was a success story. I&#x27;ve suffered from acne for as long as I can remember. Thankfully, I don&#x27;t get pimples anymore. I only had blackheads on my nose, whiteheads on my chin &amp; few dark spots here and there. For some reason, every time I use this damn mask I break out. It&#x27;s so upsetting because I wanted this product for so long and I had the highest hopes. I&#x27;ve had it for nearly a month and continued using it because I thought, hey, maybe it&#x27;s just lifting all the bad stuff and cleansing blah blah blah but no. Every single time I use this I wake up with a bunch of tiny itchy pimples, not like anything I&#x27;ve ever had before. It&#x27;s weird. And if I stop use and just use my normal soap, my face clears. I&#x27;m currently wearing the mask just because I&#x27;m insanely desperate. But if I wake up with no result I will stop using.</li>
            <li> Way too harsh for tender skin.  And, all face skin is tender.</li>
            <li> Love this product! My face feels smooth and rejuvenated after. I&#x27;ll admit though, my mixtures come out a bit lumpy sometimes so I have to use my hands to smooth them out. I&#x27;m practicing on making the perfect smooth concoction. It&#x27;s not a cure-all so don&#x27;t purchase it believing it&#x27;s going to &amp;#34;erase&amp;#34; whatever you want it to. It will help but not completely erase</li>
            <li> I received the Indian Healing Clay 4 days ago.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  I&#x27;ve used it twice mixing it once with water, and once with the Apple Cider Vinegar.  Loved it more with the vinegar.  It refined my pores and took away alot of the excess oil I have.  What I really love, is it that it didnt dry my face out like alot of cleansers and masks I have tried.  Plus No irritation.  I would definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> This is my first review because it deserves one! This stuff is awesome! I mixed it with the recommended all natural apple cider vinegar, applied it, and let it on until dry. Maybe 25-30mins. I soaked it off in the shower. My skin was pretty red afterwards for about 30 mins. My skin was sooooo soft! The real shocker was when I applied my make up. My face looked flawless. My pores were greatly reduced and my skin was glowing! And I noticed my face didn&#x27;t get shiny throughout the day like it used to! Knowing how this product works now, I would pay much more for it! The price is amazing! I can&#x27;t say enough about it! I will always have this product as part of my skincare! Try it!</li>
            <li> Messy..other products available that do just as well but don&#x27;t leave your towels grey.</li>
            <li> it was not what i expected it is a powder and it gets to messy</li>
            <li> this stuff sucks my butt. it did nothing for my skin? all it did was get everywhere! this powder substance is so messy!</li>
            <li> I had a MilD staph infection on my face and this got rid  of it with one mask application! Plus they give you a God awful Amount which  is awesome</li>
            <li> Great face mask. Does what it is supposed to do and does not irritate my sensitive yet oily, acne-prone skin. I think it has actually helped my acne. It&#x27;s a little annoying to take off your face, (because it&#x27;s literally mud that dries) but I found re-wetting my face with just water and using a wet wash cloth worked fine. The smell is also super annoying because you are using vinegar on your face, but I didn&#x27;t buy this to smell nice. I bought it to work and it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a mini plastic ziploc bag to grab the dirt (about a tablespoon) and mix it with the apple cider vinegar (enough to just get it wet). I use one hand to apply it so I will have a clean hand to turn on the faucet and wash my hands after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have acne, I HIGHLY recommend this product. But honestly I think it works well on any skin type. I&#x27;ve used it for over a month now an plan to continue. I started of using it every day, but now I use it twice a week. It&#x27;s cheap, so just buy it and try it for yourself. You&#x27;ve got nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> I use this at least once a week and it&#x27;s been the only thing to help reduce the random breakouts I get. I mix half water and half apple cider vinegar (you&#x27;ll get used to the smell) and a little goes a long way. I use much less than the directions say to use so there&#x27;s much less waste. I normally leave it on for 10-15 minutes (until it&#x27;s mostly dry and you feel a mild pulling sensation). I&#x27;ve left it longer but won&#x27;t do it again since it left my face a little red for a few hours. Using this along with an oil cleanser has been magic for my skin!</li>
            <li> You feel it working and it&#x27;s pulsating lay great :)</li>
            <li> I am an esthetician and I have oily skin, prone to breakouts and I cannot believe I have not found this product sooner. I love that the recipe requires to mix it with raw apple cider vinegar. I found the first time I made way too much and made it far too thick. Next time around I used MAYBE a teaspoon of the clay and of the ACV and it was plenty, a thin mask made it pulse and tighten like the label describes.  I HIGHLY reccommend this for anyone with oily/acne prone skin or any one with aging skin that wants to feel tight and firm. Overall a great simple product!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok,not easy to remove after use. you have to wash it . and it is a little hard to mix the powder everagely.for the effection,it is ok,not good but not bad. so so.</li>
            <li> This stuff has done wonders for my face. After reading all the reviews I had to try it for myself and my god does it work. I suffer from mild acne and I have extremely oily skin. After just one use, I noticed a difference. The first time I used it was before I went to sleep. The next morning I go into work and my boss is like &amp;#34;Did you shave really good this morning?&amp;#34; I&#x27;m like &amp;#34;no&amp;#34; so he&#x27;s says &amp;#34;you got a haircut&amp;#34; me &amp;#34;nope&amp;#34; my boss &amp;#34;are you wearing make up?&amp;#34; (I&#x27;m a guy) so of course I say no but the point is after just one use he noticed a difference in my face. Of course he sees me almost everyday so he knows what I normally look like but now after a few weeks of using it maybe every 3 or 4 days along with my usual acne facial wash my face is looking great. Use this stuff maybe an hour or so before you go to bed and the next morning after you wash your face you will look like a million bucks. After several uses you will look like a billion bucks. It does get messy and you have to lay it on thick but I don&#x27;t even care. The end result is worth so much more than messiness. Try it now. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> It really made my face red and kind dried it out. I know that it&#x27;s normal for your face to turn red after taking off the mask but I believe that its harsh on my skin since i have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This feels awesome on your face! It&#x27;s easy to mix up when you use apple cider vinegar and no lumps form. It tingles when you first apply it and dries quickly in about 15 minutes! You can see stuff coming right out of your pores! After I washed it off, I applied Thayer&#x27;s rose witch hazel as a toner and Trader Joe&#x27;s antioxidant oil-free moisturizer and my skin felt amazingly soft and clean! I would highly recommend this product and it&#x27;s fun to use with friends!</li>
            <li> This really does work!</li>
            <li> omg love this in connection with this raw honey, vitamin c serum and rose water toner i am acne free ..in like forever  im soooo happy will be buying this product again</li>
            <li> It may be the way I am using this product but i really did not like it. i first mixed it with water, but it did not blend well and when i applied it to my face, it made my face super itchy, i couldn&#x27;t stand it so i rinsed it off right away. Then i mixed it with apple cider vinegar, much more smooth consistency but it still made my face itch, i decided to tough it out this time though and leave it on my face for an entire 15 mins, i fanned my face with a piece of paper to relieve the uncomfortable itching sensation. i tried once more, thinking maybe it was just that one time, but once again my face was itching, it wasn&#x27;t a pulsating sensation it was an extreme itching. i seem to be the only one who&#x27;s experienced this according to all the other reviews. Nevertheless, it is still sitting in my room collecting dust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  i tried using it as a hair clarifying masks as many other naturals do, it worked well, but i&#x27;m too lazy to keep up with it so i&#x27;ll just stick to co-washing.</li>
            <li> Great stuff and seller!</li>
            <li> Shipping was really quick. I used it for the first time last night and my face felt nice afterwards</li>
            <li> I had acne since I was 15 ( I am 27 ) and I can tell it does halp a little bit ! Love the suction feeling and pores seem to be smaller after just a few uses.I will definetly give it a try for a longterm .</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders! I used it for the first time and it does make your skin very red and causes some burning after you take off the mask, but that goes away after a few hours. My skin looked smoother and brighter after one use! It was also less greasy for a few days, which is nice!&lt;br /&gt;However, when you mix it, DO NOT USE ANY METAL TOOLS. Metal makes the clay clump up and makes it hard to apply to your face. Many people as well as myself recommend that you use an old make up brush or shaving brush to mix and apply the mask. This makes thing 10x easier as you don&#x27;t have to get your hands all muddy.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I would not recommend washing this off in the shower or rinsing it down the sink. I&#x27;m afraid this stuff will clog my pipes as it&#x27;s VERY thick. so, watch out for that.</li>
            <li> I use this every Sunday. Even got my husband to use it with me. We both really like it and you can&#x27;t beat the price. This will last a long time. I prefer to use ACV with this rather than water. I can&#x27;t last the whole time till it gets dry but I last about 15-20 minutes. My skin really likes this product. I have sensitive skin and so that&#x27;s saying something. Don&#x27;t be scared if you look like you got a sunburn after using this. It fades.</li>
            <li> Day 1 seems to be very good</li>
            <li> I love how immediate the results are with this product. After my first use, I noticed the effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it reduces the appearance and severity of existing acne. When I get a pimple, I use this product. When I take the clay mask off, the pimple is noticeably reduced in size -- and therefore much less noticeable. If the pimple is small, then when the mask comes off it might not be noticeable at all, which is great. That&#x27;s a difference in less than an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it reduces the size of pores. I thought they looked smaller after the first use, but it was so slight that I wasn&#x27;t completely sure. I used it every other day at first, and after three uses (about a week,) it was much more noticeable that my pores were smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, it makes my skin look healthier. \\&quot;Radiant\\&quot; is the buzzword here. When I first take the mask off, my skin is initially very red. I pat my skin dry and immediately moisturize. In about 30 minutes or less, my skin looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it&#x27;s a bit of a hassle to use. It takes preparation. It needs to be left on for a while, and I leave it on for about an hour -- although you can probably take it off after 20 minutes or so, and you can do other things in the meantime. When it dries, it might start crumbling on things. It&#x27;s not easy to wash off and that takes more time. I&#x27;m not the type of person who wants to spend a lot of time on my appearance, so I don&#x27;t use this nearly as much as I probably should to fully benefit from it. I&#x27;ve occasionally used it several days in a row, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any bad effects on my skin, (quite the opposite, it&#x27;s great for my skin,) so I think it&#x27;s safe to use daily if you&#x27;d like to. But I don&#x27;t always have the patience for or interest in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product by mixing it with Bragg&#x27;s raw unfiltered apple cider vinegar, which I picked up at Whole Foods where I also bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin doesn&#x27;t always respond well to products, but I&#x27;ve had no problems with this. I have dry skin and eczema, and I&#x27;ve had terrible reactions to some makeup products. So I&#x27;m hesitant to try new things on my skin, especially on my face. This is very much worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full five stars for this great product. Although it&#x27;s not the most convenient product to use, it&#x27;s fully worth it.t I&#x27;ve had no problems with this.

            <li> I mix this with a little apple cider vinegar and apply it as directed 1-2 times every 3 weeks. Leaves my skin soft, clean, and supple!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. WILL DEFINITLEY BE A RETURN CUSTOMER</li>
            <li> Being amazed every time I&#x27;ve used this! On my African American acne prone and oily/combination skin has worked wonders.Love how much my pores have reduced,my blackheads are all but gone and I&#x27;ve not glad a single white head. Highly recommend using the Apple cider vinegar, the smell isn&#x27;t strong once mixed,you&#x27;ll see better results!</li>
            <li> This is amazing; the feeling is incredible. I would do the mask every day if I had the time. Working out always clogs my pores, but this mask, when mixed with vinegar &amp; lemon juice, ah-mazing!</li>
            <li> After about 2 months of using it, it did not do much for me. My pores are bigger than ever and I still break out and have oily skin. Just didnt help my c ombination skin type. :( I really wanted it to work for me but it just didnt. :(</li>
            <li> I think I would leave the word &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; out of the product name.  The only part of the product use description that was true is that it certainly made my face red--like I had a bad sunburn--for about a half hour afterward... then after the red faded away, my fact didn&#x27;t look any  different, though it felt very dry, even using a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Once a week my daughter in law and I use this with raw apple cider vinegar.  We&#x27;ve both seen improvement to our skins texture and pore size has diminished!</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t awful, but it isn&#x27;t perfect either and I&#x27;m always wishing it was super clear especially since I&#x27;m not longer in my teens. This is seriously *THE* best product I have ever bought. Like I said my skin isn&#x27;t awful but I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv, a bunch of Nuetrogena &amp; Clearisil products, Garnier, any of the big name brands out their I&#x27;ve tried, and they&#x27;ve either made my skin worse or done nothing for it. But this is great!!! My skin started looking a lot clearer after only a week and now 3 weeks later it&#x27;s great! I still will get the odd pimple but my overall complexion is amazing, so pairing this with an acne spot treatment will give me the skin I&#x27;ve always wanted! Like other people said it does clog drains so be careful (I keep a plastic bag or bowl under my face when I&#x27;m rinsing it off) and making a certain amount and storing it in a plastic bag to take out from later is a great idea!</li>
            <li> This mask is so great! I have used tons of facial masks and this is by far my favorite! I recommend mixing it with Braggs Apple Cider Vinegar to apply. I follow with Young Living Tea Tree Oil to soothe!</li>
            <li> This mask does wonders! It burns a little, and if you have sensitive skin I would reconsider finding something less harsh. My skin is always left feeling super soft and clean. I use apple cider vinegar but you could also use water. It is a bit messy to clean up but worth it.</li>
            <li> go youtube and search for this product, there are many videos shown how to do the mask.  dont forget to use lotion before apply mask on your face, and use Apple cilvid vinegar to mix the clay.</li>
            <li> So far I like this product. Brings everything to surface, purges skin, but I feel that with continuous use I will get my skin where I want it.</li>
            <li> After several days of scratching mosquito bites, I bought and used this product specifically to stop this aggravation. I had previously tried other natural remedies but this is the only product that helped stop the itchy feeling and heal the mosquito bites. Note: there may be other clay powders like this that may work just as well too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is how I prepared and used this product: I mixed this powdered clay with water (I didn&#x27;t have the recommended apple cider vinegar on hand); I stirred it into a thin non-clumpy paste the consistency of more like almost-mayonnaise; and then I layered each bite and the surrounding red colored skin with a creamy, lotion-like thin coat. Then I left it on -- I did not wash it off. Within a couple of hours the color of each bite turned from bright red to a pink color, and the feeling of itchiness completely went away.  I did feel a little bit of itchiness later on with some bites, because the paste wore off. When this happened, I went back to my already prepared lotion-like paste and coated the bites again. This stopped the feeling of itchiness once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received a new mosquito bite -- as soon as I could -- I immediately coated it with a thin layer of this lotion paste too. This bite did feel a bit itchy, only sometimes, even with the paste on it, but instead of feeling like I needed to intensely scratch it, like I did the older bites, this one began to heal faster.  This lotion paste helped heal this bite faster than the other bites because I used this product immediately on it. And as a result, I hardly felt the need to scratch it - therefore I damaged my skin less. In the other words, the toxins of the mosquito bite were neutralized by immediately using this clay, and as a result this helped heal this mosquito bite faster than the previously untreated or clayless bites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also gave my reluctant spouse a thin lotion-like layer facial with this same product. The next day, he said he could still feel the positive results of having this clay sit on his oily skin for 20 minutes. He said \\&quot;Its a plus.\\&quot; Personally, my skin is dry and does not benefit from using this product as a facial often. However, I can imagine using this powdered clay in other ways. For instance, when my dogs get flea bites; and I even added a container of this clay and another bottle of water and a plastic stirring bowl with a lid  to a medical travel kit for the car. This may come in handy for bee stings and other insect bites, and nettle stings and other similar skin irritations that can happen further away from home base - where I am keeping a supply of this clay in stock.feel the positive results of having this clay sit on his oily skin for 20 minutes.

            <li> This clay makes a great mask for oily skin. And it doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg. I mix a tablespoon of this powdered clay with apple cider vinegar. It foams up a bit (I guess the clay is alkaline in pH.) Then I smear it on my face and let it dry. It washes off easily enough with warm water and a clean washcloth. You can even add a drop of tea tree oil (if it doesn&#x27;t irritate you) for more anti-bacterial effect. You can make this up to the consistency you desire; I like it about the consistency of heavy cream, but if you like thinner or thicker, add more or less vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has other uses--some people make poultices out of the clay to sooth sprains or bruises. (No broken skin, please.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned how to make this as a facial from an aesthetician. This was her first step in doing a facial. Afterwards, you can put a few drops of pure lavender essential oil on a warm damp washcloth and use as a compress. This makes a quick, effective facial and is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This is truly one of the best kept, simplest beauty tricks out there.  Had great results with this, Though the instructions recommend equal parts ACV to clay, i prefere to add some more moisture to make it easier to spread.</li>
            <li> did you know the radiation in california is huge from fukushima?&lt;br /&gt;did you know this clay sucks up radiation? thats its job.&lt;br /&gt;and then you put it on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just some thoughts....... anyways im sure its nothing to worry about.</li>
            <li> Product worked as stated. I mixed with apple cider vinegar. Definitely gave me a deep clean but my face didn&#x27;t seem dry.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a cream but it&#x27;s actually a powder you mix with water to make like a mud mask. It&#x27;s works well. I&#x27;ve used it twice and afterwards my face feels fresh and I actually feel more awaken almost like i drank a cup of coffee. Weird right. Maybe that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for ANY household. It keeps your skin looking fresh and flawless. It is also very helpful for bee stings, slivers, or hard to poke pimples- make a thick paste and leave it on overnight, by morning it will have removed the nasty. I would pay 10 times more for this great product, but thankfully it is super cheap!</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;- leaves skin feeling and looking great&lt;br /&gt;- does seem to improve texture and blackheads&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons (even with the cons it is worth it to me)&lt;br /&gt;-messy!&lt;br /&gt;- washing off is hard because it is real mud</li>
            <li> I got this for detox and cleansing but its so messy its hard to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still I have made up a paste with water and a little plain yogurt (be careful, the powder is fine and can fly all over), for an excellent drawing facial mask, I have applied to my body in the shower as a &#x27;mud bath&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice and light, its a sizable amount, and the clay has purported detoxifying properties (pulls heavy metals and pollutants).</li>
            <li> all you have to do is mix a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and a small amount of clay mixed to a thin paste... dab it on and take a nap, or go to sleep... i noticed it works well with a thin layer just as good a a thick one. No need to dirty your sink with clay and it comes off easily when placed on thin... i just use warm water and a face cloth... then i apply my favorite cream or honey... nothing better than a beautiful complexion... and im a senior male...&lt;br /&gt;good luck ... it sure worked wonders for my dry aged skin... :)</li>
            <li> i am a Chinese, my skin had been dry since i came america. but after using this item, i feel better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pure bentonite clay. You can find it cheaper in bulk at your local health food store.</li>
            <li> Although I just used it once so far, I really liked the result. My skin feels smooth and clean. Had a little redness after removing it, however it disappeared in a few hours.</li>
            <li> Works just like it said it would.</li>
            <li> Do not like product. Had no idea I would receive a container full of fine dust. It does not mix when following the instructions and leaves a mess everywhere.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. I read the label and use vinegar with it and it does make it a lot stronger. I have to say that it is the best I have ever used by far and lasts a long time</li>
            <li> This really dries out my skin, but I guess that&#x27;s what most masks do. I like it less than the mint julep masks, but if you&#x27;re looking for more pulsating masks, use this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times. I get the occasional breakout and since using this once a week I have had not a breakout except just one little itty bitty pimple. Which is great, and I attribute it to this cleanser. I&#x27;ve used this 2 different ways, one with just mixing in a bowl and applying with my fingers. I do not recommend this method. It&#x27;s messy and I don&#x27;t feel it goes on as well. I took another reviewers suggestion and mix it in a baggy and turn the baggy inside out and apply with the baggy. I feel this method is so much easier and less messy and I get the application I think it needed. Be sure to moisturize after using it because your face will be very dry afterward but I really like this product. Glad amazon recommended with another purchase I was making!</li>
            <li> I did my first mask today.  I read a whole lot of reviews regarding this mask and was really excited to use it.  I can&#x27;t say I have problem skin, I&#x27;m a black woman, 50 -carmel complexion and have taken really good care of my skin, and I guess good genes are a factor too.  I mainly purchased this for my enlarged pores--they&#x27;re not craters but they could use some shrinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I mixed it up and applied.  The funny part about this mask to me is the drying process.  I was sitting partially in front of a fan on my bed, and kept waiting for the pulsating everyone was talking about.  Well, it didn&#x27;t happen right away.  But as it dried more, I feel it sucking my face, and I sat there laughing inside (my face was too tight to crack a smile) because I had a picture of a vacuum sucking the air out of a space bag) when I looked in the mirror I was like \\&quot;who is that?\\&quot; that my face almost looked distorted after it dried. .it was hilarious to me!  While rinsing it off my face felt SO soft.  I immediately patted my face dry (I have a whole arsenal of oils I use on my skin--olive, pomegranate, rosehip seed oil, grapeseed oil, coconut oil) but I decided to use the grapeseed oil when I finished, and my face was just a little red. Ok so I thought my skin looked brighter, I looked at my pores and thought ok, they look a little smaller.  But a few hours later, I took a shower (washed my face in the shower) and when I got out. .that&#x27;s when I could really tell the difference.  Seriously, I was sitting here looking at my skin the mirror for a while and thought \\&quot;time to write my review!\\&quot; I can tell you this is my new favorite and a must have -- I&#x27;m so impressed.  I think I could be a salesperson for this product, it&#x27;s the blue ribbon baby of facial masks, and I&#x27;ve used quite a few!</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this product, especially since it is all natural. Another well known product has this same ingredient, but it also has a lot of other &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; that would always make my eyes burn.  Definitely mix with natural vinegar; it works much better than water.</li>
            <li> This stuff works some magic on your skin. Just don&#x27;t leave it on too long or it starts to get reallyyyyy itchy. My pores are noticeably smaller after using this and this has really helped my acne out. I&#x27;ve been using it 3x a week for a month now and I can say there is a big difference in my skin. Right after wiping it off your skin feels incredibly smooth too.</li>
            <li> Not really sure why everyone loves this stuff. It doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my skin but slightly decrease a pimple and make my skin soft. I&#x27;m still trying to give it a try. Maybe I will use it for other things.</li>
            <li> Love the way this product works! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like what everyone else has been saying. This is a great budget mask that delivers high end results. I have horrible persistent acne (I&#x27;m in my late twenties), and I&#x27;ve been doing this mask about twice a week, mixed with apple cider vinegar. I definitely notice a difference in the amount of breakouts and how my scars are healing. The biggest draw for me though is honestly just the value. It&#x27;s such a great price, and it really does work well. When you take into account a tube of something fancy at sephora will run you close to $40, there&#x27;s really no contest. And really, I think this might still work better!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed to find out the clay needs to be mixed with vinegar and water.</li>
            <li> Like all other reviews. Used countless other stuff that did work much.&lt;br /&gt;1. Visited dermatologist(s) who gave suppressants but not cure or remedy.&lt;br /&gt;2. Had moderate acne all over face and back.&lt;br /&gt;3. This DID WORK. Used it twice or thrice a week. Clear and smoother skin. Lighter marks. And prevents more acne. It is actually a REMEDY than cure.&lt;br /&gt;4. Took it for my mother as well. She also opines the same. Her skin is more fresh and glowing according to her.&lt;br /&gt;5. Thanks to fellow reviewers for introducing this to me.&lt;br /&gt;6. Skin get dry.&lt;br /&gt;7. I used this with apple vinegar as well as other suggested.But am more fine with just water.&lt;br /&gt;8. U&#x27;ll find easier way to apply as u get accustomed to it.</li>
            <li> update 10/5/2014&lt;br /&gt;This is my skin regimen now:&lt;br /&gt;daily:&lt;br /&gt;- take off makeup with boscia makeup breakup oil, it washes off with water&lt;br /&gt;- wash face with philosophy purity cleansing soap&lt;br /&gt;- wash face gently with sulfur soap (I think my face likes to be very clean, but gently)&lt;br /&gt;-&gt;&gt;weekly: wash face with olay pro-x brush + exfoliating creme (right now I&#x27;m using korres rose scrub)&lt;br /&gt;-&gt;&gt;weekly:  aztec indian clay mask, 1 tbsp clay + 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar is enough for me&lt;br /&gt;- wipe face gently with cotton ball and well soaked thayer&#x27;s witch hazel rose toner&lt;br /&gt;- put on moisturizer: Dior hydra life creme sorbet&lt;br /&gt;- do a spot treatment with sulfur ointment (FYI ,sulfur ointment works GREAT for ingrown hairs in your bikini area)&lt;br /&gt;This has helped my face clear up greatly, plus no more peeling skin.&lt;br /&gt;hope this helps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best face mask I&#x27;ve ever used. I wear it for 30min and wash it off. I&#x27;m scared it&#x27;ll clog my drains so I rinse into a wash bucket, but I&#x27;ve read if you&#x27;re just doing it once a week it should be ok. Immediately after I took off the mask, I noticed the black heads on my nose were better. So I&#x27;m going to try maybe a nightly mini mask for my nose. Great value.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best product I have ever used for acne.</li>
            <li> I just add water and put it on, not with the other stuff.&lt;br /&gt;*makes skin glow-you definitely will feel a fresh, clean face with a glow.&lt;br /&gt;*prevents major breakouts&lt;br /&gt;*prevents any pimples&lt;br /&gt;*helps pimples go away after continuous use</li>
            <li> I suppose I should have researched this product a little more, but there was nothing in the description or reviews that led me to believe it would be such a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;First off, this is a POWDER THAT MUST BE MIXED, not a ready-to-use product.  I knew that from the beginning, but had no idea what a pain it would be to mix.&lt;br /&gt;Second:  The directions say, &amp;#34;Mix Clay with equal parts of raw apple cider vinegar and/or water. Use a non-metal bowl and utensil. Stir the mixture well to a smooth paste.&amp;#34;  I realize I am no great engineer, but I&#x27;m no stranger to mixing materials (modeling clays, paints, etc.), and I have yet to get a &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; batch of this stuff mixed.  It is time-consuming (another reviewer said to place the water and powder in a plastic baggie and knead it until smooth... which may work for them, but I have arthritis in my hands and they give out long before the mixture is smooth enough to be usable).  Short of using a blender, I am not sure it can be mixed to a smooth, consistent, spreadable texture.&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I didn&#x27;t find it to be any better for producing &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34; skin (and I certainly didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel [my] face pulsate!&amp;#34; when I used it) than the clay masque products by Queen Helene or St. Ives I can buy for about the same price off the shelf at local stores.</li>
            <li> This is another gift I purchased for my sister, I myself have used it with great success, the only thing is it must be mixed with apple cider vinegar!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Would have given 5 stars but the smell is awful lol that&#x27;s really because of the apple cider vinegar though.</li>
            <li> I enjoy putting this on my face and scaring my roommates. It&#x27;s very effective, they don&#x27;t even talk to me anymore.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for over a year and it is truly powerful. I have acne prone and oily skin. So I have alot of black and white heads and pimples and when I do this mask with the apple cider vinegar and feel it pulsate I know its doing its job.  When I was ot off I like to moisture right away. This really helps to clear up my skin alot! So glad I got it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rave enough about this stuff! Nothing has helped my blackhead issue as much as this clay. I recommend it to everyone. Side note- I love the way it tightens and makes my face pulsate. It makes me feel like it&#x27;s actually working.</li>
            <li> Created a DIY mask recipe from Pinterest with one application I’ve had at least five strangers tell me how great my skin looks ands too many friends to count have commented as well.&lt;br /&gt;I have nice skin (from what I’m told) but since using this product the compliments have been rolling in and I know it’s the clay! I think this product will last way longer than the 18 months on the use by date &amp; a great value. I really like that it’s a natural product and can help me limit the chemicals that I use to fight the signs of aging.</li>
            <li> Only used it two times. So far so good.</li>
            <li> this stuff litterally pulled the stuff out of my pores the first time i used it. i have tried a lot of things but i have never taken it off and saw stuff purging like that. now i have only had it for a week, and i still have some clogged pores. id say you should exfoliate after you use this stuff, and it will get worse before it gets better. i was skeptical but its not that expensive considering the money i have spent on many products that didnt work so i gave it a shot. i really am happy with it, but its not a miracle worker. it just really did help get this stuff out of my pores. i wish my face was bright and smooth but it has only been a week. besides i have been looking my worst with it all popping out of my face. i pulled through it though and its starting to clear out. id buy this again and agian. i need to find something that will finish the job and get everything soft smooth and bright! as far as masks go, the best one i have ever used. a lot of products out there that dont work at all.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it, but I think it is good</li>
            <li> This is good stuff. Took all the blackheads off my nose and tightened my pores</li>
            <li> This deep pore cleansing mask works wonders. It&#x27;s very easy to use and my skin feels soft, tight, and gives me a healthy glow and my pores are smaller than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My method is very simple. I add 2-3 tbsp. full of Aztec Clay &amp; add 2-3 tbsp of Bragg Organic Apple Cider Vinegar (also purchased from Amazon), mix together well (I purchased the Rosallini 4-In-1 bowl mixing tool set from Amazon/plastic) and apply to your face generously, wait 10-15 minutes, wash off and reap the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO TIP: I have a couple tips to share. DO NOT wash off this mask in your sink, you will clog your drain. I put a plastic bag in my sink when I use this mask. I open the bag up wide and I lightly scrape off what I can, most of it cracks and falls off into the bag, what doesn&#x27;t I lightly scrape off with the handle of one of my paint brush tools that comes with the 4-In-1 tool set. After most of it has come off my face I take my Olay cleansing brush, add a small amount of water, and slowly remove the rest of the mask, then I wrap up the plastic bag, throw it away and nothing has clogged my drain. I then rinse my face with warm water just to remove any residue that was left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks radiant and healthy, what more could a girl ask for? I give this product 5 Stars &amp; I recommend you try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to try to prevent the breakout I get once ever month &amp; to clear some of the dark marks I have from previous pimples I have popped. I also have very dry skin &amp; wanted something to try to even it out as even lotion does help the dry skin on my face. I mixed this powder with apple cider vinegar &amp; applied it with a Popsicle stick. I let it dry completely then washed it off in the shower. I  noticed my skin got a little less oily but I still got the same breakout as usual and I didnt notice my dark marks diminishing. Even after I tried it agian after 2 weeks. I have seen suggestions online to mix in avocado or honey &amp; apply &amp; that will help prevent dryness. I did feel like I was being pampered at the spa while waiting for it to dry</li>
            <li> Best facial mask I&#x27;ve ever used! And I&#x27;ve used tons of different one. The next 1-2 days after using it is when I saw the best results</li>
            <li> i just use it today and I feel so good I can tell this product will be good to make my face look :)</li>
            <li> Amazing! Has turned my skin health into what I wanted!</li>
            <li> this is an amazing product...seriously!! it&#x27;s like a peeling that absorbs dirty, oil..and you get a wonderful skin after this! you have to try this mask is cheap. effective and natural. why you have to spend  your money in expensive products??? love love this mask!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for my teen with acne issues, but it is something we have to do on a regular basis</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also fantastic as a spot treatment.  I mix up a tiny batch in the palm of my hand when I have just a few isolated pimples or areas that need some help.  I mix the clay with a couple of drips of Braggs ACV, or even just plain water.  I then take my index finger of the other hand and &amp;#34;tap&amp;#34; the clay mixture onto the trouble spots.  I just did this for a cystic pimple that was on my cheek.  I let it stay on overnight; today, it is gone.</li>
            <li> Although i don&#x27;t use it everyday like i should, i really enjoy the deep cleansing treatment of this product.  everytime i do use it, my skin feels so much softer and much cleaner than an already made clay mask.</li>
            <li> This will change your life.  I got it for the acne/blackhead benefits.. Turns out it is a serious heavy metal detox in the body.  I can&#x27;t recommend this enough!!</li>
            <li> I used this for two weeks, 5 days a week and was left on for 15-20 minutes, I used apple cider vinegar to create the mixture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff worked miracles for the first two weeks, the zits I would get on my forehead throughout the day were completely eliminated; and I have tried everything to get rid of them in the past, literally everything. All my scars on my face are practically gone and my skin is defiantly more evenly toned. Before using this I would even get white heads throughout the day, so I would have to constantly check my face each time I would use the bathroom to see if there was a disgusting puss filled zit on my face I needed to pop &amp;#34;Yes, I would pop a zit if it was a white head its just to gross to leave it on your face so I pop them&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, all was great being acne free but now for the past 3 days all around my mouth I have been breaking out really-really bad, I honestly have counted 15! bad zits -- some cystic just around my mouth in clusters but nowhere else on my face. This has to be caused by this face-mask since I hardly ever got zits around my mouth before and I never had more then like 5 zits at once. And yes, I have ruled out that it is not food related or another topical product causing it. So this is quite unusual for me, I would love if people reading this have had any similar situations, if so please comment on this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using this to see if my results change and I&#x27;ll post an update.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well without drying my skin out and i like how smooth it is after i use it</li>
            <li> Wonder clay! Hooked on it and I tell everyone I know about it. Price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> Seems to be clearing up my acne it&#x27;s not gonna happen over night you&#x27;ll need to use it everyday it says to only use once per week but if you have bad acne use it daily please note yes it will brake you out but that&#x27;s because you are clearing out all the junk this stuff works pretty great just remember it&#x27;s gotta get worse before it gets better ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My results seems to clear up everything it broke out the night before and brings out new ones that have been small bottom line this stuff works just stick with it !!! Also recommend getting a lotion that has nice herbs in it</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful for someone with acne issues. I mix it with Organic Apple Cider Vinegar, it smells terrible but boy does this really kill zits. You use it once and it will tighten you skin and dry out your acne. I can&#x27;t use it too much because it really does dry your skin but if I am breaking out bad this is the answer. I love this very much.</li>
            <li> Sealed only by a sticker on the top. Kind of iffy if you ask me.</li>
            <li> Just used this for the first time tonight.  Mixed with apple cider vinegar and tried to slather on the recommened quarter inch.  My skin looks a little better and feels a little better already.  I didnt feel the pulsating, but thats okay.  I am wondering if I am meant t let it dry totally, but slatheriing on 1/4 inch and not leaving it on more than 20 minutes seems impossible!</li>
            <li> Good! Better be used with organic apple cider Vinegar to create smooth baste, if you use water it will be clumpy. Did not feel my face pulse though but maybe I should leave it longer but my skin is sensitive so I leave it no more than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> gives me more blackheads....</li>
            <li> This stuff coupled with the raw apple cider vinegar is a god send. FINALLY something that works for the cyst type acne and I&#x27;ve used proactiv for years with no relief of these types of bumps. HIGHLY RECOMEMDED</li>
            <li> By far thee best mask I have ever used. It tightens and you can actually feel your face pulsate as described. I have very large pores and this shrinks them  every time. If you are looking for a great mask without all the harsh chemical you should give this a try</li>
            <li> To start off I get black heads on my nose and my skin is normal to dry so I can&#x27;t attest to overly oily or dry skin or breakouts. I used a 1.5 to 1 ratio of clay and vinegar. After applying I had a cooling and tightening sensation then it got really itchy after 10 mins and then started to sting/burn, 5 mins left to spare and I almost couldn&#x27;t take it but the stinging subsided or I just focused on something else.&lt;br /&gt;I used a paper towel to keep it from clogging the sink and a damp wash cloth to wipe my face and then cleaned with witch hazel and applied a moisturizer. Got most of the black heads so maybe I didn&#x27;t apply it right and it did come off really chipped but this is much better than nothing at all. I look forward to a weekly mask, this should last a really long time.</li>
            <li> Honestly, still not sure how I feel about this product.  I have used GlamGlow and an Origins Charcoal mask as well as this one, and I must say, for my skin (sensitive), I wouldn&#x27;t buy again probably.  It&#x27;s cheap, yeah, but I also think I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth it if it makes my skin really red, seems like I shouldn&#x27;t be doing that to my face, you know?</li>
            <li> Did not get the tingling sensation but my face feels cleaner.</li>
            <li> Sucks everything out and leaves your skin nice and silky. Still need to get the mixing done right to avoid clumps though.</li>
            <li> I like this een tho it can be a pain to mic and wash off. It does feel good and works well.</li>
            <li> Happy to have found this. This is the same as multani mitti found in India. This has been used by them for ages as part of their organic beauty regimen. I mix equal portions of this with apple cider vinegar and apply it on face and neck, and then wash it off after 20 mins or when dry. You may notice red spots once you wash your face. This is normal, just know that the mask has worked its magic. Follow it with a gentle moisturizer. I usually use avacodo oil as moisturizer. Since it is a strong mask, I usually use it once a week. I have noticed pores getting minimized after using this all-natural mask.</li>
            <li> love this stuff, and great deal... I mix it with witch hazel or coconut oil</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter.  She is a teen so she is in the pimple phase.  She said she believes this is working great on her skin.</li>
            <li> I have noticed I have smoother skin because it seeps in all my pores. . So when I use a toner it really shows how much of the clay gets into my skin.  This makes a flawless foundation application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad news is I break out!  My nose pores are dark. . So I&#x27;m not really sure how i feel. .</li>
            <li> make sure you use vinegar (i used white vinegar, not organic apple cider), makes the mask smoother and works 1000% times better</li>
            <li> It really does the trick. I&#x27;ve used other stuff for the face before like Mint Julep but the mud really works. You can really feeling it working on your pores as the application dries off. My face does not get irritated like it says in the box. I apply once every four days or as needed. My guess is that if you&#x27;re consistent with usage you&#x27;ll get better results.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much for me.</li>
            <li> my daughters were very against this at first but really like how this cleans their faces. they use a couple times a week and it helps their complections</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if it worked. I think it just makes my skin itchy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, my girlfriend bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this, as well as glam glow, and some other products. We both like it a lot. She still prefers glam glow, but I prefer this because you get  SO MUCH MORE.</li>
            <li> I brush my teath with this, use it on my face, in soap, and as a healing clay. This stuff works miracles.</li>
            <li> Most of the reviews here address talk about the clay&#x27;s effectiveness for facials; I have never used it for that purpose but know it instead as a healing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a humbling snowboarding trip I was introduced to the Indian Healing Clay by my mother-in-law.  I had spent equal parts of the  day on my feet and falling repeated on my right forearm and hip.  I was pretty badly bruised and she insisted that I try the magic clay.  Despite being a skeptic, I obliged and gave the clay a chance.  I was amazed at the way it helped speed up the healing process.  I used it for the next few days and there is no doubt that the clay helped my bruises heal quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since used this many times to help relieve pain associated with bumps and bruises and would recommend this stuff to anyone.</li>
            <li> Once you get this stuff mixed up it works good.  This stuff will pull out the oil and stuff from your face while it&#x27;s drying.  So many mask don&#x27;t seem to do anything while drying, but this isn&#x27;t one of those.  The mixing is a little trying, but once you get it right it works!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the naturalness of this product and I have everyone in my house addicted to this mask! Will definitly buy again!</li>
            <li> All my life I&#x27;ve had decent skin. My T-zone can get a bit oily at times but nothing too bad. Whenever I have had a break out due to stress, menstruation, diet, etc., however, I would break out this stuff and mix it with some Bragg&#x27;s and leave it on until it dried all the way through. It makes your skin feel nice and tight. Then I would take a washcloth with water as hot as I could stand and lay it over my face in the tub to soften the clay up before I scrubbed it off. It has always left my skin smooth and any breakouts disappeared usually within a day. I have done it on occasion twice in the same week and it did leave my face a little pink... but those tough break outs finally disappeared when nothing else would help. I picked up mine at WFM but am glad to see it on here. I am almost out and desperately need some more. I might add that a little goes a LONG way. 1/2 T of both this and Bragg;s mixed more than covered my whole face. Bentonite is a miracle in itself, the yerba prima liquid bentonite is a great tasteless detox for those who have issues with heavy metals, toxins, excess sodium and stuff like that.</li>
            <li> So I read all these glowing reviews, but I was still skeptical. What works for one person, might not work for another, especially when it comes to skin conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my tub of this stuff in TWO days, which was the fastest delivery I&#x27;ve ever experience on here. I bought some regular apple cider vinegar at the store, when home and mixed it all up. It does froth, but it makes a nice smooth mask. I put it on, and waited 27 minutes before I washed it off. It was SUPER itchy on me, and I wore it as long as I could stand it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin type is pretty dry - if I don&#x27;t use enough moisturizer it gets oily in efforts to make up for the lack of moisture - The older I get, I have uneven tone from sun damage and I get small breakouts with the weather changing, or before my period. But my biggest irk with my skin is having blackheads. I have never found a product that could remove them, and I have tried everything. My sister owned a skin spa for a long time, and she has given me tons of high end products, but none of them has ever worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that ever worked was having a $400 acid peel treatment - which I obviously couldn&#x27;t ever have afforded without it being a family discount thing.&lt;br /&gt;(Since then, my sister has moved to another state and given up the spa, (not a very good business in a bad economy) so no more free or discounted stuff for me :&amp;lt; Sad.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But THIS worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seriously took away nearly ALL my blackheads!!! I&#x27;m so impressed with it! I still have a few blackheads here and there, but my skin looks clearer and smoother than I ever seen it. I think with another few treatments I&#x27;ll probably see even better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clay is pretty drying - and it was uncomfortably itchy, and left my skin splotchy and red, but that faded after a half hour or so. I think it was probably just the acidic vinegar that made it itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But keep in mind girls (and gents) itching or burning doesnt mean it is bad for you. Quite the reverse. The acid peel felt the same way: it just means its removing a layer or two of your skin. Microdermabrasion does the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it kind of feels the same as an acid peel, I&#x27;d definitely have a good soothing moisturizer with high SPF on hand - like 50 or 55 - before going outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO YES! I liked it. Its so cheap, too! I&#x27;ll do it a few more times and then do a follow-up review if I have anything else to add.the same way: it just means its removing a layer or two of your skin.

            <li> This is the best skincare product I have ever used.  I put it on about once a week and leave it for 20 minutes.  I use it with Bragg&#x27;s raw apple cider vinegar.  It pulls on my skin after a while, but like magic, the next day my skin is very soft and clear.  Last night I had a breakout near my lip.  I used the mask last night before bed, and this morning it is gone.  I wish I knew about this mask as a teenager!</li>
            <li> This product is no miracle but I am 33 years old and I have tried many skin products over the years...this is the best that I have found. It works even better the longer you use it, so be patient. I use it once or twice per week and my skin feels GREAT afterwards. My skin does turn red at first but that goes away in about 20-30 min. I highly recommend this product and I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it about 4 times now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very hard to mix and put on your face evenly.  I keep it on for about 25-30 minutes (I have combination skin that is definitely not sensitive).  I have mixed it with ACV (Braggs organic pure) and water and didn&#x27;t notice a difference in results when using either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives a sucking sensation but \\&quot;pulsating\\&quot; is a definite hyperbole, as is most advertising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I rinse, my skin definitely feels softer and my pores *ever* so *slightly* smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I feel like I am breaking out more since using this product.  I have researched and found that these clays can make your skin worse before it gets better because it is drawing out toxins.  I am getting black heads in places I&#x27;ve never had them before, which makes me slightly nervous.  I am hoping that with more use over time this product will do what it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving 2 stars because it does not pulsate and because it needs better directions that are straightforward instead of using the space on the bottle for a bunch of nonsensical hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good product speaks for itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I am going to try buying a different brand.</li>
            <li> This product is a miracle in a jar! I recommend purchasing the apple cider vinagar as well. I believe it works better than the plain water. This mask literally makes my face glow afterwards. Immediately after rinsing my face is a little red, but it fades quickly into a healthy glow. I also recommend using this right before a shower, as it is a messy pain to rinse off. It is a little hard to mix into a creamy paste with just water. As I have become more comfortable with using this I have recently added greek yogurt and a little bit of honey to the mask... perfection!!</li>
            <li> THIS IS AMAZING!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I was looking for a mask that would help in &amp;#34;healing&#x27; my skin. I suffered from a massive breakout and had lots of bumps, zits, and scars that left my face very blotchy and red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On first use I noticed a difference. My skin was less red. I used this every night for 2 weeks and now my face is completely clear. I only have a few pesky light pink scars on my cheek.( they will fade)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions on how to use:&lt;br /&gt;I personally use a plastic baggie instead of a non metal bowl. I pour about 4 spoon fulls in a baggie and then mix with water. Some people use Apple Cider Vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix the water and powder in the baggie. Make sure you have enough water to powder ratio.&lt;br /&gt;From there just follow instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will let you know that if you do not have the proper water to powder ratio when you apply, it will ITCH!!! I heard that using ACV removes the itching factor. I can not vouch for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would save water is left in the baggie for another time. THIS IS CLAY, IT WILL CLOG YOUR DRAIN!! Use one of those water stoppers or drain catchers to collect the leftover clay. Some people use wash cloths and or wipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you make the mask the first time it does take some time, but if you save the extra from the baggie the next application is quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff. I feel my skin pulsate and get tighter. It helped with the redness and scarring.</li>
            <li> I bought bentonite clay really cheap, like 3lbs of it for a couple bucks, it&#x27;s the same thing as this so since I have acne &amp; blackheads on my nose I figured it would really pull out everything from all the reviews I read on line. I tried it w/water since ACV would be a bit too strong for me. I layered it on my face &amp; man does it dry up hard. You can feel it tightening on your face. I thought, Oh Boy!! It&#x27;s going to pull everything out! I took a warm facecloth to melt it off little at a time. What a mess, don&#x27;t let it go down your drain cause if it hardens your screwed. Anyway I was beet red but I thought I could deal w/that if it works it&#x27;s worth it. I looked like I had a devil mask on my face for hours. I was so dry after so I put on some oil &amp; moisturizer. That hurt too. The next day I was loaded with red dots, little pimples all around &amp; under my eyes,on my cheeks &amp; chin. And I had a brown patch on my jaw. It was toooo strong for me. It took me days &amp; days to get rid of the spots,they had little whiteheads in them. I know it must have been the purging but dam. I couldn&#x27;t hid them &amp; my skin felt so dry &amp; hurt for days. I see a lot of good reviews on here &amp; I&#x27;m glad it worked for them but I&#x27;m older &amp; have sensative skin. I&#x27;ll stick to the lighter masks. I didn&#x27;t see any difference so far besides having to hide out for a few days &amp; feeling my skin feel like sandpaper &amp; I was itchy too.&lt;br /&gt;I know since it&#x27;s cheap &amp; there are a lot of good reviews it&#x27;s hard to resist. So if you do try it on your forehead first. I didn&#x27;t get red bumps there but you&#x27;ll be able see how it feels first before you put it on any delacate areas.  Good luck.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions.  Mix 50/50 with apple cider vinegar and pack it on your face or wherever 1/4&amp;#34; to 1/2&amp;#34; thick.  Wait 20 minutes.  I always wash things like masks or scrubs off my face in the shower instead of over the sink, so that I don&#x27;t have to worry about clean up later.  The mask dried, and I could feel it pulling at my face which is a good sign.  I looked in the mirror and saw the clay cracked, so I washed it off.  I&#x27;m a chronic pimple picker, so I got up close and personal with a mirror and examined nearly every pore I could find.  Doing this, I gently massaged my face, and magically black heads and white heads that I had not previously seen (prior to putting the mask on) were starting to surface.  Being the picker that I am, I coaxed the heads out and lightly swabbed with some alcohol on those places.  I followed with moisturizer.  The next day, more white heads started to surface around my jawline.  So in essence, this is not some magical zit-b-gone product, but with a few uses, your face will naturally start to clear because it acts like a magnet and causes the gunk to surface slowly over time.  It pulls the impurities out that lurk deep within your epidermis.  It feels good to know that you are getting a good deep clean with this product.  I like it, and I will continue to use it.  Also, my friend told me about bentonite clay.  She paid something like $25 for this exact same thing except hers came from some boutique, so yeah.  This product is no frills, but is worth every penny.  It is low cost because no celebrity has claimed it and put their name on it and charged you an outrageous price for what is essentially dirt.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my skin feel wonderful and helps clear out my pores.  Be sure you mix the clay with apple cider vinegar instead of water to prevent clumping.  It will leave your skin really red but it goes away after about 1 hour or less.</li>
            <li> So I think I actually like the Redmond Clay better, but I ran out of my tube of it, and had this still kicking around. I learned a cool rehydration method for this and the Redmond Clay though. I didn&#x27;t have Braggs on hand, and whenever I mix it with water it just clumps, but the Redmond Clay was so silky smooth, so I investigated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, for 1/2 a cup of this clay, you use 2 cups of water. For a cup, you use 4 cups of water. Just put the clay in a quart size jar, add 2 cups water, shake it, and wait 24-48 hours, and it will be the consistency of a thick pudding. Shake it every once in awhile so the water and clay redistribute and it wont clump. It stays good as long as it&#x27;s in a air safe tight container. Easy peasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both clays will suck absolutely anything out of your pores. And I mean it. Blackheads on your nose? Forget it. Also good for sinus infections. I wash my face with this daily, it&#x27;s the only thing that actually gets everything off and out of your skin. And by wash I mean I wear a mask for 10-15 minutes and then rinse it off. Works wonders.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little messy to work with, but I use it about once a week to help clear up my face. I also use it in my hair and it makes it very soft and helps detox my scalp.  Works very good with the Organic Apple Cider Vinegar.</li>
            <li> I use ACV from the Dollar Tree, it worked great! I did not have any burning or other bad side effects. I did feel it pulsate but it was almost like awkward twitches, not bad at all. It had no strange smells and it was very easy to apply and to wipe off. I left mine on for 20 minutes but I think I may leave it on a bit longer next time. I have oily skin and usually when I wake up in the morning my face is pretty oily, this morning, my face was no where near as oily as it normally is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a blush brush to apply the mixture, I didn&#x27;t want to get it all over my hands and I had no problem getting an even coat. Some people said to use a foundation brush, I just made sure the blush brush was one that was a bit courser than a normal one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even my pre-teen daughter loved it and it really helped with her acne. It&#x27;s not harsh at all on your skin and has no scents so it can be used by someone even with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to and it&#x27;s super cheap! I would recommend this to anyone! I&#x27;ve used it as a foot soak, face mask, on poison ivy, and on other rashes. It has so many uses! Great value!</li>
            <li> WOAH. This stuff is amazing. I was a little hesitant as I do have pretty sensitive skin, but I am so glad that I purchased this. It definitely works better when you use the apple cider vinegar, it&#x27;s WAY smoother that way. I do a heaping tablespoon of the powder and a tablespoon of the vinegar then mix it really well, getting rid of all the lumps. Then I use a big wide paintbrush to apply a thin layer all over my face then wait for it to try (I left it on for like 20 minutes the most recent time). Then I took it off with a wet rag and put on a gentle moisturizer (my skin dries out really easily). I am really pleased with this product and recommend anyone on the fence to try it out!</li>
            <li> I use this clay for facial masks, mixed with water and vinegar. It works as described and helps clear the skin. It is a much cheaper way to get a good clay mask compared to store-bought premixed products.</li>
            <li> Use as directed. I use the product once a breakout begins, it does not completely remove the acne, however, it does stop irritation.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a mask for a long time for my sensative skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works great so far used it twice.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to mix. Easy to put on.. Easy to wash off in a shower...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it. I wush founded sooner. Great product.. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for those with oily and/or acne prone skin. I&#x27;ve always had hormonal breakouts that are rather painful and hard to get rid of. This mask (when made with the apple cider vinegar, NOT water) really helped my skin. It draws all impurities to the surface and helps clear pores. Don&#x27;t freak out if your skin seems worse after the first time - give it a second try! I think it really does work by pulling impurities to the surface so after 2 or 3 times you&#x27;ll really start to notice how clear your skin is. Great for blackheads and cystic acne. My skin doesn&#x27;t tend to be very sensitive so I leave it on for about 20 minutes and start to notice the tightening/pulsating sensation at about 15. It is hard to remove but with a little hot water you&#x27;re good to go. Would recommend using at night rather than before your day as skin may be a little red for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> It was wonderful, just tablespoon was all you needed for your whole face. It got a little tight after 20 minutes, but your skin feels so so smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin and have never had problems with pimples, except for the one or two popping up before my period.  I read rave reviews online about this stuff.  I&#x27;ve slapped it on my face twice last week.  My skin looks the same.  The only thing I agree about w/ the other reviews is that it hurts a lot as it tightens.  Anyway, skin looks the same, not any brighter or duller, doesn&#x27;t feel any cleaner or dirtier.  Pretty sure it&#x27;s just a lot of hype.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had time to use this on my entire face yet but I have on my nose and the results excite me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nose gets pretty dry, flaky, and I have eczema. When I used this on my nose it didn&#x27;t dry it out at all and it took out majority of my blackheads! Can&#x27;t wait to use this on the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> This is not as great as I was hoping. My face feels like there is a film on it after I use it. Can&#x27;t seem to get it mixed smoothly. For the price though, I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> Great mask I mix this with another great product ( Braggs A.C.V.) it stinks but does wonders for my skin. I notice that it cleans and buffs my skin from impurities and if I have a break out it sucks them to the surface for easy removal gross I know but also pretty cool if you need to get rid of those little bastards fast and furious :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is the ugliest green and stinky, but you can feel it tighten your skin and pull out dirt. However, it dries your skin. So, keep your skin moisturized if you plan to use this. The container was huge!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. I was surprised to see it on Amazon.com so even though I generally get it from the manufacturer directly I went ahead and ordered it to have on hand. Very good for taking those top layers of dead cells off once a month or so. Very good for lifting from within and purifying the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;Olga</li>
            <li> I instantly saw a glow to my skin after rinsing the mask off! Try it, this product will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> After using this product, my skin looks one or two tones lighter. Don&#x27;t forget to use nice skin lotion and serum after this. You will feel your skin responds to them better.</li>
            <li> OH MY GOSH!!! There are SO many grammatical errors in the discription it&#x27;s comical!!! If it weren&#x27;t for the number of positive reviews,  I would never even consider buying this...who proof reads this stuff!!?</li>
            <li> this mask is awesome i really like it. i mix my pearl powder in it and it feels nice good product</li>
            <li> prompt delivery, as usual by Amazon.  This is my first time using this product and i&#x27;m hooked!  i&#x27;ve been using it every other day. First time I used it with just water it my hand and it was chunky/messy!  Then I decided it was time to use a whisk &amp; bowl with apple cider vinegar/water mix.  Worked much better. However, I decided to mix it in my mini cuisinart as another user did.  It worked BEST!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product about 6 times now.  The first time I mixed it with Green Tea, but it was SO lumpy. When mixed with Apple Cider Vinegar it breaks down easily into a smooth paste. You can really feel it working. My skin is smooth and blemish free.  I now mix it with Apple Cider Vinegar, honey and therapeutic essential oils and use it weekly.  It&#x27;s inexpensive and works brilliantly.  I use it on my clients, too. The \\&quot;pulsating\\&quot; sensation can be a bit irritating, but once you wash off the mask and feel how smooth &amp; soft your skin is and see how youthful &amp; radiant it looks, you know that sensation is the mask working its magic. I recommend Aztec Secret most highly.</li>
            <li> Just used this for the first time last night.  What a crazy feeling on your face when it is drying.  Takes a while to dry say more than 20 minutes.  I washed it off just a little sooner than I could have.  Will take a few more tries to get used to it on my face.  I liked the results I got, my skin was smooth, felt soft and looked clean.</li>
            <li> I love how this makes my face and hair feel.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin really red and irritated, and very hard to wash off, I recommend taking a shirt off when washing off to avoid drenching your shirt a bit</li>
            <li> I use this all the time for face masks and in my home made deodorant and tooth powder for it&#x27;s detoxifying effect. it really does make your face pulsate when it dries!! Weird sensation at first but I love it!</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s not a miracle cure by any means, but after using it for a couple of months - about twice a week (or so, sometimes once), there has been a noticeable decrease in breakouts and acne scars are at least minimally diminished.</li>
            <li> very effective but be careful if your skin is sensitive. This is strong</li>
            <li> I first picked up this clay at a natural market on a whim and it has been my best friend for years. I&#x27;ve tried other premixed masks but I always go back to making my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit [Nov 11, 2013]:&lt;br /&gt;I have recently read about the pH of betonite clay being about 8 or 9 (above 7 is basic). Apparently if you simply use water, the pH remains the same. Since Apple Cider Vinegar is acid (pH around 4), it balances out and is good for the skin. Plain vinegar is more acidic, so yo would end up with a slightly more acidic mixture. Ideal pH of the skin is 5.5. These are things to keep in mind when you are mixing up your mask. If you want to be more precise and match the ideal pH of the skin, you could always use pH strips to test your mixture.</li>
            <li> After mixing this with apple cider and vinegar, my face feel soft and supple like a baby&#x27;s bottom :) . The only advice that i have is to mix it with apple cider vinergar instead of water because the mixture would have a better consistency thus easier to put it on your face.</li>
            <li> Ordered the 2lb one now,  love it so much</li>
            <li> I love this product! I didn&#x27;t realize how much a pound of this stuff actually is! It&#x27;s gonna last me a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It calls for Apple cider vinegar, which is an irritant to the skin, but it also good for you in small doses! I leave my mask on for 20-30 minutes to make sure it&#x27;s completely dry (you won&#x27;t be able to move your face easily, haha!) I like to do my mask at night because it usually makes my skin red for like 15-20 minutes. (The redness is because of the apple cider vinegar). It&#x27;s not the most comfortable thing to experience, but once you take it off, you really feel like you have done something great for your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to tell you if it&#x27;s gonna clear up acne, but it&#x27;s definitely kept new big breakouts from happening. I&#x27;m gonna stick with it, along with using coconut oil to moisturize, and drinking plenty of water because no product will work unless you do other things to help it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it and if you have other people in your household that want to use it, trust me, this one jar is more than enoughfor everyone! ☺</li>
            <li> I love this product! It makes my sling feel soft. More importantly it helps clean the deep blackheads and acne areas! This is the stuff I&#x27;ve been waiting for.</li>
            <li> It really does tingle! And my face fells so much smoother and refreshed afterwards!</li>
            <li> Has anyone tried to leave this producy on overnight?</li>
            <li> African American can&#x27;t use all products on their skin. However I have to say this works! Use with raw apple cider vinegar. Water will NOT give you the maximum results. I have oily skin so this product didn&#x27;t dry my skin out. It actually made my skin look &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; opposed to the oily look I normally have. If you have dry skin, please use a good moisturizer. Works great for spot treatment over night as well!</li>
            <li> Holy grail face mask. Cheap, natural and works like magic. I got it for my mom and she&#x27;s just as obsessed. People tend to comment on how great my skin looks after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix a spoonful of clay powder with a spoonful of raw, unfiltered apple cider vinegar in a plastic bag. I sort of squish the bag together until all the lumps are gone and then apply it to my face. Once the mask dries (and my taunt face looks like some creepy alien creature ala Star Trek), I wash it off. I prefer doing this right before a shower because it&#x27;s easier to wash off in the shower (comes off in chunks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I have very, very sensitive skin, so my face is a little red for a half-hour after. I always make sure I have time for my face to &amp;#34;calm down&amp;#34; before going out and follow with an all-natural moisturizer. I will mix with water (rather than ACV) for a milder mask. The more liquid, the milder the mask in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lasts forever! I only use it about 1-2 times a month since my skin gets red after. Two years with a tub of it and still going strong :)</li>
            <li> This is the most incredible stuff.  It just pulls all the impurities out of my face, leaving it smooth and clean.  I would recommend this to everyone concerned about their skin.  It can&#x27;t be beat for what it does.  Will definitely purchase again --- when it runs out.  This jar goes a long long way, which is another plus.  Try it and see how great your face feels.  Can&#x27;t recommend it enough!</li>
            <li> Perfect for oily skin, specially if used with Apple cider vinegar. It cleans my skins really well.</li>
            <li> Amazing, Great! I love it</li>
            <li> Live this face mask! Gets rid of dead skin after bad sun burn and leaves skin nice and soft..</li>
            <li> So far... Loving it. I appreciate the very earthy feel of it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Wouldn&#x27;t be without it! I use weekly as mask, and occasionally as an overnight spot treatment when I need it that time of the month. Clears up over night.</li>
            <li> I received this item a few days ago.  Unfortunately, the container seal had been broken already so it had been opened before it was delivered.  I did use the product that nigjt anyway and the next day, I had very irritated, itchy dry skin (I do not have sensitive skin). This is a first of having Amy sort of reaction to facial products.  I will not use this product again.  I am rating this a 1 star because of my experience with the product but others may have experience different and positve results.</li>
            <li> REALLY HELPED UNTIL I TURNED 3O.NOW MY SKIN TO DRY TO USE IT.</li>
            <li> very good product just as described, thanks</li>
            <li> You can definitely feel the pulsation in the face.  as expected, my face was red afterword for like 30 minutes. And it hurt taking this thing off, but it was that good hurt if ha know what I mean. It actually took me 3 times to actually get the proper amount mixed. I would always make to much. But I&#x27;m golden now! Gradually, I could start seeing a difference in the apes tense of my pores. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I like it! Tightens the skin</li>
            <li> this crap is amazing. never use water- always acv. feel the burn! no pain no gain! better to use closer to bedtime..</li>
            <li> Messy but makes your face feel clean and refresh , I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have a teenager,  We have tried everything with nothing working.  So with this mask and Pan Oxyl bar, she finally seems to be clearing up.  Im going to say it may be a combination. So definitely give this a try!! Don&#x27;t pass this one up!</li>
            <li> I have suffered for years with cystic acne and some weird almost like ingrown hairs on my arms . My facial acne was along my jaw and one on my nose that always would come back every month . I am 42 years old and nothing at all has ever worked this well . I use the equal parts clay and apple cider vinegar and make it somewhat thick and let it sit on my face until the pulsating stops .. Usually 25-30 min then rinse . My face is red but img I can feel all the oil dirt feeling gone and it never ever has dried out my face like other masks that have fragrance or chemicals . My skin is pretty sensitive and Thai has been a struggle for years . After rinsing I put on a small dab of pure 100 percent jojoba oil to moisturizer while I sleep ( go easy on it) your skin will absorb it and it will be silly smooth without clogging because jojoba is the closest to natural sebum in the skin therefore it tricks your face into believing it has enough oil and won&#x27;t keep overproducing and ending up with more acne . Amazing product that I recommend to patients at the hospital I work at . If you suffer acne and are at wits end ... This is your answer I promise .</li>
            <li> First time I used it my skin felt great and got rid of blackheads and other blemishes right away, I love it!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, was exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying this, and I love it!!!  It feels great, you can really tell that it&#x27;s doing a serious job of clearing out your pores.  After just a few day&#x27;s of using this my skin is way softer and clearer.  Try it you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it it helped with my acne and scars!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this clay mask twice so far and my skin has never been more clear! I have switched up my skin care routine all together so I don&#x27;t know how much I can contribute to this product, but it really seems to do what it says it will! I don&#x27;t have chronic acne, but I always have a few spots of pimples, especially on my chin and forehead. Since using this mask those have diminished significantly! I purchased this initially because I suddenly sprouted terrible acne on my chest, shoulders, and back. This was surprising to me at 24 but I think it was stress related. I mixed up a bunch of the clay with both ACV and water and slapped it all over. After the first use I noticed a huge difference! The acne isn&#x27;t gone, but it has cleared up amazingly. I&#x27;m hoping with a few more uses it will leave my skin nice a clear. So far I use it once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit of a messy process to mix up the clay and apply it all over your chest, shoulders, back, and face but I&#x27;ll go through how I&#x27;ve been doing it. I read some reviews suggesting mixing it in a sandwich bag, that would definitely cut down on the mess but it seems too wasteful for me.&lt;br /&gt;I just mix up 1 part clay powder, 1 part ACV, and add water as needed to reach the desired consistency (make sure to not use anything metal as it will react with the chemical properties of the clay mixture)&lt;br /&gt;Then I spread that s*** all over where needed. First I apply to my chest, shoulders, and back. I&#x27;ll leave that on for about 20 minutes, then I apply the rest to my face. Once I start feeling the mask pulsate (it really does make my face feel like it&#x27;s pulsating) I hop in the shower and let the warm water take the mask off for me. This is the really messy part if you are applying to more than just your face as it will leave behind lots of clay.&lt;br /&gt;To avoid clogging my drain I don&#x27;t force any of the pieces down. Most of it will break up into small particles again and go down the drain, whatever is left I use a paper towel to clean my tub. I leave the hot water running for a little while for good measure.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, once the clay mix is completely dry in the bowl I used to whip it up, it&#x27;s easy to wipe the excess into the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;This sounds like a lot of work but it is actually a lot of fun to me. Using ACV makes the mask I nice muddy consistency that is fun to spread everywhere and watch turn into a dark earthy color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To end this exceedingly long review, if you use this product, pay attention to your skin, not recommended times. Once the mask starts pulsating and feeling uncomfortable TAKE IT OFF. Whether it&#x27;s 5 minutes in or 25 minutes in, pay attention to your own body! I have sensitive skin and once the mask starts feeling uncomfortable I take it off! As other reviewers have said, it does leave your skin really red after, I think it&#x27;s just because the mask pulls and tightens as it dries. Other reviewers have said to use an oil free moisturizer after, I&#x27;m not sure why it has to be oil free, but I listened to them and have been very happy with the results.eave the hot water running for a little while for good measure.

            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product once and it worked well!! The clay made my hair very soft. My curls were elongated and defined. I look forward to using it again!!! I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I first bought this at whole foods about a year ago and fell in love with it. Getting it on Amazon is even better!! It seriously helps with acne, and I have terribly sensitive skin too. I always break out when I&#x27;m stressed, and this stuff is a miracle in a jar! Mixed with vinegar, it is the best face mask I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this stuff. She uses it 2-3 times a week and she swears it gets rid of blackheads better than anything else!  Makes her skin smooth and soft with no flakies!</li>
            <li> This stuff is AWESOME.  Do not let these details deter you in any way from buying this.  Stock up.  I looked into this clay because I was looking into other Ayurveda treatments for other things.  I got this because i am sick of dealing with clogged pores.  Sick of trying things, the prices, claims, etc.  (I don&#x27;t have any real long term issues other than this plus your normal issues that crop up, so not sure how it would work on actual cystic or red acne blemishes). I am in my late 30s/early 40s?  ;)  Lying about my age?  Doing a little Botox?  Yes - but just some background so you know who is doing this review.  First, you seriously may want to consider doing this before you take a shower - I&#x27;ll tell you why later in the review.  I did not know this, but the clay is powder, as in baby powder-type consistency, so be careful when you open it (I thought it might be more solid like other clay masques I have used, as in already damp in the jar).  This is then mixed with equal parts of organic raw apple cider vinegar (see Braggs - I purchased this from Amazon as well).  I know, it sounds weird and unpasturized and will it go bad, but no, you are fine.  Does not need to be refrigerated.  It&#x27;s best to use a glass bowl, and if you have ever had your hair colored, the application brush is a perfect mixer.  This is mixed until you form a paste, I would say in between mayo and toothpaste.  It smells like vinegar.  It is very messy.  It is green.  The jar talks about lathering on 1/4&amp;#34; - 1/2&amp;#34; - just at 1/4&amp;#34; is a lot of masque!  I then slather it on to try and get to 1/4&amp;#34;.  :)  It does not fall off.  After doing this, I wondered how/if it would ever dry because it was so thick and wet, but it does.  As it dries, you feel like your face in hardening and being pulled in, and it really IS hardening (and at this point it is SORT of uncomfortable but nothing bad at all).  ;)  Let it stay on until it dries/mostly dries (and at that point you really want it off).  Now here&#x27;s the shower part - if you try to wash this off in the sink like any other masque - be aware it does not just rinse right off.  You are trying to re-wet and moisten back up this clay - not easy.  Well, of course it will come off, but make sure your face is down into the bowl, and you will need a washcloth to gently get it off.  I think you could also use a netting bath puff.  Once it is off, rinse, rinse, rinse.  You will smell a little bit like vinegar for a while (or at least I think so, and I think maybe this is just a teeny bit of residual masque in my hairline?).  Your face will be somewhat red for a little while (and the jar tells you this).  It is nothing bad; it just looks like you got a little sun, no big deal.  I saw a difference after using this one time.  I used it twice in one week, and I had different skin.  I am serious.  I don&#x27;t work for this company and I have done lots of reviews, been on Amazon for years.  I tried this a number of times before posting this review, and my opinion is the same.  I love it, it works, I wish I had known about this product before.  I am not using anything different.  I do use an exfoliating skin cleaner/wash, but I have always done this.  This is the first thing that made a very obvious and very significant difference after the first use; I wasn&#x27;t waiting for weeks to see any improvement or forced to use an entire skin care line and not mix product to see a difference after weeks of use.  I am hooked, and I hope it works for you if you decide to try it.re&#x27;s the shower part - if you try to wash this off in the sink like any other masque - be aware it does not just rinse right off.

            <li> Great stuff! Even bought back ups so I wouldn&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! It has minimized the appearance of pores from the first use. I use it occasionally and have noticed a great improvement on my skin. I absolutely love it! I was skeptical at first, but now I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Am loving this product!</li>
            <li> I absolutely am in love with this stuff!!! My mom actually bought this and since this container is absolutely huge... She said she would share! I mixed this with apple cider vinegar like I had read to do. It mixed to a very smooth,creamy consistency and was quite easy to put on my face. I put a rather thick layer on and it did not take that long to dry. The sensation when it was drying was really neat haha. It feels like your skin is being pulled tight, and you cannot smile or move your face. It feels really good though!!! It does slightly tingle and it feels as if its doing .. something! When I was ready to remove the product I put a very hot cloth over my face to soften up the clay. I then used paper towels, which I threw in the trash, to remove the excess clay. Afterward, my face was slightly red but my pores instantly felt smaller and my skin looked VERY VERY CLEAR!!!! After using this a few times now, my overall skin tone has improved and my face feels more supple and firm. It has not improved the fine lines I have around my eyes, but it has definitely reduced the pore size and seems to have started some collagen production. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and this stuff did not irritate or dry my skin out. As a matter of fact, it made my skin look great. When I mixed it it became really clumpy. I will try with a fork or something next time. I am looking forward to using this product again &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Sort of reminded me of bleaching my hair. It agitating and you kinda feel like you wanna scratch it..but the end results are more than worth it. Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this!! I mix it with Bragg&#x27;s vinegar and it works great on my blackhead prone areas! I suggest using it at night as it does make my face red for a little while after I wash it off.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s a pain to take off but worth the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this about 3 times a week since I got it. I mix it with apple cider vinegar and leave it on for 10 mins since my skin is more sensitive. Once I&#x27;m finished I rinse it off and moisturize hardcore with CeraVe Moisturizing cream. My skin looks freaking flawless after the mask and lotion! I always feel awesome and cleansed afterwards. I recommended it to my boyfriend and now we both use it together.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I&#x27;ve used it a few times myself and I have to say, my skin looks amazing. I have a few acne scars from my earlier years and I get the occasional pimple from time to time, but I haven&#x27;t had a breakout since I&#x27;ve used it and it minimized the visibility of my scarring. My husband had terrible back acne and asks me to scratch his back daily. I put this on his back and his back acne is almost non existent. It cleared up significantly and he hasnt even had the desire to have his back scratched a full week after I applied it. I also used it on my preteen daughter who gets the occasional bumps on her forehead. Ever since we did the mask on her... nothing! Perfectly clear skin. We are one happy, clear skinned family!!! definitely recommend. I mixed theirs with the Braggs apple cider vinegar and when I did my face (pregnant and couldnt stomach the vinegar smell on myself), I used moroccan rose water the first time and pure aloe vera the second. Idk which worked best, but all turned out great! I&#x27;m planning a girl&#x27;s night in spa night with my lady friends soon :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t think of buying this before as I have seen the effects of these kinds of clays first-hand before. When I was younger I took a river tour somewhere in Mexico, and part of it was getting a clay treatment from the clay in the river, which is said to have all sorts of beautifying and healing properties. This product is almost indistinguishably similar.&lt;br /&gt;I usually apply it with regular apple cider vinegar (because the other kind is honestly a bit more than I am willing to spend) one to three times per week and have had excellent results. It appears to dry out those pesky problem pimples as well as soothe erupting pimples and cystic acne (though to a slightly lesser degree). Recently I also learned that you can also mix tea tree oil (though I usually leave out the apple cider vinegar when I do this and just use water) into it to help treat acne and it has worked wonders. I also sometimes apply it problem areas on my body (upper arms, chest, back) and it works for those areas as well with equal success.&lt;br /&gt;Do be prepared for the pulling sensation because you can definitely feel it and it will probably start to hurt after a bit if you leave the mask on too long (which I have done and regretted). Also, be prepared for your skin to break out a little bit when you first start using it. This clay works  by pulling impurities up to the surface, so if you have a lot of them which you have not been pulling up to the surface routinely, then they will start to be pulled up. However, as you keep using it this will lessen. Also, be cautious of the drying effects of the clay. It can be very, very drying, especially if, like myself, you are also applying topical acne medications like clindamycin and retinoid cream at the same time. I definitely recommend applying an oil-free acne moisturizer after washing off the mask and not following washing off the mask with washing with any strong acne cleanser (clearisil, proactiv, etc.) as this will only aggravate the skin/increase dryness. While I am on this topic, I recommend making sure that the skin is clean of all makeup/creams/body lotions etc. before applying the clay as these things will either decrease its effectiveness or possibly cause irritation of the skin.) as this will only aggravate the skin/increase dryness.

            <li> I love love LOVE this. I&#x27;ve had it for 3 maybe 4 weeks &amp; I have had little to no acne since using it. I use Apple cider vinegar with mine. 10/10 would recommend. My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t find this sooner, it makes my skin glow.</li>
            <li> It says it will make my face pulsate but it barley made it tingle, and I would not suggest using water to mix with it, it does not mix that we&#x27;ll with water,  but mixes better with apple cider vinegar. I will use until gone but will take me a long time there is a lot of product so if it does work for you Great,  I am not so impressed.</li>
            <li> I AM AMAZED! I purchased this item to incorporate into my skincare regimen, been using it once a week for 3 weeks and OMG!!!! I love it!!! I have never used a deep cleanser that makes my skin feel this incredible! When it says \\&quot;feel your face pulsate\\&quot; it does just that. This product stands up to its name.</li>
            <li> The actual tube is very small for the price that is why it gets 4 stars</li>
            <li> Well if you&#x27;re reading this I am guessing you are in the position where I was less than a week ago. So I trusted the 5 star reviews and bought the dang product! Although I saw a few that had stated that it dried out their face, made them breakout, etc. but I figured it was worth the 9 bucks! And I am glad I did it! I got this in the mail yesterday morning and waited to try it until night time, I am 15 with troubled skin, mostly just scars and the occasional stress zits. (I also have had eczema like skin occasionally on my legs and arms, so I have pretty sensitive skin.)  I took my makeup off and mixed about 2-3 tsp of Apple Cider Vinegar and 2-3 tsp of the powder and mixed it just in a Tupperware cup and evenly spread it on my face with my finger. I waited about 20-30 minutes (until it was dry) and I just washed it off right away in the shower so it, hopefully, wouldn&#x27;t clog the drain. But if you&#x27;re doing this over the sink I recommend not washing it down the drain, as some have said in other reviews. (I didn&#x27;t use any face wash that day or night) After I got out and put some face moisturizer on, my face felt SUPER clean and soft! This morning when I woke up, my acne scars had faded enough so I just used BB cream and some concealer on my face. Really excited to use this again! So if you&#x27;re debating whether to get this or not, I HIGHLY recommend this! But be patient with it to fade scars and clear your skin, this was just after one use and I plan to use it once a week. Hopefully this product works for you!</li>
            <li> This mask really makes your face feel clean. Mixed with water or apple cider vinegar, it does wonders. It may burn at first, but once it&#x27;s washed off your face is very smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Well I didn&#x27;t order mine online, though this is where i initially found it. The other day, my grandmother and I came across one of those natural stores that sold herbal capsules, smudge sticks and other such homeopathic remedies.. Well, we had looked around for a while, then out of the corner of my eye, I saw this. And only for $5, so I&#x27;m kinda glad I didn&#x27;t get it here (what? I&#x27;m cheap!) So I had used it that night, just with water to try it out. Definitely messy, so I ended up showering that night too. The next morning though, I could already notice some changes. Normally I wake up with a nice layer of grease on my face, but there was hardly any grossness to my face that morning.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try different stuff with it (like washing my face then using it, using it with ACV, using toner afterwards) but so far I like it.&lt;br /&gt;It may have been not mixing it with ACV yet, not a whole lot of tingling, but it was kinda cool with the tightening thing. But yeah, if you can find it at  your local natural aide-type place, look around there first. They&#x27;ve got a lot of cool stuff, and hey, it might be a couple dollars cheaper and you&#x27;ll get it the same day.</li>
            <li> Love it! I have wikid acne and this has def been helping . I would recommend mixing with apple cider vinegar , with the &amp;#34;mother&amp;#34;  in it (organic?). They say a few times a week but everybody&#x27;s skin is different.  Try out a few times a week and see how your skin responds.  I use it everyday on my cheeks, which is my problem area , and maybe a few times a week on my whole face. Follow up with some moisturizer for a beautiful complexion.</li>
            <li> So I got my mask cream today, and use it , and oh my ! how I felt it getting tight on my face after about 1-2mins I left on for about ten mins, my face has been so shining and Oily after washing off my face feels refreshed and cleaned , I can tell I&#x27;m going to love this product by my first use of it. I give four stars because I need to use more.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this, and I&#x27;ve been very pleased.  It really helps close my pores up, and I only use it a couple of times a month.  A little goes a very long way, so you may have this for years!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel the pulsation that everyone was talking about; however, my face felt amazing afterwards. It dried out my acne and has shrunk my pores. I use this once a week and the results have been great.</li>
            <li> add to my homemade deodorant. nice product</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little difference, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to someone who has dry skin. This will make it worse.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much. Great product.</li>
            <li> Works really well for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> This clay is literally magic in a jar. I use it as a full face mask as suggested and also to spot treat my blemishes. My blemishes clear up much quicker compared to when I do not use it. My face feels refreshed afterwards, when I do a full face mask I typically wash it off in the shower and apply a hydrating cream afterwards.</li>
            <li> I just received my clay today, already used it . At first it wasn&#x27;t doing anything and after a minute when it started drying the pulsating feeling began ,when it dried my face was so tight I looked like I had too much filler injected , I couldn&#x27;t smile hehe After I washed off my skin was feeling warm and a little red. I noticed the blackheads on my nose have vanished , that&#x27;s a plus , now since I have acne and scars I hope by using this mask often (everyday) for a week I will see great improvement in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Also I have heard that eating or drinking clay , not this one specifically , one that is safe for internal use, also helps to detoxify the organs and help clear skin from breakouts, how true is that?</li>
            <li> I mixed with raw cider vinegar and the consistency was perfect, no lumps. I have very sensitive skin and it felt good as it was drying.  My face was softer than ever after washing it off without any redness or irritation at all.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> arrived on time and was as described</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Deep cleaning, easy to use.  I do use it with ACV. I will definitely have a reorder.</li>
            <li> I love this mask. I&#x27;m using it about once a week and boy does it pulse. I will say be careful to get exact parts of the clay and vinegar because otherwise it&#x27;s too thick.</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time today. I thought it would dry out my skin, but surprisingly enough, it didn&#x27;t. My skin feels really clean too.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive and reactive skin, with eczema especially on my hands.  (can&#x27;t even touch antibacterial or scented soaps)&lt;br /&gt;So I was a little nervous trying this.  But it works great and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I mix it with water.  adding water slowly until it&#x27;s a thick but spreadable consistency (a bit like thick peanut butter).  I leave it on about ten minutes per the labels suggestion for sensitive skin.  After putting it on my face I also thin the remaining mixture and put a light layer on my neck and upper chest.&lt;br /&gt;I rinse with a warm wet washcloth at the kitchen sink (with a garbage disposal incase any chunks of clay go down the drain).  Then after most of it&#x27;s off I take my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do this clay mask about once every week and a half.</li>
            <li> Love this mask. Bought it on a whim after getting a severe breakout from a new supplement ive been taking for an bum shoulder. I mix it with apple cider vinegar as my face is not sensitive and incredibly oily. Noticed a difference with in the first use. The breakout went down a lot and the redness was gone. My only complaint is that its a nightmare to was off.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve never used anything like it before, the tinggly &amp; pulling sensation is an awesome feeling. It does leave your skin a bit red once rinsed off, but it dissapears within minutes. I only use it on my face and I feel it leaves it soft &amp; clean. The mixing recipe calls for Apple Cider Vinegar but I chose to mix it with pure lemon juice since is just as good. I find it easier to mix &amp; apply with a clean make-up brush (foundation brush to be exact), I just rinse it with soap &amp; water after every use. Over all, I am content with this product and would absolutely recomment it. It&#x27;s inexpensive and definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> Use this to make my own tooth powder. I don&#x27;t like commercial toothpastes as I dislike the lathering agent. Some also feel the fluoride is toxic. Mostly though what don&#x27;t care for about most commercial toothpastes is penchant for making things anti-plaque. And regardless a lot use glycerin in their toothpastes which as the effect of not letting minerals settle in the teeth and leaves them sensitive. I decided to make a simple tooth powder where I don&#x27;t have to deal with ingredients I can&#x27;t pronounce let alone understand and got a few recipes off the Internet. This clay was recommended in one review and for me it works. I didn&#x27;t add any peppermint or other flavoring and just use it plain mixed with a few ingredients and I don&#x27;t miss the flavoring/sweeteners as artificial sweeteners generally used aren&#x27;t good for you if you do your research. So far so good. It&#x27;s fine and neutral tasting. My mouth doesn&#x27;t feel gritty after. I use a bit of non alcoholic mouthwash after to kill any taste and make my breath minty fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried it as an face mask yet and that will be my next step as I have mild acne and combination skin with that oily &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; zone. I used retin A for many years without a problem, but when I switched medical plans to an HMO the dermatologist didn&#x27;t want to prescribe retin A for me. Instead he pushed adapalene gel which I didn&#x27;t care for so I am going to devise my own treatments.</li>
            <li> The clay makes your skin feel amazing!  It does draw the skin and turn it red for a few minutes (maybe an hour) after you rinse it off.  I use it with apple cider vinegar and will try it with water to see if it is less drying. I also put it on pretty thick and let it dry completely before removing.</li>
            <li> Strong mask gives a deep cleansing feeling  for days after</li>
            <li> I read a recipe in a book that mixing this with Hydrogen Peroxide would help with acne and dark marks. I tried it and it is amazing! I&#x27;ve been using this twice a week and everyone is commenting on how great my skin looks. I&#x27;m prone to comedonal acne which is white heads and black heads that can turn cystic. I use a small amount of clay and mix it with hydrogen peroxide  and let it sit on my face until dry. It lighten&#x27;s the dark spots and brings the white heads to the service. It does an amazing job clearing out the skin. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> The one star is for the lack of labeling it green. I was expecting white clay and got green. I am totally disappointed, since I did not see anything about green in the description. So I cannot say anything yet about the clay itself, but I do not want to make green deodorant with it.</li>
            <li> Alittle work to get the mask made but it is great</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use on insect bites, pimples,  and for deep cleansing. This is so messy to use and it takes forever to dry. It&#x27;s a powder that you have to mix with water and I had problems getting it as smooth as the directions said it should be.. I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> definitely some tingling of the skin but i already see a difference in the appearance of my pores. wish it came pre-mixed because its a pain to do myself but well worth the extra effort</li>
            <li> I have larger pores and this mask is amazing. My pores are clean and shrinking. This container will last a really long time.</li>
            <li> Based on reading The reviews, I have used this twice to make a facial mask with a 1:1 solution of clay to Apple cider vinegar.  It makes my skin so soft.  Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> First, we will discuss the product.. because that&#x27;s what this is a &#x27;product review&#x27;. Very easy to mix, I use a 1 cup glass sugar spoon and a wooded butter knife to stir this product with Bragg&#x27;s Raw vinegar. it can either be extremely messy or quick and easy; that depends on you. if you use this product 15-20 minutes before your shower there is virtually no clean-up, However; after receiving the product and excitement gets the best of you to the point of timidity running to put it on, the wash off process will leave your powder room, green all over. so use before a shower. So far all i can tell you is my skin is soft, and rather red. but the redness is fading after about thirty minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW ON DELIVERY:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was ridiculous. one star out of five. Because I feel like I could have got this much much sooner than the expected arrival date.&lt;br /&gt;I felt as though they didn&#x27;t want to get it to me &#x27;to soon&#x27; it sat at my LOCAL ups office for three days. it sat at a ups office for two days that was only one county over.</li>
            <li> over the years this is my second jar which comes in plastic and is durable,this is a good face toner it you mix with water its a sacred mud thing if you try it its a jar of all you need for a healthy complextion water is needed 2 mix and until smooth apply and let get totally dry on face that is all 2 it and i suggest you 2 get it off with a washcloth you will get instant results my skin us usually red its the blood circulation thats come back it drys like all facial mud and feels crackly but is worth the time use of 1 time or 2 times daily i suggest use when going some place special or a little time before a bath this is a natural product you wont be dissappointed</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, works great to cleanse skin!  Love it for acne control.  Very drying, don&#x27;t forget your moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The only thing i experienced with miracle clay is the sensation from tighens face while staying on.. and it helps acne .</li>
            <li> I got the recommendation online, but it did not work for me. I can&#x27;t really tell the difference. I just feel a little bit smoother but I think all kinds of clay mask can have this kind of effect.</li>
            <li> This product lived up to it&#x27;s claims. I was pleasantly surprised by it&#x27;s effectiveness at clearing my problem complexion. I had been experiencing a troublesome acne breakout due to hormone replacement therapy ( I am over 50 and post-menopausal). The Healing Clay was better than all the other much more expensive anti-acne type products that I had wasted my money on before trying this. I will be using this product from now on :o)</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping and praying it would help clear up my face. It does clean okay but its making me break out more then ever. i use it with the Apple Cider Vinegar does nothing for me, i tried the water still no results. ive used it 4 times already..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;im very sad.. i thought this was my cure :(</li>
            <li> I think this clay powder makes a nice face mask couple times a week when you want to pamper yourself.  I don&#x27;t believe all hype with reduce pore sizes and completely free to acne, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it to do the following&lt;br /&gt;- Tighten skin temporarily. If used religiously, you might be seeing smaller pores, but after a while of not using it, pore size will turn back to how it was&lt;br /&gt;- Calming skin.  I feel the acne areas are less red the morning after I use the clay.  However I would like to point out I always use benyozl peroxide 2.5% at night as acne treatment.  I did not rely on this product alone to treat acne.&lt;br /&gt;- Less Oily. I find my face produce slightly less sebum throughout the day on the day after I use this clay.  By that I mean I blot at noon instead of 10:30AM.&lt;br /&gt;- Make up stays better.  This could be result of face being less oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I want to provide my little experience in working with this product as first few times I had some issues and could not find help online.&lt;br /&gt;1. Recommending tools? bowl, I use a ceramic ramekin I keep in the bathroom just for masks and stuff; a plastic spoon to scoop the clay powder (I break the handle so it&#x27;s short enough to keep inside the jar), a plastic fork for mixing (find heavier duty forks), lastly, ELF $1 foundation brush (its complete plastic bristles makes it a good clay applying tool, easy to clean up too!)&lt;br /&gt;2. How much water should I use? I recommend starting out with the same amount of liquid you think you will need as masks.  If you need 5 tablespoons of clay? put 5 tbp of liquid in the bowl.  In this case you will not waste product or end up making another batch because you didn&#x27;t make enough.  I use about 2 tbp because I lay my mask as thick as possible.&lt;br /&gt;3. Mask too clumpy? Again, start with water, then add one spoon of product at a time.  2 tbp water requires about 2~3 rounded spoonfuls of clay powder.  Use the fork to mix the product well before adding the next spoon will ensure you get a smooth texture!!&lt;br /&gt;4. Face turning red because the clay bits are so hard to take off? First of all, avoid hairlines, it will make cleaning process a lot easier.  Second, I recommend using thick layer of clay mask, and wash it before it completely dries.  Feel free to enjoy the paluse feeling as long as the clay surface is still dark green and in chunky pieces.  when clay mask breaks into small bits then you will definitely have problem taking it off.  Excessive rubbing will make your face red.  That happens to every product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope these information will help you guys making the most of this product (though it looks like 1lb will last me years...)n will ensure you get a smooth texture!!&lt;br /&gt;4.

            <li> it&#x27;s very big one ,1pands can use many times .&lt;br /&gt;when i use i need to add the water not very easy to use.</li>
            <li> As a face mask, I&#x27;m not really impressed. The only thing it seemed to do was dry out my skin. My face felt a lot smoother, but then it dried out and peeled. The same thing happened when I used it in a detox bath.</li>
            <li> I guess I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but wow what a deal! This is a pretty large container of a dry clay powder which is reconstituted with water or it suggests apple cider vinegar so in reality the giant tub you receive is doubled in amount of product. I do think that the 1/4-1/2&amp;#34; application suggestion is a bit absurd I just use a small layer and I feel the difference with just that amount (less wait too because I&#x27;m impatient). My only concern is: how do I get all of the lumps to go away? That was the most frustrating part for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is no joke. I used this in my fishtank, I ingested it, I made a mask and washed with it and each usage showed positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plants use the minerals and trace elements in it to grow, it clouds water for a few days tho.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get a recipe from YouTube or google and follow it 100% and you will see its cleansing effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On your skin it drains impurities and oils out or into a head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price made me wait skip this product a few times but once I baught it it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like having to mix my face mask.  The few times I did use the product, I definitely felt it working. I just wish the product were sent in a package fully ready to apply.</li>
            <li> I have sooooo much leftover. I use part water, part apple cider vinegar (organic, which is cheap) and my blackheads are less visible and makes my skin smoother. Definitely makes me red after 30 minutes of taking it off, but that goes away -- don&#x27;t worry! Hmm, great great price for all that you get and because it works. I&#x27;m not sure how well it works for pimple pimples because I&#x27;ve been taking Pantothenic Acid pills that have been the only thing actually getting rid of my can (which I highly recommend!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s a nice mask, kinda clumpy if you mix just with water, but with apple cider vinegar/water it bubbles and is less clumpy. Doesn&#x27;t pulsate much unless left on longer than 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this! Been using it for a month now and my face feels smooth and soft. It has decreased my breakouts making them almost nonexistent. Really a must face product!</li>
            <li> Really good for oily, acne prone skin.  Its too harsh for me but the teenage son uses it frequently.  It really does pulsate.  Idk how.</li>
            <li> Ok - I rarely ever write a review but I gotta tell you guys - this stuff is amazing. I have had bad skin all my life. I mean, like - 30 years old and still using over the counter acne products - been on meds for acne- changed my diet - done it all. We&#x27;re talking - concealer all day long to hide the hyper-pigmentation, acne, black heads, scarring. Its a mess. I hated my face - I hated showing it to the world. Anyway, I went to get a facial a few months ago and my esthetician told me about this clay. She had perfect skin and was 27 and told me she&#x27;d had terrible skin all her life and this clay did the trick. I was skeptical I&#x27;ll be honest, but I bought it ( who can say no at this price) and tried it and HOLY MACKERAL - this stuff.. its like from some alien world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all - mix it with apple cider vinegar NOT WATER. ACV is SO good for your skin and it just helps heal it so much better than water. Its gonna smell strange if you arent used to ACV but thats ok :) It also mixes better than water does with the clay. Do not use anything metal with this clay - I use a wooden bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is going to make you feel like your face is in a vacuume - it hardens to a rock-hard shell on your face and your face will pulsate like it has a heart beat. Let it be known that its not a comfortable feeling, and it freaked me out at first, but you get used to it - and start to even like it ( weird I know ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok now for results. The first time I did the mask, I didnt notice very much of a difference, except that my skin was bright bright red for an hour. However, after using it 3 times a week for about a month, i&#x27;m noticing a HUGE difference. Its occurred to me now that it was working all the time, and It just took cumulative progress for me to finally really notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When i use the mask now, my face afterwards look younger every time. My skin plumps and is so supple, and if i have acne in a certain spot - it will be reduced to almost nothing. Hyper pigmentation always looks so much better - sometimes the marks are completely gone. My make up slides on smoother, and i&#x27;ve been using way less concealer than I used to. My scarring seems to even be fading. Its kind of miraculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to keep using this mask and have begun using it on other parts of my body that also have acne. Point blank, this is an inexpensive way to heal your skin!!! I am so glad I found it, and I can&#x27;t wait to go back to my esthetician and show her my results. That is If i even need her to do a facial! :). Hyper pigmentation always looks so much better - sometimes the marks are completely gone.

            <li> This mask is very effective!  I use it with apple cider vinegar when I&#x27;m having a problem with break-outs, and it seems to help within a day.  After the mask comes off, my face is red and shiny (the redness goes away) and my breakouts lessen seemingly overnight!  Love this and will repurchase!</li>
            <li> my significant other use these and he loves this product and I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to buy it</li>
            <li> I mix it with ACV.  Makes skin feel so great!  Definitely worth the purchase. Just make sure you have a heavy duty moisturizer to use after.</li>
            <li> Wow. Just wow. I love this stuff!!!! So natural and works wonders. I have pretty good skin to begin with, but using this mask makes my skin look so much more even and soft. I use this with Bragg&#x27;s Apple Cider Vinegar and man does it take care of any break outs that come my way. I was starting to break out on my chin the other day and all I had to do was make a small mixture, apply it to my chin, leave for 20 minutes and repeat the next day and BAM! Pimple? What pimple? It was gone. This stuff works for me! But I would definitely advise using only apple cider vinegar with it and not water. I used water with it the first time I used it and it just doesn&#x27;t have the same WOW factor. The ACV makes it into a better mask in my opinion. Anyway, I use this stuff a couple times a week and I can&#x27;t get enough. Period.</li>
            <li> Does everything it says it will do.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this mask. I mix it with water and use it 2-3 times a week.  I can go without makeup and feel confident my skin looks great!</li>
            <li> Seriously the most AMAZING and most affordable mask for oily/acne skin!!!!! I never found a cheap, affordable mask that worked so well. I suffered from horrible breakouts. It wasn&#x27;t all over my face, but under my chin, on my chin and lower parts of checks would get these big cystic acne clusters. I am on acne medication which has helped, but this stuff has forever changed my skin / skin routine. I use this mask every other night (if you don&#x27;t have acne / oily skin or if your skin is really dry and sensitive, I would only do 1 or 2 days a week at very most and see how your skin does). It is very drying after even for more, which is good for my oily skin. I barely get oily skin throughout the day anymore. I use this product with my acne medication and then go on top of my acne medication with a very heavy over night cream. Im telling you, this is revolutionary.</li>
            <li> Great for the skin. Always use with Apple cider vinegar! !!</li>
            <li> First application, didn&#x27;t notice any difference. Second application, my face looked amazing. Apple cider vinegar works the best to get a creamy mixture, but I can NOT stand that smell. So I do half vinegar and half water and it becomes more bearable. Using just water, the mixture is pretty lumpy and thus more difficult to apply. I still have breakouts but not as badly and I think it has helped even out my complexion.</li>
            <li> I just used a little bit of my roommate&#x27;s tub of this and let me tell you that you need to try this stuff! It makes pretty big claims, but it lives up to them. It sucks your face off while it&#x27;s drying but at the same time it&#x27;s sucking out all the crap from your pores. Feels pretty cool! It was hard to get it to not be clumpy but that didn&#x27;t seem to be a problem. It COMPLETELY removed all the stubborn blackheads from the creases of my nose, and that is a wonderful feeling. I recommend showering, brushing your teeth, flossing, mouth wash, then use this stuff, then moisturizer and you will feel like a new person! By the way I just used water.</li>
            <li> Loved this! Didn&#x27;t sting or burn or leave my face red at all. It did stay clumpy which was annoying but maybe I need to mix it differently. Left it on for 30 minutes. I really think it comes down to your face and how sensitive your skin is. I read some of the bad reviews -everyone&#x27;s skin is different! That&#x27;s part of trial and error. I have mild acne and big pores. I&#x27;ve only used this once and so far so good. I will update in a month to let you know if it helped or worsened my acne.</li>
            <li> Using this product Actually feels like I&#x27;m in a spa with this masks on. It tighten my face and made it feel rejuvenated!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t help with scars and pores</li>
            <li> Tried this from a friends recommendation and felt my pores open up considerably. Now want to have it used on my back where I normally breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use - highly recommend mixing with Apple Cider Vinegar.</li>
            <li> WOW! Best i ever had!</li>
            <li> i love this product! i have used it three times and each time my skin has gotten better and better! i don&#x27;t have problematic skin, just the occasional breakout . which i had before i used this, the morning after i used this mask (the clay mixed with water) i noticed my zit was almost completely gone. after the second time, it&#x27;s no longer there and even some acne scars have faded. i don&#x27;t have to wear much makeup anymore my skin looks and feels flawless &amp; even. it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> good face mask. tamed larger whiteheads and gave skin a glow.</li>
            <li> I actually really do like this product. I did notice that if you try to mix it with just water it has a very clumpy consistancy and I did not care for that. I did however end up ordering the organic apple cider vinegar from Bragg&#x27;s after using just regular appler cider vineger from the store gave me a horrible allergic reaction. I was kind of scared to try vinegar again but I did give the organic Bragg&#x27;s apple cider vinegar a try and it was to harsh on my face at all. The down side to this product though is that I think it works best if you don&#x27;t wear makeup. I don&#x27;t wear makeup often and the first week that I did the mask my face was looking wonderful but, after I wore makeup one time my face was broke out. I have sensitive skin so I was hoping to find a product that would help with my breakouts when I do occasionally wear makeup. I am aware that this isn&#x27;t the products fault but, I guess I had it built up in my mind as a miracle product so I was a tad disappointed when my face did break out again after wearing makeup just once because, I thought this stuff cleaned your face down inside the pours and everything. Another thing that I was not super thrilled about was how tight it gets on your face as it dries. I mean I read reviews where people said that their faces throbbed and I was thinking &amp;#34;no way, they are exaggerating! Their faces didn&#x27;t actually throb.&amp;#34; But, it is infact true! As the mask hardens I could actually feel my face throbbing and could barely open my mouth....Most of the time I have to take it off before it is completely dry because, it starts to hurt a little bit. BUT needless to say this actually is a great product for people that don&#x27;t wear makeup, or for people that don&#x27;t have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great value and good product.</li>
            <li> Amazing tight cleansed skin. Especially after your skin has been over exposed and looks tired, try it. Use it with organic vinegar rather than water. A little goes a long way, so you will get way more facials than the description says.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed. I have problem skin...adult acne has been a pain in my butt and when I read the wonderful reviews for this product, I was really excited to try it out. It tingled and made my face red, which was to be expected. So I thought that meant it was working. Nope. My pores were still clogged and I continued to get acne even using this product twice a week. I went through the entire container and have not seen in a difference in my skin AT ALL. Luckily this product is cheap. Maybe my skin is just stubborn...</li>
            <li> This stuff is worth the hype &amp; the five-star rating. Don&#x27;t be torn down by the poor ratings... I mean, it&#x27;s difficult to take someone seriously with atrocious grammar, &amp; no common sense, am I right?&lt;br /&gt;  Now back to task at hand. I am a 30-year-old female, with moderate breakouts, stemming from hormone fluctuations &amp; stress. I&#x27;ve tried all the fancy washes &amp; systems, but nothing worked to keep the zits at bay! I switched to a tea-tree based cleaner (with a small silicone scrubbing pad for exfoliation) from The Body Shop, every evening. In the mornings, I rinse with warm water, then use witch hazel as a toner. I&#x27;ve been using this masque for a few (9) days now, &amp; the pimples are on the run... I tell you, it&#x27;s clearing them up so much! I follow up with the Olay 7 moisturizer (I&#x27;m old, haha!).&lt;br /&gt;  For the price (a whopping $9 &amp; free shipping), it&#x27;s worth a try. Yes, the apple cider vinegar smells, and may burn a bit... it&#x27;s dilute acetic acid. Using the masque in conjunction with the ACV, the oil is reduced, &amp; the impurities (makeup, environmental, etc) are easily drawn out. If nothing else, my skin feels amazing. Even my fiance has noticed the radical difference in this short time frame. I don&#x27;t smear it all over my face each time, just every third time so far. I really wanted to see the effect on the problem areas (chin-to-lip area), which is grand.&lt;br /&gt;  So spend the $9, &amp; give it a try! :-)</li>
            <li> Omg I love this clay mask clears up my skin! Deep cleans pores! Will always purchase this mask! Never gonnna use any other mask!</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay, this is one of the best masks I&#x27;ve tried. I mixed it with Apple Cider Vinegar, I was afraid to put it on my face but after a thin layer I felt it working so fast! I left it for about 15 minutes and rinsed it out with warm water. I saw the difference immediately after removing it, I had a lot of white heads and most of them where gone. Can&#x27;t wait to try it again to get a clearer face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and its absolutely amazing for people who have blackheads and dirty pores. It cleans and minimizes. I used it on my boyfriend who had horrrrrriibbbllleeee blackheads and the mask wiped them out all at once. This stuff is just pure amazing.</li>
            <li> use three days a week and works like a charm, use with apple vinegar for best results!</li>
            <li> Love this clay. Really love that it doesn&#x27;t have all the additives that other clay masks have. I will be using this for a long time. The only downside is my husband calls me \\&quot;Shrek\\&quot; when I use it, makes me grin and then the mask cracks! I have to learn to stay in the bathroom until it&#x27;s totally dry!!!</li>
            <li> this product is actually really good! I mixed it with apple cider vinigar. And put it on my face for about 20 minutes. After I washed it off, I can see reduced of black heads and my skin was so smooth!! Not so much changes about the acne. But good enought!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve read the negative reviews on here and the positive ones and yes, I would say all those reviews that keep using the word \\&quot;pulsing\\&quot; is just weird and probably not real. For the people that say they got wrinkles, well I just don&#x27;t know what to say about that. I have really oily skin so I guess that helps me keep away from wrinkling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anywho! I don&#x27;t use this as an all over face mask bc I personally think it&#x27;s best for people that get those nasty, ginormous zits that take like two or three weeks to go away! I have acne prone skin, especially around my period and I swear every two months I get those huge, mountain sized pimples that usually take a week or more to completely surface and then another week to pop and get all the grossness out and then another week for it to disappear, sort of. I hate it. It just makes it impossible to feel comfortable being in front of people. So I bought this stuff, in hopes it would help somewhat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well it does! Yes, it really pulls on your skin, like it&#x27;s trying to suck your face off (insert, \\&quot;That&#x27;s what she said,\\&quot; for all you &#x27;Office&#x27; fans). I guess this is where people say their skin gets temporarily wrinkly. However, for whatever reason, when I use it, it ALWAYS pulls the nasty ooze stuff up and out. Every single time. So normally when I get a bad break out and it takes a few weeks to get rid of it, this stuff always brings that down to a week tops. And I&#x27;ll use it multiple times too which expedites the pimple process even faster. Pimples have cores and if you don&#x27;t get rid of that core, it&#x27;s just going to keep growing and spilling out ooze. I have some of this mask on my chin right now bc my face decided to erupt like 3 zits in one spot. Those are the really bigs ones I use this mask for. After one use I was able to squeeze out the pus and it went down to 1/3 its size. I use it again to help drain out whatever is left (since it pretty much always opens up the pimple after taking the mask off)and then if it&#x27;s still a little puffy or I just want it to scab over and heal even faster, I&#x27;ll use the mixture one more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re acne prone like me and you want to speed up the pimple process, I say go for it. But don&#x27;t use it where you don&#x27;t need it. I don&#x27;t think of it as a mask to make your face smoother and vibrant but as a pimple killer! I&#x27;m sure the apple vinegar is totally an acting agent with helping but out of every mask and acne product I have ever used, this is the only thing that has ever shown the fastest results and gotten rid of those mountainous zits in a speedier manner.t&#x27;s still a little puffy or I just want it to scab over and heal even faster, I&#x27;ll use the mixture one more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re acne prone like me and you want to speed up the pimple process, I say go for it. But don&#x27;t use it where you don&#x27;t need it. I don&#x27;t think of it as a mask to make your face smoother and vibrant but as a pimple killer!

            <li> Nothing special...theres no pulsating whatsoever. It doesnt do much to the skin, but I guess I will just keep using it.</li>
            <li> This product has saved my face! I ignored the reviews saying to use apple cider vinegar because i had dry skin. I had bad cystic acne that wouldnt stop spreading across my face and I thought adding vinegar to the mix might make my skin drier and irritate it more. Boy was i wrong. I used it for about a month with just water (every night) and then saw no improvement. I stopped using it for like 2 months to move on to different solutions. I started using it again because i had some apple cider vinegar at home. IVE BEEN USING IT EVERY NIGHT SINCE THEN AND MY SKIN IS ALMOST CLEAR - I still have scars but this is slowly helping. I use this mask and then hop into the shower. I use witch hazel as a toner then use mu tria blue light (pricey but worth it) and moisturize with argan oil. Using all of the above has cleared up my skin and are preventing new ones</li>
            <li> Well I bought this product the beginning of February, used it every night becuase it says you can use it more a week if yoy have problrms. So i used it with water and with a face wash. I&#x27;ve waited weeks and the only thing this mask has made me was to break out. It did remove the black heads from my nose buy it broke me out even worse. Maybe it&#x27;s because I used it with water but I&#x27;ve waited like a month to see improvement and each day I would wake with more break outs. Never again.</li>
            <li> Love the product!! It really makes a difference on my skin!! And it lasts a long time!! I love how I feel after I remove it from my face and I have also noticed that my face feels and looks smoother!! A must in every womans face kits!!</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time and and it itches and burns while its on my face. I have sensitive skin so I leave it on my face for about 15 minutes. It cleaned out my pores very well. Its a good product, would buy again.</li>
            <li> My first attempt in using this clay was last night. I missed equal parts with apple cider vinegar (raw)and  it came across as a little on the runny side, but honestly after reapplying to my face, it applied fine. My skin was tightening that I can barely move my facial muscles lol. It felt wierd and good all at the same time :) I had a 20 minute timer and kept it on for the fully 20 and rinsed off. Rinsing off was the most challenging and I may just get in the shower for this task. Prior to using this product, my face had some extremely dry patches (could have been burnt), but after the clay, my face feels even and soft all the way around. Since my adult acne has worsen in the last 5 months, this was my last effort before accutane. I&#x27;m honestly quite impressed at this product drawing out all the impurities and it most certainly feels like it does that. The instructions say to use once a week, but I&#x27;ve seen some reviews that this has been used 2-3 times per week. I&#x27;ll have to see what works for my body as I&#x27;m on a mission to stop this acne. I typically get anywhere from 1 to 4 pimples a day and so far today -NONE!</li>
            <li> This product sucks! It has only given me more acne. What the hell are all these misleading reviews !!!</li>
            <li> We love this! Use it as a face mask or use it to create a homemade toothpaste! I am sure there are more uses for it as well. You don&#x27;t need much to make a mask so this jar will last a LONG time!</li>
            <li> i likes. its clay. and its a mask. clay mask. i likes</li>
            <li> any time i have a pimple i would put this on my face and it would help to get rid of it. its also great in bring black heads to the surface. i bought this product about 3 months ago and i still have alot left. its easy to apply and remove but the process can get messy. other than that its excellent</li>
            <li> This stuff leaves  your skin feeling nice and clean use it with Bragg Apple Cider Vinegar..I will buy again!</li>
            <li> I bought this on a recommendation from someone online. I was looking for something to help with adult acne. It seems as though when I entered my 30&#x27;s my face reverted back to puberty. So I bought this, a little bowl and brush and some apple cider vinegar. This stuff is amazing! AMAZING! I&#x27;ve been using it about 2 times a week and my skin is flawless. I noticed I was getting a pimple and immediately put a mask on. The pimple never became anything. The mask draws out all the toxins. My pores are smaller and my face is clear and smooth. Buy this stuff! It&#x27;s all you need!</li>
            <li> I have never used a face mask so I was kind of concerned about getting this as a starter but I am so happy I did. I havent used it a whole lot but its great because it doesn&#x27;t expire as fast as the other pre-made face masks do. Also, it is super easy to learn to use. I just youtubed someone using it and followed along. I loved using it and would suggest it to anyone who hasnt ever done face masks before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once so far and at first I wasn&#x27;t too impressed because I saw some whiteheads.  My skin felt very smooth and soft but then i noticed it was cleaning my pores! This is great for the price and I will share it with my sister!</li>
            <li> Does the job perfectly well</li>
            <li> Love this deep cleanser. The first time I used it on my face I kept it on for about 20 mins. When I took it off, the black heads on my nose were gone and my face looked cleaner. Great investment for a personal spa day.</li>
            <li> I got this product for my teens.  I mixed the powder with apple cider vinegar.  It worked great on my son with bad acne (whiteheads that pop up overnight) and very oily skin.  It pulled out the plugs and dried up his face.  On my other daughter who doesn&#x27;t have much acne, it seemed to irritate her skin a bit.  Perhaps she has more sensitive skin and with such minor blemishes doesn&#x27;t need a product like this.  But if you have problematic skin that is very oily, plagued with whiteheads, etc. this might be very helpful for you.  And the price is great!</li>
            <li> Natural is allways the best way, you can literally feel this mask sucking the dirt out of your pores</li>
            <li> Great! Has really helped with my acne.</li>
            <li> Excited to try it.  Happy with the amount for the price.</li>
            <li> As described, fast delivery, looking forward to trying it.</li>
            <li> Love this for managing my adult acne, along with apple cider  vinegar.</li>
            <li> I have only used this as a part of a remineralizing tooth powder. It does not have any flavor. I keep promising myself I will use it as it was intended, as a face mask.  BTW, there was a big question about using this in the mouth if there are metal fillings...I have been using it on myself and 2 younger children...all with metal fillings...with no problems.</li>
            <li> I love this mask! I used apple cider vinegar to mix. This mask starts to dry fast so I applied several layers. I definitely felt the pulling everyone is talking about. My face felt the softest it&#x27;s felt in a while. I use this once a week because I feel like it does a good job the first time around, and I do different treatments with other things throughout the week. I had pretty bad acne and this reeeeaalllyyy helped in the process of clearing my skin up. I think this is a must have in everyone&#x27;s cabinet</li>
            <li> Great product, bargain price.</li>
            <li> Felt like my skin was on fire. Broke out in hives after using it. Sadly, just not for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews alone and had to try it for myself.  I definitely was not disappointed!  I have long been a fan of charcoal masks and now of the clay. This product used once per week truly keeps my breakouts at bay</li>
            <li> Very much enjoy this clay.  My boyfriend and I used it on our face and back maybe once or twice a week.  I have bought multiple tubs of this.</li>
            <li> This thing is joke. After applying you may feel clear and clean . After a day or two, your skin will be darker than it use to be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product a few times. I hope as I continue using it I will see better results.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been so soft and blemish-free.  I was a little alarmed to read on the label, not just once but twice, in bold uppercase red font, that you will FEEL YOUR FACE PULSATE but am glad I didn&#x27;t chicken out!  My skin is a bit sensitive, so I only leave it on for about 5-7 minutes, basically until it dries and starts to get a tight, itchy feeling. (aka pulsate?)  It is kind of a weird, uncomfortable sensation, but it&#x27;s not too bad and the results are well worth the 30 seconds of discomfort while I remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tiny bit goes a long way, so it is also a great bargain.  I put about a tablespoon of it into a plastic baggie, add water, and squish the bag until the mud is a smooth consistency. Using a plastic bag makes it easier to mix than using a spoon, and is also a lot less cleanup.  Next I scoop it out with a plastic spoon, and apply to my face and neck.  When I start to get the telltale &amp;#34;pulsating&amp;#34; sensation, I wipe it off with a few damp paper towels and put them in the trash can.  This minimizes the amount that goes down the drain when do a final rinse with water.  Then I apply moisturizer and put the leftover mud in the baggie the refrigerator for another use.  I usually do it twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend giving this a try if you are prone to breakouts, as I am.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I wish I could use it everyday.  I love that it pulls so much dirt. This leaves my face so clean. I look forward to my weekly mask.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Extremely messy, I use a basin so it doesn&#x27;t go down drain and clog. But works wonders on my skin!</li>
            <li> Ok. I don&#x27;t normally believe all the reviews but THIS STUFF IS AMAZING! I have sensitive skin,large pores and uneven skin tone, I used this mask 2x a week and the very first time is used it (with apple cider vinegar) my pores were flawless &amp; reduced in size. Seriously you can have gorgeous skin for $8!!</li>
            <li> I truly believe in this stuff. I purchased it after seeing all the great reviews and the all natural ingredients as well as also having heard great things about it from a cousin who has great skin. I&#x27;m also a skincare junkie and have bought/tried several other masks but ultimately come back to this one. I bought it over a year ago and tried it for myself and loved it. I mix even parts Bragg&#x27;s apple cider vinegar and this powder in a glass bowl and mix it in with a facial brush. I leave it on until it&#x27;s dry and by then I am itching to take it off! The tightening and pulsating feeling it gives off reassures me that it is doing its job. I definitely feel like my face gets detoxified and when I take it off my face is tomato red. That only lasts for 15-20 minutes and I know my skin is being renewed since all the blood is drawn toward my skin and the circulation is intensified. After rinsing it off I use Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel and Rosewater toner I purchased off of amazon as well and follow up with an extra hydrating cream. (I currently use Keihl&#x27;s Ultra Face Moisturizer). I use it 4-6 times a month depending on how my face is doing with hormonal breakouts or the occasional pimple. It does pull everything to the surface and detox your face so you may notice new pimple growth afterward but it&#x27;s only because it is removing pimples which were growing anyways. If you use it again the next day or day after it will help dry them out and keep the skin clear. Hope this helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, after using this for a few months my sister discovered it at home and is addicted to using it too! And my mother wanted in on the mask after seeing us use it and now she makes it for herself as well! Not to mention other family members who have tried it after hearing about it and purchasing it for themselves.</li>
            <li> This will clog your drain</li>
            <li> Works as described. You really feel it when you put it on...but it is slightly messy so best to use on the shower not the sink.</li>
            <li> OK experience, but oh the trouble to put on and take off.  Face felt fine after first use with a slight burn from the moisturizer applied afterward. I may grade upward after a few more times but will not use this product more often than a few times a month. It applies lumpy and not smooth and does not remove easily. I have a mud trail all over the apartment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The skin does feel smoother and cleaner, so we shall see.</li>
            <li> Product left my skin very sensitive, think twice if you have sensitive skin. My face was red and irritated after using. Tried two more times and ended up with the same results. not a bad product, just wasn&#x27;t for me</li>
            <li> This product was awful for me!  After just one use, I broke out with pimples all over my face.  This is very upsetting for me, since I have spent a ton of money trying to get rid of acne, and just got close to succeeding when I decided to try this.</li>
            <li> Great product works very well !</li>
            <li> When they say, &amp;#34;feel your face pulse&amp;#34; they mean it.... As this stuff dries it draws on the skin so hard it felt like my sinus cavity might be pulled through my pores! It even triggered a small panic attack, but I&#x27;m very claustrophobic! Lol&lt;br /&gt;As for the results it produces, it does produces great results! My skin was very soft and the pores seem smaller. All and all I&#x27;m very pleased with the results it&#x27;s provided me. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product help with my face with a little time and patient. I got this for free and I have to said I was very skeptical because when i first tried it...I hated it. After that I have huge pimples from eating too much junk, so I reluctantly use this product once every week without complaining how stink and tight it is. I was amaze at the before and after pictures of myself and for the first time my skin is nice and  smooth. I felt good about myself and my nice delicate skin. I would tried to savor it because i don&#x27;t have much money to buy another one but who knows :D</li>
            <li> A great stand by,always excellent</li>
            <li> Purchased for a friend who has not complained about it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much!! My skin is incredibly smooth after using.&lt;br /&gt;I mix it all together (using my fingers) in a plastic container (With a lid), then I have it ready for the next time. I use the water and acv ratio.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne for years and i feel like using this product has worked to make my acne scars disappear.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful - I have very sensitive skin, and this stuff helps clean out the pores and leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This product dries out all of my juicy pimples! You definitely feel your face pulsating! This clay squeezes out all of the old sewage built up in my deep pores and minimizes those little pot holes, making my skin feel smooth with a nice soft glow.  I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> Perfect! The ship very quickly!!</li>
            <li> really worked on my acne prone skin</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product to me and after some research and reading all the great reviews, I recently purchased and gave it a go. It was pretty hilarious how quickly my face turned to stone... I made the bad decision to FaceTime people - laughing is not an option with a stone face but you can&#x27;t help it when people react to your nonsense! It was a conversation of &amp;#34;hahaha... ow ow ow! my face is cracking!&amp;#34; Still, fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked really well, and while my face was indeed red for about 30 min, that went away and someone actually said I looked tan later in the evening, which is a welcome compliment in the middle of the winter when in reality I was pasty white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face was nice and smooth and it seemed to clear some of the previously noticeable black heads around my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I would recommend is going slow at the combination of liquid to powder... I misjudged and did like a half cup of water/apple cider vinegar and couldn&#x27;t get the right consistency of mud without adding the whole container. So take it easy and start small, you can always make more.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just don&#x27;t like dirt - but I wasn&#x27;t please with this product.  There is just too much to wash off.  I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in my skin &amp; didn&#x27;t feel any tingle at all like some people said they felt.  Maybe I didn&#x27;t mix it correctly - but I won&#x27;t be giving it another try.  Sorry - this just wasn&#x27;t for me.  Yes - I did understand that clay is dirt when I ordered it.</li>
            <li> It worth in this price, will have little oil spot came out. but you need to have apple vinegar, works perfectly</li>
            <li> Best mask ever. I will never order another clay! Bf with oily skin...life saver</li>
            <li> WOW THIS WAS AMAZING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 28 yr old female with oily breakout prone skin. So far I have used this mask twice and it is amazing. I am going to use it daily for a week and see what happens.</li>
            <li> this product is GREAT!!  its the best mask on the market and you can really feel the natural mud cleansing all of the impurities from your skin.  It will make your face RED tho so use at night when your not going anywhere lol</li>
            <li> I have a really bad case of sebaceous filaments on my arms and decided to try it. First of all YES!! This stuff helped to slightly, this isn&#x27;t a miracle mask, reduce the appearance and that&#x27;s after the first use! Also it left my arms, definitely the next day, super smooth. My face feels soft from the mask I&#x27;m not sure about how well it worked for pulling impurities but definitely have softer and brighter skin.</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference after only one use. Smaller pores. Improved skin tone. Little annoying acne surface bumps disappearing. It&#x27;s a total mess, but worth it. Can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive it is too. I&#x27;m really excited about this product, after trying several expensive alternatives. Just try it, seriously.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my skin so clean and soft! I have larger pores and this really helps if I used it once a week. Remember that you are supposed to use this with ACV not water, ACV is great for your skin so the combination of these two really makes a difference. My boyfriend even noticed how good my skin looked after I tried this for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is that it&#x27;s kind of a pain to get off of your face because it&#x27;s literally dried mud so it takes some scrubbing and makes a mess. It takes me about 15 minutes to get this completely rinsed off. If you&#x27;re going to rinse this off in the shower I recommend putting some paper towels over the drain to collect the mud because this can&#x27;t be good for the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product though! The removal is just annoying. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this product...it is heaven sent.....I can&#x27;t stop using it .....LOVE LOVE LOVE....BUY SOME...it does work...works verywell for body wraps</li>
            <li> This stuff is truly amazing!!! Here are the reasons why you should buy this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Makes your skin tone even and calm&lt;br /&gt;2. decreases oil production by 75-100% (which lasts for days afterwards)&lt;br /&gt;3. you wont get any more breakouts if you use this regularly (for me 1-2 times a week does the trick)&lt;br /&gt;4. its cheap as hell and will probably last you a year if you use just a teaspoon or so at a time, which is all you need for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried everything to stop acne. nothing has worked completely until I found this product. if you&#x27;re like me and have tried a million products and remedies but still break out, please try this clay!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using before you shower to make the cleanup as easy as possible without having to scrub your skin to get this product off. I also recommend leaving it on for 30 mins and using a moisturizer (I use straight up aloe) afterwards. Don&#x27;t cleanse with your normal cleanser after rinsing this off just let it do its job with regular water. You could use a cleanser before applying the mask to get impurities off your face first if you choose. Also it makes your face a little red for about an hour. This is normal but plan accordingly if you&#x27;re going out after. Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> Where has this been all my life?!? I have struggled with acne and blackheads for as long as I can remember.I have tried so many different topical products. They are usually harsh on my skin or just do not simply work. I am so glad I purchased this product because it is heaven sent. Wicked excited about my new skin journey.</li>
            <li> As a novice home maker of things (soap, toothpaste, deodorant, shampoo, conditioner and other beauty products) I&#x27;ve found this to go a long way and works as reputed.</li>
            <li> Honestly works great!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this product because it was opened and it was used before delivery.</li>
            <li> I do see a difference in my pores. They are cleaner and they are smaller than before. I do recommend this product to other customers. I have been doing it the mask once a week if I can squeeze twice I do. I don&#x27;t do water because I feel it provides me with more results if I do it with Apple Vinegar Cider.</li>
            <li> This is one of the nicest calcium bentonite clay face treatments I&#x27;ve found outside a beauty spa. It&#x27;s pure clay, which means no fragrance. Thank you thank you thank you for not adding perfume.</li>
            <li> This is the best mask I have ever tried.  Definitely recommend using the apple cider vinegar to mix with, but the smell can be a bit overpowering.  The results are worth it!</li>
            <li> I have used peeling masks and pore strips to try to shrink my pores which exploded in size at around age 21and big pores run in the family. I use this product one time and as soon as I washed it off the pores on my nose shrunk significantly. I keep staring in the mirror because I cant believe how much smaller my pores are. The ones on my nose are almost invisible and I have not seen them this way in 6 years. My complexion was also really smooth after I washed the mask off. It does burn/tingle a teeny tiny bit so make sure you dont have any open sores. It is definitely a healing mask.</li>
            <li> Great price and product!</li>
            <li> works almost instantly and definitely clears up my skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mask several times now, as well as on my boyfriend, but I haven&#x27;t seen anything special or any improvement. I mainly wanted this for my pimples and on times of the month when I break out with cystic acne bumps. They&#x27;ve made my pores look a little smaller possibly, but that&#x27;s about it. And it also does get messy, even with the towel placement. So far I&#x27;ve just used water to mix it, perhaps I&#x27;ll try the vinegar method sometime.</li>
            <li> If I could give this 1000 stars I would. I saw it on pinterest and it was so cheap I gave it a shot. Cleared up my skin AMAZINGLY before my wedding. I used it 3x a week for about 3 months before the wedding. You have to moisturize well with this, I use St Ives collagen boosting moisturizer (about $5 at wallmart). My skin sucks it up like a sponge. I have PCOS and have horrible hormonal acne, you know the kind that is giant painful oil bumps that never pop? Yeah those. This cleared it up. I went and had a facial after the wedding, about 3 months later (using it 1x a week to maintain) and the girl doing my facial was blown away at how good my skin looked, literally no black heads to extract except that part just under your nose where you cant put the mask (hello vinegar). I used braggs organic apple cider vinegar (mother) with this and it foamed and made a nice foamy paste to paint on with a brush. You can literally feel your face pulsing. You WILL BREAK OUT after using this the first 3 or 4 times but stick with it, its getting gunk from the teenage years out (haha I&#x27;m 27) and its gross. Seriously, it will dry some out and make some come to the surface and its gross what comes out of your skin after all these years. From a PCOS diagnosed bride, this was a God send. Order it...now. On my second container (first lasted nearly a year! mix 1:1 tbsp. until you learn what you like for consistency and amount needed)</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have recently began to incorporate a weekly hair mask in my hair regimen (I have African American natural hair) and I must say that I recognized that benefits of this clay (along with other ingredients) on my hair.  I wish someone would have told me about this product a lot sooner in my journey to grow natural hair, because I truly feel I would be a lot further along than I am now.</li>
            <li> Loveeeeeeee it, works great on my skin.</li>
            <li> Works wonders. I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks now and I definitely notice a difference in my skin. It&#x27;s clearer and more radiant for sure.</li>
            <li> love this great stuff for ur face</li>
            <li> The best product ever!!!! My face is so different since I started using this!!!!!!</li>
            <li> good deep cleanser for skin</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me at all&lt;br /&gt;1. My face started to burn within 5 minutes of applying clay mask&lt;br /&gt;2.The clay started cracking like the mojave desert all over my face and Removing the clay was extremely painful..&lt;br /&gt;3. Once I removed the mask with warm/hot water my forehead swelled up at bit(small allergic reaction)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never had this problem with a clay mask ever, I&#x27;m disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this mud!</li>
            <li> I like the simple effectiveness of this clay.  It is a back to basics approach to skin care, providing a soothing way to deep clean skin, without a lot of  expensive extras. It is also quite gentle.  While it may, or may not have been popular with the Aztecs, I find it helpful for a home spa day or after a camping trip,  Of course, anyone with serious, or ongoing skin problems should consult with a physician, but for me, this is a pleasant and helpful product to keep on hand.</li>
            <li> i am 26-old man and tried this for few times and i can see the results after that. I strongly suggest this for men too but only thing is we need to be careful while mixing this with water as it forms lot of lumps. I wipe the clay off my face with tissue after 15 min of applying so that it will not clog the sink drain.</li>
            <li> Works really well. Sucks all the oils out so you can put the good moisture back in. Use with caution. It&#x27;s very powerful. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I ordered a large 2lb bag of this off of ebay. I ordered this jar before I realized it was the same stuff. Oh well, I have more than I need for a while.</li>
            <li> I bought this jar of dirt while black out drunk. I will admit that. But now I will cut a bitch if they even so much as sniff my dirt. I LOVE MY JAR OF DIRT AND I DONT CARE WHO HEARS! I&#x27;LL SCREAM IT FROM THE ROOFTOPS!</li>
            <li> My face looked like I was sunburned and it clogged up my sink.</li>
            <li> Four and a Half stars! No issues with it so far, except the mess (that&#x27;s expected, you&#x27;re basically playing with fine dirt). Made my skin smoother and has stopped new acne from forming on my face! Love it! Use your favorite, most nourishing skin cream afterwards, and your skin will soak it up!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I definitely recommend using Apple cider vinegar to mix with instead of water.</li>
            <li> Do not be deceived by its price because the product is better than that. It gets a little messy and takes a bit of work preparing, but its great. Little bit is definitely enough. Just slap some on before shower and wash it off. I wouldn&#x27;t use it too often though. I loved it so much, i made the mistake of using it too often and got a small dry patch. Oops</li>
            <li> First facial left skin a bit red...must have worked:) we will see what this clay can do in a longer usage, I&#x27;m planning on using it 1 time a week</li>
            <li> It really works for my oily skin and it arrived sooner then it said it would which was really exciting. I even tried it on my boyfriend and his skin got better.</li>
            <li> This is a must have. A little really goes a long way! this thing last forever! it leaves my face clean and clear. If you have oily skin then product is perfect. It removes all the dirt and excess oil without drying out your skin!</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this product because it put me over my $25 free shipping limit and I figured it made more sense to buy something with the $7.00 that otherwise would have gone to non-free shipping. I saw that it had a lot of great reviews and thought most of them were probably BS but oh well, it&#x27;d be a fun thing to do. The first two times I tried this product I put way too much of it on my face (the instructions tell you to put a 1/2 inch on your face??) and it never fully dried before I washed it off so I didn&#x27;t really see the benefits. Then I reread the reviews wondering what all this porno talk about \\&quot;throbbing\\&quot; and \\&quot;suction\\&quot; I remembered reading about was talking about. I found a review that said to only put a thin layer on your face and let it completely dry and that you would be able to SEE the blackheads that were pulled out of your skin in the mask. Still skeptical, I tried the mask for a third time, this time only putting on thin layer. The results were seriously incredible. I wish I had taken a picture. I could see little dots throughout the mask where dirt and oil had been pulled out of my skin. Once the mask had fully dried and gotten all crackled like it does, I was able to peel a few flakes off and see even more blackheads on the underside of the mask flake. My skin was a little red but nothing extreme, and after washing the rest of the mask off I put Vitamin E oil on my face and after 10 minutes my skin was glowing, rosy, and wonderful. This does not remove all blackheads in one go (so don&#x27;t get TOO excited), but I imagine if you do it every week or so your pores will continue to improve. Bottom line is this mask actually works for pore cleansing and it is really the only product I&#x27;ve used that does.</li>
            <li> I have always had \\&quot;problem\\&quot; skin and walked into a natural health store. The friendly cool girl recommended this product for my skin. In fact she said she gave up soap and used this clay for her face. I tried it and loved it. It works. It tighten&#x27;s up and you feel it working. I actually put jojoba oil in it once a day (and wow my face brightens up)I get up very early (4am) for work and while I make my espresso I put this on my face. It helps with any pimples or dull skin. I highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Great firming and exfolliating mask. Skins feels super smooth and pores look much smaller immediately. Smell from apple cider vinegar is a little unpleasant but the results are completely worth it! Will definitely recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> Oh the way this make my face look and feel after I use it is amazing. A little goes a long way with this product.</li>
            <li> Now this is a clay mask! Seriously this clay pulls, draws and your face really does pulsate WOW!  I mix mine with the recommended Braggs unfiltered cider vinegar (which I use anyway)  After adding the vinegar it fizzes.  I mix it till it looks whipped.  I use 1 tbl spoon of each and I leave it on till it&#x27;s dry.  It really deep cleans your skin.  The redness is from the clay increasing circulation to your skin, it goes away in 30 minutes or so.  I love it so much I used it 5 days in a row with no dryness or irritation.</li>
            <li> Would love! to know how much should I put on my face so that the mask won&#x27;t crack within the first few minutes?! This is the only problem that I&#x27;m having right now, other than that. I certainly fond this mask. I feel my skin pulsate and all of the gunk that&#x27;s been deep within my pores comes to surface, (remove in any method you find best) I didn&#x27;t purchase this through Amazon, I got it at my local WholeFoods. Get it there if it&#x27;s near you! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anticipating for anyone to tell me how to get rid of the cracked clay and make it smooth instead on my face.</li>
            <li> This clay isn&#x27;t just any clay. I&#x27;ve been tortured with oily, problematic skin since I was I was 15. I&#x27;ve lived in Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Georgia and now Oregon. Obviously your skin reacts differently to each different climate and altitude. My skin has been absolutely horrid since I moved to Oregon, I mean hybrid dry-oily skin that consistently breaks out and is uneven. Even on a so called \\&quot;good day\\&quot; my skin would be sore and ravaged with acne. So I purchased this clay powder because I have a holy trinity of 3 different masks to use each week for optimal skin performance and controlling acne/oil, a clay mask is one of them. It arrived earlier than expected and sealed perfectly. My boyfriend and I tried the mask, since my skin is so sensitive I mixed the clay with equal portions of aloe vera and water. As the package says, for the first 30 minutes or so after taking this extremely tightening mask off, our faces were red. The next morning though BAM!!!! My skin was toned, no dry patches of scale skin, no horrid break outs! My skin felt dewy and soft and had this gorgeous warm golden glow like I used to have before puberty. Even my boyfriend noticed the differences and reccomended we start using the product 2 times a week! It&#x27;s not every day you buy what appears to be a lousy jar of clay and it turns out to be a miracle product and works wonders for people with two completely different skin types! Never in my life have I experienced such a mind blowing mask, the effects are instant! If your smart then you research your skin/beauty products before purchasing them, look no furthur! There&#x27;s a reason why this clay has over 100 reviews of 5 stars, it literally is a miracle in jar!</li>
            <li> I used this mask for about 2 months with apple cider. But it really burned my skin so I decided use water but it doesn&#x27;t mix well, there&#x27;s a lot of lumps in it and really sucks. So fare it didn&#x27;t do much for my skin and didnt help acne.</li>
            <li> I picked this up at my local Whole Foods after reading several reviews. I must say I dont know what these people are using but it certainly isnt the same product I&#x27;m using. I followed directions and  applied to my acne prone face and saw zero results mind you I picked this stuff up in July, so I&#x27;ve been using it for quite a while. It hasnt cleared up my acne or blackheads. I&#x27;m not surprised as most products do not do as theyre supposed to. I will continue to use it as a mask and placebo myself into thinking its working. sad but true!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item about 2-3 weeks ago and have been using it every other day roughly on my face. It has helped considerably. I noticed that brown marks and acne scars and lightening. Plus for the most part is helps to control acne breakouts. It is a pretty intense product. I put it on my face and leave it on for 20 minutes. It has a tightening effect for sure. When I remove the product, my frace is REALLY red and looks like it has a sunburn. But I do this right before bed and go to sleep. The next morning, my face looks great. The container is large and I think it will last me a while. I am pretty impressed so far.</li>
            <li> Love this product, arrived on time. Make sure you buy raw Apple cider vinegar to mix with this product- DO NOT USE WATER! When mixed only with water this clay is way too basic and causes chemical burns.</li>
            <li> I love this clay mask. I mix it with Bragg Apple Cider Vinegar to create a smooth mixture. Apply it on my face, wait 15 minutes and TA DA!!!!!!! Be prepare to :::::minimize the appearance of pores, get rid of black heads, white heads, tighten skin, skin feels smoother and brighter. I even apply this on my body to get rid of tiny pimples on my arms and legs !!!!! I love love this clay. With over 70 minerals, what more can you ask for in an all natural product. Do yourself a favor and buy this!!! Your skin is begging you!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;I have a coupon code for this site if you want order the first time: CAW688 and you have 5$ off. The clay cost 5.99 and you pretty much pay 0.99 cent and shipping fees. Highly recommend -- &gt;&gt;&gt;iherb.com  (search for Aztec Secret, Indian Healing Clay)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update:: ive been using this after 3 months! my skin is flawless! no more white heads, black heads, or red bumps!!!! the clay literally sucks everything out!!! gross i know!</li>
            <li> This mask rivals all other much more pricey facial masks ANY day of the year! I&#x27;m african/amer &amp; i&#x27;ve always had problem oily skin. This stuff really sucks out all the impurities &amp; oil. It&#x27;s almost like having a chemical peel but you have to follow directions &amp; use the organic apple cider vinegar! I use vinegar &amp; a little water so it&#x27;s not too strong. You really can feel your face throbbing..that&#x27;s it working it&#x27;s magic! After i remove, i use Thayer&#x27;s rose witch hazel toner &amp; follow with Neutrogena&#x27;s fight &amp; fade gel for my dark spots. My skin hasn&#x27;t been this clear &amp; pretty in a LONG time! I dont have to use as much makeup to cover up...AMAZING! Get it...it WORKS!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice but my skin feels smoother. Some stuff came to the surface as well. I was worried that it would dry out my skin but that has yet to happen.</li>
            <li> Cleans enlarge pores and tightens the skin, i put it all over my face, neck and chest.My mom loves it as well:)</li>
            <li> I have never tried facial clay that was not already mixed. Mixing this is a pain but I love it. Once I apply it with the ACV it stays on my face for 15 minutes. You have to rinse this off with a wash cloth because near to impossible to get off. Afterwards I put on jojoba oil as not to irritate my skin. Do not put anywhere near eyes because of the pulling that occurs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been many years since I have written a review here but I have to for this purchase. This product is thoroughly amazing. It clears up irritation and redness in my skin, immediately minimizes my pores, and leaves my skin feeling cleaner than ever before. My skin is problematic in the combination sense - it can be oily and/or dry. This stuff hits the spot for both issues.</li>
            <li> Great mud mask. It will be lumpy if you mix it will water, but surprisingly smooth when mixed with apple cider vinegar. It does leave my face a little red for 20-30 minutes afterward, but not too bad and I always get compliments when I go out after using it :)</li>
            <li> OK, so I have had acne for a long time but this is the best product I have ever used. I&#x27;m not going to spend time typing a page to convince you to buy a product, just do it! I have only used this product twice(mixing it with apple cider vinegar) in one week, but all of my acne has disappeared. The only problem I have with this is that it dries out your skin significantly. Even thought my blemishes were dried out, I immediately seen specks of acne scars that appeared within two days. My solution is to use Ambi or Cape Fear Lighting cream on the dark spots at night.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a good product.  Love the way it feel after I use the this,soft and clean.</li>
            <li> seriously i have had acne and this cleared my acne so much! if i have a pimple i put this on my problem area and it goes away in 2 days i recommend this to anyone who has acne of black head it works wonders on problem skin :)</li>
            <li> I HATE THIS STUFF!!!  I tried it once using bottled water to keep it simple and pure (not vinegar as suggested) and as it dried, my skin started breaking out in large puss filled bumps.  So, I quickly rinsed it off my face and phoned my dermatologist.  He had to give me a Cortisone shot to counter act the effects of this &amp;#34;pure mud&amp;#34; on my face.  So, if you don&#x27;t mind paying $120 to a dermatologist to calm and soothe your skin and keep yourself from looking like a zombie with skin falling off your face, then go right ahead.  Be my guest and buy it!</li>
            <li> just try it once yet, it feels smooth after i wash it away from my face, hope it as good as it writes</li>
            <li> I have moderate acne breakouts and black heads/oily skin. I have been using it every other day and it has caused cystic acne on my jawline. I have cut down to about every 3 days to see if this is just the &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34; stage. Other than that I have noticed my blackheads going away as well  as my oil productions seems to be less. I will update in a few months to see if my acne has improved. I do like it so far, just hope the cysts go away soon.</li>
            <li> Makeup brush&lt;br /&gt;Small bowl&lt;br /&gt;ACV&lt;br /&gt;Clay&lt;br /&gt;The makeup brush works well as a mixer and applicator.</li>
            <li> Good facepack for all skin types</li>
            <li> I purchased this from a health food store and after sitting in my cabinet for a while I finally got around to using it. I had no idea that mixing it with ACV would create a fizzing effect and it puffs up the clay a bit. Which is good in my opinion because of the amount of clay that is suggested you put on. So in actuality you don&#x27;t need much dry mix and ACV. I used maybe two spoons of clay and just poured a guesstimate amount of AVC and the consistency was good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  So the part about feeling your face pulsate is spot on! Not only was my face throbbing but I felt like my face was shrinking! Oh, and a little advice, many times beauty products will say to apply a product to your face and neck so with that prior advice I did the same with this product. DON&#x27;T DO IT! Not unless you want to feel like you are being choked for 30 minutes! I didn&#x27;t even consider the thought until it began to tighten, and I don&#x27;t think I had that much on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Removing the clay is a bit of a task. I tried to peel and rub off as much as I could and toss it as to not clog up my drains. You can get a majority off this way but the areas around your hairlines will have to be washed off. Showering is the easiest way for me. I did notice some redness, and a few welts on my nose and on my chin. I imagine this was caused by the cracking of the clay and the exposed skin popping through the cracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Once I dried off I must say my face doesn&#x27;t feel dry, it actually feels pretty good. I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin and I left the mask on for 30 minutes before I began to remove it. I don&#x27;t have much experience with clay masks. I have used another brand recently that is ready made and you apply it out of the package, but this Aztec clay is far more intense! With less ingredients as well. So in conclusion I would recommend this product, just start slow and see how your skin reacts to it. I plan on using it once a week to clear up my mild acne and acne scars. Good luck!. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from acne for the last few years, and I&#x27;d wake up sometimes and look at my face and would feel like crying. I don&#x27;t get small acne, when I break out, I break out with cystic acne and whiteheads which hurt like hell. I bought this about a month ago, and have been using it since. When I put it on, I was a bit doubtful, but it really does feel like it&#x27;s pulling in your skin. It pulsates and tightens to the point of even giving me a headache sometimes. I use it with ACV and have never tried it with water, so maybe that&#x27;s it. I have darkish skin, not really dark, just tan dark, and once I wipe off the mask, even my face gets red. But my face feels lighter and looks much brighter right after. I still break out, but not as much as I used to, and they don&#x27;t last as much anymore. And when I do break out with cystic acne, the mask has a way of speeding up the process so that I&#x27;m not stuck with painful bumps on my face for months. It&#x27;s not perfect, but maybe the longer I use it, the better the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned: You will break out at first in the beginning! It brings out all the impurities which will definitely result in zits but that just means that it&#x27;s working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I suggest, that when wiping off the face, to use a handtowel. Soaking your face with it first, and breaking the mask up around your face really helps, because otherwise it really hurts. I usually wet it in sections and go back and wipe it off once it&#x27;s easier.</li>
            <li> This mask is unbelievable!  After the first use, I noticed a difference in the pores &amp; texture of my skin.  My skin was smoother &amp; looked more radiant.  I&#x27;m someone who has used so many different products because it has always been important for me to take care of my skin.  I mix the powder with vinegar &amp; it makes my skin tingle.  Give this a try.  I think you will be pleased!!!</li>
            <li> great product started using this two weeks ago already seeing results!! so happy!</li>
            <li> I live this!!! I noticed a difference within a week! People told me at work that my skin looks clearer! It&#x27;s a very affordable price. Won&#x27;t hurt to give it a try. This works better than proactive!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It has found a permanent home among my skin care routine. I was a little dissappointed in how long it took to ship from Amazon. It was over 2 weeks, even though it was listed as in stock when I ordered it. But the product itself is amazing.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews of this product before deciding to purchase and they were positive, but when I used it, it didn&#x27;t seem to have any noticeable changes after using for two weeks so I just stopped using it.</li>
            <li> This seems to clean really well and has marginally helped with my adult cystic acne, but oh good hell, does it ever ITCH. I can&#x27;t leave it on longer than 7 minutes without wanting to claw my face off. Is that normal?</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. I tried because of good reviews &amp; price. It was a pain to get off my face after it dried, then all it did was dry out my skin and irritate it. A day later I had 4 new blemishes. Total waste</li>
            <li> My acne is going away :)</li>
            <li> Feel the difference in just one try!</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel great also helps clear my pores I have been getting less breakouts.</li>
            <li> One of the best purchases I have made to help with my problematic breakouts each month! I purchase off of Amazon just about weekly for everyday deals and also the hard to find items that your local CVS or Walgreens might not cover. I appreciate when people write thorough and well thought out reviews that help others, so I will try to do that as well with this one. First, the amount of clay for the price is outstanding. I could get well over 2-3 months use from one tub. I have problematic frequent breakouts &#x27;that time&#x27; of the month and they range from just under the skin irritating pimples to full blown cystic nightmares. This clay, when combined with Apple Cider Vinegar (like suggested instead of water) works miracles on drying up and TRULY shrinking my pores. Make the mixture to a mid-thick paste, swipe it on, (I use a designated makeup fan brush) let semi-dry then add one more layer. 20 min set time and I can practically peel off the dried clay with my fingers and I have butter smooth oil-free skin underneath after a quick warm water rinse. For a price you can&#x27;t beat and frequent use its grand for us oil producing madhouses. It also works great for the quick redness/acne overnight spot treatment when you see one popping up.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this clay long, but it&#x27;s working wonders. I&#x27;m in my late 20s and I have mild acne, especially on my cheeks and forehead. The first time I used it, I mixed it with a generic brand of apple cider vinegar, and my face got really red and itchy after I rinsed the clay off. I almost didn&#x27;t try it again, but I decided to buy raw ACV (Bragg Brand--Amazon also sells it) and try again. I mixed 1 TBS clay with 1 TBS ACV, and that was just enough for my mask. It worked really well! My skin looked a little clearer after the first (successful) application. I&#x27;ve been using it every other day since and my skin has been improving. I would recommend rinsing it off in the shower, because it clogged my sink drain. After I rinse off the mask, I apply a little bit of Argan oil, which also seems to be helping my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the bumpy start, I love this clay for my masks. If you didn&#x27;t have luck with this clay, I would suggest changing the liquid you used to mix it. :)</li>
            <li> Finally a solution to my acne.  My face seriously has never looked better.  Definitely recommend using it with a good quality apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> I honestly expected more from this...It definitely helps clear up your skin but the consistency isn&#x27;t great which makes it really messy.  It will always be clumpy so don&#x27;t expect a smooth/soft mud type of feel</li>
            <li> I use this once a week an I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> One of the best pore cleansing mask, it is very powerful and you can feel your face pulsate and your skin tighten. For the quantity it is worth the price as it will last a while to finished the entire thing.</li>
            <li> I am amazed by this product! It takes awhile to dry, but I think that&#x27;s part of the fun with masks. I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference the night I did it, but the next day a lot of the little pimples had gone away, my skin was a lot more toned, some of the dark acne spots had lightened if not gone away completely. My blackheads lightened as well. Overall I am very impressed.</li>
            <li> With so many great reviews on this product, I decided to give it a try. My husband would kill me if he knew I was outing him, but I&#x27;ve gotten him using it as well. Mixing with apple cider as suggested is like a science experiment, making it more &amp;#34;guy-friendly&amp;#34; to my husband. I&#x27;ve been mixing this in a paper bowl so I can throw the remaining mix in the trash. Once mixed, it&#x27;s very thick. If I emptied the remainder down the sink, my husband&#x27;s agreeable attitude to using this would go down the sink as well…once he unclogged the sink pipes. I&#x27;m pretty sure you could mold a pottery bowl out of this stuff if you wanted. The smell isn&#x27;t the greatest, but tolerable. Once this dries, avoid any facial expressions because it will crack off in big chunks. Not the easiest to wash off, but my skin feels great after I use it.</li>
            <li> Really like this product. Have used it before in a body wrap. As a facial mask, it&#x27;s quite refreshing and leaves you feeling transformed... at least for the short term.  The tightening sensation is pleasant and the resulting skin is invigorated and vibrant.  Even better, it&#x27;s much less expensive than just about any facial mask product on the market.  I look forward to experimenting with the formula (recommended use: one part clay powder, one part apple cider vinegar).  I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s a great base for adding oils or other ingredients to address specific skin problems.</li>
            <li> So far, so good! Used it twice already, impressed.</li>
            <li> I have very large pores and can pick at them daily. I need to use this more consistently, it does a good job and my skin looks better. I use it in conjunction with Olay Pro X and Olay Microdermabrasion Peel System. Made my skin look and feel fantastic.</li>
            <li> Works well. When the mask dries though you can&#x27;t smile or else it hurts a lot. Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my pore size, but then again I don&#x27;t use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I used this once and could immediately tell a difference in my skin. Felt like a baby&#x27;s bottom for real!! I also had someone at work ask me the very next day what I was doing differently and said that I looked &amp;#34;well rested&amp;#34;. Needless to say, it shrinks pours and works like a charm. Can&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
            <li> I Do Not Like This Product At All.. Way To Messy!!</li>
            <li> Kinda hard to mix with water because it gets clumpy fast and doesn&#x27;t spread well. Be careful when you open it because its powder will shift and when you open it, it can be a mess. Haven&#x27;t used it consistently to know if it has many benefits yet.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this mask and I used it at least ten times, but it just breaks me out terribly! I understand bringing stuff up to the surface, I&#x27;ve worked in the beauty industry for 15 years, but this is just ridiculous for me. Huge, horrible pimples that weren&#x27;t there before and they don&#x27;t go away until I stop using this stuff. I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> Perfect when added with Apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li> This mask is really intense. It gets really tight on your face and your face will appear a little red after but that&#x27;s normal. It&#x27;s helped my acne on the side of my face. It&#x27;s very drying so I would recommend a follow up with almond oil or whatever you like for some moisture</li>
            <li> This is by far the best mask I have ever used.  You can feel it working the entire time its on your face.  Cannot rinse this down the drain, as it is truly mud, but worth the extra work.  It tightens my pores and helps to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> Why did I wait so long to try this!??? OMG it&#x27;s so awesome! I use it once a week and my face looks and FEELS amazing!!!! Buy!!</li>
            <li> To difficult to use it,my friend said it will burn my skin,so I threw this away!</li>
            <li> I received the package later than it said I would but that&#x27;s not a big deal. I ordered because of all the stuff it said it can do for my acne and what not. I&#x27;ve used it the past 3 nights and I have it on right now. So far I&#x27;ve only tried mixing it with water, not apple cider vinegar yet. I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference in the softness and smoothness of my skin. Also it decreased my pimple size and redness on my left cheek. A few pimples popped up on my forehead but I expected that because others said that would happen because the mask is pulling all the gunk out of your skin. It&#x27;s kind of uncomfortable to have on for me. My face is really itchy and I just can&#x27;t wait for it to dry so I can get it off. The packaging is not lying when it says your face pulsates cuz it definitely does! Also, it&#x27;s painful to get off your face I just wet it a little bit first the try to scrub/wash it off as fast as possible cuz it kinda sucks. I would reccommend doing this at night because your face is really really red after wards - like a sunburn! I&#x27;ll update with results</li>
            <li> NOT ANY DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER CLAY MASK.  VERY MESSY!</li>
            <li> What a great job it does for so little money!</li>
            <li> This clay will transform your skin.  I saw a noticeable difference after using it only two times.  My pores are looking smaller, blackheads are disappearing, and acne is clearing up. And it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this mask. I use it about once a week. My tips: Throw the package directions out the window.  Equal parts clay and ACV is a good starting point, but don&#x27;t be afraid to experiment with ratio to get a nice mousse-y consistency, and you really don&#x27;t need more than a teaspoon of clay (a far cry from the Tbs recommended on the tub). And putting it on to a thickness of 1/2 inch? Forget about it. Aside from being wasteful, I doubt it would even be possible to layer it on that thick. Also, the thicker it is, the longer it takes to dry (and if you&#x27;re waiting too long for it to dry, you might leave it on your face too long and cause irritation) and the harder it is to remove. Thin layer, leave on your face 20-30 minutes max, and hop in the shower to rinse off because it does not wipe away easily like prepackaged masks from the drugstore. Your face will be a nice shade of red everywhere that the mask was applied, but don&#x27;t worry, that&#x27;s normal and it fades. Just don&#x27;t do it before a first date and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> I was surprised it came fast in the mail. I was excited to use it, but a little nervous. Even w/ my first time using it. I was surprised, it did dry up fast. As suspected, but once I rinsed it off I could tell it was lifting and opening up my pores. My blackheads were almost (not completely) gone. My skin was soft too. Next time I will let sit longer for better results. My brother wanted to use the mask too, so far we both like it.</li>
            <li> Your just can&#x27;t beat clay for a great cleansing. Works great.</li>
            <li> nice but big mess after</li>
            <li> This works better than other mud masks I have.</li>
            <li> After spending hundreds of dollars on facial cleansing products I have finally found the one, I have never experience this much cleanliness on face before I have purchase the Mary Kate facial kit for over $50 and it was so useless. This mask works !</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Makes your face feel clean without drying it out.  I have oily skin and large pores.  This really shrinks the pores.  No irritation or redness at all.  I wash my face (and body) with Ivory soap when I shower and I use the mask once a week after I shower. I just eyeball enough of the clay to put on my face and add warm water to it as needed when I mix it.  It gets really clumpy/chunky though.  It&#x27;s better than the many creams and cleaners my dermatologist gave me.  I highly recommend it t anyone.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel great</li>
            <li> My face feels so clean after using this. My forehead and sides of my face get extremely itchy though! The mask is also drying so use moisturizer right after.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best there is. I use it weekly on my face and armpits. This was much needed when switching from commercial aluminum-filled deoderant to a natural one. This is so great for detox, I&#x27;m always left feeling amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is great! It is a product where you can actually tell a difference when using it. It is easy to mix and hardens quickly. It is a little hard to wash off but, the results and skin tightness is wonderful. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The ONLY thing that controls my acne.</li>
            <li> This stuff is no joke. Even on the packaging it says, &amp;#34;FEEL YOUR FACE PULSATE&amp;#34;, and it&#x27;s not kidding. It is intense and pretty inexpensive which is a plus. It is definitely much more effective with Apple Cider Vinegar but I get a good result with water as well.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm, right from day#1.</li>
            <li> It feels like the mask is massage you AS your your face is getting tight. Recomended</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this because I have bought so much other stuff in which did not work, but I love the way my skin feels after an application of this. You can tell results immediately however when you wake up the next day is when you can really tell. I read where this girl did two applications back to back so I tried it and got great results....I do two apps on the days my face seems super dull, other than that I use this 1-2 times a week.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and heard many recommendations online from this specific product. I&#x27;ve been using once a week with Apple Cider Vinegar and have had incredible results. Like others have noted, use non-metallic utensils and containers to mix with either water or apple cider vinegar. Directions on the packaging say to hold on your face for 20-30 minutes, but I&#x27;ve gone up to 60 with great results. I rinse this off in the shower (please use a screen catch in the drain as clogging can likely happen) and after about 15 minutes of redness have much healthier looking and feeling skin. This product, matched with daily apple cider vinegar treatments has dramatically improved my complexion. For my apple cider vinegar, I buy from Trader Joe&#x27;s- current price in my area is $2.50 per bottle making this a no brainer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope it&#x27;s as effective for you as it was for me!</li>
            <li> This helped my skin immediately. I used it once and my skin looked amazing. I didn&#x27;t expect such fast results. Forget all those expensive clay masks with additives...this is the one. My skin looks so smooth, air brushed, smaller pored, hydrated.</li>
            <li> This will leave you skin feeling sooo smooth... I suffer from severe cystic acne... if I were to rate my acne from 1-10 (10 being the absolute worst) I would say I am around an 8.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good-&lt;br /&gt;- Pulsates your skin (like a mini-massage)&lt;br /&gt;- Pulls out all the impurities&lt;br /&gt;- Reduces redness of acne&lt;br /&gt;- Helps smooth scars (I have awful rolling scars)&lt;br /&gt;- Gets rid of black heads (quickly too!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad-&lt;br /&gt;- Since I refrigerate mine it gets cold and can be unpleasant putting it on&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s mud, so going down the drain is a no-no. (But I do it anyway)&lt;br /&gt;- It can dry out your skin (but moisturizer will fix it!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product, and for the price it&#x27;s worth a try. :)</li>
            <li> This thing sucks the life out of my skin but not the blackheads, unfortunately. The only difference I notice after using it is my skin is redder and tighter than it was before. This did not exceed my expectations. Maybe you could use it after picking out the dirt in your pores though? It might come in handy then.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product, and I thought, well, sure. I&#x27;ll give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t dreadful, but it&#x27;s not my favorite. I&#x27;ve had better pore cleansers, but this one is supposedly natural. Unfortunately, it left a filmy feeling on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up purchasing something from The Body Shop, which worked a bit better (for me). Your mileage may vary with this!</li>
            <li> I give this product to all the females in my life on birthdays and Christmas. Bentonite clay works better on clearing my skin than any facial ever had. It is without a doubt the most important beauty product in my armory. It clears blackheads, exfoliates, softens skin and is made of pure earth, no added whatevers.</li>
            <li> No need to purchase expensive facials or products.  I have been using this product for 30 years and it works for acne, boils, and other skin ailments.  Be sure not to put it too close to your eyes.  Try to let it dry as much as possible.  I like using Bragg&#x27;s Apple Cider Vinegar with the clay for great results.</li>
            <li> I  am so happy I discovered this facial! It does everything it says it will do! This made my face look like a babies skin afterward. All of my poors were cleared out and my skin was glowing. You can literally feel it when it&#x27;s on your face so you know it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve only used this once (in fact I just finished washing it off) this works wonderfully. It felt odd while it was on, especially when it started to dry, and I&#x27;d suggest maybe not putting on quite so heavy a layer simply because it begins to flake, but once I washed it off my skin felt refreshed and soft and smooth, and my pores were visibly smaller. I bought it to help with my acne, so hopefully a few more times will show some results with that, although if all it gives me is smaller pores and softer skin I&#x27;ll be happy. It&#x27;s an excellent product at an excellent price, but it is mud, so don&#x27;t wash it down your drain unless you want to be replacing your plumbing later on.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy more when I run out. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> not nearly as good as some of these review say it is. I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say necessarily, it didn&#x27;t cause me to break out, which some products do. it did seem to clean my pores a little, but no better than any product I&#x27;ve tried. and its messy, and annoying to mix up. takes forever to dry on your face. just wouldn&#x27;t recommend. you&#x27;ll still have black heads after using this</li>
            <li> I buy this stuff all the time</li>
            <li> Missy to use and has tendency to dry out the skin</li>
            <li> I use this as a facemask. I mix the powder with a little water until it is a paste. Let it dry and wash it off. It leaves my skin fresh and soft! It comes in a big jar and will last me a while</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have always use this clay for yrs and I always get ppl telling me how young my skin looks</li>
            <li> Five Stars In Every Way*****</li>
            <li> Came super fast. and i love it! its so creamy i could have sat there and applied it all day. I used apple cider vinegar to mix with it, I used that on my face pryer because I heard its good for your skin. bottom line i love this. if you&#x27;re 50/50 on it like i was try it anyway. I have combination skin and have a little acne and i do see a difference in using it 1 time.. :)</li>
            <li> I have tried seemingly every product out there for my oily, acne prone skin.  After reading some of the reviews here, I decided to try it.  Trust me when I say that this product does not disappoint.  My pores are minuscule, the oil production on my face has slowed to a controllable rate, and any acne I have dries up overnight!  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> After reading all these amazing 5 star reviews, people saying stuff like it changed their life and all this I was like dang okay I gotta get this! I&#x27;m sorry to say that I was dissapointed though. I&#x27;ve been battling acne for a few years now and this mask makes your skin nice and soft and smooth, and makes it look more evenly toned and what not afterwards; but this did absolutely nothing regarding my acne. I mixed with apple cider vinegar and tried applying daily to weekly to every other day, nada. Not for anyone seriously trying to clear up.</li>
            <li> Scared myself the first time because the person in the mirror was green. For someone who was about to make the Guiness record for senior acne, it&#x27;s a lifesaver.</li>
            <li> Wife said: it was too hard to put on and was uncomfortable and didn&#x27;t do much. I could have grabbed some mud from the lawn and been just as happy.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s good. Make sure you have apple cider vinegar as the instructions tell you to mix it with it. If using water this will not have the right consistency . My skin looked really clean after using!It will tighten up on your skin. My pores really tightened up after using this and I will keep using it. Please rate this was helpful. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This clay is awesome!! I found some facial recipes online, and have been using them as often as I can. This clay also works wonders when added to bath water...very rejuvenating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had terrible acne prone skin since I was nine. I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING. Every kit, cleanser, toner, lotion, mask, potion, or whatever.. I&#x27;m now 26 and extremely tired of the merry-go-round of products.. I received an Amazon gift card for Xmas and somehow came across the link for this Indian healing mud. I read some reviews and was pretty surprised by all the good things people had to say. Then I saw the price and was even more surprised.. heck how could I not try it?! So I ordered it Sunday and it arrived Friday morning. I just got home and was so excited to find the package. First thing I should say to anyone wanting to buy this product- OPEN IT OVER THE SINK! I did not realise it was a powder and in my excitement opened it sitting on my bed...oops but no biggie there is so much in a container I doubt I&#x27;ll run out any time soon. Next advice LESS IS MORE- when it comes to mixing it. I grabbed a Tupperware bowl and poured quite a large amount of the clay into it which when mixed with the apple cider vinegar ended up making a huge batch. Oh well. One thing I&#x27;ve got to say though is that the packaging DOES NOT lie- it says your face will \\&quot;pulsate\\&quot; and it will! Its not uncomfortable though so don&#x27;t be scared. Now I have extremely oily skin so I used a thick layer like the container says but I can definitely see people with sensitive skin wanting to use a little less. I left it on for twenty minutes then rinsed with WARM water, and I&#x27;ve got to tell you while I was rinsing it off I could already feel a huge difference! My skin feels so soft I&#x27;m almost to tears..my skin has never felt this amazing and if you&#x27;ve gone through life wishing for beautiful skin you will understand why such a strong reaction to such a little thing. But to a woman feeling beautiful is no small thing.... I 100% recommend this product to people with acne prone skin. Hell, what have you got to lose?</li>
            <li> This products works so well I have to stop myself from trying to use it everyday.  After the first time using it, i was sold.  it tightens your face to the point where you can barely speak.  After you wash it off, your face becomes very dry.  it is best to moisturize as soon as you are done.  By my second time using the mask, my face felt like a newborn.  I had little to no blemishes.  its amazing!</li>
            <li> tightens poors, removes impurities, firms skin- 3 weeks of using this and my ance has cleared up, puffiness gone and blackheads shrunk!</li>
            <li> Great transaction and I am pleased with product</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really used this product enough to be madly in love with it..</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Leaves your skin so smooth and feels great!</li>
            <li> Works great for weekly use</li>
            <li> Great product, it leaves your skin feeling soft and beautiful. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Its a good Product . Nothing Exceptional or magical  .. i have used other similar products and they have done better job than this ..</li>
            <li> Just make sure to have apple cider vinegar on hand to mix.  Is heavenly and does what&#x27;s promised.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I was pretty skeptical of all the praising reviews but I was wrong! It works super great.  I&#x27;ve done a couple different application methods. First I tried the plastic baggy, and putting some clay in and I actually use a little more apple cider vinegar than clay. This way you can make it into more of a smooth paste then a chunky mess. Then I put it on with an old flat foundation brush. Works like a charm. I don&#x27;t have a hard time taking it off at all. I just use a paper towel and wet it, then let it soak on my face and get the mask wet. Then I wipe it off, with another wet papertowel, works like a charm. I&#x27;ve also mixed the mask in an old protein scoop, which works pretty well too. It&#x27;s easiest just to play with it till you find what works. The pulsating sensation is pretty weird, but enjoyable in a weird way. I love this mask.</li>
            <li> The front of the product has a Mayan temple.  The description mentions cultures other than the Aztecs.  I can find no research suggesting the Aztec used this.  The marketing is deceptive.  And it clogs shower drains</li>
            <li> Great product, I like it a lot.  You can pay a lot of money for a facial or do one yourself with this clay, and have fantastic results!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok so far, I&#x27;ve use it on face and it feel refreshed afterward. I also put some in my hair but I don&#x27;t think I used right.</li>
            <li> Love the way this feels! Great, cheap facial that makes skin very smooth and cleans our your pours.</li>
            <li> Loved that it came with a sealed label.  I&#x27;ve used this product once and I love it.  PLEASE follow the instructions on the jar.  It is rather drying but I have acne prone, oily skin so its great for me.  Just use a great moisturizer and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> Have only used it a couple times but love the results on my face it is more soft and clear of blemishes. Thanks</li>
            <li> Using this product is like having a mini facelift. The skin is so clean, smooth and tight afterwards, it&#x27;s amazing. Of course it doesn&#x27;t last very long, ha ha but for a little while you look 20 years younger. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and made my face feel so soft after applying. But I didn&#x27;t see much improvement on my blackheads.</li>
            <li> Makes quite a bit...a good bargain&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Excellent buying experience! The item was exactly as described, it arrived very quickly and was packaged very securely. The price was also the best on the internet, too. Great item, exactly what I wanted! Highly recommend both this item and the seller. Thanks very much!</li>
            <li> This facial clay does clear pores, but is hard to apply in just one even layer without ending up with a face full of chucks of mud.</li>
            <li> Great, works on your face!</li>
            <li> You can feel clay in action</li>
            <li> This will def. dry your pores out.  It is painful to remove from your face.  It causes redness, and you will have to moisturize after the wash is done.  This jar will seriously last you a life time.  It&#x27;s not that bad of stuff for the price.</li>
            <li> turns your face slightly red for 20 mins or so.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim as an add-on to my amazon order because of the great reviews and it truly is a fantastic product. I suffer from mild breakouts but what was even more frustrating for me was my pore size and skin texture. I had a lot of problem areas that were very bumpy and nothing seemed to get rid of them. I have used other masks such as GlamGlow to try to combat this issue but I couldn&#x27;t justify the price for the mediocre results. This product, on the other had, does exactly what it says it will. I have been using it 3x a week mixed with Apple Cider Vinegar and can&#x27;t recommend it enough. Amazing Product!</li>
            <li> Thank you for your service. This product is outstanding. Your delivery was great. A ok</li>
            <li> I bought the product to make homemade toothpaste. I haven&#x27;t done it yet, but I used it as facial mask. It cleans the pores very good. It&#x27;s kind of fun to have that muddy mask on your face. I managed to freak out my husband :)) It only burns your skin a bit after you remove it and it is red for a while, so it&#x27;s better to do this when you&#x27;re planning to stay in for the night.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff and it really works</li>
            <li> Best mask I&#x27;ve had. Can get messy since it is powdered clay in the container. Definitely can feel the suction but is no cure for acne or blackheads...</li>
            <li> This is a great mask for deep pore cleansing. I mix it with apple cider vinegar, and it gives a really cool tightening sensation on your face. The only downside to this is that it makes an absolute mess when you&#x27;re removing it. It gunked  up my sink and shower , so be prepared to have some extra time to clean your drains out after you use this. Other than that it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> I use this about once a week. When I use this, I like to mix some of my aloe vera juice and witch hazel in with some distilled water. It&#x27;s definitely will firm your skin, but is strong. Would not recommend this for someone with sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a makeup artist in the Sephora store and I must say it has been so effective! Deep pore cleansing is an understatement. Use it with vinegar and mix with a wooden spoon. Let it sit and dry... Rinse in bathtub as you shower to cleanse thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this clay mask to help clean up pimples I had on my face. It was a bit awkward at first because you can hardly move your face... so it is a bit uncomfortable and hard to take off. But it is so worth it because your face is smooth and it clears up pimples like magic!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I diluted the apple cider vinegar with water. I used 1/3 part apple cider vinegar to 2/3 part water. This mask cleaned deep into my pores and was not too harsh on my skin. I was red after rinsing, but like the product says it did go away after about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> This product works great.  I mix it with raw apple cider vinegar.  I usually leave it on for 20 + minutes (more than direction say to).  Face is only temporarily red for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this clay for myself as well as my parents whom both love it. I wash my hair with it, face masks, detox bath, bug bites during the summer freaking everything I can&#x27;t get enough and it last me for months. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Very good mask..Super drying. It pulls everything out!  So if you have lots of underground pimples, know that this WILL bring them out to the surface.  I would be careful with frequency of use.  I feel that if I use this like once a week it helps with detoxifying my skin.  However, be careful with too much use.  Your skin can become an angry red mess.  So this product is great!! Just don&#x27;t use too frequent or you will be left off with angry skin.</li>
            <li> i like it a lot pulsate your skin after 30mins ，take the oil out from your skin ，will buy it again！</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really just a nice clay mask. I felt the tingling, pulsing sensation that others claimed. My face really wasn&#x27;t red afterwards. It is a bit messy to mix, and I found the Ziploc bag method to be the best as it allows you to mash the mixture to avoid chunks. Be prepared to mix it for a few minutes. I spread a very thin layer on, just enough to work, not thick enough to crack and fall off. It really doesn&#x27;t take a thick layer. Next time, I think I&#x27;ll make it thinner and just brush it on. My skin was noticeably softer and pores were visibly smaller for about 2 days afterwards. I have mild to moderate acne and combination skin, but I can&#x27;t really call this stuff a miracle. It was just as effective on my acne spots as any other mask I&#x27;ve used. What I really noticed was how firm and soft my late-30s skin felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Simple, natural clay mask, great for weekly or twice weekly use. Noticeable improvement in skin tone and reduced pores for about 48 hours after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Messy. Be prepared with moist towels handy for clean-up, watch out for your plumbing, and have something to store leftovers because You&#x27;ll never make exactly the right amount.</li>
            <li> I love love love this, I am 22 and have mild acne problems, I use this for about 45 minutes a couple times a week and it really keeps the pimples away! I use apricot scrub afterwards, and moisturize with burts bees natural acne solutions moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Very good to oily skin. I used it with few drops of cider vinegar and mix thoroughly and used as masque, better than other items you bought at stores which I tried before I switch to this. It makes your skin smoother, firmer as it removes dirt and oils. Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it is doing but it burns and when you take the mask off your face is red for a good 30 minutes. I would definitely keep using it to see if I see improvement.</li>
            <li> Good mask, the first time see the result! Super</li>
            <li> I bought this mask because I have heard it compares to Glam Glow (I&#x27;m guessing their Thirsty Mud) While I have never tried Glam Glow and can&#x27;t say that it is true or not I can tell you that this mask is quite good. I used it with apple cider and felt no sensations as the mask dried other than the usual feeling like my face is turning into a statue. After I rinsed it off my face was quite red (as the instructions say can happen) but it hurt pretty bad like I had a horrible sunburn, it lasted about a half an hour. But my face was extremely soft and smooth. I&#x27;m not sure it was a big enough difference to go through the pain again but my best friend does! Warning DO NOT rinse this down your drain, I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking but I did and I had to pull out chunks of mud lining my pipe and draino my sink, rinse it into a basin or something and bag it up and put it in the trash.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful and makes my skin look healthy. It does dry the skin so you definitely need a good moisturizer after. I use a little Vaseline on my face immediately after the mask. I gave this product a 4 rating only because I didn&#x27;t know that It came in a powder form and i would have to mix it with each use.  I probably won&#x27;t be buying this product again but not because it&#x27;s not a great product. But because I find that using ginger on my face as asks is just as effective .</li>
            <li> The BEST mask ever. A pain to clean up but so worth it. Left it on for 25 minutes and it pulled all of my blackheads out and soothed my acne flareup.</li>
            <li> Is not that miracle as the say, but I still like it</li>
            <li> Acne skin? Break outs all the time? This right here will change your life. Every day I have a mask and I give my kids mask when they start breaking out and this takes care of it faster then anything else, plus it doesn&#x27;t cost that much compared to other stuff you are probably buying right now.</li>
            <li> This stuff is intense but it definitely leaves ur face feeling clear and without toxins.</li>
            <li> Love this product, have used it for years &amp; will continue.  It&#x27;s very intense &amp; I love how fresh &amp; healthy it makes my skin look.</li>
            <li> This mask is the best! My skin has never been better and my wrinkles have magically decreased&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Love it can live with out it</li>
            <li> Try a small amount on a small area first. This stuff will make your skin very dry. It wasn&#x27;t the right product for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I had no idea it existed until my roommate showed it to me and swore by it. I immediately purchased it on Amazon, and started whipping up a face mask as soon as I opened the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff can be MESSY. I started out using a regular kitchen bowl and spoon when mixing it, but was having a lot of trouble getting a good consistency and I read you are not supposed to use metal utensils with it. I then switched to using a regular bowl and a plastic spoon to mix, followed by using a powder makeup brush to apply all over my face in layers. What a difference the brush makes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also use apple cider vinegar to mix it with, which I have tried and had no problems with. And you can use rosewater that you can purchase on Amazon, and I&#x27;ve heard that it works even better with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I leave it on until it has completely dried, which makes your face stuck. And I mean STUCK, once this dries you need to go ahead and wash it off because any movements you make may possibly hurt (especially if you laugh). It washes off easily though, and you can see how clean your face looks once you rinse it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this when I see myself starting to get a few breakouts when I&#x27;m under a lot of stress, and nothing have cleared those up as fast as this product. I&#x27;ve also used it in a bath and for mosquito bites and have had only good experiences with it in those situations as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works great. My skin will take time to get used to it</li>
            <li> Got for grandson, who has been having problems with acne.  Seems to be helping much at this time, after 2 uses!!</li>
            <li> Amazing with the Bragg Apple Cider Vinegar.</li>
            <li> ✿✿ ABSOLUTELY ✿✿ WONDERFUL ✿✿ SELLER ✿✿THANK YOU✿✿</li>
            <li> (Product reviewer: Female, 22 years old, long-term moderate acne)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high expectations for this product after seeing the excellent reviews.  However, after using it a few times, I have seen no real improvement in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-A little bit of this stuff goes a LONG way.  Start with a small amount when mixing for the first time; you can always add more.&lt;br /&gt;-Be warned that your face may be red after using this product (similar to getting your eyebrows waxed).  Don&#x27;t use it right before going out.  To avoid some of this irritation, when you go to take the mask off, try using a warm washcloth and pressing it to your face to soften the clay.  As tempting as it may be to start rubbing it off (especially if it is itchy/stinging), that seemed like it would irritate my skin more.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s messy.  Get a plastic container to mix the clay in another one to rinse your washcloth in when you wash your face.  I had a hard time keeping it out of my hair -- another reason to avoid using this mask before going out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck to the rest of you; I was just disappointed this product didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I mix this clay with apple cider vinegar for a clay mask. Although my skin feels soft and smooth after using it, I have not noticed any improvements with regard to my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easiest to rinse this out in the shower since it gets messy. If it clogs your drains though, just pour some vinegar down the drain. I personally have never had a clogged drain when using this.</li>
            <li> Great product for problem skin.  Used as directed its amazing!  Will continue buying!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using products in my hair that I can&#x27;t pronounce or eat (I&#x27;m not going to eat this,,,It&#x27;s just a saying). So,I mix the clay with olive oil, apple cider vinegar, and water to make a lose paste and I slather it in my hair. The bentonite clay deep cleans my hair and defines the curl pattern in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I love this alternative to shampoo. :-)</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t do anything to my skin or cure any acne problem just irritates it. i should of read the negative comments first. i won&#x27;t ever buy this product ever again</li>
            <li> Sure I look like a green monster every time I use it, but wow this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> This stuff just seems cheap, I bought it to help pull out acne pimples but it made it so much worse. I would not recommend for my skin type.</li>
            <li> I seriously cannot say enough good things about this face mask. After reviewing the reviews I was still a little hesitant to try this... I mean after all there is no such things as a miracle mask, right? WRONG. This product is a miracle! My skin goes through stages where I will break out in different places... For the past few months I was suffering from cystic acne on my chin my dr prescribed me antibiotics it was that bad. Being anti medication I refused to take it... There had to be another way besides taking pills. This chin acne was so painful and every time one would almost go away 5 more bigger nodules would form under my skin. I got to the point where I almost gave in to fill my prescription. I came across this mask and decided to try it as a last resort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed it equal ratio with apple cider vinegar with the mask. I did clean my dace with a gebtal face wash to remove my makeup before the mask. When I first used it I will admit I was extremely uncomfortable. It sucked. My skin first itched really badly and I couldn&#x27;t move my face. It was also a pain to get off. I also couldn&#x27;t see any instant changes because after I took the mask off my face was RED. It didn&#x27;t hurt or burn it was just red. I used toner and moisturizer afterwords but I was still red. I don&#x27;t know how long the redness lasted because I went to bed right after. The next day I woke up and my cystic acne felt so much better. A few of the cysts were brought to a head that I could easily pop (I know it&#x27;s not recommended to pop your pimples... But I can&#x27;t help myself when there is a huge white pus bump on your face). I also had a few pimples that surfaced to a head in places around my cheeks that I didn&#x27;t even know were there. They were brought to that whitish pus point too so I safely popped them as well. In 2 nights I tried again. This time I took the mask off in the shower and it wasn&#x27;t so uncomfortable.... Same thing my face turned red and I did the rest of my fave care and went to bed. the next night I did it again and when I woke up the next day that&#x27;s when I realized the difference. My pores were so tiny and basically disappearing... There were barely anymore bumps on my chin the only marks on my face were my acne scars. I used this once more tonight (2 days later) and I am happy to admit I HAVE NOT ONE PIMPLE OR CYST ANYWHERE on my face. This time the redness only lasted about 10 minutes so I could examine my skin better. Not only did this fix my acne but my forehead wrinkles are filling in as well. My skin is so soft and my pores are so tiny that I can barely see them! (I had huge pores before)&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to EVERYONE. It&#x27;s a fast solution. In a few days your skin will be clear. Unfortunately i still have dark spots and acne scars on my chin (why we don&#x27;t pop pimples) but those are so easy to cover with makeup. It feels so good to have no pimples on my face. I never thought it would be possible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS. USE THIS. IT WILL WORK.ed. the next night I did it again and when I woke up the next day that&#x27;s when I realized the difference. My pores were so tiny and basically disappearing...

            <li> Feel skin tightening and pores diminishing. Leaves face with good complexion. Skin may feel dry afterwards. I usually follow up with acne lotion. Once or twice a week keeps acne in check.</li>
            <li> I got this 2 days ago and tried it right away at night.&lt;br /&gt;I mixed it water since it is my first time using it and planning to use cider vinegar the next time I use it to see if there are any difference.&lt;br /&gt;It was hard to mix, but I think that I put less water and it turned out to be clumpy but that&#x27;s okay I ended up putting a little bit more water anyways. I used an unused makeup face brush and it went smoothly after. For mixing I used a plastic spoon and a plastic bowl for easier clean up. I left it on for about 20-30 mins and be careful because some of it might fall off when it dries up. While waiting it to dry I can physically see that it &amp;#34;sucking&amp;#34; my face that I ended up have a duck face in the end, it&#x27;s funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washing it off is pretty easy, I ran hot water for 2 mins to make sure that it washes off the mud in the drain.&lt;br /&gt;After, I can physically see that my pores were 90% smaller, I can barely see it. And it dried off my pimple and it was gone the next day. Will recommend this for sure. I will probably use it 1-2 times a week.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!! That is all I can say. My 17 year old uses it constanty for his acne. While it does not clear up the acne it altogether. It does help. This product arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> Loved this product! Made my skin nice and soft and was easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very good for that after winter skin revival.....after some use you can expect great results with clearer skin and nice even tone and even a few less wrinkles</li>
            <li> Best facial product i&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s a bit messy but definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> My skin is tight and my complexion is evening out.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is totally worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again and again</li>
            <li> Lo and behold the secret to a cleaner and brighter face. This is just too good for its price and very easy to use too.</li>
            <li> I used this product 1 time  and followed the instructions as recommended . I mixed 2 table spoons of clay and 2 tablespoons of organic cider vinegar plus a tiny bit more water in a non - metallic bowl and mixed with a plastic fork until very smooth . I applied with the back of a plastic spoon. I covered my face ,neck ,and upper chest . I waited , and waited, and yes it does tighten and pull. I felt a small amount of pulsing , not tingling . Time to completely dry was over 30 minutes . I wore an old tank top and hosed off 90% of the clay in the yard and used a large face cloth to help with removal . Much better for my house drain to rinse outside.&lt;br /&gt;Results were immediate . My face was pinker , my skin , especially on my upper chest was smooth as silk. My pores which are always clogged with white heads seemed smaller . This will be a weekly beauty regime for me .</li>
            <li> So far made a mud mask and loved results</li>
            <li> I have only used this for about a month or so, but I use it about 4 or 5 times a week. My skin looks and feels softer, healthier and my adult acne is at bay. I do use essential oils after the mask and I do use full apple cider vinegar to mix the mask. So far, I love this mask and it seems to be working for what I needed, which is to clean out my pours, make them appear smaller and help the overall appearance and texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> Obsessed with this mask. I use it with organic Apple Cider Vinegar a few times a week. It dries quickly and really tightens to the point where it hurts to talk - so don&#x27;t watch anything funny while you have this on. But i really have seen a difference in my skin tone and it leaves my skin feeling so soft afterwards. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> For just $9.95 you&#x27;re getting a lot of product for your money and it&#x27;s a great product.  The clay mask is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use 2 tablespoons of the clay, 1 tablespoon of white vinegar and 1 tablespoon of water.  I mix this up in a custard dish and apply it to my face, neck and dec area.  Once the mask is removed, my face feels so soft and smooth.  I then put my Eve Hansen&#x27;s Rosehip Oil on and my skin drinks it in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched white and apple cider vinegars and the acidity level was about the same.  The mixture comes out nice and creamy using half vinegar and half water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to other reviews, before I ever opened the container I gently tapped it on the counter a few times to help settle the product.  When I opened the lid, there was no mess.  Debi B.</li>
            <li> I have tried a numerous amount of facial masks but nothing comes close to this one.&lt;br /&gt;It is not expensive and definitely does a great job of clearing skin and gives a nice glow. I have used it once a week for about a month now and have seen dramatic changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can feel the mask making its way down cleaning the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is getting the consistency of the mask down but otherwise, great product!</li>
            <li> Works wonders for oily skin! I use it mixed thinner than recommended for ease of application and it  reduces the drying time!</li>
            <li> First use made my skin extremely itchy. Tried again and was a little better. Tightens up face and helps minimize pores *slightly*. I recommend putting a small amount into a container with equal amounts water and letting it sit. Helps with spread-ability.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I took my son to a dermatologist for his acne and was recommended medication that has serious side effects (mood change, suicidal thoughts) and a 20+ page &amp;#34;hold harmless&amp;#34; contract.  No thanks!!  So I did some research and I found Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has great reviews and is inexpensive.  We mix it with the recommended apple cider vinegar.  It works really well and has helped clear my son&#x27;s skin.  He uses it on his back (with my help) and his face.  All the &amp;#34;junk&amp;#34; comes out of his pores, allowing healing to occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one other tip for kids/parents with this condition is to treat acne &amp;#34;sores&amp;#34; as wounds.  Speaking as a first aid instructor, wounds should be kept clean, so wash your hands!  After cleaning the area, applying the clay, drying, washing off, etc., I highly recommend using an antibacterial cream on the affected area (test on a small area first, for allergic reactions).  I don&#x27;t recommend antibiotic ointment, because it&#x27;s just too slimy.  Antibiotic cream can also be used as &amp;#34;spot treatment&amp;#34; after ordinary face washing.</li>
            <li> I was researching online for a product to help me control my oily skin and breakout prone and I found this. I just used it last night for the first time. I had no problem mixing it but ended up needing more Apple Cider Vinegar than the recommended ratio of 1:1. It could be due to the altitude where I live. Anyways, I mixed it well and used 1 tablespoon of clay and like 2 vinegar. I applied it on my face and let it dry for 30 minutes. I did feel the tingles and a little itchy, not pulsate for sure (I thought it would be like a painful pulsate, but it was not). I washed it off with warm water and my face was not red at all, it was pink in some areas from me scrubbing to take the clay off. I also was able to peel off some areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my face felt clean, pores looked a lot cleaner, and I was radiant. I would defiantly recommend and will do an update. I plan to use it ever other day until my acne on my cheeks decrease some. I also will put some on my arms, neck since I breakout some there too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this clay mask with the recommended Bragg Apple Cider Vinegar in hopes of it helping reduce/clear my acne. I only used it maybe about four or five times. I would have liked to keep using it, but there were two negatives about it that really turned me away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One, is that it was pretty painful for me to remove the mask. Perhaps I applied it a bit too thickly, but still, I had to scrub roughly and with a wash cloth for a while to get it all off my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, is that it clogged the sink/shower drain in removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that the pulsating effect was kind of cool, and my skin felt very clean and refreshed afterward. As it seems to work, my acne worsened a little bit after the times I used it. I wish I didn&#x27;t experience the trouble with it, so I could&#x27;ve continued and possibly have seen results. But, I don&#x27;t think it was worth it...</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!  I was being steered towards a high end line of skin are by my physician to deal with my pregnancy induced acne.  I decided to give this mask a shot before investing hundreds in the other product.  And I&#x27;m so incredibly relieved I was willing to give this mask a shot.  It works like nothing I&#x27;ve ever experienced before.  I noticed a major improvement in my skin&#x27;s clarity, suppleness and even a firmer tone.  I&#x27;ve used this product twice now, and am convinced this is all I need to add to my weekly skincare regimen.</li>
            <li> ok Im not gonna lie to you guys/girls this stuff really does work, I had pimples on my face not big pimples so do say, more like mearly red dots on my face  like if it was turning into a pimple but it hasnt yet.. so I applied the product right away when I received it which was around june 8, and I have been knowing some results since I been using it on my face has been clearing out no more of those red dots it cleared out on my face.... the way I been using it is I take 1 tablespoon and add about 1 tablespoon of  apple cider vinegar, and start mixing it, then I apply it around my face, if the mixing is still more watery add a little bit more of the clay and mix again... also the product says you might experience redness around your face after using the product I did not experience any redness on my face......now the product says to use once a week,more often for problem skin, I use the product every morning and night idk maybe if you use it more you&#x27;ll start seeing better results on your face withing a few days you can buy this same product at your local vitamin shoppe... for 8 bucks... hope this reviews helps you out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note I have been trying proactiv, and that stuff has not been helping on my face, if you have been using it more than 30 days and your face has not been healing  just a little bit, then safe bet to say that proactiv  does not work for you... but anyways I stopped using proactiv, and just used the healing clay from now on....</li>
            <li> I just used this clay for the first time and I already see a difference!!! My black heads are almost completely gone after ONE USE!! My skin is soft and I have an amazing glow :D.. And the huge pimple that I had on my face is now 1/2 the size.. But make sure to moisturize afterwards!! U won&#x27;t be disappointed trust me!!!</li>
            <li> This mask does help with your face. I have used it four times and have already noticed a difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance. That being said, it is messy though. I clumps up a lot with water, the vinegar works better with it. My skin was a little dry after the 2nd time of use, but I compensated that with some face lotion. It&#x27;s good, but not amazing as every other review that I read. I would buy it again only because it does seem to help more than any other products that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I purchased this just because of the great reviews and price.  I have to say that this stuff genuinely works and is totally worth it.  It&#x27;s not going to be the frilly mask that smells like cucumbers and roses - it&#x27;s the real deal.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> i am baffled by the number of good reviews this product has. i totally regret purchasing it...&lt;br /&gt;this is my honest experience with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it comes in a powder form that you have to mix with liquid to turn into a paste, which you then apply to your face. this product does not mix easily with liquid so it takes a bit of patience to get it to the consistency you want it to be... kind of a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i attempted to mix it with water in a small bowl, then apply it to my face and let it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;why i don&#x27;t like it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. it never fails to make a huge mess all over the bathroom counter and sink.&lt;br /&gt;if i apply it and then go into another room (sit on my bed or something or watch TV while it dries and i find it flakes off and crumbles onto my couch and comforter, really annoying...)&lt;br /&gt;2. i dont even have sensitive skin but it made my skin feel WAY too dry and tight once i rinsed it off... it was a very uncomfortable feeling.&lt;br /&gt;3. it got all up in my hairline and looked like dandruff, don&#x27;t use this product unless you have time to shower afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;4. this product just feels unnatural on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;5. it is incredibly annoying to apply -- unless you take the time to mix it in a baggie, it kind of clumps and doesn&#x27;t dissolve properly in water, so u end up with stange lumps all over you face, then some bare patches where it didn&#x27;t apply.&lt;br /&gt;6. cracks and flakes off and makes a mess as i mentioned previously, you&#x27;ll need to confine yourself to the bathroom while you wait for it to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other people might have gotten it to work for them but there are MUCH better clay masks out there for purchase that are easier &amp; more convenient to apply and won&#x27;t strip all the moisture from your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would not recommend, it&#x27;s way too drying, and not in a good way.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne since I was 10 years old. I&#x27;m now 28 and I still suffer from blackheads and hormonal breakouts. A few months ago, I became DETERMINED to have clear skin for my wedding this Spring!!! I got a prescription for Differin gel (which didn&#x27;t work when I was younger, but over the counter treatments don&#x27;t work, so I figured it&#x27;s worth another shot!) I had the horrible initial breakouts the first few weeks, as expected, but it did greatly help clear up the major zits. YAY! But I still had horrible blackheads and hormonal breakouts…I was desperate and found the reviews for this mask. The price was right and I&#x27;m already a fan of using apple cider vinegar as a toner, so I ordered it and WOWZA! I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it almost every day for the past 10 days and I cannot express how amazing my skin looks and feels. I have no, I repeat, NO zits on my face! My blackheads have seriously diminished and my skin feels soft and clean, like I&#x27;ve never felt in my entire life. As someone who has always battled acne/bad skin and tried tons of products with great reviews, but they never worked for me…I understand the skeptics! But I honestly am so grateful I found this when I did…life changing/confidence booster in the form of powdered clay. I&#x27;m in love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About my skin and tips: I have extremely fair, sensitive, combination skin. I was a little freaked the first time I used this because my face was as red as a strawberry when I washed it off, but as promised, it went away within 30-45 min. So use at night or if you&#x27;re not going anywhere for a while! Knowing my skin is sensitive, I took the risk of doing the mask almost everyday. I use ACV/water as a toner, then Neutrogena&#x27;s oil free Light Night Cream after the mask. I highly recommend toning with ACV and using an oil free moisturizer if you have similar skin. I have not experienced dryness at all. Based on my results so far, I would suggest you try doing it everyday/every other day until you see the results you want and then do it once a week to maintain…I wish you all happy clear skin!!!until you see the results you want and then do it once a week to maintain…I wish you all happy clear skin!!!</li>
            <li> this mask has been awesome. ive seen a significant difference in my appearance. i recommend it for everyone. and it should last me a very long time. price is perfect for this gem</li>
            <li> OMG!!&lt;br /&gt;I never understood what other reviewers meant when they said it will pull on your skin and makes a dramatical difference.&lt;br /&gt;It works!! My pores are not small as yet, but hoping to see a change in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;You will feel your skin tighten like never before.&lt;br /&gt;Am glad I got this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have had moderate (40-50 pimples at a time) acne for 2-3 years now, I tried 2 or 3 of the off the shelf acne products with little to no success. I&#x27;ve been using this 2-3 times a week for a month now and I am down to 6 or 7 pimples and I have seen a great reduction in my light acne scarring as well. 5 stars, definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It&#x27;s really cheap for the quality of results you get. If you mix with water, it&#x27;ll be lumpy but no less effective. Also, the tub says to put on 1/4&amp;#34;- 1/2&amp;#34; of clay, but all the reviews/tutorials I&#x27;ve read apply a thin layer. I do it really thick and let it sit for like 40 minutes. I have bad blackheads. When it&#x27;s dry, it looks like all these fleas have come and died on my face- little black specks everywhere. When people say it &amp;#34;sucks out&amp;#34; blackheads, you can really see those suckers-- they&#x27;re laying all over your face. Also, if you understand that &amp;#34;clay&amp;#34; is texturally consistent with &amp;#34;mud,&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t see how you could be surprised at it being &amp;#34;messy.&amp;#34; Use an old soft toothbrush to apply if you don&#x27;t have those nice brushes.</li>
            <li> I use bentonite clay for so many things, from aiding in digestion, to pore cleansing masks, and bath soaks, tooth powder, etc.  My mother suffers from many allergies, and her skin is sensitive to everything (it seems).  I make her a bentonite detox bath soak with epsom salt, lavender essential oil, bentonite clay and apple cider vinegar, and it relieves her symptoms, as well as keeps them away for several days.  Highly recommended for multiple uses.</li>
            <li> I just tried this product last night for the first time and it was much better than I expected. I mixed mine with raw apple cider vinegar instead of water and applied to my face and neck. My nose of course was the first to dry so you could feel the tingling/mild burning sensation. It wasn&#x27;t unbearable or anything but you might want to be careful if you have sensitive skin. There was a point where I could actually feel my heartbeat throbbing in my face! LOL! Anyway, my neck area never did completely dry but I finally washed everything off in the tub when it seemed all the parts were beginning to crack (so I assumed it was \\&quot;dry enough\\&quot;). I splashed my face and neck thoroughly with warm water (without rubbing the skin) until all the clay melted away, then I patted dry with a soft towel. When I looked in the mirror, there was no redness whatsoever (like I thought there would be) and the huge pores I have around my nose area were actually diminished considerably! My skin felt a little tight so I followed the treatment with a full facial steam for 20 minutes and then applied a little chilled aloe vera gel before going to bed. This morning when I woke up, my pores were still tiny and even with the gel on my face, my skin didn&#x27;t feel oily like it usually does when I wake up. I love this stuff!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of warning though, I used this in the bathtub (not in the shower) and wiped up the clay residue left behind after the water drained with paper towels. It *is* clay afterall and I don&#x27;t want to find out what it&#x27;ll do if too much of it gets caught up in my pipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (5/20/2013): I&#x27;ve found that applying the mud with a paintbrush to my face and neck makes the thickness more uniform all over (so some parts don&#x27;t dry while other parts still stay wet). I also sat facing a box fan for a little while and both my face and neck dried uniformly. Finally, I heated a hand towel with tap water and just pressed it to my face for a few seconds (like they do in a spa) and as the mud melted, I just wiped it away and wrung out my towel in a plastic tub. I repeated and just threw the muddy water outdoors over my compost when I finished (so no danger of clogging up my pipes)! Yay!and as the mud melted, I just wiped it away and wrung out my towel in a plastic tub.

            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne on and off for the better part of my young life. I tried a few products over the counter and quickly realized it was a huge mistake. I&#x27;m sure most people who have acne, whether major or minor, can sympathize with the frustrations that come with it. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s easy to fall in the trap of buying product(s) that are just horrible for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the healing clay and braggs apple cider vinegar a few days ago and I can already see a healthy difference in my skin (face). I followed the instructions that many people have posted, did my research (i recommend you do the same). I&#x27;ve applied the mask on before I go to bed for 3 days now. Because my skin tends to be more on the sensitive side, I didn&#x27;t want to take any risk leaving in on for too long.  So i suggest you consider that before you time it. I&#x27;ve left it on for 15 min. And yes, your face will get a bit red, but it lasts for about 10 min for me then back to normal.  So far, this stuff works and leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed. Just remember, everything in moderation. There are no quick fixes, it&#x27;s a process so be patient. But this product certainly lives up to the hype!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 5 stars, but i&#x27;d like to wait and see if it continues to work effectively. If it does so, i will gladly come back and give it the rating it deserves :)</li>
            <li> This stuff works like a charm. The apple vinegar produces the most results and using hot water leaves the mud in clumps so unless u want muddy lookin&#x27; warts use the vinegar. Another plus is that when you use the vinegar it keeps your family away for hours so of you want to wind down with a favorite book, put your muddy mask on and you won&#x27;t be bothered for a good hour or two. Don&#x27;t worry about the smell, after you get past the initial gag reflex, it&#x27;s smooth sailin&#x27;. I love this product and strongly recommend though it&#x27;s not for the faint of heart.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing i have never used or owned such an exclusive product that makes your skin look and feel great absolutly love it!!! i have sugested to all my firemds to own n buy this product its # 1 in my book!!!!</li>
            <li> I saw a difference in my skin after the first use. It tightened up my pores and helps control my minor breakouts.  My face looks younger and tighter. My husband noticed it and asked me what I was doing differently.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I originally got this to combat my clogged pores. While my pores are smaller, they aren&#x27;t completely unclogged, though it&#x27;s done an impressive job (especially compared to all the previous products I&#x27;ve tried). I&#x27;ve also found that while using this product my acne has decreased and my skin doesn&#x27;t get as oily during the day. I use it every night and mix it with apple cider vinegar, which I find is the best way to get a smooth mix, and leave it for about 20 minutes. My face can be slightly red afterwards, but I don&#x27;t feel any discomfort or pain.</li>
            <li> This clay is great!  My daughter and I use this and we can see the black heads and other guk rise to the top of our skin in a day or so.  It is a good overall deep cleanser.  The price is great as well!</li>
            <li> Not much to add to all the other great reviews of this product. Love that while it&#x27;s drying, it really tightens up literally pulling your face up like a facelift. If it wouldn&#x27;t look so bizarre to walk around with this mask on, I might just do so to look 10 years younger! ;-)</li>
            <li> I love this clay! When mixed with the Apple Cider Vinegar, it deep cleans like anything I have ever tried. I use this mixture once per week and it has helped keep my skin flawless. You can really feel that it&#x27;s working which I like. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it&#x27;s a little difficult to get off once you let it dry. That little fact doesn&#x27;t stop me from using it however. My skin is smooth and brighter using this clay. It also feels really clean which is what I want in a deep cleanser. You can feel it pulling the impurities out as the clay dries so don&#x27;t be alarmed when using for the first time. TRY IT!</li>
            <li> I am not sure what is it so special about this product. It does help to remove oil from the pores, but it doesn&#x27;t really clean face that well... I expected more(( I used it 3 times for the past two weeks,  so maybe I should use it for a couple of months to get a visible result? ..Or maybe the effect depends on the type of skin...</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!  I use it once a week and I am starting to see and feel a difference in my skin... and I&#x27;m not breaking out as badly as before.  I mix with water instead of cider vinegar.  It does not burn like some say, or turn my face red afterwards!  It&#x27;s makes your skin a little tight, but not uncomfortably so... It&#x27;s hard to smile and/or laugh when your face is tight like an Aztec goddess.  I highly recommend this product to others.  It&#x27;s a bit of a mess mixing and a real mess when applying to the face, but it&#x27;s so worth it.  It kind of clumps to the face.  I have sensitive skin and it works wonders on me.  It&#x27;s definitely worth a try.  And the price can&#x27;t be beat when you compare to other beauty products.  This one is a winner!!!!!</li>
            <li> Aztec Secret Indian Clay gets 5/5 because it works great and is a wonderful natural way to clean skin of oil and clear the pores.&lt;br /&gt; It is gentle and easy to  use just once a week is recommended.</li>
            <li> I have already used it for about two months. It help me to clean the pore in a magic way. And more important, it&#x27;s really cheap.</li>
            <li> I just started using this about 2 weeks ago and so far it&#x27;s working.  Background on my face: oily, with both blackheads and whiteheads.  I did have some little whiteheads come in the first few days I used it, but I expected that based off the other reviews.  Those cleared within my next 1 or two uses.  It&#x27;s slowly bringing up and out all my other whiteheads.  I&#x27;ve been able to extract them with a tool.  I&#x27;ll keep using it and post with an update.</li>
            <li> At first, when I read that this is the world&#x27;s most powerful facial, I was skeptical. It just seemed too good to be true. But after trying it, OH GOD. It was true. This indeed is the world&#x27;s most powerful facial. What it did to my face, you guys. It made me too beautiful. my pores are too sexy. There is no reversing it. You know those Axe commercials where chicks won&#x27;t leave that one guy alone cuz he smells just so darn good? Well, everyday the number of males (and females) that follow me around to bathe in the aura of my exfoliated face increases. It reached the point now that I almost got arrested for leading a riot, but then the police officers were struck by the cleanliness of my pores and joined my followers. Now my city is out of a police department. Crime rates are soaring. Anarchy is slowly unfolding through the city. People think that I am a Goddess of beauty and clean pores. They insist on bringing me sacrifices. So many babies.The divine beauty this product brought to my face brought a whole city into turmoil. The power of this deep pore cleanser is to great. Purchase it with great caution.</li>
            <li> Perfect example of all hype. All it did was make my face feel like it was been sun-burned, wreck a bowl, and make me smell like dirt.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference yet but so far it does tighten and make my skin glow.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long, long way.  Great purchase.  Many uses and will last forever</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Bentonite Clay, and this one is okay. However, I tried the Redmond&#x27;s Clay before I tried this brand and I will have to go back to that brand. This particular brand seems to be a bit more harsh, and I have sensitive skin. When I use it on my face my skin gets red and hot when I wash it off. It could be my fault, which is why I gave it 4 stars. I have heard that there are 2 different kinds of bentonite clay, and perhaps this one is different than Redmonds. It does the job, but I would have to say that the next time I order it I will go back to my previous brand.</li>
            <li> This stuff is LEGIT. It makes your face pulsate when you use it with the ACV. It sure gets the gunk out and makes your pores look really tight. I highly recommend this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I have only used it twice (once Friday and once Sunday) and my skin is already much clearer!  Spots where I had acne are almost gone and my pores are less noticeable.  My face feels so smooth- I definitely take care to moisturize plenty afterwards.  I can&#x27;t believe I am loving this so much already.  Mixing was a pain but who cares if it does its job so well.</li>
            <li> I have used this product several times and I have noticed an improvement in my skin. I would recommend using it with the Apple Cider Vinegar (I find it more effective).</li>
            <li> Excellent Mask, removes all impurities.But be careful, don&#x27;t let it on your face for more time tat recommended, can be very irritating.</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff me and my wife do mud mask Mondays and this makes our skin feel soo much better. This is one of the best treatments you can do for your face.</li>
            <li> I was skepticle about ordering this product but friends and family who tried it face start to look so clean, smoothe, and glowful. I finally ordered this and it came way sooner than I expected. This is a miracle in a bottle!!!!  You could feel and see the difference on your face in the first facial treatment.  My whole family uses it even the fella&#x27;s!!!  Just Amazing is all I can say!!!</li>
            <li> Very good mask if u mix it with apple cider vinegar. Reduces the oil in my face.</li>
            <li> I used this product once and my skin felt so nice after! It did tingle a little bit and left redness for about 4 minutes after removal.  After rinsing it off my pores were smaller and all the gunk came out! I will be using this in my weekly face routine from now on.</li>
            <li> Ummm,,,this is a heavy duty facial mask.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Pulls all the funk out of your pores - good stuff!&lt;br /&gt;Pulls so tight on my face that it gets a little uncomfortable though.</li>
            <li> This product is so wonderful. I used on my face and body and my husband even used it too. You do have to add water or a tea to add to the powder. I thought it was a clay but was just the powder. either way this is wonderful healing stuff. Even cured a bit of psoriasis on my freinds leg. Wow. Yes I would recommend to everyone. Thank you</li>
            <li> I love this mask , saves my skin every time I need a deep clean.</li>
            <li> Just awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Got everyone in my family hooked. Cleared up a nasty case of peri-oral dermatitis/acne I had. Keeps acne at bay with regular use. I use about every other day on average.&lt;br /&gt;I mix with straight Bragg&#x27;s ACV (with the mother!), and I prefer a slightly thinner consistency.  This product has changed my skin forever.&lt;br /&gt;You will need a good moisturizer, as this will suck all of the crud out of your pores but you can expect to sacrifice some moisture in the process.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used a product that did more for my skin than this.&lt;br /&gt;Instructions on the package suggest a 1 to 1 ratio of clay to ACV- I find that a 1 to 1.5 ratio makes a consistency I&#x27;m happier with.  The instructions also say to apply this mask 1/4 inch thick- Whaaat?! No, you don&#x27;t need to do that... you only need enough to cover your skin, no super thick layers necessary.  The label says the tub contains enough clay for 10-15 masks... I find that mixing the clay to ACV at a 1 to 1.5 ratio (I use about a teaspoon of clay to 1.5 teaspoons ACV) and applying a much thinner layer than the product label suggests still provides REMARKABLE results while stretching the product much farther.  This 1 pound tub lasts me about 4-5 months, and I apply a mask 2-3 nights a week. At an average of $12 a tub, that&#x27;s less than $3 a month for the most effective skincare product I&#x27;ve ever used.  I still can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out how more people don&#x27;t know about this stuff, and why something so HOLY GRAIL caliber is so darn inexpensive!&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;When my teenage daughter developed some age-related acne, this product worked wonders for her.  I was hesitant for her to use straight apple cider vinegar on her young skin, so we used half distilled water and half ACV.  I found than when using water, the clay doesn&#x27;t mix up as smoothly- it tends to be lumpy.  I get a better result when I dilute the ACV with distilled water FIRST, then add the diluted ACV to the clay (instead of adding water and ACV to the clay as two separate ingredients).&lt;br /&gt;Also, when I am in the mood for a more cooling type of mask, I add 1 or 2 drops of tea tree oil to my mixture.  I don&#x27;t notice any difference in the effectiveness of the mask when I do this- I just like the way it feels.  It adds a cool, tingly, freshening sensation while I&#x27;m waiting for the mask to dry.e ingredients).

            <li> If you&#x27;re seeking clear skin, LOOK NO FURTHER. i&#x27;ve used this product twice in the past week and i already see a huge difference !&lt;br /&gt;Before i found Aztec secret i was struggling badly with HUGE pores on my face and blackheads in my nose and chin. i&#x27;ve spent so much money at regular department stores on products that have never even gave me slight the results Aztec did. I highly recommend this product to anyone seeking clear skin. it makes your skin soft, smooth and clear. What i love the most is that it does exactly what it says it does. it gives you real (life changing) results. I am now more confident than ever. I don&#x27;t use filters for my selfies anymore. life has been great !</li>
            <li> this gave me acne really badly - I tried it as a mask and a spot treatment, both with ACV and water, and it failed me on both counts.</li>
            <li> Great product! Cleared up my acne after just 2 weeks!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a clay mask to use to help clear up adult acne, so I read the reviews and purcahsed this product.  It was recommended to use with apple cider vinegar, which I did, and not only did it smell out my entire house (and scare my 6yr old son), but it did nothing to clear up my skin.  I liked how it tightened up my skin while it was drying and was expecting great results, but have not seen them after a few times of use.</li>
            <li> This is great to use, I mix it with apple vinegar and find my skin is glowing after!</li>
            <li> You get a lot of product in this tub! I really feel like my pores were minimized when I used it the first time.. I will have to keep using to see if there are any longer term benefits!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Has changed my skin.</li>
            <li> I love it.. Best stuff around... Really cleanses the face and literally has black heads hanging out after you wash off the clay! Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because its really lumpy with you mix it with your liquid of choice.  I&#x27;ve bought clays similar to this that were not lumpy at all and a little easier to mix.  It made my face feel smooth and clean and that is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start this off by saying that I have sensitive, oily, acne-prone skin. I thought this thing would be amazing for the oily, acne-prone part of it. The first time I left this on, I left it on for 10 minutes and it essentially burned my skin. It was so painful. I then switched to leaving it on for a maximum of 5 minutes but it still leaves my skin feeling raw. I thought, maybe I need to dilute it more, only made a negligibly slight difference. I&#x27;m giving it to my cousin who has more resilient skin than I do in hopes it will work wonders for her, but for my sensitive skin, it&#x27;s just too harsh and leaves it feeling like it went through a war zone.</li>
            <li> I use this mask whenever I feel like my skin is dull or when I am breaking out and it has done wonders for my skin. I mix equal parts of ACV and the clay and I only need a little bit for my entire face, like 1 tsp full and I apply a thin layer. It extracts and sucks out all the disgusting dirt and residue in my face and leaves me with a purified fresh face... I would recommend using it at night rather than the day because when I do this mask at night, moisturize, apply my treatments, drink a tall glass of water and wake up in the morning, my skin looks just amazing. I recommend this mask to everyone.</li>
            <li> I was a little scared of the pulsating part but my skin felt soft and looked good. I can&#x27;t speak for most because i don&#x27;t have a acne problem, I just want to maintain great skin. This clay did leave my brown skin red but that went away as the others stated.</li>
            <li> I use with apple cider vinegar!!! works magic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 20 years old and get a lot of breakouts on my face. A friend recommended I try this and it just works wonders! Takes the redness away and clears up all breakouts. It also decreased the amount of blackhead and shrunk my pore size. Great product! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It clears blackheads and leaves your skin extremely clean. But when you pour it out, beware it would get allover the place.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMEND MIXING THIS WITH ANY TYPE OF VINEGAR RATHER THAN WATER CAUSE IT WILL ONLY MIX WITH VINEGAR. THIS PRODUCT WORKS VERY WELL ON OILY SKIN AND SHRINKS LARGE PORES. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  Makes my face feel smooth and seems to exfoliate....and it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> I can say with certainty that this healing clay has helped improve my skin more than anything else that I&#x27;ve tried. I have really oily skin around my t-zone, and the rest of my face is fairly dry. This product has shrunk my pores in my t-zone, which has helped reduce and prevent a lot of my acne.  It hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of the blackheads on my nose like it has for other people, but i think it&#x27;s still a fantastic product! Definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re interested.</li>
            <li> I have been using this clay from my local apothecary, and recently switched to Amazon due to rice inflation. Even after the first use of this clay, my skin is visibly smoother, clearer, and glowing. This Mask is the best one I have ever used and I swear by it!</li>
            <li> Was happy with the first use.  But you don&#x27;t even need a lot.  I think I mixed a tablespoon and I had enough for myself and my daughter and then thru a little bit out.</li>
            <li> VERY DRYING to skin. If you have dry skin, do not use it.</li>
            <li> Maybe this product works for others... but DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT IF YOU HAVE ACNE PRONE SKIN!! If you&#x27;re like me... your acne isn&#x27;t exactly terrible..but you almost always have a zit. You skin gets oily throughout the day and if someone touches your face you will most likely get a zit there the next day. If this sounds like you... do not use this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I broke out after using this product... HORRIBLY!! I have never in my life experienced such a horrible break out. ALL around my mouth, my cheeks and forehead. It was TERRIBLE... I even called in sick from work because of it. I was too embarrassed.. it was so bad. It&#x27;s been about a week and the marking have still not gone away.. no more whiteheads but... red bumps/markings all over. I&#x27;m hoping they will not leave scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are battling acne.. do yourself a favor before you try any topical/masks... drink a TON of water!! Drink a minimum of 8 glasses of water a day for two weeks and your skin will be glowing! DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Mix with vinegar, love the feeling and skin feels refreshed.</li>
            <li> Completely useless. I had realistic expectations buying this product based off all the success stories on the reviews here.  If anything, it only exacerbated my acne, which honestly wasn&#x27;t even that severe to begin with. After the first week of using the product (with ACV), I was observing new pimples on my face, but I persisted with the product anyways after falling for this &amp;#34;initial purging period&amp;#34; bogus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, nearly one month later, my face is at the worst it has ever been -- none of the initial acne has improved, and in addition to that, there are so many additional pimples on my face that I can&#x27;t even count then anymore. I can&#x27;t even say that this product caused me to breakout, because many of the new blemishes were in the usual troublesome locations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would not recommend this product; I honestly had VERY realistic expectations going into this product. It&#x27;s not like I was expecting a miracle product, but at the very least, I was expecting at least minor improvements over the course of a month. If your acne is an issue, you would be much better off consulting your family doctor or dermatologist. One star for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product now four times and I have been happy with the results. It does help in reducing breakouts and works well on my teenage son.  You do need to use it regularly to be affective, but it is working for us.  Another reviewer mentioned using disposable towels to take the majority of the product off and that is good advice. This is very thick mudd and I am a bit worried it would clog the drains.  Also, I use paper bowls and plastic spoons to mix the product so I can through everything easily away.  With apple cider, the smell is really strong. Throwing everything away makes clean-up quick.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t feel or see any big changes</li>
            <li> When used as directed, this product really pulls the dirt from your pores. You&#x27;ll notice outbreaks at first because it&#x27;s purifying your skin, but your skin will clear up quickly. It&#x27;s kinda messy so maybe purchase a mixing bowl with applicator brush to eliminate too much of a mess. Do not male a latge batch because the additive mix is vinager and it will begin to mold after a few days. I haven&#x27;t tried to refrigerate because I assume the clay will harden. You can make a batch as you use it or enough for three face washes, and store the leftover batch in a tupperware container for furtur use.</li>
            <li> This product was for my wife and she&#x27;s enjoying it.</li>
            <li> It was a little messy, but otherwise a great product. I felt my skin tightening and I couldn&#x27;t help but feeling like Princess Fiona, the ogre. I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in my skin: my pimples already got smaller and my skin feels softer than a babies bottom.  This product was fun to try and will buy again!</li>
            <li> I bought this face masks for my wife and ended up trying it out of curiosity. We were pleasantly surprised at the way our faces felt when the mask was removed. There was less black heads around my wife&#x27;s nose and our faces felt smooth. The mask did itch while it was on and was a bit of a challenge to get on without a brush of some kind. Overall, we are happy with our purchase and are excited to try it again.</li>
            <li> Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed improvement in my skin, along with using it with apple cider vinegar!  Love it</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! It keeps my skin clear and soft. I love how my skin feels afterwards. I do this once a week and mix it with apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> I love this clay. I use it to make my own toothpaste, face powder and as a face mask.  A little goes a long way, so the jar is going to last a while.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I use it with Apple Cider Vinegar, and I love how it &amp;#34;foams&amp;#34; up and feels so soft going on to my face. I let it sit for 20 minutes. As it dries, it tightens up and I really can feel my face pulsate like they say on the label. Didn&#x27;t have any redness afterwards - and I have super sensitive skin. Love it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing! Totally cleared up my acne. My next step was going to be the dermatologist but not anymore! Makes my skin soft too which is a bonus.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS SERIOUSLY THE GOD OF ALL GODS!! I have acne-prone oily skin and with the exception of benzyl peroxide products, nothing seems to work with my skin without causing me to breakout. I&#x27;m slowly switching over to more gentle and natural products for my skin and this \\&quot;healing\\&quot; clay really lives up to its name. It comes in powder form, which is good because you will be able to mix a fresh new batch of clay every time you want to use a mask. I use a spoon to scoop some out and then mix it with organic apple cider vinegar until I get the right consistency. I use a makeup brush to apply it all over my face and I apply a thicker layer to areas where I break out most or where my pores are the largest. I let it dry about 10-15 minutes or until it feels uncomfortably tight before washing it off. TAKE NOTE: Be really careful how you wash the mask off your face. I heard that if you wash everything down the drain, you can easily clog your sink. I use a big pan of water to dip my face in and then wipe off with paper towels. It&#x27;s not hard to take off but you just have to remember to make sure none if it goes down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot begin to express how satisfied I am with this product. After using it, my face feels really soft and my pores have noticeably closed up. I&#x27;ve also noticed that I seem to be breaking out less. I think most people use it about once a week but I use it twice a week because of my acne. Be careful not to use it too often or it would dry out your skin. Apple cider vinegar is also good for acne and dark spots, so it&#x27;s a good combination to try out if you have acne-prone skin. However, apple cider vinegar doesn&#x27;t smell that good -_- You can also mix the clay mask with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy that I found out about Indian Clay Masks because they do wonders for my skin! I haven&#x27;t found a product that works better than this. I will definitely purchase again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good: works really well, closes pores, doesn&#x27;t break out my skin, oil control&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad: if you&#x27;re not careful, you can clog your sink with this! it is very easy to remove but for someone lazy like me, it can be a pain (but still worth the effort!)oil control&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad: if you&#x27;re not careful, you can clog your sink with this! it is very easy to remove but for someone lazy like me, it can be a pain (but still worth the effort!)</li>
            <li> Honestly, I haven&#x27;t tried this yet but am hopeful that I will LOVE it and that it will clean out my pores and leave my skin &amp;#34;baby soft!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> As I am writing this I have the mask on. My face feels really tight and I can&#x27;t move it! Since this is only my 2nd time, I&#x27;m not sure of what the benefits to my skin will be. Definitely a good idea to mix it up using ACV, then add a bit of water for it not to be lumpy. It feels lovely going on, but after 10-15 minutes I&#x27;m ready to take it off. At this point I can only blink :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hope this helps my hormonal acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update review as I continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******Update Aug 27, 2012*******&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is officially AWESOME. I am so excited that this product actually works. Albeit my skin isn&#x27;t perfect, it&#x27;s better than it&#x27;s been for a LONG LONG time. I&#x27;ve been using it pretty much as needed, usually every other day. When the acne starts to show itself, sometimes I do a spot treatment with the mask, often that means just my chin and cheek area. It somehow shrinks the acne bumps to a very manageable size and it will disappear within a couple days - this is a big improvement over other things I&#x27;ve tried and I often have to wait a week or more for the acne to go away. And by then, new acne has shown up - ah, what a pain. So again, this mask has helped make huge changes on my face. I&#x27;m in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I should note the other things I&#x27;m doing to conquer the ongoing acne:&lt;br /&gt;1) I&#x27;ve decided I&#x27;m going to drink 4-6 glasses of water a day. I fill up a big rubbermaid drink container that shows the measurements in pints/quarts so I can keep track of how much I&#x27;m drinking. Then I have a goal too. I used to be only a coffee drinker but I&#x27;ve majorly scaled back to one latte a day and drink mostly water with lemon for the rest of the day. I don&#x27;t love to drink a lot of water, but I am determined to make my skin look better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Fish Oil capsules: I&#x27;ve never taken these before b/c I think it&#x27;s a little bit nasty...but again I&#x27;m sick of crappy acne. So I&#x27;ve added these to my diet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) MSM supplement: Please don&#x27;t quote me on this, but I understand these have a sulfur component which aids in battling acne. I&#x27;ve done a bunch of research on good &#x27;ol google which helped me to understand it better. If nothing else, it&#x27;s great for joint health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Wild Yam Oil - ladies if you have menopause or PMS seriously look this stuff up. It helps balance hormones which in turn can reduce acne flare ups and help with tons of lady troubles we all have. I bought my first bottle at GNC last weekend and I&#x27;m giving it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Well this is a no brainer - eat healthy most of the time. Ditch the processed foods the best you can including SODA. When I need a fizzy drink fix, I get some carbonated water and add a flavor. Like Italian Soda. I can control how much sugar I&#x27;m ingesting and to me it just tastes better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alright, that pretty much sums it up.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!e don&#x27;t quote me on this, but I understand these have a sulfur component which aids in battling acne.

            <li> I bought this product to do an at home body wrap for detox and weight/inch loss. I am satisfied with the product thus far. I could feel the clay working while I was wrapped in it. I don&#x27;t know yet if it will help provide results (in addition to dieting and exercising), but I feel like it is actually working when I use it. It was pretty cheap and a little bit goes a long way. The wrap I made called for 1 cup of this stuff... I did a wrap over most of my body and still had enough mixture for 1-2 more wraps. I will probably buy this again if I see results while using it.</li>
            <li> I wear a very thin mask when I get home from work.  I wear it a bit thicker on weekends.  I am amazed at how this takes time off my face.  I had it for awhile &amp; used water.  My Mom tries it with the apple cider &amp; she was GLOWING.  I have been using it since &amp; I am sooo  satisfied!  Looking back at hundreds of dollars spent on some treatment or cream &amp; this 7$ clay out-preforms them all!</li>
            <li> Works pretty good. I&#x27;ve only used it once but I could feel it working. Only thing I found a little off was the directions. Maybe I read them a bit wrong. Something about applying a 1/4-1/2 inch mask? That&#x27;s pretty damn thick (TWSS). I can&#x27;t imagine that thick of a mask being necessary, or very possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the soft feel of my skin after the mask and will be using this product a few times a month, in addition to the daily scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside? With the unfiltered organic apple cider vinegar it&#x27;s not the most pleasant fragrance. It&#x27;s not unbearable by any means... just not my choice of fragrance.</li>
            <li> my hg mask. bit harsh for winter though</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love it but it&#x27;s really not that good. Just ok. I&#x27;d rather use the Freeman purifying clay mask. Same results and not as messy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Also look up its other uses. It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> For acne seriously this really does help but make sure you combine this with the apple cider vinegar, you wont regret it. It took some time to see a difference, but the difference is definitely worth it over the small differences that daily face scrubs do.</li>
            <li> Amazing ! I&#x27;m 21 years old and its like I hit teenage puberty again :( my face broke out so bad and I used this like 3 times a week starting out and it cleared those bumps up. It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks since I ordered. I love it. It makes your face extremely tight and The smell is iffy if you use vinegar (I use organic apple cider vinegar) but it definitely works. It has worked better than products I&#x27;ve bought for $50</li>
            <li> I like to put this on and freak my girlfriend out. A man, using such a product...yes I do, and it works well. It makes me feel like an old aztec warrior. I like to pretend i&#x27;m going to sacrifice a dozen virgin whiteheads to the gods of acne, to keep my world free of it for one more year. It seems to work quite well, and i&#x27;m entertained with my own antics. Can be somewhat messy, what what isn&#x27;t that&#x27;s worth doing these days? Get some, get messy, and get the most smooth, supple, blemish free skin you&#x27;ve ever seen. Don&#x27;t forget to moisturize fellas, your woman will appreciate it.</li>
            <li> I never get full rating but really this thing works</li>
            <li> I love how  soft my face feels.</li>
            <li> Great product!!! My hair loves it! I use it as mud wash, leaves my hair soft and moisturize.</li>
            <li> The mask is really good. At first I used it with the vinegar and it was a bit too much for my skin. The second time around I used half vinegar, half water. That was a good combo. It&#x27;s like going to the spa. I would recommend this, it&#x27;s helping my skin and tightening the pores.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve just finished my very first application process and so far not bad! I am an African American, 21 year old woman with more acne scars than acne I&#x27;d say. I get minimal breakouts but every breakout is brought on by something (cycle, sleeping on others beds, etc). I&#x27;ve purchased this product to help aid in those breakouts which will aid in the scars following those breakouts in the long run. I mixed this mask with warm water, I was unable to get a pudding like consistency so my mask did have clumps; nonetheless, it serves it&#x27;s purpose. I let the mask set on my face for 25 minutes before steaming my face clean by showering. I did not experience redness following my application, I think because of the steam and lightly rubbing my face in a circular motion. I followed up with witch hazel and a facial moisturizer. I&#x27;m looking forward to results! Oh and I cleansed my face with cetaphil before hand. These photos are of my face after the mask, toner, and moisterizer. Will update upon experiencing results.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a DEEP PORE Cleanser!  Once applied you can feel it seeping into your skin and tightening your face.  Once washed off your face is thrilled to be clean!  I do recommend as others that you wipe off the clay with warm water instead of wash off in sink.  It is rather thick and quick drying.  I imagine it would likely clog a drain.</li>
            <li> FRICK FRACKEN FRICK I HATE MYSELF FOR BUYING THIS. My face was pretty clean and i hadn&#x27;t badly broken out for quite a while, BEFORE I bought this product... Like everyone else I bought it because of the great reviews. All i wanted was a brighter look and maybe a bit of shine since my face was already pretty clean. If only i&#x27;d left well enough alone and read the one star reviews before. Ughh. :(( I started using it with the ACV and broke out almost immediately with tiny red pimples on my forehead (somewhere i never break out!!) and a few over my cheeks. I did feel a nice pulsing and didnt mind the redness since it went away after i applied lotion. I stupidly used it 5 more times thinking it was just getting the gunk out as another reviewer said but nope, sorry, no product is worth a burning face that only results in pimples. Maybe you just have to be consistent with it for a couple months?? but I miss my clean face and now I have to get something else to fix what this product did to me! Don&#x27;t bother if you have sensitive skin, or already decent skin. The only good thing was that it got rid of the blackheads on my nose. Great now I have a jar of dirt JUST for my nose. Yayyy me.</li>
            <li> I can not believe how well this mask worked for my breakout. As a person who has dealt with acne for years and have used just about every product out there including the expensive brands I can not believe something that cost so little worked so well and so fast.I was having a huge breakout when I started using this product and only used it twice at this point and was amazed by how fast my face is clearing up. I have never used anything that has worked so quickly. I was very skeptical on this product because of the low price. But I just can not believe how much it cleared up my face. I used regular acv and it still worked amazingly well.I rarely write reviews but I had to for this product because I am so happy I found something that helps so well with my severe acne. I do use a good moisturizer after use of the mask to help my skin from drying out. It may be slightly messy to clean up but it is so worth it for me to have my fave clear up as much as it has. Im positive after maybe 2 more uses my face will be blemish free</li>
            <li> I alter this with a peel mask for the best results. Really great product. It does leave your skin red for about a minute afterwords but you will notice the difference the next morning.</li>
            <li> Works well and is a great value for the price. Would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have only used it on my hair so far and WOW..my hair felt incredibly soft and managable! Love it !</li>
            <li> I bought this mask mostly cuz of the great reviews &amp;when it came I couldnt wait to try it. I mixed it with raw unfiltered ACV and it does bubble up and become smooth. Once applied on my face I let it on for  about20 mins until it dried it  was a lil  itchy as it dried  in some parts. And I couldn&#x27;t move my face. I was like wow! It started getting uncomfortably tight so I was like yea it&#x27;s time to wash it off.whoa! My face felt like a cement mask was on it lol. Washed it off with warm water and yep, my face stayed red for about half hour, like a sunburn. But then it faded as promised.that was yesterday. My face looks great today!! Really smooth and clearer, a type of clear I dnt get from my other face masks. It works!! This is now in my weekly beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing... It leaves my skin baby smooth! I wish I would have known about it throughout my teenage acne prone years!</li>
            <li> Great mask. Unclog pores</li>
            <li> Spa quality. No messy cleanup for me. Mixed a batch in a small tupperware container used it for months until it was gone then made a new one. Store in fridge. Use braggs acv. Skin does purge at first-keep using. Its worth it</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> Once you get over the fact that you&#x27;re essentially buying a jar of dirt from Amazon, this is actually a great product.  It&#x27;s simple yet so very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive, acne-prone skin and use a regimen of apple cider vinegar whenever I&#x27;m having a bad breakout (it works wonders!), but never did I think of using it as part of a mask!  The combination of ACV and the bentonite clay left my skin feeling pure, clean and it only left some redness that subsided after about 20 minutes.  The next morning I woke up and my skin was more evenly toned, supple and my blemishes had visibly shrunk in size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always laugh when I read the back of the bottle, though: &amp;#34;Feel your face pulsate!!!&amp;#34;  Indeed, you do feel your face &amp;#34;pulsate&amp;#34; as the clay dries.  Your skin may feel uncomfortably tight as the clay dries (good luck making any sort of facial expression) but it&#x27;s all part of the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a chance on this product. You have nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff makes my skin look younger and makes pimples disappear. After I use it I put on a Greek yogurt and honey mask to help with the dryness. And mosterize with some olive oil</li>
            <li> does it heal acne scars?</li>
            <li> I have only used the Indian clay once. When I put it on my face I felt everything tighten up. When I took it off, my face was very red so I didn&#x27;t think it did much of anything . . . until . . . I woke up. This morning my skin is absolutely amazing. The blackheads. gone. The redness, gone. It even almost fully healed an acne wound I had on my left cheek from where I stupidly picked at a zit last week. WHAT IS THIS STUFF? It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> When I use this mask my face feels so smooth and clean. I actually see my marks fading and I feel like my skin is refreshed. It does dry your skin considerably so I apply vitamin E of a strong moisturizer immediately after removing. I also took a reviewer&#x27;s advise and I remove with baby wipes so that it doesn&#x27;t go down and clog my drain. I would definitely recommend this product to all my friends.</li>
            <li> In the process of using this stuff. Item as described. Will update as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> When you dab this stuff on your face and let it dry after fifteen minutes you can feel the crap being sucked out of your pores. No wonder this is known as the world&#x27;s most powerful facial.</li>
            <li> amazing mask! takes all the gunknin your face..can be used for all skin types! love it!</li>
            <li> After reading all of the great reviews on this clay, I decided to give it a shot. I&#x27;m pretty happy with it so far. I&#x27;ve used it as a face mask with both Bragg&#x27;s ACV and just plain water. It works much better with the ACV - the mixture isn&#x27;t lumpy, but I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell. If you go with just water, you&#x27;ll have lumps in the mixture. I suggest putting a few drops of tea tree oil or some other oil in with the ACV mixture to lessen the odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely feel the pulsing sensation after a few minutes (I usually leave my mask on for 25-30 mins). My face is red for about a half hour afterwards, but then my skin is so clean and smooth! My face still gets oily by the end of the day, which is annoying, but I should probably try using the mask more often. I&#x27;ve not noticed much improvement with the pores on my nose, but again, that could be because I only use this once or twice a week. I&#x27;m going to try it every other night and see if I notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this product, and I will continue to buy it in the future!</li>
            <li> I have suffered with acne since the age of 13. I am now 43 years old. I have tried every prescription, and over the counter product there is, and I can honestly say that nothing has truly ever worked for me. This product is the closest thing to perfection that I have tried in the last 30 years of my battle with acne!It will shrink your [pores like you have never seen! The texture of my skin after using this mask is remarkable.It feels like baby skin.The acne is diminishing every week that I use this product. I have never felt this strongly about an acne medication ever!!! TRUST ME THIS STUFF WORKS...I PROMISE!!!</li>
            <li> I have used many masks and this one is far better than the others.  I have not used on that even compares to this one.  It pulls out impurities and my skin feels so smooth afterwards.  The redness will go away I about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Fantastic. My daughter has tried everything, been to the doctor and nothing has helped her acne like this product.  She does it nearly every night and her skin is looking great. She is so happy with the results!  So extremely happy I found this.</li>
            <li> Good product but too messy to use often. The powder  is so hard to contain to container once u openit!!</li>
            <li> Does what it says. I absolutely love this😁</li>
            <li> Nice product. The only downside is that it takes a decent amount of time to dry, but it works quite well on my oily skin. I have large pores and this helps reduce the appearance of them. It&#x27;s a little clumpy when it gets rinsed off, but it&#x27;s not much of a drain clogger.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.. It really deep cleanse your pores.. Just make sure you use a really good facial moisturizer.. It can dry you skin. Over all I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, my face glows after removing the mask. I&#x27;m currently mixing with ACV and lemon juice to fade an old tattoo. It will take some time but I already see results.</li>
            <li> Amazing! That&#x27;s all I need to say. Try it and I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Although it works great, this mask is way too much work. It comes in powder form, so mixing it with water yields a different texture every time, and it&#x27;s too much work to put it in a plastic baggy every time in order to make a completely smooth mask. Also, it is real mud, and will clog up your drain! Don&#x27;t wash it off in the sink- I&#x27;m guessing you need to use paper towels or something. Like I said, too much work. Maybe they will eventually make a product that&#x27;s already mixed.</li>
            <li> Personally feel more when I mix it with water</li>
            <li> not satisfied with results.</li>
            <li> It sees t work much better when mixed with the apple cider vinegar. I don&#x27;t like the smell but it works ok. I mostly got it for my son who suffers from acne pores and face redness but we both use it. It does not work miracles but it clears some the pores out and skin seems healthier.</li>
            <li> Burns you&#x27;d face!!! But makes it feel soft the following day. Not for the delicate flower!</li>
            <li> I have acne-prone and super oily Asian skin. This clay doesn&#x27;t have any positive beneficial values to my skin after a few use. I have been using a lot of different skin care product with Retin-A, BP, AHA, BHA, etc. I know instantly if my skin likes something on it. This is not it...</li>
            <li> First off, I want to point out all the people who gave bad reviews. They all said the same thing: the clay mask is bringing all the acne and blackheads to the surface of their skin!&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S SUPPOSED TO DO THAT.&lt;br /&gt;By bringing all the impurities to the surface, its helping to get rid of them by getting your pores to excrete them quicker. So yes, you will break out for the first few days. But that&#x27;s just the first step.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I love this stuff. I only have been using it for a week on a daily basis (I have moderate/severe acne and acne scarring) and my face feels great. My acne did get worse after the first few days, but it&#x27;s getting progressively better and better! A lot of the people complain about chunks in their masks, but there is an easy solution. I am a ceramics major, so I know how clay works. Just prepare and mix what you need the day before, and then mix it again before you use it. Your water/vinegar will have evenly distributed itself by then in the clay, and you should have little to no chunks. If you leave it for two days its even smoother after mixing; almost like it was whisked.&lt;br /&gt;And again, its clay. Its going to smell a little funny. I work with clay on a daily basis, so I&#x27;m used to it (granted this stuff is way lighter in fragrance). And it will dry out your skin. So just use moisturizer afterward. I put on my acne lotion after, so it gets soaked up really fast.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars people. This is great stuff. Would you really wanna put chemicals on your face when you can use a natural clay that does an even better job?</li>
            <li> love it, thats all i have to say.</li>
            <li> I really do like it but its very lumpy and its very frustrating. I would mix for 10 minutes but it was still very lumpy. I hate that but I guess its still good. It got rid of all my blackheads and made my pores smaller.</li>
            <li> This is the best mask ever! Make sure you purchase raw apple cidar vinager to mix with it. This mask  hardens on your face like concrete! The dirt and oil that is washed away is amazing. I use this one a week. My face has been virtually acne free!!</li>
            <li> This mask works really well to cleanse face tighten pores.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It feels great going on and it feels great once it&#x27;s off also. Don&#x27;t hesitate on buying this seriously just get it. I put my in a baggie with equal parts Braggs Apple cidar vinegar and zip locked it shut an mixed it around with my hands, then I apllied it to my face just wiping the Baggie on my face without touching the clay. It leaves no mess! Then I wiped it off with witch hazel as people have said ☺️ Love it</li>
            <li> This is the only mask you will ever need. It gets rid of blackheads, minimizes pores, reduces break outs, and oil production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are just a couple important things you need to know:&lt;br /&gt;(1) DO NOT USE A METAL SPOON TO MIX THIS. Something about the chemistry messes up the benefits of the clay. You can read more about it on their website if you&#x27;re interested&lt;br /&gt;(2) Your face will be red after using this. It will go away within 5-10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;(3) Your face will be dry after using this. It&#x27;s nothing a little moisturizer can&#x27;t fix.&lt;br /&gt;(4) While it&#x27;s on, you will feel your face &amp;#34;pulse.&amp;#34; Don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s normal. That&#x27;s how the mask works!&lt;br /&gt;(5) While it does work with water, it&#x27;s clumpy and hard to mix. It works much better with apple cider vinegar. It&#x27;s easier to mix, and it will clean your pores much more thoroughly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s super inexpensive and will last forever considering you only need a little bit. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I feel like leaving a positive review for this stuff at this point is overkill--but I bought this clay a little over a month ago, and I&#x27;m so in love with it, I actually wanted to spend 4 minutes out of my day to write a review. Everything everyone says is right--this is the best mask on the market, in my opinion. I definitely would use apple cider vinegar instead of water, because its super lumpy when you use water. With that said, I used only water for the first 3 times and still love the results: very clear and soft skin. I follow it up with witch hazel--thank you guy with the super long review! Anyway, buy this thing. It&#x27;s amazing!!</li>
            <li> I have tried EVERYTHING! From prescriptions to a LOT home remedies, and I will tell you the second I put it on I realized it was one of the most powerful things I&#x27;ve ever put on my face! Now, the catch with this product is the responsibility of making sure you don&#x27;t break out. IF you have dry skin do NOT keep it on for more than ten minutes. if you exceed that you WILL break out. IF you have oily skin, the recommended time is 15-20 minutes. I would recomend mixing the product with apple cider vinegar and in a small sandwhich bag. Do NOT use it frequently with one drain, switch drains up or rinse it out in a bowl with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KEEP TRACK OF TIME SO YOU DONT BREAK OUT. All of the 1 and 2 star reveiws say it doesn&#x27;t work cause they broke out but they didn&#x27;t follow they directions! With the first use I promise you will notice a decrease in redness and irritation and if possibly you will have already gotten smaller pores.&lt;br /&gt;This product is worth it and has been the strongest acne solution I&#x27;ve ever use and trust me I&#x27;ve used almost EVERYTHING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your dirt ;)</li>
            <li> This mask is the only mask I will use on my face. I have sensitive skin and am always looking for something that won&#x27;t irritate me but will work on my oil and blackheads. The mask is really stinky if you mix it with vinegar (obviously) but that&#x27;s really the only way to do it. It actually gets so hard that you can feel your heartbeat in your face! It&#x27;s amazing! And when you take it off, your skin is SO soft.  My skin stays a bit red for awhile after removing the mask but this is from all the blood in my skin (hence the &amp;#34;pulsing&amp;#34; feeling) and not from irritation from the product. So if you&#x27;re very fair skinned be ready for that, but no need for alarm. I would recommend this to anyone, sensitive skin or not. It works wonders and it&#x27;s so affordable. One thing I read though is that you should clean this off your face into a bowl or pot or something other than your sink since the clay can build up and cause a clog after a while. But that&#x27;s a small price to pay for porcelain skin if you ask me. :)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face mask! I combine in with apple cider vinegar and a couple drops of lavender essential oil. It eaves my skin feeling smooth and it cleans up my pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of facial masks.. DIY on Pinterest to St. Helen&#x27;s cucumber mask.. nothing compares to this mask. I was debating purchasing this one or Glam Glow and this definitely gets the job done. I work in an environment full of dust and grime and when I use this mask, it cleans my face to a T. The tingling feeling is amazing and I am so happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I mix it equally with Apple cider vinegar. I love how it makes my face feels once I clean the dried mask off.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and works great on oily acnetic skin</li>
            <li> Great mask. Has a nice tingly feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this once since I bought it a week ago. My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t buy the bigger container. I LOVE this product. I have very acne prone skin and this has helped tremendously in just one use. I&#x27;ll be buying again.</li>
            <li> Great product fast shipping!</li>
            <li> HAVE USED THIS FOR YEARS &amp; COULDNT FIND FOR MANY- LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Thank  you  very much,  i loved</li>
            <li> Amazing product, especially mixed with apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin and this mask has been fine for me when mixed with Apple cider. I ensure to moisturize well after use with a non comogenic moisturizer. I use 2 times weekly about and my skin is near blemish free.</li>
            <li> This product is a dream come true! I am astounded by the results, what a success! I am introducing it to more people and they are loving it as well. Thanks</li>
            <li> Really gets toxins out of skin, I notice my skin is clear and firmer</li>
            <li> This clay is wonderful use it occasionally on hair and skin and makes them feel lovely. Generally mix with water and ACV for best results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years, it&#x27;s a fantastic mask. The container last a long time, great deal for your money. It works quickly in about 5 minutes and makes your skin glow!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this really. For $7.50, I didn&#x27;t expect much. But I decided to try it anyway. It is really easy to use. I mix with ACV and applied to my nose and my chin. The blackheads on my nose have reduced and the breakouts on my chin dried up! I also used the tip from other reviewers to splash some warm water when removing to soften the clay and use paper towels to wipe them away instead of rinsing directly into the sink.</li>
            <li> Would this help my acne scars and open pores ?</li>
            <li> I love this clay and you get such a generous amount for such a good price. I&#x27;m addicted to this mask regiment.</li>
            <li> This lasts for so long! I got this for my sister for a gift and I happen to use it as well heheh... But I am pretty impressed with this. I&#x27;ll just make a list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Affordable&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin smooth and soft&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;Pulsates&lt;br /&gt;Does clean pores thoroughly&lt;br /&gt;Skin feels fresh and clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Hard to get off (can&#x27;t let this thing down the drain)&lt;br /&gt;Does make your breakouts more prominent for a while since it&#x27;s taking the toxins out&lt;br /&gt;Kind if messy because it&#x27;s dry clay but hey, it&#x27;s worth it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helps! I would reccomend using this again (:</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about this product, but I have used it twice now and can honestly say that it does, in fact, produce immediate results. I do not have acne prone skin, but I can tell that my pores are almost completely clear after washing off the mask. It also seems to stimulate blood flow (hence the--slightly freaky--pulsating sensation, I&#x27;m guessing), which is beneficial to the skin in a number of ways. There is redness after removing the mask, but it goes away quickly and completely. Probably the thing I&#x27;m most impressed with, though, is that it does not seem to be drying out my very prone-to-dryness skin. I also would like to add that I don&#x27;t know why so many people have made it seem like applying or removing the mask is messy or difficult. Those types of reviews almost dissuaded me from getting it. However, I&#x27;ve done it twice now and have found it to be simple enough to do before bed on a week night--point being, it doesn&#x27;t require any advance planning, preparation, or clean up. I use a flat paintbrush to apply the mud and a hot washcloth to remove it twenty minutes later. I plan to continue to use it weekly and already have recommended it to a couple friends.</li>
            <li> Have only used it once so far but skin is already looking better! I have blackheads and minor blemishes, instantly cleared up the blackheads and this morning my minor blemishes are greatly reduced. Completely amazed at how well this pile of dirt works :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed with water for my first try and as others have posted it is messy, using a plastic sandwich bag to mix and apply is a very good idea! The small jar should last for months, maybe even a year depending on usage and can&#x27;t beat the price. Based on my experience I think this would also be great for severe acne and would only caution someone with very, very sensitive skin to not use it as it is strong.</li>
            <li> HOLY CRAP! This has literally SAVED my skin!!! This is my third time using it in one week and the results are incredible!!!! My pimples are literally gone and my red marks are drastically fading. I want to help other people struggling with there complexion and I&#x27;m telling you BUY IT!!! I used it with water and alittle rosehip oil. And that had worked amazing. I was scared to try Apple vinegar because I didn&#x27;t want a weird reaction. But seriously guys I never even write reviews, I just had to share that with people struggling with pimples and an overall bad complexion. My skin glows! Go buy it now :) and I hope I helped!!</li>
            <li> Truly does work better with vinegar than water. But very messy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it it makes you have the most zits ever.</li>
            <li> I used this mixed with apple cider vinegar and store bought oil. I used for detoxing hair. This product dries quickly so you have to rinse well and deep condition. I didn&#x27;t see any difference in hair texture or condition. I would not  buy again. Seemed like a good idea.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Lasts forever too. I use it about once a week on my face and it does the trick.</li>
            <li> NOT TO PLEASED WITH THIS ONE ! FELT LIKE PLASTER...TRIED THAT TO ONCE WHEN MY HUSBAND WAS DOING THE WALLS</li>
            <li> Healthy,  organic mask.&lt;br /&gt;Love it and helps managing my acnes. Huge tube, will probably last me forever.</li>
            <li> its really good.......</li>
            <li> This has become a part of my weekly beauty routine...Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This has become a new holy grail product for me, I will be buying this again when I run out, if I ever run out this is a lot of product. You only need a teaspoon of the clay, and a teaspoon of vinegar, I used Braggs vinegar. The mask feels nice on your face, it gets really tight. It will cause reddening, but it says that on the package and it&#x27;s normal. After you use this, you will need a good moisturizer, it cleans out your pours and dries your face a bit. I use Argon oil after I use this, it leaves my face feeling clean and nice. The redness goes away after about 10 mins, and your skin will look and feel great. I totally recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I love how it makes your face feel after you wash it off. I love it love it. I am recommending to all my friends and family</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help with some spots of acne on my face.  I have used it a couple times.  It&#x27;s supposed to be used as a mask, which is okay. It&#x27;s a little too much clay for me,</li>
            <li> This product is just what I needed for facials. Size saves me money.Mixes well DOES THE JOB. Would buy again. LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  It draws the toxins out of your body.  It makes my skin look so beautiful.  I glow after I use this product.</li>
            <li> The first time using this product was a bit of a learning experience for me, and messy, but the second time is a charm! I use about 3 teaspoons of this stuff per application (the bottle says to coat your face with ¼ - ½ in of this stuff, I found that to be a waste and quite unnecessary. I also use equal parts water to mix it, which does leave a somewhat chunky consistency; I will have to try it with apple cider vinegar another day. So with my 3 teaspoon application and waiting for the clay to dry (It is a little difficult to remove but there is nothing that can really be done about that, it&#x27;s clay-- DO NOT PUT ANY OF THE CLAY DOWN THE DRAIN! I wash my face off into an empty bucket and then toss the used clay and water outside) my skin feels SO amazing! It is super soft and feels very clean.</li>
            <li> We have used many products for boils. I have cysts boils!!! Nothing worked, until we found Aztec Secret-Indian Healing Clay. Followed directions and within 15 -20 minutes. The boil had formed a head and by the next morning the boil had burst!!!In my opinion, what I read about this product, before ordering it, is true to its promises!!! We love it, it works!!!! We love Amazon, too!!! Thank you Amazon for your site!!!</li>
            <li> You have to add water to it and sometimes the dry clay just clot and makes it difficult to apply on the face. But it works very well! My face was very smooth after only one use.</li>
            <li> I mixed this product with apple cider video and really enjoyed the results! Definitely intense suction, and left my skin feeling silky smooth. I had serious cystic acne at the time, and it seemed like it was soothed the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why three stars? I liked the product, but I don&#x27;t think it made a lasting impact on my skin even with a few uses. Good, but not a miracle product.</li>
            <li> A gem, I still require a facial by a professional but this does a very good job at cleaning out the old layers of skin on my face. I use it all over my body for extensive exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great steal for the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months and I used it about 10 times and there is still a TON left in the container.&lt;br /&gt;My face gets a bit red because it really does work.  Maybe too well...</li>
            <li> A very good product.  Well worth the effort.  I will try to always have it at hand.  By a mile it is better than all the expensive products that are available.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using this after I break out and I definitely can see the change. I leave it on for ~40-60mins, at 20mins I didn&#x27;t really see any changes so I upped the time. Though I don&#x27;t suggest doing that if you have sensitive skin. Also I noticed this pulls facial hair out with it, not sure if that&#x27;s just an odd coincidence or not.</li>
            <li> i use this myself but when I noticed my teenagers face breaking out I made them do a facial as well. It really helped their faces. Didn&#x27;t cute the acne completely cuz they are teenagers after all. But it did help a great deal!</li>
            <li> I used this mask with ACV. Definitely felt the pulsating. I keep reading everyone says it&#x27;s because the blood is rushing to your face? I don&#x27;t know about all that. Calcium bentonite is technically volcanic.. It&#x27;s pretty much creating an electric current when it&#x27;s introduced to liquid. That&#x27;s why it bubbles and you can&#x27;t you metal utensils (metal is a conductor). Pretty neat. That&#x27;s also why it draws out toxins. The charge grabs onto them. Regardless, it helps with my acne. (:</li>
            <li> I must be missing something here because I don&#x27;t get all the hype. I thought the mess, the clogging of my drain and mud everywhere was not worth the results. It&#x27;s a pain in the neck. Contact me and you can have mine for free.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product a couple times so far and I definitely feel the tingly and pulsating feeling. After my skin feels so soft and not dry at all. One thing that I don&#x27;t like is that my face stings and I get little red welts on my face after using this product however, it goes away within an hour.</li>
            <li> This clay has made my skin look so much better! I did the mask with Apple Cider Vinegar three times now, and my skin was red for about 1/2 hour (like the packaging said it might). After that, my skin was so smooth and soft. I have a problem with adult acne, so I have tried just about everything. I am going to read up more on this, and see what else I can do with it. I am also going to buy one for my sister.</li>
            <li> THANKS FOR THIS&lt;br /&gt;ONCE A WEEK OR ONCE A MONTH, USE IT&lt;br /&gt;FORGET FANCY SPA TREATMENTS, THEY USE CLAY ALSO&lt;br /&gt;IT EXFOLIATES, DRAWS OUT THE DIRT, CLEANS AND TIGHTENS PORES, AND THE COMPLEXION LOOKS FRESHER&lt;br /&gt;YOU MAY ALSO TRY OUT THE BENTONITE LIQUID DRINK TO DO INTERNAL CLEANSING&lt;br /&gt;I AM ON LOTS OF MEDICATIONS.&lt;br /&gt;MY SKIN AND HAIR WENT THRU TERRIBLE THINGS, AND HAS FINALLY GOTTEN BACK TO A BEAUTIFUL PLACE.&lt;br /&gt;KEEP OFFERING THIS. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Feels like a real mask!</li>
            <li> Used it once-burned....no literally burned my face. I had to wait almost 2 weeks for my forehead scab to heal then guess what happened? My face broke out in cystic bumps that hurt so bad. I really wanted this help clear my pores and it didn&#x27;t. Do not buy if you know what&#x27;s good for you.</li>
            <li> I seriously love this! Mix it with some apple cider vinegar and have great skin after washing it off. You literally have to wash and scrub it off, but my skin looks great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once with 50/50 vinegar and water solution.&lt;br /&gt;So far so good. My skin was softer and glowing (a bit red too, but that went away shortly after I moisturized) afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll have to try it a few more times to see if it lives up to the hype of improving your complexion (some review claim a drastic difference after just 3 uses).</li>
            <li> Didnt work with me. It made my skin a little itchy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 51 with a greasy face.  My problem is forgetting to use it.  I&#x27;ve had it 7 months and used it 3 times.  Every time I have loved it.  It takes so little and this jar will last me for ages.  I mix it with 1/2 vinegar and 1/2 water in a solo cup.  People were freaking me out about washing it down the drain so I just use that and paper towels to take majority off and throw it all away.  It&#x27;s not a miracle thing but it&#x27;s $9 and makes my face happy.  I&#x27;m not glowing by any means but it&#x27;s a great refresh.  Someone posted about mixing it in a ziplock bag.  I did that but the solo cup with a spoon is much easier.  Spend the $9.  Oh and I do not have sensitive skin so don&#x27;t quote me if you do.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> Huge container, will last forever.  It&#x27;s a bit of a pain and a mess mixing it up every time you want to use a mask, so I just make a small batch and stick it in a jar in my fridge to use when I need to.  Much easier, and as long as it&#x27;s covered in an air-tight container it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> OMG I love this stuff.  I use it in at-home facials.  I have not tried it as a deep conditioning mask for my hair yet.  It works great and is powerful. I noticed my acne lessening after the first use.</li>
            <li> very good four stars because it&#x27;s only external.... I wanted to drink some but the label scared me.  messy but it s good and real.</li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the tingling that the other reviewers have gotten, but I&#x27;m amazed how great my skin look since I started using this once a week.  The first time I used it I broke out but that was to be expected because of everything it was pulling out of my skin.  I recommend using it with apple cider vinegar and I just wash iit off in the shower with no problem.  I&#x27;ve used a ton of expensive face masks, but now I only buy Indian healing clay!</li>
            <li> Nothing really out of this world</li>
            <li> A friend from work recommended this. There is so much product in this jar! Mix a tiny bit with Bragg&#x27;s Apple Cider Vinegar once a week, so good for you!</li>
            <li> Great stuff, really did help out. Its a great price too!</li>
            <li> So the first time I used this , my preteen daughters and I got little salsa bowls and our apple cider vinegar from the kitchen and headed upstairs to the bathroom, I grabbed a older foundation brush and we started mixing.. it was really fun to do together, and the pulsing claim is real, it tightens and you can feel a slight pulse as it drys.. after rinsing with warm washcloths or jumping in the shower your skin should be all prepped to do some extractions.  The last 2 times I have done it on my own I mixed a few drops of lavender essential oil into the mix and it was both aromatic and great for the skin and left my face much less red than just using the clay &amp; vinegar without the EO. Have fun..try new things.. you will love it!  Also word to the wise,.. its cheaper on vitacost.com, so if you were planning a vitacost order, look there too!</li>
            <li> i actually use this stuff every week on fridays and my skin is so amazing and my family always ask me what i do to my face. i now have two of my cousins using this product with me. 100% natural and i love it. my skin is so beautiful guys. here is how i mix my product&lt;br /&gt;1)1 teaspoon of clay&lt;br /&gt;2)2 teaspoons of extra virgin olive oil&lt;br /&gt;3)1 teaspoon of apple cider (acv)&lt;br /&gt;4)3 teaspoons of warm water&lt;br /&gt;5) and mix mix mix until it looks like clay, do not use metal to mix the product, now put it on your face and let it sit for 45min to an hr if you would like!!! my next target is the rhassoul clay!!!! im so excited guys!!! hope this helps</li>
            <li> My wife wanted this, she seems to like it, I know nothing about it, but it got here fast so what are my complaints?</li>
            <li> Purchased this 3 times when mixed with cider vinegar the only mask to come close to pore shrinking is the pore shrink mask I&#x27;ve reviewed on Amazon.  Be warned this will make your face feel like its in a vice and once off it feels fabulous - an oily skin must have product</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mask.&lt;br /&gt;It really pulls out all the oil and dirt from your skin, leaving it squeaky clean; and also helps a lot with breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;You can really feel the tingling sensation, which I like because it means it&#x27;s doing something.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re struggling with acne and oily skin, you NEED this mask in your life!</li>
            <li> After using the healing clay for a few months, I have noticed my skin has cleared up significantly and my pores are noticeably smaller and cleaner looking.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed results in less than a week of regular use, using apple cider vinegar at a roughly 2:1 ratio. My girlfriend likes to go slightly thinner by adding a tiny bit more vinegar to thin out the mixture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The contracting feel of the clay drying is surprising at first, but is actually very pleasant. I always look forward to the nights when I clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the cheapest and most effective skin treatment I have ever used (and I have tried quite a few).</li>
            <li> As an educated consumer, I am continually on a quest to find natural products/remedies for various things; especially when it comes to skin care as I have sensitive skin. I purchased this item after reading up on the benefits of bentonite clay. So far, I&#x27;ve used this item as both a facial mask and on an insect bite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a facial mask, I think this stuff works fairly well. Just note that it is difficult to get smooth (so there are clumps, which makes it difficult to spread on your skin) and it will dry out your skin (so make sure you have a good moisturizer once you wash it off). With that said, I definitely saw a difference after using it a few times in terms of how my skin looked and felt. I myself don&#x27;t really feel a tingly sensation other than the sensation I feel as it dries (which is typical for any type of mud/clay mask).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday afternoon I noticed a large insect bite on my forearm. As someone who has a somewhat severe reaction to insect bites (flea bites looks like mosquito bites, mosquito bites look like spider bite, etc.,) I figured I mine as well try the clay to see how to works for this purpose. Well, sure enough, after letting it sit on the bite for about 15-20 minutes, I washed it off and noticed an immediate difference. The swelling had gone down significantly and the bite did not hurt anymore. By this morning, you can barely even see it. Usually it takes 2-3 days for bites to look the way it does in less than 24 hours when using the clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all this being said, I definitely recommend this clay for the various purposes described on the label.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of the reviews and maybe I&#x27;m missing something but I use this almost every day before I shower for work.  I only use a couple of tablespoons with the vinegar.  It mixes well, goes on smoothly with a makeup brush and doesn&#x27;t clog my drain.  It has cleared up my acne and makes my skin so smooth.  So far so good!  Now my mother wants to try it.  I received my order very quickly.  This is a very good seller and I will reorder.</li>
            <li> So I was hesitant to try this product to begin with. I am 27 years old and I have horrible hormonal/adult acne with combination skin. My tzone is oily and my chin is usually dry. Clay products tend to exacerbate that 10 fold. Starting last year after switching to a new birth control, I really broke out all over my face. I felt like I was in high school again. It was absolutely horrifying. I was constantly anxious about my skin. I bought about every single product known to man for my face. I spent probably thousands of dollars to no avail, and it seemed either a product would make my face even worse, or only help slightly or for a short period of time. I began to pick my face obsessively. DO NOT EVER DO THIS...I cannot stress this enough. People at my workplace started to notice my worsening skin, and even commented to me about it. It only made my anxiety and face picking worse...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to present day....I decided to finally buy this product after reading hundreds of reviews and doing plenty of research. I figured I had nothing to lose at this point. The product came quickly and packaging was nice. I hesitated for several days to use the product...but finally I gave it a try! All I can say is wowwww! A few pointers...1. USE 100% non-filtered apple cider vinager....you will regret it if you dont. It is not harsh on the skin. 2. If you are like me and dry out using clay, put a capful of olive oil in with it as well...makes a huge difference. 3. I do not put on a 1/2 in of clay...a layer to cover the face is more than enough. 4. DO NOT use the mask once or twice and think because you see nothing yet it does not work. After the 4th day or so is when I finally noticed the drastic changes. 4. Almond oil or olive oil after the mask is a must. Like I said, the mask itself isn&#x27;t drying, but the oils have healing properties that work magic while you sleep. 5. DO NOT freak out when your face is read afterwards for about 30 mins...its normal. 6. I recommend leaving the mask on until it dries...not the label that says 15-20 mins...usually takes me about 45 to an hour. I have been using it everyday for over a week now and I am in shock. My skin is glowing and beautiful. The oily tzone is at bay, and my dry flakey chin is getting better with each use. The awful pick marks/scabs are finally healing, my acne purged the first few days due to the mask pulling out the toxins and dirt, and now my blackheads and deep pimples are finally going away. I can&#x27;t believe that I was so afraid to use this mask, and it is the one product that is working. I tossed my proactiv and all the other chemical crap in the trash today and made sure I got on here to write a review...which I barely ever do. You can crush an aspirin into the mask as well for hard to heal acne. I do not even need to do so, but I have read many people do so. Oh, few other tips. Use plastic spoon and plastic bowl to mix it. You should also watch your drains...I can bet this will clog it. So I try to get as much as I can peel off my face into the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all people....TRY IT. For 8 bucks you can&#x27;t go wrong. I am the queen of acne products and I gotta say, this is a miracle in a jar. Good luck! :)ask on until it dries...not the label that says 15-20 mins...usually takes me about 45 to an hour. I have been using it everyday for over a week now and I am in shock.

            <li> This is definitely the best clay mask I have ever used. It is a very strong and powerful clay and I can feel it penetrating deep into my pores. So far so good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad. It&#x27;s messy. If you have sensitive skin I&#x27;d be careful. My face was red for two days, but my black heads were gone. So don&#x27;t use it the day before a big event!</li>
            <li> Wish they sold this mixed and ready to use !!! It&#x27;s a really good stuff but what a mess mixing it up !!! Now this is indeed the most extracting mask ever !!! You will feel the freshness write away and the mask gets really really tigh as it pull Al of the dust and crab from your face</li>
            <li> I thought the reviews on this product were inflated but it turns out that this mask really does make your skin baby soft.&lt;br /&gt; I really love it for that. I still have not had the other major changes in my skins that others have experienced. I am still very hopeful as its only been a week since I started using, but just for the softness alone its worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product but wasn&#x27;t a miracle for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some hormonal acne that was slowly going away with light glycolic acid peels, but I wanted faster results. This product didn&#x27;t necessarily clear up the couple of stubborn cysts that were hanging around, but it did really help return my complexion to prior break out status -  glowing, smooth and just really healthy looking. I did notice a few blackheads that were &#x27;pulled&#x27; to the surface and at first I thought the clay had deposited them but I am pretty sure they were pulled. I have a couple of cystic acne blemishes that have been there for a few weeks, and after three consecutive days of using the clay they have not surfaced but their redness and size is much smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed an improvement in my complexion within 24 hours and after three days of use the acne cysts were nearly invisible under makeup (which included a yellow blemish cover stick). I hope after a week of continued use they&#x27;ll &#x27;heal&#x27; and be gone forever. Then I&#x27;ll just use weekly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is messy, as others have mentioned - DO NOT RINSE IN SINK - a little down the drain isn&#x27;t an issue but you don&#x27;t want to rinse the entire face in your sink/shower because this is dirt. I get a large bowl, rinse with that and toss the dirty water outside. Then I wash my face with my cleanser and lather with BioOil or face lotion. That evening or the next morning I return to my normal routine. I got a bit of redness. I left the mastk on much longer than 20 min - until it dried and changed color - about 45 min. It did hurt a bit as it tightened and pulsed but not much. I didn&#x27;t use a really think layer, maybe 1/8 of an inch. I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Deep clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;The pulsating effect is invigorating.&lt;br /&gt;Fewer black heads.  Smoother skin and glowing complexion.&lt;br /&gt;I would totally recommend this stuff</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews and figured I&#x27;d try it. The jar proclaims that your face will pulsate. I can&#x27;t say that I felt tha but my skin felt good. I followed others advice and mixed it in a zipper bag. No mess.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use in my homemade shaving soap. It seems to provide a smooth surface for my razor blade. One day i got a bad case of poison ivy. I read that applying this as a mud over the skin would relieve the &amp;#34;itching&amp;#34;. Made the mud, let it dry, washed it off and never looked back. It worked!</li>
            <li> Once a week, and feeling after the skin is clean and redness well after a, acne and India have subsided, but blackheads are still there, I will stick with, must have some effect.</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of facial masks and none of them have compared to this on. I did have a lot more breakouts at first, BUT these are the pimples that were already below the surface and are just being pulled out. So, if this happens to you, don&#x27;t get discouraged. Sometimes it will get worse before it gets better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it with water and apple cider vinegar and there is a HUGE difference on which liquid you choose to use. The water and clay creates a clumpy and mess of a mask to put on that is difficult to spread. With the apple cider vinegar, there it is effortless to get the clay and vinegar to mix into a smooth velvety paste that goes on easily. Plus, the &amp;#34;pulsations&amp;#34; are more intense with the vinegar when compared to water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently tried this routine and it has done wonders for my face: (1) wash face as usual (2) exfoliate with one part olive oil and one part white sugar (3) wash face again to remove the oil (4) use this clay mask (5) rinse off (it comes off easiest if you use a wash cloth to collect water and splash it on your face just as you would if you were rinsing your face after washing it and using the cloth to gently remove the mask. It takes less than a minute to get it off this way) (6) moisturize&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, after several uses, my pores are smaller, acne is less of an issue, and the blackheads on my nose are gone. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I use it 1-2 times a week.  I followed the directions on the back but it makes too much so I kinda just eyeball it with the powder and apple cider vinegar until I get the consistency I want.  It literally feels like its pulling the gunk out of your pore as its drying. LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> This product definitely lives up to it&#x27;s high reviews. My skin looks clearer and pores look smaller. With people with adult acne issues, this won&#x27;t solve your problem, but it does help acne heal faster. What more could you ask for in a facial mask?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that say this is hard to wipe off, you are not applying it thick enough. Make sure you apply it with your hands for a thicker application, and when you&#x27;re ready to take it off, wet a washcloth in warm water, put it up to your face in sections and it just wipes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, make sure you apply a good moisturizer after while your face is still wet, because it does have a drying effect on your skin.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time and I was amazed at how well it clarified my hair.  This stuff made my curls pop and my hair was so soft.  I will use this as a clarifier once a month because it made my hair feel clean but not stripped.</li>
            <li> Just came today and I tried as directed.  Got tight very quickly.  Washed off easy enough.  The product made my neck very, very red.  Hopefully it disappears after 30 minutes as stated.  So far, so good and would recommend.</li>
            <li> Great communication with vender. I&#x27;ll do business with them again. Easy, fast and simple. Recommended. Great product and very happy.</li>
            <li> In love with this clay mask .. I tend to get cystic acne and this helps calm my cysts down .</li>
            <li> IT WOKRS IF YOU DONT BELIEVE IT WORKS...TRUSH ME! I WAS IN YOUR SHOES....I WAS THE ONE WITH THE SAME PROBLEM YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW! I HAD THAT PROBLEM WITH MY SKIN. I WISH I COULD SEND YOU A VOICE MESSAGE TO EXPLAIN YOU(YES IM TALKING TO YOU) HOW GOOD THIS IS....I MEAN I HAD PIMPLE PROBLEMS SINCE LIKE I WAS 14 TO AGE 21 AND GUESS WHAT I USE THIS FOR LIKE A WEEK AND YOU CAN SEE THE DIFERENCE RIGHT AWAY.ITS NOT GONNA TAKE ALL PIMPLES IN 1 DAY. BUT AFTER A WEEK YOU WILL HAVE 50% LESS PIMPLES.MY ENGLISH IS NOT THAT GOOD BUT I THINK YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IM TRIYING TO SAY NOW RIHGT????? I TRIED EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NOTHING WORKED UNTIL 1 DAY I WAS BORED NO CONFIDENT.THIS MY FRIEND IS GONNA HELP YOU IMPROVE YOUR CONFIDENT AS WELL WITH A BEATIFULL FACE.I HAVE USE THIS FOR 3 MONTHS SO FAR ONLY BOUGHT 1.. AND I ONLY HAVE LIKE 1 PIMPLE A WEEK.BUT MOST OF THE TIMES NO PIMPLES!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I used it on my son who is horribly allergic to poison ivy. The first time I used it when he&#x27;d had it awhile and it was really bad. The second time I used it was right when the spots started showing up. It totally wiped them out. They appeared, but never spread and then went away. I mised the Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay with Bragg&#x27;s Apple Cider Vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this clay due to all the amazing reviews, hoping that it would help me with my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a nice treatment indeed, it makes me feel very clean, I mixed it with vinegar and got even better results. Nevertheless, the effects are not as stunning as said by some people, yes, it would clean your skin nicely, but do not expect it to change your complexion dramatically, at least it was not the case for me. By the way, I have been using this mask once a week during 4 months.</li>
            <li> I have been FIGHTING with my skin so much as a 27 year old woman. I&#x27;ve tried everything, Retin-A, duac,benzoyl peroxide, clindimycn, salicylic acid, a million $$$ on makeup and face washes, you name it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this almost every night for the past week on my face, neck and chest for a half hour. My skin is flawless and I haven&#x27;t used any of my other harsh chemical products, including expensive peter Thomas Roth acne face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin does tingle and tighten (used with apple cider vinegar) and the turns bright red for like 20 mins and then I just rub a little maracuja or argon oil on the red areas and I look like a different, fresh faced, amazing woman. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!</li>
            <li> I do love how my skin feels after the treatment and the only negative is the messy mess of taking off the clay after it&#x27;s hardened!</li>
            <li> Wow did this work! In less than 5 min, my face was already tightened up and once I washed it off, my skin felt incredibly smooth and clean. Definitely a buy!</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this mask.  I began getting terrible breakouts at 23 and it got really bad when I turned 24.  I never had acne as youth or even teen.  I&#x27;m assuming the stresses of a transitioning adult figuring life out finally took a toll on my skin.  I went to two dermatologists, paid for countless microdermabrasion facials (which I love by the way and ultitmately helped with dark spots caused by acne, and also unclogging the pores,) and I bought every skin care product in addition to the prescriptions my doctor recommend.  This is my second time purchasing this product.  I use this clay mask 1-2 times per week and my bumps go away over night.  The mask tingles when wet and you can feel it working when it&#x27;s dry, your skin becomes very tight.  I mix the mask with water and allow it to sit for 15 minutes before applying to skin.  Over the course of time, I only use the mask when I have a break out and apply it in that area.  If you are skeptical about trying this mask, don&#x27;t be! It works wonders over night.</li>
            <li> Awesome mud mask. By far the best mask I&#x27;ve ever used. Softens your skin, helps reduce black heads and acne, and overall makes your face feel better. Dont use as much as the container says (it recommends 1/4 - 1/2 inch thick) and dont be freaked out when your face is super red after washing it off. The redness goes away quickly and you are left with great skin. Love it.</li>
            <li> Easy to mix as you need it - you can feel the results immediately and see the results as soon as you wash it off. Great for the New England change of seasons and blah skin from changing temperatures. This container lasts a long time - you really only need a tablespoon for each mask. I have combination skin and just love this.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the reviews I decided to give this a try. For the price, it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to bad if it was a flop. I have now used this twice and I notice a significant difference in my skin. First of all, the blackheads on my nose and between my brows are gone. Also, I had to pimples that were kind of sore and raw near my lip, and they have dried up and are no longer red. I suspect they will be gone here shortly. This mask feels really odd while it&#x27;s on you face, and it definitely pulsates, as they say it will. I recommend this product and have already told a few friends about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH-and I have rosacea and it did not bother that, just an FYI</li>
            <li> Get a small bowl and a new foundation applicator brush, and some apply cider vinegar. small amount of clay and a small amount of the apple cider vinegar, it fizzes up and mixes perfectly, something you cannot do with regular water. Then brush on your troubled areas and within minutes you can feel the clay harden and work. I leave it on 15 minutes, once a week. Great for my skin!</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews I thought this product would be great, not the case. First off let me say I have normal skin. I mixed with apple cider vinegar as product instructs and left on for ten minutes. Worked as described but when I washed it off my face was a bright red and was burning. I took a thirty minute shower to get all of this stuff off. After about an hour the redness started to go away. I called the phone number on the package and was told to put aloe Vera on the skin and I did. I hope the aloe helps and my skin is not actually burnt! I will update this review tomorrow on how my skin is. But for now my skin is still burning. I hope I am going to be OK.... I fear I have made a horrible mistake using this product. I have know idea how it could have gotten so many good reviews.</li>
            <li> This is a great calcium bentonite clay and makes an awesome detoxifying mask. I have used sodium bentonite for face masks and it&#x27;s really hard to apply as it tends to ball up and not spread easily. This clay mixed with apple cider vinegar gives an extra kick and foams up for an easy, mousse-like application. You can definitely feel this working, as it tightens your skin and brings the blood to the skin, sucking out dirt and toxins. I use this once a week to keep my pores clean</li>
            <li> Cool product, really nice facial. Je tem!</li>
            <li> This did nothing, but dry out my skin. Such a joke.</li>
            <li> I had great expectations for this, purchased a lot of it at another retailer.  It is too drying for me, not doing much.  I use it for the occasional blemish, works fine for that.  I like to use it anyway, maybe I should skip the vinegar that I purchased to use with it.</li>
            <li> Just started using this last week.  Love it so far.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the miracle mask some reviews touted it as, but it did improve my skin. I used the apple cider vinegar with it and did not always feel the &amp;#34;tingle.&amp;#34; That seemed to be a product of the tightening as it dries. It does cake heavily and is kind of tiresome to remove. You can scratch your face if not careful. Nevertheless, as I said, it did improve my skin when I used it consistently, by which I mean about three times a week. Decent product. I&#x27;ll likely buy again.</li>
            <li> I desperately need something for my acne. I&#x27;ve had bad acne since my freshman year of high school. My problem area is around my mouth. I&#x27;ll give an update after I use it for a month or so. It&#x27;s super refreshing! I mixed it with only apple cider vinegar. I read a bunch of reviews and they all said how you won&#x27;t be able to move your face because it&#x27;s so intense. At first I kind of felt my face pulsing but nothing extreme. Then like 5 minutes later my face was completely unable to move at all. It&#x27;s amazing. Regardless if it helps my acne or not which I&#x27;ll let you know. it&#x27;s still totally worth it. Taking off the product wasn&#x27;t as difficult as I thought. Just use warm water and maybe a wash cloth. My face didn&#x27;t dry out which was surprising. After I removed it my face wasn&#x27;t as red as I thought it would be either. I highly recommend this like you seriously can&#x27;t beat the price. My face literally felt brand new.</li>
            <li> I have been using this clay for years. It is very affordable and very effective! Makes my skin look fresh, clean and well taken care of!</li>
            <li> This jar will last you the rest of your life! Such a bargain and an amazing product. I&#x27;m using it for anti aging purposes and I have faith it will work.</li>
            <li> The mess that comes with using this product with the cider vinegar makes it a big chore to use it. It works great if you don&#x27;t mind the mess.</li>
            <li> Works well scars are fading acne heals better. If u have to pop a white head u put a little bit of it over the pimple u just popped and it will heal right up. Only thing is it will draw out all your underneath pimples \\&quot;impurities\\&quot; at first.but ill take that over pimples popping up for the rest of my life. &amp; also my face doesn&#x27;t warm up or pulsate from it like everyone else but maybe its because I&#x27;m a smoker.</li>
            <li> another item I bought to help skin and still have not used it  because I think it will be messy and I will have to be ready to jump in the shower right away</li>
            <li> Came in just fine. I use the clay for my natural hair kinky texture. This clay would be considered more of protein clay/conditioner. I used it weekly to cleanse my hair, and I noticed that my hair strand were smoother and stronger. So this more on the strengthening/protein then moisturizing, unless your hair loves protein then this will be moisturizing for you!</li>
            <li> sucks all the gunk out of my pores.  i even started using it on my husband&#x27;s back.  i do have to use it once a week to maintain results though.  i have pretty sensitive skin and i&#x27;m fine with this stuff.  i get red for maybe 30 minutes and then my skin calms down.</li>
            <li> Cleared up my skin in a few days and a lot of people noticed. Definitely buying it again. There&#x27;s also a lot of product so it will last a long time. The only downside is that it&#x27;s messy and takes a while to prepare the mask but no pain no gain.~</li>
            <li> love how soft it makes my skin!! it does get a little red after washing it off but it soon fades, maybe i just have real sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This product exceeded my expectations... cheap and effective!  I could not believe how my skin felt after only one use.  I will definitely purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> I was initially very skeptical about trying something like this because I&#x27;m your typical 30+ year old man. And we guys don&#x27;t buy things like this... or so I thought. It cleans pores very well and seems to tone your skin, leaving it very smooth. My face looks and feels 10 years younger after my weekly treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now you do have to be very careful when opening the container and when dispensing the product because power goes EVERYWHERE!  When it comes time to wash it off, it is very hard to do without mud getting all over your bathroom (or wherever you choose to apply it). Now, none of this was meant to discourage you. As long as you give yourself time and don&#x27;t mind some cleanup, then you&#x27;re still in luck BECAUSE this stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> If you have clogged pores this will unclog them! I use it 2 to 3 times a month now that my pores are unclogged to keep them that way. The clay also minimizes the size of your pores, gives you a radiant glow, and exfoliates without drying out your skin. love it love it!!!</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used this product twice so I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet.  I didn&#x27;t know that this clay is a powder and you have to mix it with water.  This is very difficult for me to get it to the right texture that you think it should be to apply it to your face.</li>
            <li> This really does go deep into the pores, HOWEVER it can be a tad bit uncomfortable. Watch my review about it on TheVixenBox on youtube or like my page on facebook to get more in depth on how I use it.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because it did work............WAY TOO GOOD! It took me weeks to get my face cleared up after it pulled everything to the surface that I didn&#x27;t know I had in there. I knew I had a few that I wanted to draw out so I thought I would give this a try.  It made my face freak out! It took weeks to get it to calm down after using it once. It did what it should have but it&#x27;s not for me. Maybe it&#x27;s for younger skin. I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s with average skin and never had THIS kind of acne before. It was bad that my skin and face hurt from all the zits for weeks after. No thank you!</li>
            <li> Very good product. I have used this on my skin and in my hair and both ways the products worked very well.</li>
            <li> Face - mixing it with water to a pasty consistency, leaving for 15-20 min&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It made such a huge difference in shrinking my boyfriend&#x27;s pores. He has really oily skin and since he shaves his head, the oily skin doesn&#x27;t seem to end until the neck. A few hours later, the pores relaxed a little bit, but still better than it was originally&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I am fortunate to only get the occasional pimple but I noticed this is a great pimple-zapper. I just dab a thick layer of clay &amp; teeny tiny bit of water over it and let it sit for 20-30 min. The zit disappears in 1-2 days rather than the usual 4-5 days. Plus I don&#x27;t have time to mess with it and give myself an ugly scar&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I have combination skin aka T-Zone. This thing will shrink and distort your face after it dries so don&#x27;t be scared that another person is staring back in the mirror. I couldn&#x27;t blink so after about 15 minutes I had to wash it off. My pores are thankfully small already so I didn&#x27;t see anything noticeable. BUT the texture of my skin felt velvety. I am told I have nice skin already but dang, this made it feel different for days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Mosquito bites - we all love getting them don&#x27;t we? I have a tendency to get the quarter/silver dollar size hard, incredibly itchy bites. I only had the clay on for a few minutes, went to sleep, and woke up with it a third of the size. Still itchy though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body - ingested with a lot of water&lt;br /&gt;-I haven&#x27;t really tried this, but the bf likes to take this with fiber drink and such to absorb the toxins from his insides. Ironically, wild elephants know to do this to absorb the toxins they eat from all the foliage in their diet. I don&#x27;t go around eating poisonous berries, but with all the processed food these days, it can&#x27;t be a bad idea to do a cleanse.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I expected, it&#x27;s a mask! It mixed well with the apple cider vinegar and made more than I anticipated. It actually was nice on my skin and I used it for the suggested 15 minutes for sensitive skin. My roommate and I who both used this both broke out the next day. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying again.</li>
            <li> Love this product and will purchase another jar after my first one is done.</li>
            <li> I just received mine today and the product looks exactly like the picture. I mixed mine with apple cider vinegar in a zip lock bag it was easy enough. Left in on for about 20 mins it was kinda hard to take off and my face did get red but it should go away soon according to other reviews. My face feels soft hopefully I see more results as I use it.</li>
            <li> I always get acne so I decided to try this and I must say it really does work at first I had only bought it because it was 10 bucks lol who would of thought it actually improves acne I&#x27;m amazed</li>
            <li> Works great on my acne.</li>
            <li> Delivered today, I tried for the first time, mixed with water. I have nothing in the pores on my nose and I can&#x27;t even SEE the pores on my forehead!!! I am floored!!!!!!!!!! I&#x27;m going to use it on my back next. I have never been so excited about a facial product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dramatic &#x27;feel you skin pulsate&#x27; headline in the jar: I literally felt a heartbeat like sensation through my face as it cleared and shrunk my pores. Just amazing.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Tried this product on my face and a portion of my hair. My face was clean and felt soft. There was a little dryness but I used a moisturizing lotion and all was well. As for my hair I only did a small portion just to see the difference. My hair is natural (no chemical processing). My curls were well defined and my scalp was (squeaky) clean. I would recommend this product to my family and friends. I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Clearing up oily skin and hormonal breakouts. Mix 1/4 cup of clay with 1/4 cup organic apple cider vinegar in a sandwich bag.  Then I snip one corner, squeeze clay mixture onto fingers and apply.  I leave clay mask on for 10 mins or until dry, then wipe off with aperture towel.  I store any remaining mixture in another baggie.</li>
            <li> This mask is fun to apply and makes my skin soft. I don&#x27;t notice a difference in acne though, I just have couple to begin with. It also loves to clog my drains, and if I remove it with a towel, the towel is pretty much ruined, unless I rinse it off, but then it clogs the drain. So I wash my face in a big bowl and dump it outside, however this adds to the hassle though.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff for myself. (this is my husbands account) and i&#x27;m completely blown away by the results after just one use. i mixed it with equal parts of water and ACV and it worked magically. I left it on for about 30 mins. You don&#x27;t feel anything happening right off the bat. It took about 15 mins to start feeling the &amp;#34;pulsating&amp;#34; feeling. My lips puckered up and I could literally feel my skin getting a good cleaning while it was drying. Let it dry all the way. And be careful when you rinse it off... could possibly clog your drains. I highly recommend this product, and am looking forward to what it will do with continuous use.</li>
            <li> This product has really improved the quality of my skin, the first week I got it i used it everyday for a week and after that I used it every second day. I had dark acne scars which are now gone and I have not had any new breakouts, my skin also looks very radiant and glowing</li>
            <li> My face is really clearing up!</li>
            <li> incredible!! works soooo well on blemishes leaves pores very clean and skin feels very refreshed after using!!</li>
            <li> ummmm....WHAT have I been doing all my life without this!!!?? OMYGOD!!! this is literally LITERALLY the cheapest skin saver EVARRR! I have normal to dry skin, the occasional blemish, and the usual BLAH skin. so I knew I needed to do SOMETHING. I mean, clothes only look as good as the skin that wears them right? right. so I bought this after seeing a gazillion good reviews. well was I surprised! I mixed a little apple cider vinegar as it instructs and created the paste and applied to my dry clean face. after I removed it (20 or so minutes later) I had a new skin complexion! it look ALOT more even. I had no foundation on, and my skin was a little red from removing the product with a small towel, and yet my face still looked good! I stared at myself in the mirror in disbelief. Ive used other products before that I was excited about but none worked as fast or as hard as this one! and this one is so affordable!  I feel like im not just peeling my skin like certain peels out there--im actually removing all the gunk and keeping my skin nice and clean. yes it really does pulsate as its pulling gunk from your face. its awesome. Anytime I see my skin is looking &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34;--I hurry home and do a face mask with this stuff and then WA-LAH! great skin the next day! skin im proud of. skin that looks healthy and even !! seriously this stuff is a life saver! especially if youre on a budget! the Aztecs were on point with this healing clay. I feel like going back in time and kissing them. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about 2 weeks ago and have only used it twice (both with organic apple cider vinegar). I can honestly state that my skin has improved and is actually glowing. Cannot wait to use the mask again. My husband who teases me about my beauty regimen is now sniffing around my healing clay product!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I used it on myself and several other people , who all have different skin types,-oily, sensitive, aged skin, and the results were great! It left my skin feeling very smooth and cleansed! Highly recommend it to everyone no matter what skin type!</li>
            <li> I love it, it really helps my skin. My acne is healing and I feel confident about myself. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Someone here said \\&quot;I had the worst time mixing this product. It clumped uncontrollably and adding more liquid didn&#x27;t help, it just made it worse.\\&quot; I TOTALLY AGREE!!! Useless. I am an experienced clay user, so trust me, do not buy it. Try another one.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a couple times so far but it is awesome. Other clay masks i have used before were riddled with perfumes and cost so much for a tiny amount. This stuff is just perfect, 100% pure clay. A little bit goes a long way. Once you put it on and let it dry you can feel your face tighten up and you pores shrink, its awesome. I have a solid beauty regime now. Baiden mitten in the shower to exfoliate, clay mask, a nice facial oil or lotion to finish up. If youre on the fence, spend the 9$, you wont regret it.</li>
            <li> A good base for most mask recipes.</li>
            <li> I think I fell for all the reviews. I got this and was less than amazed with the results. I don&#x27;t have bad skin, normal blemish-free face. I have used this three times. Each time it left my face feeling very dry. Twice in the shower. The first time, I don&#x27;t think I left it on long enough. My face brokeout (3 zits) after using it. Is that normal?! The second time I left it on forever. My face felt soft, but it always felt that way, not any softer. The third time I could not tell I had used it. Each time I mixed it with ACV. The last time I also added olive oil. No one has mentioned the way it sticks to the sink/tub, makes a mess. Don&#x27;t need the whole scoop to use on face. Not sure if this will be a regular in my routine. Nothing to brag home about. I might try making a mudwash for my hair. Have read better benefits with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok so I do use it for my hair and will say that it is very excellent in cleaning my hear. I put a spoon full in an applicator bottle and fill the bottle up with water. I shake it up and then squeeze it throughout my hair and scalp. I let it set for an hour or so and then I rinse it out. I has my hair so clean and shiny. It is almost like a clarifying shampoo. So I do also moisturize immediately afterwards because without it can be stripping.</li>
            <li> Topical medications from the dermatologist made my skin so much worse. I gave up the harsh medications and decided to use gentle/natural face products. This cleared up what I originally went to the dermatologist with by about 75%. I mix it with organic raw apple cider vinegar and use it as a spot treatment after washing my face with CeraVe Foaming Face Wash. Now I&#x27;m just dealing with redness.</li>
            <li> Love this mask &amp; amazing amount! It&#x27;s going to last forever!</li>
            <li> I noticed the size my pore smaller the first time I used it! I also had a little pimple, it dried it out and today its gone completely.</li>
            <li> This is gross. It smells bad.. It&#x27;s in powder form and you have to mix it with water but it does not mix very well... Gross gross. Save your money and find something else.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Mix about 1 TBSP of this with 1TBSP of Braggs Apple Cider Vinegar and apply to face for 10-15 mins. Rinse with warm water and remove with washcloth. The longer you leave it on, the drier it gets and the more red your skin will be so don&#x27;t overdo it. But it works great. My skin is glowing for several days after. I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! It really made a difference to my skin. I noticed that within the first few weeks of using the clay, my skin tone started evening out and I had less breakouts. Thank you! I will be ordering this again;)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to everyone bc it has so many uses. This was well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> I have a terrible back acne problem for over 10 years, and have pretty much gave up on it because I&#x27;m tired of spending 100&#x27;s even 1000&#x27;s on stuff that doesn&#x27;t work or works for only a limited time frame.&lt;br /&gt;Idk why i haven&#x27;t tried this earlier but apparently it works for my back acne. I&#x27;m not trough my 5th lbs and 2nd bottle of vinegar, and i apply it almost every day before going to bed unless i&#x27;m too tired to go trough process.&lt;br /&gt;I mix 2 spoons of clay and add vinegar until i get a paste in a porcelain bowl (mixing it with fingers you are anyways going to apply it).&lt;br /&gt;I apply a layer on my back and even though i thought it&#x27;s not working after two weeks my acne started to clear (i apply it to my face too just for the heck of it even though i have no face acne). After applying wait 20 min and then jump into shower. this part is messy but it&#x27;s a shower. I applied it over 30 times and had no problems with the drain. don&#x27;t try to rub it of just stand under a shower and it will come of in 2-5 minutes. i like to take long showers so after 10 more min there is almost no mud left in the shower. maybe people who force large amount of it had problems with drains but if you let water do the work i&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be fine (don&#x27;t forget that i cover my whole back and i&#x27;m 6 3&#x27; and 180 pounds)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways this works and i would recommend it to everyone that has a back acne problem, just be patient and results will come</li>
            <li> Pretty basic, works well though.  You can tell how much it dries out your skin..... make sure to put lotion on afterwards.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome buy! It&#x27;s a dry powder, which was unexpected but made even better by mixing with apple cider vinegar. This will last me a year! my face feels clean after use; and during, the tingling tightness is unbelievably refreshing.</li>
            <li> Great for facial and spa baths.  love it.  Cleans out your pores real good and haves your feeling renewed and cleansed.</li>
            <li> the person i bought this for like it.</li>
            <li> Amazing, mix with Apple Cider vinegar</li>
            <li> Not so sure if I was using it wrong but my pores were the same but one thing for sure it left my skin so soft. And it&#x27;s kind of a hustle having to prepare it</li>
            <li> It is all natural product, so it does not have a negative impact on my skin. I think I will use it for years, even if I apply the product once a week. I works as any other facial mask. It may give you a short redness, but it is because it draws all the dirt from the deepest level in your skin to the top.&lt;br /&gt;I try not to dump the leftovers in the sink, so it doesn&#x27;t build up over time, but I wipe it off my face with damp piece of paper which I dump in the garbage and then I wash my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 20 and use this on my acne prone skin and it works wonders, I noticed a big difference after the first 2 weeks of using it consistently it softens the skin, gives it s wonderful glow and it feels tighter . I&#x27;ve also noticed less breakouts and when they do come this helps get rid of them quicker . This stuff is also great for hair as well.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been used because it&#x27;s a powdered substance and I don&#x27;t know how to mix it.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  I mix it with apple cider vinegar and it makes my face feel so rejuvenated, this is by far the best face mask I have ever used</li>
            <li> I bought this on the recommendation of a friend whose daughter got multiple bee stings one summer. She kept this product on hand because it was able to actually draw the stinger out of the skin. Pretty effective.</li>
            <li> This is the best mask I have ever used. Intense, and really tightens. I will always buy this for my acne prone, oily skin</li>
            <li> I really do see some difference after using this product.  It cleans my skin wonderfully and&lt;br /&gt;seems to tighten it up a lot.  At my age thought it will not do wonders but I am very pleased&lt;br /&gt;with the results after using this only 3 times.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference when I used water, probably should use apple cider next time</li>
            <li> This is an intense mask. But it&#x27;s good. I&#x27;ve never had a mask dry so hard. It&#x27;s almost tightening, in a way. Follow the instructions!</li>
            <li> works great, cleans my pores. Showed it to my teenage cousin with acne. She uses it once a week sometimes with a bit of organic apple cider vinegar and there is definitely an improvement in her complexion and acne. Wish I had this when I was a teenager! Probably would have saved me a lot of pimples and scars.</li>
            <li> This product temporarily tightened my pores and made my skin soft, but it isn&#x27;t super miraculous like I was lead to believe by all the rave reviews. I didnt notice any difference in my acne or blackheads with regular use. It made my face red for about 30 mins after I washed it off ( I let it dry completely before rinsing)&lt;br /&gt; I use it with apple cider vinegar and the jar has lasted me a very long time.</li>
            <li> Mix with organic apple vinegar cider the result is Good and Amazing:)</li>
            <li> I did not purchase on Amazon because I did not want to wait for delivery. My face has seemed uneven in tone lately, blotchy, and was breaking out. The skin was getting dry and I had picked at it and caused scabs. I do not get severe acne but from time to time my face will get pimples and clogged pours. I read all of the wonderful reviews so I figured I didn&#x27;t have much to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used organic apple cider vinegar with it and left it on my face for 20 minutes. It was a bit tricky to get off because you don&#x27;t want to clog your drains with the mask. With warm water and paper towels it did come off in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I removed the mask I took a shower to wash any left over mask off. My skin was red after removing the mask but this disappeared after several minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my shower I noticed an immediate difference in my skin. The blotchiness disappeared. My skin felt tighter and more clean and the pores appeared less visible. The scab I had on my face became so small as the mask removed all of the dead dry skin around it. I truly saw a difference after one application. I cannot wait to use this again! Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Its never work for me I was so disappointed</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the good reviews. I mixed it with the apple cider vinegar as directed. It smelled nasty and went on pretty clumpy so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. I let the stuff sit and after a while did feel it pulsating I guess...it felt like a weird pulling sensation. It got really hard and was making my face very tight, almost uncomfortably so but it didn&#x27;t hurt. I rinsed it off and my skin was slightly red but nothing major. I decided to check my blackheads and WOW! All the ones on my cheeks, chin etc. were gone. It got rid of almost all of the blackheads on my nose with the exception of one or two large big ones. A day or two after using this I did break out with a few small bumps but then they quickly went away and my skin has been the clearest it&#x27;s been in a long time. I&#x27;m currently pregnant and all the hormones have made a mess of my skin. I already suffer from occasional acne but with not being able to use my normal products and all the hormones my face has been HORRIBLE. This stuff cleared me right up. I know it&#x27;s due to this because I&#x27;ve been breaking out on my chest also and those are still there but my face doesn&#x27;t have a single zit on it currently. This was only my first use but I think I will be using this regularly. It worked way better than pore strips and definitely helped a ton with my acne. I don&#x27;t know that I would use this more than once or twice a week since it seems pretty potent but it definitely works. It may stink but it&#x27;s totally worth it for the results. If I could give this 10 stars I would. Buy it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> used it for about a month or so and made my face worse!</li>
            <li> This beats any dermatologist. Just got this in the mail a few days ago and used it for the first time last night. Yes, time consuming but so worth it! After taking off the mask it felt like I had a new face. This mask literally pulls the dirt out of your pores. Had a few black head on my nose and they were gone after using this. Face feels even and breathable afterwards. I would definitely recommend this product. All organic which makes it useful to anyone. Also people say you don&#x27;t have to use a lot, but I would because as the mask is drying it will crack and expose your skin. You want to have all skin covered throughout the whole process.</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff. Tightens your skin eight up!</li>
            <li> LOVE this mask. Completely changed how my pores looked. I have normal to oily skin, my pores before using this weren&#x27;t bad but they were there. Especially after a long day at work, I felt like my skin would look horrible and ready to be washed. After using this mask with the apple cider vinegar my pores have substantially shrunk and my makeup applications look even better than before and last a lot longer. This also helped with redness around the nose area.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin glow but also makes it feel dry for a day no matter how much moisturizer I use.</li>
            <li> Mixed with Apple cider vinegar and water, 3 equal parts, kinda cool watching the bubbling action of the mixture. Applied to face, rinsed after 10 minutes (mask fully dry) and immediately had glowing skin - and I&#x27;m 51 years old. I anticipate the jar will last me a year, that&#x27;s how little is used to make mask.</li>
            <li> Amazing mask, dries pimples and evens skin tone a little. Even manages some of my oiliness! Warning! Tried it with Apple Cider Vinegar and it was super drying! Completely recommend!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping love this stuff</li>
            <li> I was a bit miffed at the person who shipped it, since they put their product sticker right over the instructions for use. However, I figured out a system that works for me: One spoonful of Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay, one spoonful of apple cider vinegar, and just a splash of water. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m supposed to do or not but at this point I&#x27;m too lazy to figure out what I&#x27;m actually supposed to do and it works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this about twice a week and it has made my pores decrease in size and my skin looks significantly better. This stuff is fantastic and it is long lasting. I&#x27;ve had it for about a month now and I don&#x27;t even think I&#x27;ve gone through a third of the contents.</li>
            <li> I love this clay mask! I love feeling my face pulsating those impurities away.</li>
            <li> Love it so odd so different Everyone is curious! it cleans good when one needs it I will buy again AAAA++++</li>
            <li> Great product! Working great on my oily skin</li>
            <li> This is a musttt buy!!! It gives you absoulely beautiful skin!! Ive been using it for only 2 weeks and not one pimple has grown and most of my acne scars have disappeared! Its not expensive and it works amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Looks like extremely complicated to use. Just a box of powder that you have to convert it clay yourself. Not as easy as it looks</li>
            <li> love love love this stuff. its so amazing, i have made a mask with it and face powder. i love it. its so good for you.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before when I purchased from the health food store. It&#x27;s great and I can use it more than once a week and there is no irritation. It gets rid of any dead skin and impurities and tightens my skin. Love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several months and am pleased with the results. It works well. I would like to address some of the complaints and issues I had read in some of the reviews. I don&#x27;t see how this would cause my drains to clog as I do not cover my whole body in a thick layer. I mixed the clay fairly thin and apply it on and around my nose and chin and rinse it off in the shower after it dries. Since I am using such a small amount I don&#x27;t see how it will clog my drain and because I let the shower rinse it off gently I haven&#x27;t had a problem with red irritated skin from trying to scrape off a thick layer of dried clay. I would not hesitate to buy this again but it will be a really long time before I need to do that. A little goes a long way with the way I mix it so this 1 pound container will last me for quite a while.</li>
            <li> My skin always feeling dry after using it.</li>
            <li> You could feel it working!</li>
            <li> This make me break out even more</li>
            <li> I was a skeptic...however...now I am a believer.  Been using this once a week for about a month.  Had difficult white closed comedones on my forehead...and now they are almost completely gone.  Nothing else has worked other than expensive extraction sessions at the spa.  Definitely worth a try!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS!! WORKS GREAT!</li>
            <li> I mix this with water and use it almost everyday. Although it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks, I feel like my skin has gotten so much smoother. I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference with the size of my pores, but I&#x27;ll update my review after a longer time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get the perfect consistency, I mix this in a 2-oz Tupperware container with water: the first day, it&#x27;ll probably be a bit chunky and hard to spread; however, by day two or three, it&#x27;s the perfect thick cream consistency.</li>
            <li> Works great as a facial cleanser and for my hair.</li>
            <li> This was such a great product! I can feel it working its secret Magic on my skin.</li>
            <li> The other reviewers may have different skin than mine...for my mostly clear skin with some deep clogging on areas like nose and chin, it didn&#x27;t do anything whatsoever.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing....i just wish it was not so messy.  But it does work on the skin...tightening it a lot.</li>
            <li> i bought this because i was looking for a good mask to unclog my pores. the first time i used it i was in love! my skin immediately felt softer and after a couple of days my mild acne was gone and my pores looked tiny. i have never tried using this with vinegar though. i usually mix it with water but i tried mixing it with the proactiv toner and it seemed to work even better with that! overall, everyone has different skin but if you get blackheads and mild acne every now and then i would definitely recommend this product. i also believe it would be fine for sensitive skin if you only mix it with water and dont leave it on for too long.</li>
            <li> This is a great facial product. I&#x27;m a male and I get muddy and dirty from the work I do and it clogs my pores. I&#x27;ve noticed my pore size get smaller and how much  healthier my face looks.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff - Its very cooling as it dries, and tightens up as it dries almost at an alarming rate!  But I love it. Skin feels truly clean and soft after.  I make mine a little on the thin side, but still thick enough &amp;#34;so it doesn&#x27;t fall off your face&amp;#34; as one reviewer says... I mix mine by squishing it all around inside a ziplock baggie and then snipping off the corner of the baggie and squeezing it out... less mess to clean up in the end.  I also read several comments about bath and sink drains being clogged - when I&#x27;m ready to rinse, I first use a few of those pre-moistened facial cleaning cloths to get the bulk of it off my face, and that solves that problem - it doesn&#x27;t worry me to waste a few cloths this way.  Anyway, I will totally get some more - have shared it with my grown kids too but a little goes a long way and it lasts a long time using it about once a week...</li>
            <li> I received my product a few weeks ago and have been using it almost daily since.  It is a bit clumpy when mixed with water but I find that if I use a plastic fork to mix and a plastic spoon to spread it works fine. I have recently started to mix my clay with hot distilled water and apply the mask while it is still warm which helps with the mixing and also opens up the pores on my face. This product does not seem pulsate or pull as strongly as the mask I made from the NOW brand bentonite (sodium type), nor did it draw as much blood to the surface of my skin, which is what causes the redness and/or burning sensation, but it does seem to help heal better. This surprised me as I was sure that it was the extra oxygented blood being pulled to the surface that aided in the healing process. I will try mixing the two types of clay together for my facial masks as they seem to have different properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed any change to the size of the pores on my face nor has daily use of this clay made my skin more or less oily or dry. I have noticed some reduction in the depth and redness of my hormonal cyctic acne scars and I did not break out as I usually would this month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use calcium bentonite for facials as I believe it is helping me with my acne.  I am hopeful that continued use will reveal other positive changes to my skin.</li>
            <li> While I like the idea that Aztec clay is natural and does not contain harmful chemicals, it was a lot of effort to: 1. Make it – clumps up, you have to stir it forever to make it right consistency. 2. Get it off. No wonder so many people reported that their skin really dried out with this. You have to wash and scrub your face and body for ages then STILL you might walk around with some green patches that you missed. It is really clingy. There will also come a time when you will have to decide if you prefer to have a clean face and blocked drain or the other way around. I mean, you have to pile on a lot of this stuff to get the desired result. How long can you keep it up? Nope, not for me. I am going back to my trusted Baiden Mitten which does everything that this clay promises to do but without any drawbacks. This experiment just reinforced for me that I am already using the very best skin care product there is.</li>
            <li> I rated this product a 5 star because it makes the skin brighter and soft. I purchased this clay because people had stated that it helps with oily skin, I have seen any changes with the oiliness of my skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin red at first but oh so baby soft. My Acne is gone... Honestly the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the Apple Cider Vinegar smell... Other than that its awesome... I mixed lemon with mine sometimes and it works well like that too.</li>
            <li> Do you want even, poreless skin? Is your skin dry with an intense T Zone or just plain oily? this stuff is magic. Mix with apple cider vinegar for an intense clean, or just water for something lighter....I use it at least 3 times a week. Obsessed! And it&#x27;s tres cheap.</li>
            <li> I mix this with honey and apple cider vinegar. I leave the mask on for 15 minutes and it leaves my skin so soft. Love this. Once a week is a must.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, you can really feel it pulsating! Taking the product off is best done slowly and with warm water as when it dries it hrts if you tru scrubbing or peeling it off. Your face will get red after use, it wil only last about 30 minutes, but your face will be left clean, so soft and it even removes blackheads! The product arrived fast and the price was pretty decent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this only once so far - on my face. A little goes a long way. I will reduce amounts in the instructions next time since I had so much left over. You need to use up the amount that you mix each time.</li>
            <li> I really feel it pulling all the gunk out of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;At first it was a little too painful but its soo worth it after you rinse it off :D</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I use it on breakouts and on sore muscles. The pulse is so strange, but it really works!</li>
            <li> The description says it would make my skin feel pulsating. I didnt feel anything. This is an okay one not the great one.</li>
            <li> You should use the apple cider as recommended instead of water since it would make the paste to put on your face much smoother and clump free. I usually have this small silicone bowl and a brush to mix them and the little measuring spoons of course. Wash after 15 minutes or it will be really hard to wash off as it hardens and might need to scrape off with your nails. I use the clarisonic brush and warm water since it works well. You get a tingly sensation and then your face hardens so make sure you are not skyping or anything.</li>
            <li> does a really good deep cleanse. I use this weekly and love it.</li>
            <li> I love this Aztec clay removes all impurities from my skin feel movements in my face when I lay it relaxes me</li>
            <li> This clay mask is amazing! You can honestly feel your face pulsing as it hardens. I&#x27;ve used it only mixed with water alone &amp; with acv. Either works perfectly. I have very sensitive acne prone skin with scarring and have seen improvement since using this product. Clears skin without irritation.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work amazingly, but cleans your face pretty good</li>
            <li> This tub will last me forever! I use about half a tablespoon or even a little less for my whole face. Works really great with vinegar, not so much water. I found that it doesn&#x27;t mix well with water to a smooth consistency. Caution, it is an intense mask and will leave your face red after using especially if you leave it on for more than 10-15 min. One of my top 3 clay masks!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing I had so many black heads on my nose and look ! You can literarily see it working now I only have very few ! Works great</li>
            <li> You have to try this mask.. It is simply the best... you can feel a difference from the first use.</li>
            <li> An inexpensive clay mask that seems to work well.  Unfortunately, my skin always peels after...</li>
            <li> In 20 years I have never found a product like this. I took a chance and I am happy I did. This product unclogged pores that a professional facial could not. The great thing is that after using the mask it unclogs pores without the pain and swelling that happens from unclogging pores with a professional facial. I will buy this product as long as they continue to sell it. High end products that I&#x27;ve used couldn&#x27;t touch this mask.</li>
            <li> The mask is great, but the logistics of mixing and clean up is kind of a pain in the arse.&lt;br /&gt;Meh.</li>
            <li> I used too much the first time. You don&#x27;t need much. I used a foundation brush initially but I just ended with using my fingers. Great product. A must!!!! Soo tight lol</li>
            <li> I bought this item after seeing so many good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this mask takes a big amount of time to prepare and apply.&lt;br /&gt;The mask feels thick and it doesn&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t dissolve completely with the water. (There&#x27;s always some bumps)&lt;br /&gt;While on the mask it didn&#x27;t make me feel good because I felt like I was putting something cheap and of low quality on my face. I didn&#x27;t feel happy afterwards either, because it was difficult to rinse it off.&lt;br /&gt;It made my face clearer, but I guess it was a temporal bleach effect (which doesn&#x27;t feel good at all for your skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the mask works average, but it is difficult to apply and also to rinse it off. It doesn&#x27;t feel like a mask of good quality</li>
            <li> my wife ordered this and loved it... she was using it a lot because she said her face just wouldnt stop breaking out. she said it was so amazing and it really worked. she said this despite her face breaking out the entire time she was using it. one night after i get home from work she tells me i have to try it with her because the stuff really works... i have naturally good skin and rarely ever break out and if i do its just a couple at most little zits. so i try it and the next day my face is a wreck, like a real break out. it was a disaster... this stuff was breaking out my face, because i tried it again after my face cleared up and it broke out again. it was also breaking out my wifes face but shes such a fan girl of the &amp;#34;healthy alternative&amp;#34; trendy stuff that she swear the gimmicky stuff is doing somethng. made the wife happy but upset at the same time... she was upset that her face was broken out but happy that she had just the product to fix it... although the product causing it was also the same product she thought was fixing it.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve used it as soak in the tub and wow it made me sweat like crazy, good detox especially when sick.</li>
            <li> For me it did not work at all. It was horrible...just dried up my skin. This might work for people with little tiny blackheads that are very mild but I have really bad blackheads so this didn&#x27;t do anything for my pimples (witch are relatively mild), my blackheads, my skin tone or texture, it did nothing except dried out my skin. You can try it, I wanted to because of all the good reviews but trust me here you&#x27;re probably going to be disappointed. I am sticking with clearasil deep pore cleansing mask. It works pretty good I just always look for anything better that&#x27;s why I tried this stuff but there is my recommendation if you have clogged pores. Exfoliate your face (st.ives apricot scrub) then clearasil facial mask in a tube, then use aloe vera after sun lotion. That is the best combination I&#x27;ve found and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of stuff.</li>
            <li> As stated above, I have very shiny, oily skin. I have tried other masks, but they don&#x27;t seem strong enough, and still left me feeling kind of oily. My skin is much more matte now and feels super soft. Mixed with the apple cider vinegar, it worked very well for me. I just bought it a couple days ago, but my first results have been better than other masks I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> i feel so refreshed after using this product, leaves the skin so soft and smooth, and kind of red for a little bit, but not too bad with my skin.</li>
            <li> I use to use clay mask years ago and then fell off and started using mud mask, plus I can buy those in the store. Once I saw this listed on Amazon and the great reviews I decided to give it a shot. I love it once again. I rinse and apply Vaseline to my skin because it will dry you out. I didn&#x27;t think I had bog pores but when I tried a little bit on my skin and rinsed I could see the difference and it was magical.</li>
            <li> Have to admit I was very intrigued by this product. Love the cheap price point and the old school packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you&#x27;re basically getting is a large jar of powdered mud. It&#x27;s a good substantial size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You mix it with water in a bowl and apply it to your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sounds so simple but I had problems with the mixing. No matter how much I stirred and adjusted the water/mud ratio I still couldn&#x27;t get the lumps out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I put it on I looked like I had leprosy. Mud masks are never pretty but this was seriously frightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask itself didn&#x27;t irritate my skin (note: my skin is not sensitive) and left it feeling soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel like I looked any younger but I don&#x27;t feel like it was a complete waste of time, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this for people with normal skin who are looking for a limited ingredient facial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re OK with a few more ingredients in your products I&#x27;d definitely go with something by Queen Helene. It&#x27;s less messy and smells better (this didn&#x27;t have much of a scent).</li>
            <li> Eight-star product over the excellent product</li>
            <li> Love this mask. It makes my face feel refreshed. I mix with a little apple cider vinegar and apply all over my face. You can feel it pulsating on your skin. My face feels smooth after I use this. I can tell this jar will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Best mask ever invented. And I&#x27;m a beauty junkie. Every mask that sephora offers to deep clean the pores, has clay in it. Along a million other yukky ingridients. So I say why not go straight to source and just use the real stuff. Plus you cannot beat the price</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of all the fantastic reviews, but unfortunately I didn&#x27;t have such great results. It made my break out all over my forehead and my skin was red and irritated for a few days. I recommend testing this on a patch of skin before using it as a mask.</li>
            <li> I have oily and sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve struggled with acne for the past few years. I&#x27;m very cautious about what to put on my face since many products have only irritated it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, plus this thing lasts forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix it with either water or apple vinegar and mix/mash it in a ziploc bag for easy disposal and storage for any left over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love how this feels. I can feel my face pulsating from the clay shrinking and squeezing my pores. I can so notice a significant difference with consistent use: less breakouts, and any breakouts that do occur are much smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying and removing can be a bit of a hassle though. I splash water on my face to soften the clay again before removing with baby wipes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a couple times, but I don&#x27;t see that much difference honestly.</li>
            <li> This is very effective on my skin.  I use it with the Bragg Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! The only mask I&#x27;ll ever use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once but so far so good. The product is exactly what it said it would be.  Felt great on my face, plus it says you can use it for other parts of your body so I&#x27;ll have to try that out.  After reading all the other reviews I feel confidant they are all true and I am not disappointed. Will definitely buy the product again in the future.</li>
            <li> Best thing for all the things going on with my skin. Helps with bug bites/flea bites too!</li>
            <li> I love this. I mix it with Apple Cider Vinegar and make a mask that works wonderfully. But be careful because with the acid in the vinegar&lt;br /&gt;it can burn your face if you leave it on too long. It does draw out impurities and makes your pores smaller.</li>
            <li> I bought this clay in January and have been using it since then. I do not use it in a regular regimen, but on average about once a week because I also do derma rolling and exfoliation and so I don&#x27;t want to overwhelm my face. The first listed review that has that wonderful tip about mixing and applying this mask is definitely the best way to do it because this stuff can be a mess and it can be hard to get a good consistent texture just mixing with a spoon or something…I always get clumps. This feels good going on and feels good when it dries and makes my face tight. I have not had any adverse reaction to it at all and my face feels super clean and refreshed when done. I follow this mask up with coconut oil all over and it is a great way to easily pamper myself.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this face mask, my husband and I both use it and like that it doesn&#x27;t have any additives or extra chemicals in it, it is just clay. Leave it on long enough to feel your skin really tighten, pores look smaller after washing off.</li>
            <li> This stuff seriously works wonders on the face!</li>
            <li> If I could give this product 10!!! Stars I would!!! This is mother natures best kept beauty secret. Great product for facial or any body part detox. I even add it to my bath water. I will be buying this in bulk from now on. I hope they don&#x27;t run out of this volcano ash in Wyoming!!!</li>
            <li> Cured my acne from hormonal imbalance. My skin is like new again. I use only twice a week. It also has healed old acne scars and makes my skin less oily.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this facial mask after reading all the reviews praising this product. I have a lot of blackheads even though I am 27 years old and my pores around my nose and adjacent area are too noticeable for my liking. If I pick at them, I of course get pimples and it makes me feel like I am forever 15 years old. I used this product 5 times (twice a week since I got it) and it is working wonders!!! It is no miracle worker  - it won&#x27;t just clear up your skin after one use - but after using it a handful of times I can see the difference it is making in the amount of noticeable blackheads in my face. Even my husband had pointed out how much cleaner my face is getting. The instructions say to use once a week but I am using it twice a week and I don&#x27;t feel like it is too much at all. The instructions also say to keep the mask on for 15-20 minutes but I keep it on for 45 minutes to an hour because otherwise I don&#x27;t get that pulsating feeling. Also, If you put it on as thick as it suggests, it takes that much time to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can feel the effects of the mask even when I am not using it. My pores are slowly releasing blackheads constantly which is great, but it does make my skin a bit greasier than it used to be now that all the grossness is coming out of my pores. What I do is use Olay Pore Minimizing Cleansing and Scrub twice a day (it keeps my combination skin moisturized and helps clean my pores between mask treatments). I also recommend using a moisturizer after taking off the mask (I use Garnier gellbased). I didn&#x27;t think I was going to need since my skin is not dry but the mask does dry out your skin a lot after use. This is so cheap, I can&#x27;t believe it works this well. If it keep going like this, I will continue to buy more!</li>
            <li> First time I used this boy was I surprised. This stuff sucks any and all moisture out of your face when it is drying. Does a good job cleaning up your face. Crazy sensation while it is drying. Your face will be a little red afterwards, just put a good moisturizer on and relax. I would do this before bed.</li>
            <li> Tastes awful and my skin looks the same ! Shipping was fast though</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay Deep Pore Cleansing Mask.  I would like to start off by saying I have dry skin and it has started becoming &#x27;flaky&#x27; in some spots along my forehead.  I have been diagnosed with a minor case of &amp;#34;Psoriasis&amp;#34; which has been flaking off and dry in some spots.  This mask has changed my life significantly.  I take a small mixing bowl and measure out a few spoons of the mask and a small teaspoon of Bragg&#x27;s Apple Cider Vinegar &amp; a tad bit of water, I mix it all up until I get a thicker consistensy ( I prefer a thicker mask then a thin layer ).  I make sure my skin is completely clean and I have no make up, I use the Cetafil regular face wash and pat my skin dry.  I apply this mask and let it sit for about 35-40 minutes (this is longer then normal, but the longer I want, the softer my skin is afterwards).  You can literally feel your face pulsating and getting tight.  It&#x27;s incredible stuff &amp; I will use this stuff for a very long time.  &#x3D;)  I highly recommend this a couple times a week to deep cleansing.</li>
            <li> Not only is the clay powder so fine it makes a mess of absolutely everything (both in preparation and removal), the resulting mask feels like you&#x27;re setting your face on fire.</li>
            <li> One day, I noticed that I started getting very little pimple or some sort on my forehead. It happened right after I changed my shampoo. I went to see my PC since seeing a dermatologist would mean waiting for 4 months. I was prescribed some topical cream but that didn&#x27;t solve the problem on my forehead. It actually caused another problem on my chin. I was getting painful cystic acne especially on the left side. I was getting a lot of them like 6-7 very close to each other. I&#x27;ve had acne my whole life pretty much and they never really bother me since they just came and went but these painful ones were totally different. I finally went to see a dermatologist and was prescribed doxi(?? antibiotic) and like a miracle, they went away but only to come back worse when I get off of that antibiotic. I didn&#x27;t want to take the same medicine again since it only made the problem worse. Sure it would make it go away as long as I&#x27;m on it but who would want to be on antibiotic forever? Anyway, after reading the reviews, I decided to try this. Well, this is not panacea for acne. That&#x27;s for sure. However, I think it does make it a bit better. I still have those painful cystic acne on my chin but they do seem to get a bit smaller in size if I keep using this thing. I also still have the little pimple thingy on my forehead but a bit better than before. I used this product maybe everyday for the first week and then every two or three days ever since then(it&#x27;s been almost 2 months so far and I try to use it every 2 days unless my laziness holds me back). I do notice the difference when I use it every 2 days or every 3 days(or even when I skip a few days). My chin breakout gets worse when I don&#x27;t use it as often as I should. Since I don&#x27;t want to go on antibiotic again, this is pretty much my only way out to keep my painful acne under control and I do like it since it does seem to smooth out the non acne areas on my face. I will try to remember to leave the update after using it for more months in case someone is reading my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE-Sep 17th, 2014&lt;br /&gt;Okay, I finally used the whole 1lb jar.(I guess it took about 2 and a half months to use up that one pound jar for me).There were a couple of lazy weeks that I really didn&#x27;t use this regularly but after getting more of the painful acne, I really tried hard to do it every 2 days. After about 3 weeks of doing that, I finally got rid of those painful ones about 90%. I do get small ones every now and then but they go away so quickly(like within a couple of days). I think I will try to use it every 3 days now instead of every 2 days and see if that still keeps the acne under control. I leave it on for 25-30 minutes. One time I think I left it on for like 40-50 minutes and I thought that actually dried out my skin a bit and it felt quite harsh on my skin. For me, I think 25-30 is the best.&lt;br /&gt;I was very skeptical when I first heard about it and read so many positive reviews here.  I only tried it thinking that I had nothing to lose even if it doesn&#x27;t work. Now I know for sure it does work and it&#x27;s darn cheap. Heck ya, it&#x27;s much cheaper than going to see a doc and take medicine. I just ordered 2lb jar. I will update again after using that up. I wonder how long it would take this time.onths in case someone is reading my review.

            <li> Very good mud pack for oily skin. I use it almost daily and helps reduce oiliness and prevents breakouts. Mixed it with apple cider vinegar and water and this is a perfect pack for oily skin.the only hassle is you have to mix it every week and this does not come premixed like those glam glow mask.</li>
            <li> Worked amazing on my pored, started seeing a difference after the first mask! The only bad side is that you have to add apple cider vinegar and water to it. It comes as a powder in the container. Doesn&#x27;t smell amazing when made, but it works, and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This is the cat&#x27;s meow. It is a good product. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product!  Its a bit messy but worth it. My skin is softer and cleaner I love how it tingles and tighten up as it drys!</li>
            <li> Make sure you mix with apple cider vinegar, not water.  Does a great job pulling impurities from the skin.  Leaves my skin soft.  Love the way the mask works!</li>
            <li> Does what they say it will do</li>
            <li> This is a heck of a facial when mixed with organic apple cider vinegar! Pore cleansing, tightening, and softening. I was happy and disappointed at the same time when I found this product offered at my local health food store for $6.99, but that may not be the case for everyone. I would highly recommend this product for a facial as well as use in a detox bath (1 cup clay, 2 cups cider vinegar, and 2 cups epsom salts or epsom and Himalyan salt, mixed).</li>
            <li> Really tightens...use exactly as directed.  I left it on for a longer period as directed and my face turned beet red:-0(&lt;br /&gt;Thank goodness it calmed down as I was going out that evening.  Great product otherwise.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. My skin has never been so great!</li>
            <li> My face feels so smooth after I rinse it off. It goes great with the exfoliator I currently use. You really do feel your face pulsating.. which is both good and bad. Only bad because it hurts a little, like it&#x27;s pulling your face.</li>
            <li> I just got this yesterday and used one time and seen a difference. Can&#x27;t wait for another month to pass by to see my results. I&#x27;m almost 30 and still have moderate acne. I have tried plenty of products only to be let down. This stuff is promising. Also the way it feels when it starts to dry is pretty awesome. Felt like my face was doing the wave. Only part I dislike is not being able to just rinse my face off in the sink. But oh well. I like it and happy that I finally found something that works and is not expensive.</li>
            <li> Love this face mask.  I use it weekly with Braggs Apple Cider Vinegar and my skin seems to look and feel more healthy and clear.</li>
            <li> One of the best products I&#x27;ve ever bought. Above and beyond for the price. I&#x27;ll continue to buy this forever. I&#x27;ve even shared some with my mom and sisters! I break out bad a lot and using this once a week has had amazing results. It&#x27;s like magic, it seems to suck the nasty bacteria right out of these huge, cystic zits I WAS getting. It also has a very noticeable tightening effect on the skin. I&#x27;m left with glowing, taut and clear beautiful skin. I&#x27;ve paid hundreds more on products that don&#x27;t work as well!</li>
            <li> It does help to cleanse face. Cant say how much it helped with acne or scars after 3 weeks but it definitely squeezes oil and dead cells/dirt out of sebaceous gland. Very slight redness. I have to keep 1hr for thick coating and 40 mins for single layer. Apple cider vinegar stings and burns because of its acidic nature ... Be care using that acv it causes burns if u dont dilute I mean BURN. I put 1ts in 2-3ts water. Acv makes u sensitive to uv.</li>
            <li> I love how clean my face feels afterwards! It is hard/messy to get off though- suggest hopping in the shower and using a washrag</li>
            <li> I am olive complected with very oily, acne prone skin. I have a problem with both blackheads and whiteheads. I usually buy those little packs of masks hanging on the end of the makeup isle in Walmart. I haven&#x27;t felt that they really do what they are supposed to, and now I can say they definitely don&#x27;t! This mask is very powerful and literally sucked my blackheads out, as well as some pimples! I have never had a cheap mask to do that, it&#x27;s amazing. I found the mixing portions to be a little off and ended up adding more water than suggested. It still came out clumpy, but I just picked them off once it was smoothed on. My face is sooo smooth now and I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for every beauty cabinet. Great to add to a deep conditioner or use alone as a cleansing agent. This clay makes your curls pop like nothing else, just add a tsp or so to your favorite conditioner and deep condition as usual. Oil can be added to the mix too. This is also the best mask you could EVER buy. It can be mixed with water or Apple Cider Vinegar. I prefer vinegar because I feel it works better this way. I use it a day or two before any big event. I don&#x27;t wear makeup so having my pores look good is a necessity. You will be flawless with this. Do not leave it on longer than you should, that can lead to redness and pain. I have given this away to so many people and constantly have people borrowing it.</li>
            <li> This mask works better than other much more expensive ones and you get a huge amount that will take years to go through.</li>
            <li> Great product! Great recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was quick and efficient.&lt;br /&gt;Works great on facial scarring and clearing the pores, I will definitely be buying more soon.</li>
            <li> The only thing that makes my acne disappear after using it! I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> For the price, this stuff is amazing! It makes your skin so sift and you can really feel it working while it dries. Highly recommended and I will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> Used this about 2-3 times a week and it has really help clear up my skin! I was surprised when it arrived as powder but am very satisfied with this product. I found that mixing it with apple cider vinegar is easier to apply to skin as opposed to mixing it with water and I can use less of the clay!</li>
            <li> I bought this as an alternative to icky baby powders that use artificial ingredients and I am so pleased! It works so much better than regular powder and heals irritations incredibly fast! Just make sure that you do not allow this powder to come into contact with any metal as it will decrease its natural healing properties. I use it in a BPA-free plastic dredge that I found on amazon for less than four dollars. Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. You can use it as a mask for your hair and face and it leaves both feeling and looking clean. Just be sure to follow up with an oil to help replace the oils that are lost after using this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this clay on severe burns that would have caused lots of pain and blisters. I packed the burn with clay, wrapped it up and after 8 hours, I took off the bandages and there was no pain, no blisters, no redness and no scars. Incredible. Yesterday I was stung by a scorpion. I put clay on the sting, covered it and left it on for a day. This morning, I took off the bandage and I have no pain and no redness. Most people who get stung here in Panama suffer for days. I had none of that. This is the best first aid remedy. Every household should have some at the ready. Works on stings, bug bites, burns, and yes, it&#x27;s also great for facials.</li>
            <li> This is a must have product to have in your beauty cabinet. It&#x27;s greatly improved my uneven skin tone and makes my skin look brighter and tighter after use. I am going to try it on my stomach to see if it improves the wrinkly skin that I got after having kids ;-) But yeah, this definitely works wonders and has since ancient times....think Cleopatra</li>
            <li> Cystic acne - the bane of my dermatological life, and maybe yours too?  The clay has helped immensely in keeping it at bay - a treatment once a week, since it is a bit time consuming to mix it up, let it dry, and then remove it, but I haven&#x27;t had any of those awful underground takes-two-weeks-to-surface pimples since I&#x27;ve started using the clay. Combined with the apple cider vinegar, it&#x27;s immensely helpful for oily, cystic acne prone skin, and my skin&#x27;s so much happier since I&#x27;ve started using it. You need this. Right now. :)</li>
            <li> My mom used a similar clay when I was a kid. She kept talking about its properties, benefits, etc... I never really paid attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward a few years, I started hearing rave reviews on this product. I decided to give it a shot. I first mixed it with green tea, and it was okay. Then my mom came to visit; we heard about the Apple Cider Vinegar version, and gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask dried and pulled our skin so taut that we were literally unable to speak to each other within 10 min. It cleansed our pores wonderfully, removed blackheads, and I could not stop touching my skin, it was so soft! My mom actually ended up purchasing her own tub to take home after her visit. It was that amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is now an inherent part of my beauty regimen. Love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this &amp;#34;red clay&amp;#34; for using as tanning agent on legs.  A friend recommended a red clay to mix with lotion like a leg tanner. However, though this jar says it is red....it isn&#x27;t!  Second time ordering from Amazon for &amp;#34;red&amp;#34;clay.  Second negative experience.</li>
            <li> I read many of the reviews so I decided to mix my clay with raw Apple cider vinegar, first I placed three tablespoons (you only really need about 1.5 or 2 tbs max) of the powdered Aztec clay in a zip loc bag and then added equal parts Apple cider vinegar. I mixed it all up and then cut a hole at the bottom of the zip loc. I added the mixture to my face until it was about 1/2 inch thick on my face. I waited 15 min max, after results? My skin was beautiful, not dry or oily. I have combination skin, I am acne prone and my skin is also pretty sensitive.  I did not have any small red bumps or a rash or any other side effects as some have stated in their review. I love the product and I will most likely buy more as soon as I am done with this batch! Thanks a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ATTENTION: when trying to wash this mask off do not attempt to wash it off like any regular mask. Listen to the other reviews which say the same thing!! What I did was I first closed the sink drain, put my large zip loc bag over my sink drain and then using wet wipes I added small amounts of water to it and then scrapped off the clay onto the sink. DO NOT LET THIS GO IN UR DRAIN! this stuff is hard, thick and dry! It will clog ur drain without a doubt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after I washed my face I realized it was not red, no red bumps like some had experienced, for me personally it made my skin super soft. I have crator pores thanks to my genetics and I only purchased this mask because it said it would help prevent acne /remove acne as well as reduce the size of pores / clean them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note: after I washed the mask off I noticed some of the pores had stuff sticking out so I scrapped it off with my nail and realized the stuff that was in my pores was already coming out! That was truly and added bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt really clean afterward and I plan to use and purchase this mask for as long as I am alive! Nothing better for the skin then ingredients from nature!</li>
            <li> I CHOOSE THIS RATING CAUSE THE PRODUCT WORKS JUST LIKE IT SAID IT WOULD TRIED IT AND LOVE THE RESULTS</li>
            <li> This clay is wonderful i mixed it with 1 part of raw cider vinegar and 2 parts of water (cider vinegar irritates my face to much) and it has work wonders my pores are smaller, i have less oily TZone and i have not had a big ugly zit since ive been using it! Will recommend.</li>
            <li> I like using this product but currently have no need for it.  It&#x27;s great for facials if you do them.</li>
            <li> Best facial ever. Especially with the apple cider vinegar.. You can actually feel your skin pulse! I love this stuff and I swear by it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I&#x27;ve used it as a mask, but I don&#x27;t really need to use masks. I like to sprinkle a little in my hair when it&#x27;s just a little dirty but not dirty enough to wash again. Sucks the oil right up.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and acne. I use this about once a week and after using it my skin feels and looks so much better. My pores are smaller, acne size is reduced and amount of new acne forming is reduced after using it. I have used this for over 2 months and I have not used even used half of the container.</li>
            <li> I struggle with acne and very oily skin. I&#x27;ve used ProActive, Clearisil, Oxy, Doxycycline, Atralin, Acanya, you name it. The Doxycycline works great, but it does not cure my acne, my body was very reliant on it. First application of this clay was horrendous. I wasn&#x27;t sure what happened, I mixed it with water and wiped it on and there was a horrible burning sensation. I didn&#x27;t know if it was normal or not. I ended up with a red face that looked like a sunburn! I did however give it a second chance and tried it a second time (and a third, and a fourth....) I used apple cider vinegar and I got much better results with less sit time. Leaving it on for as long as possible does not work with this product! It will hurt! I suggest 15 minutes max with apple cider vinegar. My face was soft, smooth, and feels very clean, and it helps my acne and oily skin stay under control. I gave this product 4 stars because it works great, but it is not a miracle product for me. We will see with future applications whether it is truly helping or not. I do however suggest this product because it is pretty damn good for the price, and who doesn&#x27;t love a good tight face mask</li>
            <li> I have it on right now (for the first time) and it does pulsate and burn! not unbearably but I can feel it working. I don&#x27;t know if it will clear up some pimples I have for now but I will update when I use it more than once. I didn&#x27;t use vinegar… I used hot water so it can open up my pores.</li>
            <li> Works for my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so shocked at how great this product is in just the short time that I had it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a bunch of reviews before finally deciding to go for it, but have some things to add.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it takes some time to get used to the consistency of the clay and how to put it on your face because no matter what, it&#x27;s clumpy. I have experienced with how much to use and I find that 1tsp clay with 1tsp and a couple extra drops water works well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think take a small finger full and put it on my face and then move it around in a circular motion as this helps to break up the clumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I leave it on until it fully dries which is normally 45+ minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The I rinse it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews I read said don&#x27;t get this in the sink- I was very scared at first but I assure you I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of it in the sink and nothing has happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now in terms of feelings, it seriously pulls your face. I find that it hurts a bit. I also read a review that suggested using a washcloth to get the clay off. I tried that tonight and not only did it hurt but it took much longer for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t forget to moisturize.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this stuff and wish i wouldve found it sooner, i personally use it once a week. but there will be a purge of breakouts, but def differs from person to person. some people may not even brake out at all, some a little and some a lot. because it does detoxify the skin and literally draw the gunk out of your skin. but my personal purge was about a week and a half. but now my skin has never looked this good and will not go without again. def use vinegar with this one, not water. with the vinegar it is much smoother on the face. it does get extremely tight on the skin and leaves me a little red for about 20 min after but i dont feel like its irritated. and i have used a lot of masks and this one is amazing and not one has ever come close to leaving my face as soft as this one has!</li>
            <li> Wow. Talk about a tight fit! This stuff molds onto your face and makes it to where you can&#x27;t move your mouth. With that being said, it cleans out pores beautifully and does not over dry my skin. I wash with a gentle face wash before applying this. I mix mine with organic apple vinegar in a small bowl. The vinegar helps to clear up any bumps/acne since it offers a deeper clean. I also add little water to help dilute. I smear it down just below my jaw line so it can get the top of my neck where I get little bumps sometimes. I keep it away from my hair line, under my eyes, and eye brows. When I&#x27;ve finished applying I IMMEDIATLY scoop out what&#x27;s left and put it in the trash (so the clumps don&#x27;t clog my drain) and wash my little bowl and whatever I used to mix with down the sink making sure to use soap and plenty of hot water. I even let the water run a few extra seconds to make sure its plenty rinsed. I could see this stuff clogging drains like cement! I leave the mask on for about 15-20 minutes, or until it completely dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a great purchase and totally worth the money. The smell is not \\&quot;spa\\&quot; like as it&#x27;s more of a dirt smell, but not over the top or anything. This has lasted me over a year so far and I still have plenty. I use it about twice a month. I would recommend this for sensitive, combination, oily and acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I debated for a few weeks regarding whether or not to buy this item. I wanted to try it based on all of the positive reviews, but I was really skeptical as to whether or not the reviews were legit. Far be it from me to not try the latest and greatest skin-oriented snake oil, I bought it and anxiously waited for my mud miracle to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Low and behold IT WORKS. I&#x27;m happy with this product for a lot of reasons, one of which is due to the relief I felt when I realized I didn&#x27;t wind up being a total sucker. Whew. Anyhow, here are my ins and outs thus far:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I haven&#x27;t tried it with vinegar, only water, and my pores were noticably smaller (like almost gone!) after the first use. This isn&#x27;t a permanent fix, but my skin looks incredible after the redness goes away... which brings me to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This stuff makes me red. I have a full face sunburn afterwards for at least an hour or two. I only use it at night before I go to bed because of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I mix exactly 50/50 powder to water ratio using only plastic bowl and utensil. Any time I&#x27;ve added too little water and tried to add more, it clumps very badly and its totally ridiculous, impossible to deal with and it will make you want to throw the whole unused jar away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I don&#x27;t use very much. The 1/4 to 1/2 inch mud layer instructions seem like overkill - my results have been the same and I&#x27;ve tried a super thick layer (I was bored) and a super thin application. A teaspoon of powder (not packed in) and a teaspoon of water was the perfect amount for a nice super thin layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It left my face squeaky clean, literally, and I&#x27;ve never had skin this clean or soft... ever. Rinse mud off with a lot of warm water (pat the dried mud with wet hands first to get the ball rolling), then use more water to massage it around and eventually rinse off fully. When all traces of mud are removed, do a final splash with cold water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- MOISTURIZE afterwards. No exceptions. My skin was totally dried out within 5 minutes of my first use, so I started moisturizing within a minute or two of rising it off and patting dry. My skin soaks up the moisturizer like a champ and looks brand new post-treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- If you have any blemishes or blackheads, they will come to the surface when using this mask. It&#x27;s amazing (and yucky at the same time), but its the best way to get your pores flushed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I had a small breakout after first use. I expected this because it is detoxifying. I used it two days in a row and every single blemish I had disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It really does make your face pulsate. It&#x27;s bizarre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s an amazing exfoliator and I&#x27;m not sure why since it isn&#x27;t really gritty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This is not a &#x27;relaxing&#x27; treatment. If you invite your girlfriends over for a fun spa night to use this mud, they will kill you. It gets extremely tight and can get somewhat hot.

My skin soaks up the moisturizer like a champ and looks brand new post-treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- If you have any blemishes or blackheads, they will come to the surface when using this mask. It&#x27;s amazing (and yucky at the same time), but its the best way to get your pores flushed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I had a small breakout after first use.

            <li> I have been using this product on and off (mostly off) for the last 12 years. I found this mask in an organic, all-natural grocery co-op and thought it was my magic. I had horrible acne in my teens, and this did help with some of the inflammation. While I don&#x27;t use it as often anymore, I still have a huge can of it under my sink. It&#x27;s a fairly inexpensive, and somewhat &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; way to deal with problem skin. I think there are several comparable clay masks on the market today, so it&#x27;s nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it is a pain to mix and apply. Perhaps I never had the right technique, or my instinctual nature to squirt something out of a tube is prohibiting me from fully experiencing this product. Who knows... My mask is always somewhat chunky and clogs the drain.</li>
            <li> I mixed way too much to do my face the first time. I also found that it is really hard to mix something without metal being involved. I see that it says to put it on 1/4 inch thick. That&#x27;s crazy and would never dry. smearing it on for coverage is enough and it took the full 25 mins to dry with a fan. You can use your fingers to do this.  I didn&#x27;t use vinegar, I just used water, but I will try vinegar and see if it is better. It does pulse a bit and that is cool, but not until the clay dries. I was careful to not put this in the drain and used wet paper towels to remove. My face felt great after, but it was seriously red for about 30 mins. I was not worried since that was expected. The clay looks like guacamole when wet. I will google how to mix this smooth. I tried plastic silverware at first, then a plastic baggy, but still have tons of chunks and they fall off all over. If I can get it smooth I will be happy. I only plan to do this 1x a week. Huge bottle too. I expect that using a little bit on a bad zit would work well.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable product.  I mix mine with the Pineapple Enzyme powder and then instead of water or cider vinegar I make a psste using Alba Enzyme Mask...It&#x27;s a refreshing gel and makes a wonderful paste with these other two products.  I&#x27;m 60 and live where it&#x27;s very cold and very dry.  These products made my face glow after...The first time I used it...I couldn&#x27;t believe the feeling and the difference.  Excellent for large pores on your nose or forehead.  Used on painful cold sores...immediate relief. Amazing stuff..</li>
            <li> This is the best mask I have used to date. It really tightens the face and feels like it cleanses the pores. I used it back to back and got very good results the 1st time. My skin was noticeably smoother and it appears my blemishes got lighter, could just be the deep cleanse. I will definitely be re-ordering when I run out.</li>
            <li> This is the only item that was able to 100% pull all of the black heads out of my nose. It feels great and it actually pulls on your face. I never have seen anything like this before. If I could give it 10 stars I would.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. I have always had really bad blackheads on my nose and chin and this has cleared my skin completely. I also get really bad break outs on  my back, chest and shoulders and have fixed that with a soap from Japan that contains this clay. It&#x27;s called Cleaning bar with charcoal and hinoki oil by Hinoki Deitaneski. I shower with this once a day since I got it a couple weeks ago, followed by a rub down with jojoba oil and have had no more breakouts! Skin looks and feels good. Just need to find something for the scars as neither one of these products helps much with that.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the very quick shipping and competitive rate! I LOVE this stuff! Got hooked a little over a month ago, and now use it about 2 times per week... My skin is radiant!! It&#x27;s the best it&#x27;s been in years, and I attribute it to using this clay mask. Thank you!! :-)</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin really soft! Does leave behind some redness so don&#x27;t do this if you&#x27;re planning to leave the house within an hour or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a bit messy to mix with water. And frustrating cause it stays clumpy sometimes which makes it difficult for application.</li>
            <li> love this stuff !! i mix with apple cider vinegar with mother and completely cleans skin once a week or 2 times if i remember&lt;br /&gt;wish i could find more cheap alternatives like this one</li>
            <li> Despite all the positive reviews, I was still skeptical when it came to something that worked on my skin. Since I switched to mirena, my hormones have been on a rampage and it has taken place on my face. I tried some of the most irritating and powerful acne serums, but still had generally had mixed results. I don&#x27;t get many pimples, but I usually get one or two incredibly painful, huge cystic nodules (I had one that made me look like Quasimodo, which was quickly healed by this stuff). Even if my skin would clear from one pimple, another one would spawn shortly afterwards. It was a never ending battle and I could never get it fully under control; I would always have at least one problem area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this twice a week (tuesdays/thursdays), mixed with water in a plastic baggie and I am SO pleased with the results. My method was pretty simple, just put water and some clay in a plastic bag and rub the bag so the contents are completely mixed all over the surface area of the inside of the bag, turn the bag inside out, and apply. I have not broken out since I started using this stuff two weeks ago and my pores have shrunk noticeably. I had a horrible patch of chest acne and I&#x27;ve only used the mask on it twice. About a week later, I haven&#x27;t had any excess oil production and my chest acne has nearly healed completely. I notice that my skin way is less oily throughout the day, even on days where I haven&#x27;t used a mask for 3 days. The mask is very penetrating and has helped me greatly with cystic acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the fact that the packaging was completely broken upon arrival, I salvaged about half of the contents and Amazon was quick to give me a refund. I am so pleased that I kept it because it has been a life saver. I definitely plan on repurchasing and I may even get the larger volume containers next time. It is a bit drying, so be sure to be generous with the moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> This is a jar of clay dust, very fine. No odor from the clay itself.  I mix mine with Bragg&#x27;s Apple Cider vinegar to form a paste and fashion a mask. I have yet to feel any &amp;#34;pulsing&amp;#34; but once the mask dries, WOW. (It does take a while to get it totally set and dr, for me about 20-30 minutes.) I use a very thin layer, and removal does take a bit of scrubbing with a cloth. I really like the cooling effect. The results are immediate and GREAT: face is tighter, pores are emptied and clean, and my skin feels soft. No dryness, even with the tightening and deep cleansing. I also put this on my neck, decollete, and back as needed. Really tones down a breakout.  Mixing, applying, and rinsing off this mask is semi-messy business, but easily managed in a bathoom sink with a shower for rinsing. You definitely need a designated bowl or dish for mixing, and some sort of tool or spreader to make blending and slathering on a bit easier. Been using once a week, and I expect this jar to last me at least a whole year. Will repurchase, this is my HG basic cleansing/tightening mask. I&#x27;ve heard it also works well on itchy bug bites and I believe it.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple mask and by far there is no better mask out there. I add a little drop of tea tree oil, or peppermint oil and it makes that mask feel that much better.</li>
            <li> One of my children has had a pretty hard time with acne.  Was going to purchase proactiv (again)  and stumbled upon this.  The reviews were really good, so I thought, why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had my child put the clay on their face for about 20 minutes &amp; then wash off.  The next morning, my child had significant clearing in their skin.  My child has received compliments about how good their skin looks.  This was just after 1 application!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to see what more applications will do their skin.</li>
            <li> This product really is the answer. You need to buy the apple vinegar that goes with it tho... water just doesn&#x27;t do</li>
            <li> clay is clean clumps with just water dries slowly if put on too thick haven&#x27;t used it with vinegar definitely noticeable difference after just one use</li>
            <li> This product had been sitting on my wishlist for some time before I finally broke down and purchased it.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long!  This clay makes my skin incredibly soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have acne prone skin, so I do not know how well it works for that particular issue.  It does help to minimize the appearance of large pores and gives a nice refined texture to my skin.  I am incredibly oily, and this product helps to limit how greasy I get during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once per week I make a mask of the clay and a 50/50 mix of water and apple cider vinegar which I leave on for ten to fifteen minutes. As the mask dries it creates a pulsing and tightening sensation. It&#x27;s an unusual, though not unpleasant, feeling. Once the mask is dry I rinse with warm water and a soft cloth.  After, I use gentle cleanser and moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is some redness directly after use, however it fades within an hour or so.</li>
            <li> My family had been using this product for over 20 years to pull infections out of BIG and small wounds/bites :) we wouldn&#x27;t be without it</li>
            <li> Love this product! It is messy, so it&#x27;s best to take off in the shower. I have used it every other day for 2 weeks and have noticed a change! Would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> So far so good I&#x27;ve use this product for a week and it truly gets rid of pimples. I&#x27;ve even used it in my natural hair with no problems.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with moderate acne for quite some time now and this product seems to be the most effective. It helps keep keep control of my breakouts by clearing all of the dirt on pores. I mix it with apple cider vinegar and leave it on for about 25 minutes then rinse. I&#x27;ve noticed the difference in my face but I just need to be consistent with it by applying it 2-3 times a week. It can be a hassle to make and sometimes I just get too lazy to mix it and skip some weeks.</li>
            <li> Update as of 090415&lt;br /&gt;Have tried using it with Apple cider vinegar but sadly, it still doesn&#x27;t seem to be clearing my face like all other reviewers. I&#x27;ve stopped using it cause of 1) the smell when mixing with ACV and 2) mainly cause of the hassle of using this. It&#x27;s very messy when washing it off! I&#x27;d wet tissues to wipe it off for fear that it might clog my shower drain. No noticeable results too..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting much from this product but it don&#x27;t seem to help at all for my face.. I have a sudden outbreak for the first time in my 23years of life. not sure if they&#x27;re really acne but just my whole face seems to be slowly filling up with pimple like bumps. I was hoping this to help clear them up but it seems to be doing nothing at all. I use it everyday. But I mixes it with tap water. Is it more effective if I use Apple cider vinegar instead? I really hope this works..... Else I don&#x27;t know what else I should try with sigh</li>
            <li> Nice clay mask for bi weekly treatment. Not for wimps!</li>
            <li> Very effective. you will see the difference right away!</li>
            <li> I love this product really tightens my skin!! I already ordered another one for my daugther and i to share.</li>
            <li> Im 19 years old and I have really acne prone skin. I get alot of blackheads, under the skin acne, cystic etc. I have tried everything from chemical peels, benzoyl cream, salicylic acid, sulfur masks you name it. I bought this clay and the apple cider vinegar together. I used a tablespoon of mask, and a tablespoon of cider. Wow. This stuff is deffinately intense! When they say \\&quot;black hole\\&quot; it really is no joke, you can literally feel it pulling the crap out of your skin. I left it on about 25 minutes and before I wiped it off the mask had the consistency of alligator skin. My skin was so soft I couldnt believe it. Areas were a little red and blotchy but it goes away after about an hour. I used a pore strip on my nose and it got basically all the blackheads on my nose off. This stuff is great. use it once a week and you will see a difference I promise. After years of looking for a good mask I cant believe how cheap and easy this is. I will never use anything else. Very Satisfied.</li>
            <li> I purchased this clay due to the fact, that I had a possible infection after a stingray hit in to my left foot. I was afraid of infection and since I do not take antibiotics ( because I do not believe in their function) I was told to make a paste and put it on the wound. I could feel slight pulling and I never really had any infection, just slight swelling, which is a normal reaction to a trauma.&lt;br /&gt;Many people use it as a facial, which I believe works, but never tried it; no reason so far.&lt;br /&gt;I believe in nature&#x27;s healing power and this is another product that belongs to that category.</li>
            <li> I really did like this mask, I tried it with both vinegar and water but found it a bit drying after using. My biggest complaint about it is that it dries ROCK hard and it&#x27;s only easy to remove in the shower, which means you will end up clogging the pipes eventually. Its not worth all that hassle for a face mask to me, and I love DIY facials. Also these reviews of pulsating and blackhead free skin are just not true. I used it religiously for 2 months (facial every two weeks) and saw no noticeable difference other than lots of dryness in my cheeks.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great! It really tightens your skin and makes it smooth and blackhead free! I have used it a few times so far!</li>
            <li> Great facial mask.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, I truly recommended.  I myself ordered the 6 pds container because it isn&#x27;t just about the face. There are sooooo many other internal and external benefits. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to do a whole lot. I think the &amp;#34;tingly feeling&amp;#34; people were talking about you would get with any mask as it hardens - your face feels tight, feels different. I found it to be very messy and everyone says not to put it down the drain so I took wet paper towels and it took me over 10 minutes to scoop it off of my face, throw it away and finally just wash the rest of it off in the sink. Even if it had been summer time and I could have used a tupperware bowl to &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; my face in and throw it outside, it&#x27;s just too much work for me, especially when I didn&#x27;t feel it did anything after use.</li>
            <li> I recently turned 21, but for nearly 2 years I have struggled with mild acne. My skin type has gone from oily, to dry/peely (when I tried using benzoyl peroxide), but it&#x27;s fairly normal now. My daily skin routine consists of first cleansing with Cetaphil Gentle Face Cleanser, to using Trader Joe&#x27;s Organic Raw Honey as a mask for about 10-15 minutes, and then mixing Apple Cider Vinegar along with the Aztec Clay powder to wear as a mask for about 15-20 minutes. Afterwards, I use the Apple Cider Vinegar as a toner (1:1 ratio with water) and then apply my moisturizer. I do this everyday (I wear liquid foundation so I find it important to make sure my face is thoroughly cleansed and with the most natural, home remedy-like products) and it&#x27;s helped my skin substantially. Mostly by helping my acne (which consist mostly of blackheads) to surface quicker and extracting them out easier. But I do also want to note that I take daily vitamins, birth control, maintain a healthy diet, and workout (but even before using this clay mask I&#x27;ve maintained this lifestyle). With that said, there&#x27;s then something about this clay mask that has surely made a difference even though I seem to be doing everything else that would help prevent my acne. So I would recommend this to just about anyone. A tip I&#x27;d like to offer, however, is that you use apple cider vinegar and not water. Also, that by drinking 1-2 tablespoons of Apple Cider Vinegar each day, you&#x27;ll notice a great difference in your skin&#x27;s complexion and the magnitude of your acne breakouts as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope it works for you as much as it has helped me!</li>
            <li> I thought for sure the reviews on this product had to be skewed, but honestly, it&#x27;s as great as it&#x27;s made out to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will become a part of my regular skin routine. While it&#x27;s a bit messy, I honestly could see great results/improvements in my skin after just 2-3 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it about 3 x a week for the first few weeks and now I&#x27;ve cut back to just once, and it works great. Great to put on and takes about the length of a single 20-30 minutes television show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy and so worth it!</li>
            <li> I mix it with Bragg&#x27;s but need to get the ratio down.  I try to leave it on for 30 minutes.  Ill give another comment when I finish the jar, maybe in like a year.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best clay mask I&#x27;ve used. I would definitely recommend using apple cider vinegar instead of water. I mix it up and leave a bowl of it (covered) in the fridge. Also, you can save some for later. When it&#x27;s cold, it&#x27;s easier to apply and doesn&#x27;t drip before hardening. Instead of washing it off and making a huge mess in the shower, I peel it off in chunks. This way it actually removes buildup (and bonus..hair!) From the root. Definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, smooth transaction. I would purchase again and would recommend. Also the item was just as described online.</li>
            <li> I think this product works for the most part. I mix it with Bragg&#x27;s ACV and leave it on my face for 20 minutes, then shower. I try not to rinse in the sink because it&#x27;s a pain to clean up. Also, I only put a little bit of clay since I only want to use it once. Once the mask becomes dry, you&#x27;ll have to use water to moisten it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks now. My skin was deeply congested and I&#x27;m starting to see it surface. Not an overnight miracle, but I feel confident my skin will improve over time with usage.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, this deep cleanse is enjoyable weekly.  First time &amp;#34;Clay-er&amp;#34; too :-)</li>
            <li> I use bentonite clay as a face mask and I love it. Using ACV to mix, the mask gives a pulsating feeling when it starts to dry and pulls gunk out of pores. Once the mask is rinsed off, my skin is slightly red, but feels very clean and smooth. The mask makes it easy to bring blackheads to a head for extraction. I will def. order more when I run out! I hope to use bentonite clay as a detox next.,</li>
            <li> you can feel it working, it makes your skin pulsate and my skin will be slightly red after i wash it off.  it comes as a powder and you mix in water or vinegar yourself.  directions are easy to understand.  my skin feels better and cleaner after using it.</li>
            <li> I am blown away with how great this mask works. Having used many, MANY, masks in the past, I wasn&#x27;t expecting immediate results. However, after the first use, my mother and I both saw huge improvements in our skin. My combination/white head prone skin looked amazing. The stubborn white heads I had on my cheeks were shrunken! I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes! My mother has large pores on her nose. This mask really shrunk her pores. We looked at our skin through one of those horrific magnified mirrors. Only this time, it was actually a pleasure looking at our reflections. If you are hesistant on buying this mask, DON&#x27;T BE! It works! It is now a must have in my home and my mother&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The product works great, but it&#x27;s difficult to remove and keep from clogging the drain...</li>
            <li> Ehh, this product is okay. Not all it&#x27;s amped up to be. I tried it because I read a really good review about how it would be perfect for those people who have tried everything, but still nothing has worked. Well it made my skin soft but hasn&#x27;t helped clear up acne or acne wounds. It is a hassle to clean up. Don&#x27;t wash it down your drain because it will definitely clog it up! Make sure you buy some sort of filter that will catch the chunks of clay in case you do decide to wash it down the drain.</li>
            <li> Huge tub. I&#x27;ve only used it once or twice, it takes a lot of effort to make a mask and use it, sometimes I don&#x27;t have the time or want to do a spot treatment.</li>
            <li> I love the way it draws out all the impurities from your face. And all my big open pores has vanished thank God.</li>
            <li> Best mask I have ever used for pore clearing. Use raw unfiltered organic apple cider vinegar and only add just enough to get it into paste form for best results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best mask to lean up your pone, love it!  The price is amazing too,wish I find it early.</li>
            <li> This clay mask works very good for face deep cleanings.</li>
            <li> I love doing my facial masks with this clay! You really feel that pulling sensation like your faced it been cleansed of all that toxins and nasty stuff. This has helped my face so much. I will continue buying.</li>
            <li> Uffff I have to say that I like this stuff I use it twice a week and my face feel and looks good</li>
            <li> Love love love this product. Ive only used it once but my skin is so much smoother and even. My husband came home and the first words was what did u do to your face? I mixed mine with apple cider vinegar but only need two teaspoon. I defiantly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I expected good things but this turned out to be great!</li>
            <li> I love this product. Very great mask, last very long.clears my skin very nicely is a little on the ruff side, so if your skin is sentitive slowly remove the product couple of minutes before is completely dry or you will end up with a little redness in your checks. Overall, it cant get any better for the price.</li>
            <li> great stuff, just as mentioned in all the other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;really cleans out pores.</li>
            <li> However, VERY EFFECTIVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face is suctioned totally clean. I&#x27;ve tried this on my siblings and it works like a dream. Never thought I would get those blackheads off my brother&#x27;s nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do use apple cider vinegar. Works much better. Don&#x27;t bother with a super thick layer. It just takes longer to dry and is less effective. A thin layer is sufficient. Don&#x27;t use metal to mix this, plastic spoons only and ceramic or plastic bowls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your face will be red after, but should fade in an hour. At worse, it is sensitive and red for the night if you&#x27;ve  been regularly exfoliating all week.</li>
            <li> Pretty thick clay.. will bring all impurities out, as it did for me, almost through my retinol away, but then I thought NO WAY, to many uses with retinol. But if you want to feel your face get clean this would be the product to use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this with other new products I&#x27;m trying for my combination skin. I&#x27;ve only used it once, but my pores are smaller and my skin feels soft. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s from the clay or a combination of all the new products, but I will continue to use this. Messy, but seems to work well. Very drying so don&#x27;t leave on too long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy and gives great results. I usually use it at night, right before bed, scoop out some and mix it with apple cider vinegar and apply to face. Once it dries, I&#x27;ll just wash it off. I usually apply a thin layer since a thicker layer takes forever to wash off and it gives me similar results. It cleanse out my pores a bit and leaves my skin soft. Use it at night since if you are pale like me, it leaves your face pretty red right afterwards.</li>
            <li> I am a beautician and I have seen and used plenty of products on all skin types, including my own. I have very sensitive, highly reactive skin. Many masques I have used for sensitive skin have done nothing for my skin. Regular masques are too harsh and drying. This product is amazing. Mixes well, goes on easy, no crazy smell and does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> love this stuff! I did experience some irritation upon taking it off (face was blotchy for about an hour) and I&#x27;ve used 4 times, the first 3 times made me break out (the purge), and the 4th time my skin is GLOWING. Also, I have hyperpigmentation and sensitive skin, this seems to help with my coloring. I also have some uneven texture due to acne scars, and this seems to soften it a great bit. Can&#x27;t wait to see what a month from now looks like! I am DEFINITELY buying again. this replaced my Origins Charcoal mask (super expensive and NOT as effective as this wonderful product). I keep my mask on for 30 minutes....I don&#x27;t experience any &amp;#34;pulsating&amp;#34;, but I apply a thinner/runnier mask on my skin than a thick layer...I also do 2/3 ACV and 1/3 water for the liquid part. I&#x27;m gonna have to buy a larger one because I am gonna share with my two sisters and mom :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I love taking a bath and putting this with sea salt!! It truly softens your skin and feels so relaxing!!</li>
            <li> Mix feelings; nice texture but i dont think it works at all</li>
            <li> Is this stuff the greatest ever??? Awesome for skin!!</li>
            <li> All I can say is, &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve tried many mud masques before with mixed success, and I honestly did not expect such great results so quickly. My skin LOVES this stuff. Slather this concoction on, and in 15-20 minutes, the masque becomes almost frighteningly tight, leaving your face in a stone-like grimace while it tackles your unruly pores and whips them into submission. I have mild occasional acne and dry/ combination skin, and just after one use, my pores were noticeably smaller THE NEXT DAY. My boyfriend even commented on how soft my face was. No flaky skin! My usual opaque and sallow skin looked and FELT fresh and healthy, and I didn&#x27;t even bother to use foundation makeup for work! I love that this product is completely, 100% natural clay. I will definitely continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Love this product, works wonders. Would recommend this face mask to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally in love with this mask. Your face feels and looks fresh after each use, and the fact that it clear my acne is a plus!</li>
            <li> Works great on my face when it breaks out, acne is reduced visibly. However, on my hair (4c natural) I would only recommend using this once a month. It did detox my hair, however, for a couple days my scalp was irritated. I recommend Moroccan Red Clay (rhassoul clay).</li>
            <li> It was really good in the first use. It cleared up my acne and made my pores so much smaller. Recently though, it caused me to break out horrifically on my cheeks. It could be just due to my skin changing or leaving it on for too long.</li>
            <li> It works great on my wife but made me break out the 3 times i used it (cystic acne) so is not for everyone but it does leave skin feeling smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> At home facial face mask! It tightens my pores and leaves my face fresh.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews before purchasing,  it clears face well, helps with blackheads, oily skin, like the tightening, pulsating effect of the mask when drying. I followed the instructions by mixing with apple cider vinegar, it has a cooling feel on application,  let dry for 20 minutes or so, jump in the shower n very gently wash mask off, don&#x27;t scrub, this step is a process in its self, be gentle with washing mask off as skin has been cleaned by the mask, don&#x27;t need to agitate skin. This takes about 10 minutes then  I apply vit E. Skin will be a little red ,100% clean. I do this before I go to bed, so my skin has time to rejuvenate by morning. Love this product. The reviews I read some were concerned about plugging drain pipe from mask,  no worries there just run hot water when you are out of shower. Works for me.</li>
            <li> me and my mother have struggled with sagging skin and puffiness under the eyes as well as large pores. this stuff works!!! my mom is 44 and she looks like she shed 10 years.</li>
            <li> Excellent mask to tighten pores.&lt;br /&gt;Usually use once per week with Apple Cider Vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;Really cleans skin</li>
            <li> Wow I brought mud online, thought free mud on Craiglist was crazy. Works well, pulls all the crap out of my face. Super hard to clean though unless I just clog up all my drains.</li>
            <li> I have suffered all my life with acne and blackheads on my nose like real bad I was always a weirdo because i hated to go out in the day so nobody noticed my face... I have acne icepick marks on my face as well. let me tell u i have tried everything for blackheads literally..pore strips,baking soda, all over the counter facial things of all kinds, i even went to my MD to prescribe me something, gave me epiduro...somthing like that it kinda worked for acne but not blackheads...I have years and years acummulated acne and blackheads...I figured with great reviews i would try this...i have put the mask first day, noticed a change. It does pulsate. It drys and hurts and itches, but i figured it working, put it on the following day..cleaned my face...just like that..I bulls*** u not...this damn clay finally works...something that cost me 6 something finally works...I love it..I really do..it will be the best 6 dlls and change u will ever spend...i put lotion with sunscreen after, it does dry skin a little...but it works.</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff!! It does exactly what it says on the container. Your face actually throbs at it pulls out all the toxins. You feel like you&#x27;re getting a chemical peal. I love it!! I use it a couple times a week and my face feels so smooth.</li>
            <li> fast shipping. good product.</li>
            <li> This product actually lives up to the the results, it causes the face to pulsate as it clean and tightens the skin.</li>
            <li> Great product and really fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;This mask is really a wonder.</li>
            <li> Very good stuff, makes my face soft , clean, even color.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a great improvement when using it on my face or my husbands back acne.</li>
            <li> a bargin because you really get your moneys worth, I feel it working on my face, its smoother now</li>
            <li> Best Ever....Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I like how it pull my face and make it smooth afterward. very good!!!</li>
            <li> Great Company, hands down!!</li>
            <li> I truly believe this is the reason for my clearer looking skin. I am just amazed by this product. It&#x27;s a must try!</li>
            <li> Amazing cost effective product.  Yes it is a bit of a pain to mix it but it is soooooo worth it.  My skin is cleaner, dry and free of oil, smoother, tighter, and feels amazing.  I am a customer for life.</li>
            <li> I love this mask. Bought this with some Bragg&#x27;s Apple Cider Vinegar, and it was definitely worth it. Yes, the smell of the vinegar is harsh, but you get used to it after seeing your results. My biggest suggestion for anyone buying this product is to read the directions. Sounds like a dumb thing to say, but the directions on the jar are very accurate. My face was red afterward (as they say it will be), but that redness went away rather quickly. Everyone in my family is now in love with this stuff and always want me to mix some up for them when they come over. It leaves your skin soft and bright. Also, if you have drier skin then you always have the option of mixing it with water instead of vinegar.</li>
            <li> For me it helped eliminate some acne scars and It did it beautifully. Unfortunately it did not remove any acne for me whatsoever, with continued use (about 1 or 2 times a week no more) it was giving me acne. The acne was different though. It was tiny red acne all over my forehead and it looked like a rash but of acne. I did everything , used apple cider vinegar, even tried with water, applied lotion after and tried without lotion after. This product didn&#x27;t work for me. Unfortunately the good reviews had me fooled. Don&#x27;t buy this if you have sensitive skin or dry skin.</li>
            <li> Utter bliss. I followed another reviewers recommendation and bought this along with the witch hazel/rose water combination toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face feels magnificent. I followed it up with Dr. Oz&#x27;s anti-aging vitamin serum and my face is so hydrated and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to everyone who has a face.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know about this product still waiting to see a change</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel clean but does not help with acne like others have been saying.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and tightening while it was on THE FIRST 3 MINUTES....then it started to itch and burn. I only left it on for 10 minutes. The other reviews said for sensitive skin, mix with water, so thats what I did. EXTREMELY CLUMPY, A PAIN TO CLEAN UP, AND CLOGS THE DRAIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem is that I have extremely fair, and sensitive skin. This mask burns and dries my skin out, even with post moisturizing. I used it twice in one week, and my skin was so pissed off, I got red splotches and a scaley itchy RASH! The red splotches went away by the next morning, but rash stayed for several days. It wasnt too noticeable under makeup just itchy and annoying. It also made my skin look as though I used to have extremely bad acne, which I have never had. So this rash gave the illusion of severe acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask would be AWESOME for people with OILY AND NOT SUPER SENSITIVE skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin, but like I said...extremely sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you have dry skin or sensitive skin, I would NOT use this unless you want a weird scaley rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product may be great for some people, it just does not work for everyone (clearly).</li>
            <li> Use raw apple cider vinegar to mix with the clay. And I put mine in a small ziplock bag and flip it inside out to apply to my face so my hands and sink won&#x27;t get too dirty. It has to be a thick consistency to not get everywhere though. It does pulsate the face and you can feel the dirt lifting. Don&#x27;t be like me and let one fly by and go over the limit it says on the container because it will hurt to express emotion. Especially laughing. Lol...but once I rinsed it off my face felt smooth and clear. It is harsh for everyday use but depending on your skin type, you could get away with once or twice a week. It has helped my acne and my darks spots since I started using it!</li>
            <li> Aztec clay and apple cider vinegar mask is amazing!  I love this stuff. Worth a try if you&#x27;ve never used it before.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin really, I have human skin. I left the mask on for about 9 minutes, noticing my skin inflaming red and peeling. Was sensitive to touch even the morning after. Very bad product.</li>
            <li> Pretty good! Love how I feel after I wash it off</li>
            <li> I love this product! To start off a little goes a long way and it does the work. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month already and my skin has gotten better with less black heads and zits.</li>
            <li> so i have ahad this awhile and i love it! it works amazing and makes me skin and face amazingly soft and cleanses the pores. i have bad skin (i hate it) and this mask fixes a lot of it! love it! you can feel it work!</li>
            <li> After reading the amazing reviews about this miracle clay mask, I decided to check it out for myself. The product is inexspensive and the reviews are stellar. Just a little history about my skin, I&#x27;m african american woman who suffered from acne as a teen but now I only have battle scars (Blemishes), white/black heads and huge pores on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very first time applying the product to my face, it felt like any other clay mask but 2-3 mintues in I could feel the clay drying and tightening on my face, neck and chest. I left the product on until it was dried and had a cracked appearance.  I took a damp washcloth and set it on my face to loosen the hardened clay. Once the clay was softened I wipped the clay away with the wet cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After removing the clay I noticed my skin was smooth, and the white/black heads around my nose were gone! The 2nd use I noticed the pores on my nose were dramatically smaller. The 3rd time I used the product I noticed the pores on my nose had disappered. The 4th use I noticed the dark spots are less visable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also important to know what I used on my skin druing this time peroid. I wash my face with Clean and Clear liquid foaming cleanser, I use CVS astrigent for sensitive skin, facial scrub by Equate, 100% African white shea butter and or Hollywood Beauty tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the mask, it has help to detoxify my skin, I will contuine to use the product and update this review. Also, I used regular old apple cider vinegar but will use organic in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest trying this product it&#x27;s under $5.00, fast shipping you can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> I used Aztec for the first time over the weekend and it felt like a spa day for my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar arrived with anti-tampering seal. The powder is fine textured and has a soft mint-green/gray color. I measured a 1/4 cup of powder in a plastic container . Then,  gradually stirred in 1/4 cup of diluted apple cider vinegar/water with a plastic spoon. Once the clay was smooth, I stirred in 1 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil. I applied the powder to my face and my previously deep conditioned hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application was very easy to both my face and my hair. and scalp. I put a plastic cap over my hair so that the clay wouldn&#x27;t dry out. After 15 minutes, I rinsed my face and hair with very warm water. The clay rinsed out easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face was glowing and smooth. My hair had defined curls and felt soft. I was surprised to find that the 6-month old henna that I thought had grown out to the tips of my hair was vibrantly all over my hair. The clay revealed the henna again and I loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li> Glowing skin means cleaning pores and that what Aztec secret Indian healing does.</li>
            <li> This is a great clay mask, but due to my busy life, I don&#x27;t have much time to make it. Every time I&#x27;ve done it, I&#x27;ve made too much or it wasn&#x27;t done the right way (too watery or the clay clumps too much). I need to work on making it better, yet it&#x27;s more convenient to buy masks that are already premixed. Of course those may include more chemicals and ingredients, so if you are looking for a natural clay mask, this is it. However, if making a mask and figuring out just how much you need (it&#x27;s really not a lot needed if you&#x27;re just applying on the face, which is all I need) is not a problem, then I say go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying the mask after it&#x27;s done is pretty simple. I mix in a glass bowl and use my fingers to spread the clay around. You start to feel it dry fairly quick, but after about 10 minutes, your whole face feels pulsating. They&#x27;re not lying when they advertise that. It&#x27;s a strange sensation, but I guess it&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to do. After rinsing, my skin is a little red, but that goes away after awhile. But I don&#x27;t recommend to do a mask right before going out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve gotten it (about 3 months ago), I&#x27;ve only done 4 facial masks, since for me it&#x27;s a bit of a hassle to make the mask right. I honestly don&#x27;t feel a difference from this product to any other clay mask I&#x27;ve bought. It does dry my out a little more than others do, but in regards to my pores or acne, it works just fine. It&#x27;s not extraordinary, but it&#x27;s not ordinary either. The nicest thing is the large amount of clay you get for the price!</li>
            <li> 1. The amazing result is: it actually caused about 30 tiny breakouts on my face in just one night; 2. I mixed it with apple cider vinegar, the smell was so bad and spread to the entire room; 3. It is easy to apply to your face but if you apply the suggested amount (1/4 in. to 1/2 to the face or other area) then remove it without clogging your bathroom, it is very painful and messy. 4. PLEASE NOTICE BEFORE YOU BUY: THIS ITEM CAN NOT BE RETURNED!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am going to throw it away and get some peeling system instead. Very very disappointing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice since getting it about two or three days ago and my face is already clearing up. I had multiple large break outs on my cheeks and it was pretty gross looking, but I used it once and the next day my face looked remarkably better already, used it twice and I&#x27;m almost cleared up! Hopefully as I continue to use it my face stays clear!</li>
            <li> WOW. This stuff is serious. It gets ridiculously hard and has done TONS for my acne. Definitely recommended. And worth the price, I mixed my first mask in a small tupperware, let the extra dry and added more water when I wanted another mask. I use this + Lush&#x27;s Charcoal soap and my acne is almost non existent now.</li>
            <li> My boyfriends mother used it with me and she looked younger she is 70 years old. Make sure you use it with vineager. When II first used it I didnt have any and when you mix it with water it wont really stick to your face or pulse.</li>
            <li> Awesome mask! It is a great secret . I have been trying everything but have been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;But this product does what its says and more.&lt;br /&gt;Even after first application could see a difference.</li>
            <li> Have used it a good amount of times I find it tough to apply and hate mixing it. It definitely tightens your skin like crazy but I didn&#x27;t notice pore shrinkage and honestly way too busy in my schedule to find time to do this often. Maybe it&#x27;s just me</li>
            <li> cleans out all my pores!</li>
            <li> If u have oily skin this stuff is amazing. Its like a biore strip in a mask with out the painful tape like extraction.  Gonna do a bodywrap next n best of all a lil goes a long way. Thank god for this spa in a jar.</li>
            <li> I found this to be drying for my skin. I also have very sensitive skin. It made my skin worse. I am not saying it is a bad product. But I would be careful if you have sensitive skin. It does do as it advertised.</li>
            <li> My skin has smoothened out and simply looks better in tone and hydration.  It says to use once a week but this was too much for my sensitive skin so I scaled it back to once every 2 weeks.  Had the jar for several months and barely put a dent in the usage.  1/3 clay with 1/3 ACV gets me through 3 facials.</li>
            <li> I brought it for my naturally curly and dry hair. It works. It helps define my curls. At first I didn&#x27;t think it would be enough but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> the shipping and everything was great. no hassle or anything. it&#x27;s just the mask itself that isn&#x27;t all that great. i don&#x27;t see why theres so much hype to it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a powder, you have to mix it with vinegar. Works great! Don&#x27;t leave it on too long!</li>
            <li> Just received this 20 mins ago, tried it and it&#x27;s fantastic! Mixed it with apple cider, small amount of botanics clay mask (only because I had some here) and WOW what a difference. If anyone could remember St. Ives minerals clay (discontinue) the effectives it gave, well this one does the same thing. It feels good to finally find a product that works and one I have total control over.</li>
            <li> Ehhh it does its job and is what they advertise it to be, but it&#x27;s annoying to make and wish it were more of a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Less is more with this mask. It works better if you use a thin layer, don&#x27;t make it so thick when you mix it with the cider. It makes your skin clear up pretty fast but it&#x27;s only slightly better than my proactiv face mask. I use it for spot treament more than a full face mask. I did notice after using it my pores were bigger, i have a pore shrinking serum that corrected that issue but that&#x27;s my only issue with this mask. I don&#x27;t use it in places that i don&#x27;t have to, it&#x27;s very strong! I have to wash it off in the shower. It&#x27;s a good product and the price is more than reasonable.</li>
            <li> This clay mask is quite funny to use. It is thick to mix, difficult to spread on, and you will be like the Egyptian stone mummy while it sits on your face. I left it on for 30 minutes and it hadn&#x27;t dried out completely. The bad part for me was trying to wash it off. I had already taken a shower and I was paranoid about getting clay clumps down the drain and clogging it up. So I rinsed off my face in a large bowl which was not helping the mask come off. In the end I had to use a wet washcloth to wipe everything off which wasn&#x27;t really good because you&#x27;re stretching out the skin. But anyway, I used water &amp; a few drops of tea tree oil to mix my mask. It was very refreshing thanks to the tea tree oil scent. Once the mask was completely removed, I noticed my face was brighter and some spots looked like they were lightening up &amp; healing already. It could be the tea tree oil though because it&#x27;s done that when I&#x27;ve used it as a toner. I also exfoliated my face first before using this mask. Bottom line, this is a cheap &amp; natural mask that seems to help.</li>
            <li> This product was easy to use, and made my skin feel so soft. I had a little redness after which the directions worned you about. It went away quickly. It has a lot of uses after using it on my face I will be using it in a  body wrap. I will use this product again.</li>
            <li> Great product, very messy, gets everywhere</li>
            <li> MIRACLE WORKER. For the past like month and a half I had been getting disgusting acne EVERYWHERE like chronic systic, and had no idea why! I bought this just to try out a new mask and omg literally all of that acne went away and didnt come back. I only use this once or twice a week. I will be repurchasing over and over again &amp;#60;3 Tub is so huge though so I wont need to anytime soon. BTW! I did not use the apple cider vinegar, just water and it works amazingly--havent tried it with. (Im sure it would go on a little smoother but Idc about that as long as my acne is gone!)</li>
            <li> Love this. I will only use with apple cider vinegar but amazing. My face feels so clean and tight after.</li>
            <li> This product is truly amazing! I saw a dramatic difference after only one use. I highly recommend this product to anyone who suffers from Acne!</li>
            <li> Your skin will GLOW!!! Use the raw apple cider vinegar though cause it&#x27;s way better. BUT BUY IT AT YOUR LOCAL WHOLE FOODS cause the one on here is a rip off.</li>
            <li> DELIVERED ON TIME WITHOUT ANY ISSUES.</li>
            <li> My friend is a make-up artist and recommended me this product, so I jumped right into it. I figured, for the price, if it didn&#x27;t work, it wasn&#x27;t a big loss. To my surprise, I saw results instantly after the first use. I mix it with either water, apple cider vinegar, or my favorite tea tree oil (this one is strong, for deep cleansing, so you may want to dilute it with almond or jojoba oil). It leaves my face glowing, my pores visibly smaller and feels great while thightening your skin as it dries. I would greatly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful! !!! Great price and it works amaizingly... cleans pores super good..love it</li>
            <li> Its ok, very drying, make sure to put a moisturizer or oil on after.  Its okay.  Dr. Bronners castile soap has been better to remove pimples on my face.</li>
            <li> This product is the best facial I ever used!!!!!  Love it!</li>
            <li> i have problem skin but this stuff is a miracle.  definitely mix this with acv not water.  i put this on my face for about ten minutes and wash it off in the shower followed by a honey mask and i can leave the house with out makeup, it is an awesome product and it will last you forever.  i also put it on my bf&#x27;s face (when he lets me) and it makes his skin a lot smoother as well.  your face will be a little red for about half an hour after you wash it off but that will fade!  it exfoliates as well as deep cleanses so your skin will be as soft as a baby&#x27;s when you use this</li>
            <li> So far we are loving this stuff! My teenagers and I use it, and while you need to start slow, I have noticed a big difference in the acne in both my kids when they use it consistently. My son and I have very sensitive skin so we do not leave it on long. We use it with ACV.</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail today, I am a 34 yr old mother of 3 and have suffered with acne/blackheads most of my life. I mixed this with water to use for my first try. It seems to work well. I was pleased with the actual feeling of the tingle as it cleaned my pores and the feeling of it hardening on my face. I am going to try to use this twice a week to start and then move to once a week.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Just received my package and immediately mixed the clay with apple cider vinegar and let it work. I am a 33-year old Black female with problem skin, and this stuff right here....is a miracle worker. My large pores have decreased in size, so much so that they are now hardly visible..my skin is baby smooth and looks clearer. The mask really gets deep down into the pores. I didn&#x27;t find the tightening of the mask or pulsating unbearable. Definitely less pain that your dermatologist inflicts. My only regret is, I wish I knew about is product sooner. For the cost and the results.....I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to truly rate this product, because it did not stop the blackheads from coming. On the other hand, I am cleansing my body with natural and organics foods and supplements. So the few blackheads were a good sign. What it did was tightened my face up so tight, I thought I had a face lift.</li>
            <li> I used this product for almost a year now, and have finally decided to write this review. I absolutely love this clay. It works like a miracle. I strongly recommend using apple cider vinegar to create the mixture instead of water, as it is more effective. I&#x27;ve had a lot of acne and large pores for quite awhile, and after using this, I can honestly say my skin has improved a lot more and there&#x27;s smaller pores and extremely less acne on my face (only the occasional breakouts due to exam stress and hormonal breakouts, as I am a university student and a female!).&lt;br /&gt;The container does not lie, you can literally feel your skin pulsate!&lt;br /&gt;PRO: A very little can actually go a long way with this product. If you take half a teaspoon of this clay powder, you will actually have enough mixture to use on your entire face (and maybe neck too - depending on how tiny your face is)!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the 1 pound container, and I can honestly say, it will last me an entire year... if not more!&lt;br /&gt;CON: I&#x27;ve tried using it as a hair mask, and it leaves my hair really dry and feels really rough. I would not recommend using it on your hair, since it will take out all your hair&#x27;s natural oil and will leave your hair oiler since your hair is trying to restore all the lost oil by producing more oil. So I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it on your hair. BUT, definitely use it on your face, neck, arms, legs, etc. Also, the first few times you use this, your face will turn red and you will get even more breakouts. But those breakouts are just those dirt that have been stuck in your pores and are finally submerging and causing breakouts. So don&#x27;t be alarmed the first few times you use them. Your skin will get better after the first few uses!!!!</li>
            <li> Yep, its the BOMB. my skin feels soooo smooth and silky...I did break out after the first couple of uses...but that is normal for a clay mask ( it was drawing all the deep down poisons from my skin) Haven&#x27;t had an issue after the first couple of times and now I am glad I stuck with it. Part of my weekly beauty regimen now!!!</li>
            <li> it came right on time. I uses it right away and it works well.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face mask. I have very sensitive combination skin, and I just LOVE what this does for my skin. Your face actually pulsates! I put it on when I feel stressed and start breaking out, and it immediately starts clearing me up. Very happy!</li>
            <li> I use the clay mixed with Brags Apple vinegar. I love it. it make my skin very soft and bright.&lt;br /&gt;I only have positive comment about this product.  I use this once a week for a spa feeling.&lt;br /&gt;My husband used it once in a while and likes the tingling sensation.</li>
            <li> I have Seborrheic Dermatitis in certain areas of my face, and acne all over my forehead. As many with the same condition know balancing Seb Derm and acne problems is very difficult. Many acne products and face masks can cause Seb Derm flare ups. This clay mask has been great for me. I use it at night because it can leave my face a little red. However, in the morning my skin feels and looks so much better. It does a great job at helping me maintain both, acne and Seborrheic Dermatitis.</li>
            <li> all you really need is a tiny jar of this stuff.  my complexion does look better after i use this.  i  use a non alcoholic witch hazel (the real kind) after rubbing the mask off.  it takes the redness out of skin if you are fair complected.  it tightens pores a bit, but i wouldn&#x27;t say it &amp;#34;deep cleans pores&amp;#34;.  maybe if your pores aren&#x27;t that big to begin with.</li>
            <li> I love this and it cleared my acne up so good can&#x27;t get enough of this mask!</li>
            <li> This does what it&#x27;s supposed to do- absolutely TONS of clay however, be aware when opening that it may go everywhere</li>
            <li> This stuff works miracles! I am 23 years old, and I have been struggling with cystic acne for 10 years. I&#x27;ve tried everything from antibiotics, to OTC washes, to natural remedies from Pinterest, and nothing has worked for me. I purchased this product last week, I have done only three masks, and already, these stubborn, cystic bumps that have been embarrassing me and haunting me for the past 10 years have disappeared, and I&#x27;m starting to see the red marks go away as well. I would highly recommend this product to anyone and everyone, and my teenage nieces can&#x27;t wait for our next girls night to try it out!</li>
            <li> Ok, like many of the other reviewers, I&#x27;ve had acne for a very, very long time.  I&#x27;ll be turning 30 this year, and I&#x27;m still dealing with acne. I&#x27;ve also had uneven skin tone with dry spots. I wanted a product that was non-toxic and would be more of an all-in-one face mask.  I got exactly what I requested, and I&#x27;m now on my second jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to say that I find the more regular I use the product, the better the results.  That would seem like a &amp;#34;duh!&amp;#34; thing to some, but I can tell when I haven&#x27;t used the product in a week or longer.  Acne that I had that was starting to develop just disappears. My skin smooths out.  My face feels great afterwards.  This is an excellent product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have a couple tips though that make this product more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  Buy one of those mixing kits. They come with the little bowl, brush, mixer tool, and measuring spoons. I was using this with a plate or bowl and a hair color applicator brush (yeah yeah yeah).... just get a kit. It&#x27;ll make things easier.&lt;br /&gt;2)  I&#x27;ve only used apple cider vinegar. It works good. Use it.&lt;br /&gt;3)  Clean your face of makeup before you use it. I get better results when I do.&lt;br /&gt;4)  Put it on before a shower.  This is the part that gets a little tricky for me.  I&#x27;ve tried to not do the &amp;#34;before shower&amp;#34; step, but I always end up making a HUGE mess in my sink and I always end up getting some in my hair no matter how hard I try not to.  Then my hair gets wet trying to get it out of my hair, and I never can get it all out of my hair, so then my hair dries funny.&lt;br /&gt;5)  I used to think the longer I left the product on, the better.  I think 20 minutes is a good maximum.  Anything longer and it starts to really dry and hurt.  Like, pull your hair from your skin, crack your face, peel skin of hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow those steps, and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> It broke face out. I tried it with water and not apple cider vinegar. Might be the problem. I will end up trying it again and re post my results.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I use it as a mask and part of my homemade powder foundation.  I don&#x27;t know how I ever did without it!</li>
            <li> I bought this with hopes that it would help with my &amp;#34; mild adult acne&amp;#34; that I&#x27;ve dealt with for over 10 years now. It really does do a great job of clearing up my face when I use it like I&#x27;m supposed to. The tingly sensation feels a little weird at first but now I really like it. It has made my face a lot smoother and has evened out my tone a little also. I just wished cleaning it off was a little easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this as a face mask (so far, so many uses to try yet!) and holy tightening batman! While the last was drying (I just used the powder and mixed with water, I know you can mix it with other solutions) I could feel it tightening like crazy. There was some redness once I washed it off, but nothing crazy. I used it at night then went to bed after I washed this off and moisturized my face. The faint redness was completely gone by morning. And my face felt awesome. This will last a while, great amount of product with a nice price point and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Love this I see a big improvement on my face I love that it pretty much sucks up all the bad stuff from your skin.</li>
            <li> This is very intense stuff. My face remains red for quite a while after and I don&#x27;t even feel like it does as much as it says it does.</li>
            <li> a little cumbersome to use but seems to work well. At least it didn&#x27;t irritate my face. My small pimples under my chin went away...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying I have very unique skin.  I&#x27;m a rare breed of mutt, a lot of my heritage is African so I hyper pigment very easily.  I&#x27;m nearly 30 and I&#x27;m still prone to break outs.  I bought this product a year ago and was attracted to it for the price (and reviews), I had gotten over most of my acne but still occasional zits that left a nasty black mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought apple cider vinegar and mixed the two expecting healthier skin.  I tried it for a few months and noticed my skin getting worse.  I still get whiteheads on my forehead but they&#x27;re mostly benign meaning they don&#x27;t form cystic zits, they&#x27;re only noticeable in a vanity mirror and they go away within a week.  However, each time I used the clay mask ALL of the white heads on my forehead would swell into zits within days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never felt refreshed when I used it there was always a very dry feeling and a sulfury almost toxic feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I threw it away and got some level 9 green cream and my forehead is slowly but surely clearing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a black person with an oily forehead do not by this crap.  Seriously it will irritate your skin and cause massive inflammation.  tried it several times just to be sure and am only writing this a month after being off of the stuff and realizing it caused a lot of my skin troubles.</li>
            <li> Maani, I am also a college student - female, 19, minor level 3 acne, frustrated. Like you, I tried a lot of different products to no avail. I also have some redness on my face and have had no luck with diminishing any of it. Just wanting an update on your product use and maybe some photos too. Not sure if it will display my email or not, but it is elliemckelroy at g mail dot com. If that didn&#x27;t display, it&#x27;s &amp;#34;ellie&amp;#34; followed by my last name on here at g mail dot com. Thanks in advance! Excited to hear back from you. Going to give it five stars since you did, because I have not yet used this product.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as described. Will be ordering it again</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Great with my acne. It&#x27;s really important to mix with unfiltered apple cider vinegar, it balances the Ph to your face.</li>
            <li> The high ratings are valid. I have extremely sensitive skin that breaks out in acne if I try a new makeup product. After doing this (I use the apple cider vinegar as the mixing agent) my acne is immediately being shrank down and dried out. The minute you take the mask off your skin already feels 10x better. My fianc&amp;eacute;, 3 of my friends, and my fiance&#x27;s friend all have boughten this after I let them try it. Great mask for male AND females alike.</li>
            <li> Hard to mix on put evenly on your face.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mask for a month now and I like the way the mask feels on my face. It is easy to mix with the ACV and after I wash the mask off it makes my face feel tighter, my pores looks smaller, my skin feels soft. It does leave my face a little red but it goes away after a little while. I will be using this mask from now on.</li>
            <li> Wow! My skin was pulsating!!!  I do love this mask, however it does get very tight and uncomfortable.  My husband even tried this one with me..we loved it, but it can be difficult to wear for the time instructed.  skin feels soft and smooth after.</li>
            <li> I Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my skin.. But, Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong? Who knows.</li>
            <li> It definitely does something, but it&#x27;s a bit too harsh for my taste. Messy, difficult to remove and need to have vinegar on hand.</li>
            <li> I found the product to be very hard to use, you need to create the clay yourself, i bought it because the reviews were great, but i do not like the entire process.</li>
            <li> I can feel my akin pulsating, have big pores ao this makes them smaller</li>
            <li> This stuff will make your face feel like it&#x27;s gonna implode. Serious cleanin going on</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell for sure, but every time I use this product I seem to breakout more.</li>
            <li> I love face masks so I wanted to try this one.&lt;br /&gt;I used it three times as of today, I use a makeup brush to apply it. The first two times it was ok. It helped my acne a little, but nothing crazy. Makes your face red for a few minutes. I do notice it takes makeup out of my pours that my face wash left behind.&lt;br /&gt;Today when I used it, I applied a thick layer because I accidentally made way too much. Figured it would be ok as it says you can take mud baths with it, and I normally apply tick layers of other kinds to my skin. I checked it after 20 minutes and removed a small area. I noticed my face was literally turning blue/purple and was very puffy. It was actually scary to see it like that! I removed it and I got my color back a few minutes later. I will try it again and use a thin layer but if it happens again I won&#x27;t re buy obviously..</li>
            <li> I read many reviews about this product and so many people touted this as an absolute miracle product. One reviewer said it was no better than any other clay mask she used and I will have to agree with that reviewer. Now don&#x27;t get me wrong it is a very good product, but I have had other clay masks that make my face pulsate and tightens my pores. I will say this tightened just a bit more though and made my caramel colored skin red for about 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this product has over other clay masks is that it comes in a powder form so you can control it&#x27;s thickness and also being able to mix it with ACV is a definite benefit to the skin. I mixed mine with the ACV and it worked wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mixing it according to the directions I didn&#x27;t find it any more gunky for the sink than any other clay mask that I have used; therefore, I do not see any reason to go through all of the acrobatics to remove the mask that others suggest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do see this product lasting a long time so the value for the money is definitely there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So bottom line, yes, I would recommend this product. For those of you who have never had a drying clay mask this is probably the best thing since sliced bread. For those of you who have used drying clay masks before it&#x27;s not the miracle product others have claimed it to be. When you put it on you&#x27;ll think to yourself - &amp;#34;been there, done that&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Just received it today and used it about 5 mins ago. It works great. My fiance and I used it and it was fun putting it on each other and the both of us loved how it felt,once we took it off. I would def keep this as a regimen for once a week.</li>
            <li> I never quite &amp;#34;believed&amp;#34; in masks to make a significant different in your skin, but this definitely proved otherwise. It says in the description that your skin will be red and look slightly irritated right after the mask, BUT when you wake up in the morning, your skin will me smooth and glowing. So this is definitely a mask that I would only use at night, personally.</li>
            <li> I have really big pores so when someone told me that this product [in mixture with raw apple cider] cleans them out and shrinks pore size, I jumped on it. And it&#x27;s true, this stuff does reduce the size of your pores!...But only for like 2 days. It does clean the pores out and gives your face that awesome clean feeling afterwards so if you really want your skin to look smoother throughout the day or you need nice even skin for the evening, it&#x27;s cool. However if you have really huge pores and oily skin like me, you will definitely be disappointed on the third day after using the Aztec Clay/Apple Cider mixture. Best to use this clay with another product that promises longer term results.</li>
            <li> Worked great mixing it with apple cider , very satisfied with results</li>
            <li> Dont let all the good reviews fool you! I have acne scars so I hoped this mask would get rid of them for me. I didnt have much acne before I used this. But after I used it twice a week, i started to get patches of red inflamed acnes. It didnt go away for weeks!!!! I had to go to my doctor and take abtibiotics now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for three weeks (I&#x27;m using it Sundays and Wednesdays) but I have already seen a HUGE change in the texture of my skin, especially my forehead. It&#x27;s made my skin look and feel much smoother and even-toned. I love it. I have pretty sensitive skin so I mix the powder with water instead of acv, and my results are still great. I also spritz a bit of Heritage Rosewater spray into the mixture to help tame my redness.</li>
            <li> This is truly an amazing product. They don&#x27;t lie about world&#x27;s most powerful facial, I have acne problems and right after my first try my face was as smooth as of a baby. I would definately recommend this to anyone looking for that &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; face mask. :)</li>
            <li> Really does deep clean your pores! You can feel it pulsating on your skin and see the dirt it removed!</li>
            <li> This mask is AMAZING...I have extremely sensitive skin its taken me years to perfect my cleaning regimen so I&#x27;m always a little hesitant to try something new...I tried this mask and it hurt a little when it drys, you can&#x27;t really move your face and it takes about an hour to fully dry a medium thick layer. After you take it off your face will be bright red and hot...make sure you use plenty of good moisturizer after you remove the mask.&lt;br /&gt;The next day my skin looked radiant! I even got some compliments :)</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!!! I now have my niece using this and i notice a big difference in her skin. Best mixed with apple cider vinegar from the health store</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I haven&#x27;t thought of just mixing my own clay masks at home before. I am the type of person who does not like to spend a ridiculous amount of money on beauty products and I find most masks and things like that, you are paying for the brand and the pretty label. I mix this with a bit of water and it does the job just like any clay mask. Even better...my skin isn&#x27;t irritated afterwards like it is with most masks and face treatments that are full of 1000 chemicals to make it smell and look pretty. I throw one of these clay masks on and then rub coconut oil on my face while in the shower to moisturize afterwards and my skin feels amazing. Just like a day at the spa.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this about once a week, it always makes my face feel really clean and my pores seem smaller</li>
            <li> Kinda of a pain to mix it up.  Messy.</li>
            <li> nothing Secret here, buy a good scrub instead.</li>
            <li> Please make sure you dont rinse off this make in your bathroom sink as it comes off on clumps and it clogs your drain. The mask itself works well but the result is not friendly for pipes</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like it does much to my skin other than dry it out</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything to my skin,  it just dry it our really bad.  I had good hopes with this product.</li>
            <li> When it talks about feeling your skin pulse believe it, mine sure did.  I think it works well removing gunk from skin. The redness after washing it off lasted about an hour so take that into consideration when using this product.</li>
            <li> This will last me a good while. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Having used premixed clay masks for years, I always became frustrated with how they would dry up over time, some seemed to harder as soon as the lid was taken off the first time and air got inside the container.  The idea of dry granules and adding liquid at each use sounded like a promising solution.  Sadly, I found this to be extremely drying,  especially when mixed with Braggs ACV (which my face generally tolerates well as a toner) Mixed with water helped alleviate some of the dryness but not enough to comfortably continue using this product.  My face felt completely stripped and irritated.  I will probably be returning this and trying a mask that stays moist in a tube type container.</li>
            <li> i was super excited to use this product cause i love natural beauty products and face masques. i have used the st helenes mint julep masque since i was a kid and i thought this would be similar. not at all. i was almost in tears rushing to get this off my face it irritated it so bad. i was itching my face for the next hour as well. im sticking to my mint julep masque, which is still my holy grail.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It truly cleans out your pores.  Use it with a good quality apple cider and you can feel its power.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Would recommend. Skin feels and looks flawless. I am a 19 year old male and don&#x27;t have much imperfections on my face but this product has definitely made my face look better.</li>
            <li> this product is the best. recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Powerful stuff, but you have to use it correctly. To use as a mask it needs to be combined in equal parts with apple cider vinegar. The vinegar has to be a kind with the &amp;#34;mother&amp;#34; in it, like Bragg&#x27;s, and not the cheap stuff. Don&#x27;t mix with water because it won&#x27;t be the proper pH. First time users, leave it on for around ten minutes so you don&#x27;t overdo it. Even if it&#x27;s not dry yet, it&#x27;s still working. There is a very noticeable pulsing and your face will most likely be red afterwards, but it fades quickly. I wash this off in the shower as this does take a while to remove. That way I don&#x27;t have to use a washcloth which causes too much irritation. When I use this at night, I find that any active acne has significantly decreased in size and redness by morning.</li>
            <li> is a little hard to mix to a smooth consistency but is makes my skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li> I tempted to buy this due to good reviews; however, my skin broken out after used this product twice. The last time, I used it was 2 weeks ago, and I stopped it after my skin is getting worse using this product. More rashes now then before I used the product. Really regret it.</li>
            <li> Made my face break out really bad</li>
            <li> I love this mask!! I use it about every other night or a couple times a week. I mix equal parts clay and vinegar and leave it on until most of it is dry. I did have some redness the first couple times  I used it, but my skin got used to it and is now incredibly smooth. I have even taken it to a couple of my friends and they are in love with it too. Will definately be buying again when I run out.</li>
            <li> kind of a mess to work with and seriously dries out your skin but if used as a spot treatment it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Did not work. It made me break out. My overall experience with this product just was not good. My skin is really sensitive to most products. Even though it&#x27;s cheap, I will not recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is an amazing product! I will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know... Here is a review to balance out the overly inflated good reviews here on Amazon. Sorry but it seems that an acne sufferer can be susceptible to the many internet lores -products people give such praising reviews to be the holy Grail &amp;#34;acne cure&amp;#34;...  I fell for it. .. Haha&lt;br /&gt;. I wanted this to work so badly as an acne cure but it didn&#x27;t work for me. I guess that the reality is that for holistic treatments some things work for some people but not for others. I tried it for a month and nah I am worse off now.&lt;br /&gt;This mask is probably wonderful for people who don&#x27;t have an acne problem. If u have an acne problem it will make it worse -yeah maybe it&#x27;s purging but for a month or more? No thanks.&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s fair to say that this stuff does do what it says it clears yur pores... I&#x27;m just saying that it aggravated my adult acne</li>
            <li> Best product i&#x27;ve ever used &amp; i&#x27;ve tried soooo many. I saw results after one use. I can feel my face pulsating so i know my pores are being deep cleaned. I wash my face with Black Soap first then i apply the mask. Mix it with ACV!!</li>
            <li> My daughters and I swear by this. We look odd while we are wearing it, but our skin looks great when we are not.</li>
            <li> First time I used it, I saw a difference the very next day. My skin looked tighter and smoother. My pimples were hardened and dried up, less irritated. I did have red irritation minutes after i used it, but it went away. I am hoping that this clears my blemishes. So far so good tho.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin very smooth and supple!</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel super clean. I like it! However, I wouldn&#x27;t say it got rid of a lot of my pimples like some of the other reviews stated. If you do have an acne issue I highly suggest you try eliminating gluten out of your diet. I&#x27;ve had acne for almost 3 decades, but after a week of no gluten my face and arms have actually cleared! And, my eczema has even dissappeared without meds.</li>
            <li> This product cleans pores! I love it. I still think I need to use a pore strip to really pull out the black heads but the mask helps immensely. I do make sure I tone my face afterward to remove any bacteria because I broke out in acne once because I didn&#x27;t. Otherwise, my acne prone skin is clear and smooth.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Works great and arrived right on time!</li>
            <li> a great product. have been using it for many years, and love it..absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize clay was in powder form.  Personally, I prefer non-powder where you don&#x27;t have to prepare/mix to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While rinsing off, clay was clumpy and tended to crowd around the sink drain.  I was very concerned this is a drain clogger.  I mixed the powder with apple cider vinegar as instructed.  I haven&#x27;t used the product since.</li>
            <li> This clay mask has helped me a lot with my extra olily skin, specially if you use it with apple cider vinegar. I try to use it every other day at night after washing my facing and removing make-up. You need to mosturize if ater even if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin... I&#x27;m talking about you can practically fry chicken with the amount of oil my face produces after one hour of washing it.  I&#x27;m constantly blotting with oil absorbing sheets (my life savers!!!!) and I have to do this throughout the day, especially when I&#x27;m out with friends and there is a possibility photos may be taken. Having such oily skin and living in Miami, where its humid 80% of the year, doesn&#x27;t help me AT ALL! I get hormonal cystic acne breakouts when I&#x27;m really stressed on top of my regular period break outs.  Super embarrassing!! I wanted to try a new, more natural beauty routine and after doing some research, I purchased this product along with Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera, Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, and Leven Rose Jojoba Oil, Organic 100% Pure Cold Pressed Unrefined Natural.  I am so happy with my purchase! The day my products arrived I mixed the Deep pore cleansing mask with apple cider vinegar and applied to my face as a mask.  I plan on doing the mask once per week.  When I wake up and before bed, I wash my face with Aquaphor Baby Gentle Wash &amp; Tear Free Shampoo, Fragrance Free Mild Cleanser (I feel my face is just too oily to not wash with some form of soap), then I use the Thayers as a toner - focusing more on my problem areas and pimples.  After letting my face air dry, I take a very small amount (about 1/8 of a teaspoon) of the Coconut Oil and mix it with 1-2 drops of the Jojoba Oil and rub all over my face.  The oils do take a little while to absorb but once they do, my skin feels so soft and refreshed. I just started this routine 3 days ago and I am already seeing results. The pimples I had are already disappearing.  My skin tone is evening out. My face is SO much less oily and my pores are minimizing.  This morning I only had to put a small amount of BB cream and a very light amount of powder on my face (I am considering looking into home-making natural makeup as my next project). I am loving the results so far!!  I definitely recommend this product be added to your beauty routine.ct). I am loving the results so far!!  I definitely recommend this product be added to your beauty routine.</li>
            <li> Love this makes my skin so soft and no break out!!</li>
            <li> Works good! Really cleans out your pores!</li>
            <li> Amazing. I use this once a week and it keeps my skin very healthy.</li>
            <li> It does the job great. Skin feels smooth and soft after.</li>
            <li> this a must use product i use all the time to get rid of acne</li>
            <li> not seeing the results in other reviews, but good.</li>
            <li> Works better with acv, I felt a pulsation</li>
            <li> Skin feels incredibly soft after each use.</li>
            <li> I am a guy and I bought this because I use a razor to shave. I tend to get a lil bumpy on the neck under my beard. I have tried Bump Stopper and I just didn&#x27;t get the results I wanted. After one use of this, I was like wow!!!!  Cleared my neck up and even saw a difference in my face.</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff!!! Yah it smells awful but my skin glows after I am done and my black heads are nearly gone!!!</li>
            <li> Too messy to clean up in your home.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and is a fantastic product!!</li>
            <li> WORKS LIKE A CHARM, when you put it on right , you do feel a tingle so you know its working. I mix mines with water and just mix really good. idc about the clumping it still works and smooths out on your face. my pimples have gone down since using it and i have used it 3 times twice a week.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin I recommend not using this product. In the beginning I thought it was a great product, leaving my skin smooth &amp; drying (nothing that moisturizer/oil can&#x27;t fixed) but recently after applying it all over my face it was very itchy. I tried it another time and this time the itchness was unbearable!! I had to rinse it off within 3mins because I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. I have always mixed it with water &amp; it worked fine, now I can never use this product again because of the irritation. It&#x27;s really not worth all the hype.</li>
            <li> Loving the stuff! Will definitely recommend and order again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see whats the secret about this product. You use it every month or so. Nothing special about it but it does help clean your skin. You will feel a sense of tightening of the skin and maybe some redness but it goes away in a few minutes after washing.</li>
            <li> Be careful with this product if you have sensitive skin. When I removed the clay, it left a burn where the product had touched. The burn was similar to a sunburn, and took a couple of days to completely fade. It did remove impurities though.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! I used it for about 15 minutes and my face was so tightened and my face was feeling great! It does make your face pretty red for about 30-60 minutes after use. I recommend using apple cider vinegar because they mix the best and works great! I will be using this product every 3 days and I can&#x27;t wait to see how great my face looks in a month of use! You guys have to try this for $9 it can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> This stuff makes me feel pretty. I haven&#x27;t tried it with apple cider vinegar yet, YET, but when I do, I shall update. As of now, it cleans my face and my annoying pimples are annoying no longer (because they don&#x27;t exist on my face)! Love this!</li>
            <li> I was waiting for a while to write this review, to make sure I could leave the best advice/ experience/ feedback for others who are looking for something to help with their acne. To start off I never had acne until I was 21. I was one of those who would go to bed with makeup on and only wash my face when I was in the shower.  Then when I started breaking out all over my face I started trying everything I could find to work even proactive, nothing was helping or if a product was it would stop working for me. So basically where I am at now I only wash my face with water twice a day, mostly cold water, every now and again I will use warm water to open my pores then I will close them with cold water. I started using no chemicals on my face except occasionally makeup( if I have to) on June 17th, I also did this mask with Apple cider vinegar, I used once a day 4 days in a row. The mask really helped at first, but I kept breaking out, so I went down to using it twice a week. For some reason I felt like I still wasnt reaping the benefits like everyone else had b/c I was still breaking out after using it. So then I tried using this mask with water and only doing it once a week, that helped a lot! I was able to go a couple weeks with no breakout. It is July 31st and this is my regimen now and this is what is working for me. I get maybe a pimple or two now around my cycle time and that&#x27;s it! no more chemicals on my face it took a while for my face to get used to it but it is worth it. If you want to know more just Google the caveman method, although I didn&#x27;t go without putting water on my face because I want to be able to splash my face before I go to bed or after I wake up, like my boyfriend does and he doesn&#x27;t have any pimples. Just think about it, our faces are freaking out b/c were putting unnatural things on them which absorbs in the body and bloodstream, and the face is only trying to fight the invaders similar to how white blood cells react. So I dunno I&#x27;m not a professional this is only a theory, and what only makes sense to me, so hopefully this will help others out too. Bottomline is I will keep using this mask with just splashing water on my face. It isn&#x27;t a miracle product but it does great for tightening things and acne scarring, and the best part is it&#x27;s all natural.ional this is only a theory, and what only makes sense to me, so hopefully this will help others out too.

            <li> I have done a number of masks but this is the first one where I felt the change in skin as soon as I put it on! I have very oily skin. Mostly in my t-zone area. But since I&#x27;ve popped open my Aztec Clay, no more oily skin and no more enlarged pores!!! It is hands down the best product I&#x27;ve EVER purchased for my face. And it is soooo much product as well. It will last me forever. If you use it with apple cider vinegar, it kicks it up a notch (doesn&#x27;t smell great) but gets the job done! I also heard this does wonders on your natural hair, but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet!</li>
            <li> The best product for you face! I have tried alot of products but this one omg, i am so happy buying this. Fast shipping and great cuality. Just a smoll amount and it&#x27;s enaught.</li>
            <li> It helped my skin but it can leave it red for a few hours!</li>
            <li> I love this product...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that you had to mix it to make the face mask, but mixing it isn&#x27;t too much of a hassle and it gets the job done. Will be buying again!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. But you have to use apple cider vinegar, it&#x27;s a must. It turns out really bad if you use water don&#x27;t even try it I promise it&#x27;s worth driving down to the store to buy apple cider vinegar (I use braggs).</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to minimize pores and came across this product, I really didn&#x27;t think much of it at first until I read some reviews and went on U tube. So i made the purchase and I am so glad i did, Yes it does work....My skin looks amazing my pores are much smaller and i only used it one time so far. A very very happy customer.</li>
            <li> Clay draws up so tight I literally looked like I had cellulite on my face lol. I used the apple cider vinegar and it does tingle and feel awesome. There was a review who suggested mixing it in a sandwich baggie then turning it inside out to put it on.... do that!!  No mess that way! You could seriously build a house with this stuff it hardens that much so you know it&#x27;s definitely suckling all the dirt and oil out of your skin!! And yes you will break out after the first use, it is drawing everything up and out. Keep using it and you will have super tight, clean, clear skin.</li>
            <li> Works really good I use it for my face and as a hair treatment. It leaves my hair soft and its easier to detangle. This is a great product</li>
            <li> I noticed my skin clearing up after using this, and it&#x27;s always good when I need a deep clean. It did nothing for my scarring though like everyone says it would. Leaves face red but only overnight it&#x27;s fine in the morning. Really like this product and I&#x27;ve made it a part of my skin care</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff. I mix it with apple cider vinegar, and sometimes honey, and it has been great. Does as it says it will. Will be purchasing again once I run out.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to help my acne and overall texture of my skin. I read the reviews and was optimistic at all the positive results. well i&#x27;ve been using it for almost two weeks (with apple cider vinegar) and my skin looks much worse than before i started it. i have more breakouts and my acne scars look much worse. if you want to clear your acne do not buy this.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think anything would work on my terrible acne I&#x27;ve had on my neck for over 3 years.  Dermatologist couldn&#x27;t give me anything that would remedy my extreme acne.  I am so grateful I found this product, it is God sent.  So far I have been acne free for one month and that has not happened in over 3 years.  I use it twice a week and shower to rinse.  See a picture of how bad my acne WAS :-)</li>
            <li> Seriously pulls all the gunk out of your skin. I use organic apple cider vinegar to mix for an extra kick and I use the mask every night, but if you have sensitive skin, start off using water to mix it and only using it twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;This thing is the main reason my skin is clearing up. It&#x27;s not an overnight miracle(life lesson,  nothing is) so give it a week or two and you will see astonishing results.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive/dry mostly but it also has a tendency to pimple. Especially at the sides of my face and forehead area. I have to be REALLY careful with the products I put on my face because some can cause a weird rash/dry skin reaction and some can break me out so I have to balance it all out. This is so good because, when you put water in it, you can feel it drying your skin and I love it (i have to put a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t clog my pores immediately afterwards). However, I put virgin olive oil in it the other (I didn&#x27;t have Apple Cider Vinegar or any other oil) and it was soooo moisturizing! My skin feels super soft and it wasn&#x27;t even that expensive! Never buying another mask again! I love its versatility and I can&#x27;t wait to try it with ACV and other mixes to see what it does</li>
            <li> This did nothing for my face. I&#x27;ve been using it with ACV and I don&#x27;t see any difference whatsoever. Maybe my skin is too sensitive for this.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff as after I use it, my pores are smaller and face feels clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> I use this product about once a week. It doesn&#x27;t take long to make, I mix mine with just warm water.I leave it on until it completely dries and then I take a shower to remove it. After my shower I use a moisturizer. I have sensitive skin and red or peeling skin is something I often have to think about. I haven&#x27;t had any of those issues with this product at all.  I would recommend this product for anyone to try out. I plan to buy more from amazon when I finish this product.</li>
            <li> It works pretty much how everyone else on here describes. I love it.</li>
            <li> I guess I don&#x27;t use this as much as I should, it does feel really nice on your face, but i didn&#x27;t seem to have much of a change when I was using this product.</li>
            <li> I use this because I take biotin and I heard it clears acne so I got my biotin first and started to get acne and then I decided to buy this after I heard about it on trusper and I received it after 2-3 weeks later on and I make a thin-thickish paste and put it on my face and I was amazed how I saw results after 1 use but after awhile my face starts to get more oily and my face is already oily I would say stick to this when your face Is dry or for your winter face care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming back at yall again-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a dark spot (I picked a pimple)😩 and it wasn&#x27;t going away so I decided to use the Indian healing clay and see what it does for me so I mixed 2 tablespoons of the clay with 5 tablespoons on baking soda and water (I didn&#x27;t have exact measurements of water) and then I applied it to my face for 20-30 minute and I could already see results after I rinsed it off my face. Now to remind you I have oily skin and this has made my face oily so after 4-8 hours I just exfoliated my skin that way it wouldn&#x27;t look oily and ill continue to use this for 3-4 days and any other day I feel like I want to give myself a spa day.</li>
            <li> Not bad. It did leave my skin feeling soft but made my skin peel. I have only used it once. Maybe after a couple more times the peeling will stop.</li>
            <li> This product is great at reducing my active acne.&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin so this really helped dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> I do not care for this clay, I have a better one I ordered around the same time. I don&#x27;t like the way it mixes up.</li>
            <li> This clay mask is probably one of the best I&#x27;ve tried.... it really provides a deep cleanse.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Mixing is a little unappealing because I like no fuss cosmetics.  But the product is as claimed so how can I not give it 5 stars and besides...the price is right.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work with my acne, and made it worse..</li>
            <li> I have large pores that get clogged often so I wanted to try this. However, after a few uses I noticed little difference in my clogged pores.  I get better results from a healthy diet and apricot scrub.</li>
            <li> Within two applications people were asking me what I was using. Great stuff. Cheap. Love it</li>
            <li> Only used it once and did not notice any difference in my skin and pores. I should really give it more time before I rate.  It is very messy and hard to come off.</li>
            <li> Love love love. It works great, clears my pores and my face feels fresh. Would buy again its a very good face mask.</li>
            <li> This stuff works like magic! use with acv and raw honey! :)</li>
            <li> It will clean your pores but it will defenetly not cure your acne at all. (Tried acnee free for 1 month and it was way better).&lt;br /&gt;If you have 1-2 pimples I would get this. But for teenage skin(a lot of acne) I wouldn&#x27;t get this product. Its absolutely useless for that.</li>
            <li> in looooooove and its too much i think its last for 100 time of use</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product 6 months ago by a coworker who gave me a cupful of the clay it lasted quite a while. I just recently went out and purchased a pound from a local Whole Foods. I always mix it with ACV I love the pulsing and tugging it does on the skin it really lets you know that its drawing out  those impurities. it leaves my skin soft and clean my pores are really small afterwards although the skin is red its very temporary. from time to time after use I will notice a couple of tiny whiteheads surface but nothing to complain about the clay is just drawing out what would have come to surface eventually. as for the bad reviews I think those people are just putting too much faith in one topical product it&#x27;s not a cure for acne its a mask to draw out impurities if you want to clear up your acne you would need to first figure out what&#x27;s causing the acne in the first place most acne is internal it could be hormonal, bacterial, digestive system out of whack, liver being overworked ect. My acne is hormonal and currently I have it about 85% under control and I have faith that it will only get better. I started using a Estrogen metabolism supplement (diindolylmethane) to balance out my hormones about 2 1/2 weeks ago along with the clay mask. I would recommend this clay to anyone acne  or not it&#x27;s a great mask to use a couple of times a week it definitely helps improve the complexion but if you&#x27;re an acne sufferer you definitely want to look at more internal things.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. I use it with ACV and my skin is clearing up. It does make me peel, but sometimes that is what it takes for clear soft skin.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I have used better masks but this mask does a great job with reducing large pores. YOU MUST USE THE APPLE CIDER VINEGAR or else it won&#x27;t mix well not work well at all. I tried it once with water and it clumped but when I used the apple cider vinegar it fizzed and mixed beautifully. So beware of the directions because you&#x27;ll get an oatmeal consistency with the water but a smooth mixture with the vinegar. it does smell awful but it does tingle, it does pull your skin and it cleans your pores. I liked it a lot. Good luck.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the high volume of high-rated reviews and thought I would put this up against Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque. In my eyes this product failed miserably and I now have a container of this stuff that sooner or later will end up in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, this is a powder that needs to be mixed. I knew this going in, but want this to be clear to those that might not have realized. Being a powder you need to mix the appropriate parts, otherwise it will be too thick or too thin. The instructions say you can use water or vinegar, I chose water and had a hard time mixing and getting rid of the clumps. After several minutes of mixing I gave up and just started applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incidentally, the tingly and pulsating comments by others is very valid. I noticed the sensation as the product started to dry. It gave me a glimpse of hope, thinking that all the prep work would be worth it and become some magical potion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinsing off the product is much more difficult than the product I was comparing it to and was annoyingly stubborn. It did not &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; well and resulted in clogging my sink drain because the clumps where small enough to make it past the sink stop but collected somewhere in the pipe. I had to snake my drain after to get proper flow back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would not recommend this product. I gave it 2 stars because it does seem to have some benefit of usage, however the cost (monetary and residual) will keep me away. My original choice will remain my go-to product as I am happy with it, just figured I would try this one out because of its popularity. If you have not tried Queen Helene Mint Julep Masque, its worth a shot. Its easy to apply, easier to remove (can still be a bit difficult at times), does not clog the drain and can be had at a local drug store if you cannot wait for it to be shipped through amazon.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it cleared my face almost completely. Also the delivery was quick and fast. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that my face dried up a little after using it.</li>
            <li> I baught this with intentions of getting rid of acne scars, which I don&#x27;t have many, and blackheads on the nose area. And it does exactly that. I use it twice a week, so far it&#x27;s been 3 weeks and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference. I should probably use it more but it&#x27;s kinda a long process for as busy as I am. Any who has ance, acne scars, blackheads or age spots should definitely try this product. also, you only need a very little bit. So this tub should last about 9 months to a year. Great for the price.</li>
            <li> So messy!!!! and a pain to mix. Other than that, it seems to do the job. I don&#x27;t feel any pulsating but it does feel wonderful on your skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. I got it as a present a few months ago, and even though I only use it once or twice every other week, it&#x27;s done wonders. My acne was moderate/severe and when I paired this mask with monthly facials, I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference (even without the facials, I&#x27;m sure this product would still do wonders). Even if you&#x27;re not suffering from acne, this mask has many benefits and I recommend it for everyone to try!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and it has cleared my skin up dramatically. I have been struggling with acne for years and as a woman especially with pre-menstrual breakouts. Normally my skin would breakout all around my chin area, after using the mask about every other day for the first couple of weeks I have maybe 3 pimples on my face. Right now I am about to start my cycle and I still only have a couple of pimples on my face that are barley noticeable. I have tried so many non-prescription and prescription medications- this is the only thing that has really cleared my skin.</li>
            <li> I spent some time in the hospital, and I came out with some clogged pores. I used this once a week, and within 3 weeks my pores were smaller. My skin looks really, really nice. I have use all manner of expensive skin care, and the quality of this product is great! The only draw back is that it is not exactly easy to use.</li>
            <li> This face mask is highly rated and I decided to give it a try. I have combination skin probe to acne and blackheads. I used the mask as directed with apple cider vinegar for about 5 months weekly. Did not see any significant improvement. The mask is very hard to wash off and clogged my skin. It also doesn&#x27;t smell very good and made my skin dry.</li>
            <li> I use this mask like clockwork once a week, it deep cleans my pores and tightens my skin. I also use Skingenixx Face Cleanser [[ASIN:B00VSF4T26 Skingenixx Complete Exfoliating Facial Cleanser!]] and Moisturizer [[ASIN:B00VSCKY1E Skingenixx Hyaluronic Acid Facial Moisturizer.]]. I have been doing this as part of my routine in the morning and at night. My skin looks fantastic, no clogged pores and my skin is healthier, more vibrant and glowing! Add these to your skin care routine and in a few weeks you should see amazing results.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I use it with ACV and make a pasts until the consistency is even and then put it on my face for 15 or 20 minutes. It clears out my pores and leaves my skin radiant. It does get tight so be aware that it really, really tightens the skin and takes some time to wash off. It is a great mask!</li>
            <li> its better than a facial!! For sur! Love love it!!!</li>
            <li> Left my face really soft!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product..it makes your skin very soft and reduces the pores. If you are looking for black head removal, this may not be the right product...at least it did not work for me. Anyway, you can feel the difference using for few times..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dude; been using this stuff pretty much once every two weeks. Feels great and works well. Skin looks nice and clear. In case it&#x27;s important I&#x27;ve been using this product with apple cider vinegar (with the mother).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as complaints about clogging your drains, I probably don&#x27;t use it enough for that to happen, but to take the side of caution I always wash it off slowly with hot water and follow it with a dash a drain cleaner in the sink/shower. No problems here.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I have had mild acne on my face since middle school (I&#x27;m 24 now) and since I started using this my acne is gone. I only get about one or two pimples once a month right before I get my period (you know how it is, ladies).  Thats it!  Its pretty strong and will leave your face red for a little while afterwards, but my face has never been softer or clearer.  It works way better when you use it with apple cider vinegar than water.  The water is harder to mix and it ends up being clumpy, but the vinegar makes it glide right on.&lt;br /&gt;I use it about once a week and always make sure I use a (heavier) moisturizer afterward.  Love it!</li>
            <li> My name is Ali.R I have had pimples and a bit of acne on the side of my face since I was 13.its almost gone just after 3 weeks..I recieved a lb.and begun mixing a bit of water and 3 tea spoons of clay.mix til its smooth no clumps.mix honey or substitute the water with green tea for a more delicate clean.and remove with warm water only!!let the clay dry til its hard,perfectly cleeaaann.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Indian Healing Clay because of the great reviews it had.  I was not even in the market of purchasing anything like this.  It popped up as something reccomended for me.  I ordered it and have used it twice.  I like it so far. You do break out a little at first but that is expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive. Last for months (depending on how often you use it). While its on your face you can feel your pores tightening up.  This is some great stuff!!</li>
            <li> So far i&#x27;m loving the results. I have mild acne and sensitive skin. I noticed this really matters when your applying this product because it can cause an opposite effect if you don&#x27;t use it the right way. I started using the product every two days and leaving it for 20 minutes, and I started to breakout really bad but my skin felt soft so I still wanted to give the product a try and kept using it but now I now I use it every 4 to 5 days and only for ten minutes and it began to clear off my acne instead of breaking out ! so it really depends o the severity of your acne to how you should use the product. Also, I use it with hot water and use a sandwich bag to apply it on my face because it is much easier.</li>
            <li> A great product, even after one use it has made my skin feel softer and smoother. I would recommend mixing with the apple cider vinegar as it has a better consistency and easier to put on your face. Water, however, takes a long time to get that cream-like/batter-like mixture. The vinegar is also good for those with acne. The smell isnt great but you&#x27;ll b happy with the results! LOVE LOVE LOVE this &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this mask very long but I&#x27;ve used it once a week for the past 2 weeks and you can definitely feel your face tightening while using this product, I have yet to notice a drastic change in my skin but I do notice that my face is brighter after using.</li>
            <li> Use it as a facial mask with ACV and activated charcoal, works wonders for the face!</li>
            <li> A very fine, soft, odorless powder meant to be mixed with water or vinegar. I&#x27;ve used this product three times, once on a wasp sting, once on eczema, and once as a pore cleaning mask.  I&#x27;m grateful for the very detailed reviews with instructions here, they are spot-on.  It worked fine on all three applications, and I used it with equal parts apple cider vinegar to clay powder.  A very natural and inexpensive product, just be careful not to clog up your drains when washing it off.</li>
            <li> I used it once, and it made my current acne worse, I redness on my face that would not go away and it irritated my skin. I have been breaking out badly for the last week and I cannot pinpoint if it was because of this mask, or because of some antibiotics that I&#x27;m taking for cellulitis that sprang up on my foot, coincidentally, the same day I used the mask. I don&#x27;t know what to do, my face has never been this bad.</li>
            <li> I am very happy for using this product my acne and blackhead gone down.&lt;br /&gt; I have used oxy, clean&amp;clear and non of them works like this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ pro&lt;br /&gt;-works great&lt;br /&gt;-product not expensive&lt;br /&gt;-have a smooth skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-cons&lt;br /&gt;-takes time&lt;br /&gt;-if u use vinger with the product the room you are staying in will smell like vinger ( i sometime prefer to use water because it does not smell)&lt;br /&gt;-hard to take off ( so you will need to shower after every use because it comes off easier when you shower)</li>
            <li> It does leave your face feeling pretty clean. I do the face mask once a week, but you do have to mosturize afterward!! Would recommend. I have yet to try with apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> Making homemade masks is so easy! This is such a fine powder, it goes on so smooth.  I haven&#x27;t mixed the clay with vinegar as suggested on the tub (I&#x27;m afraid my skin might be a bit sensitive for such an intense treatment).  Rather, I am mixing the clay with castor oil and a couple drops of oil of oregano (for my hormonal acne) and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, fast shipping and great value for money. Comes in large tub and the powder you mix with water or vinegar will last a long time.</li>
            <li> The Aztec Secret is AMAZING!!!! A few pros/cons though....Pros- my face feels absolutely amazing and extremely soft afterwards! Cons- this stuff is a mess to work with. It&#x27;s a chalky dry substance you have to mix with water. Make sure to use a plastic bowl and spoon to stir the mixture. Apply to your desired area right away. I tried my best to stir the mixture as well as possible, but it would still be a bit clumpy when I applied it to my face. However, this stuff definitely does the job! Once the clay starts to dry your face will feel very tight and maybe a bit itchy in some places, but this is not excessive or unbearable. I usually like to use this healing clay on my days off. I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I am using this in Asia. My face gets really oily in this hot-humid season. I apply this pack at night and wash off after 10 minutes. It seems to keep the oiliness away for a few hours. The nose blackheads also go get pulled out by this one.</li>
            <li> I saw some results after the first use! My face felt smoother and tighter. I have used it about 4 or 5 times by now and my skin has a glow to it. Love this product!  Don&#x27;t worry if after the first few times if you might get a few pimples it&#x27;s cleaning everything out and bringing it to the surface..</li>
            <li> Love this mask! I use it almost every day. I&#x27;ve struggled with acne since adolescence and this is the only non-prescription product that works for me. I apply the mask at night for 15 minutes, wash it off and then apply it to any acne or hyperpigmentation spots that I have and let it dry overnight. Use it with apple cider vinegar for best results.</li>
            <li> this stuff has made my skin seriously amazing. it feels great and really tightens your pores. The only bad thing about it is it&#x27;s really hard to get off if you put it on too thick. otherwise I love it!</li>
            <li> My face feels so good after I use this. It does the job well.  Cleans and shrinks pours very well</li>
            <li> So, I watched a youtube video of a young African-American lady using this product in her hair, as well as her face and throat, and she looked AMAZING afterwards (including her hair)!  For the price, I decided why not give it a try.....I LOVE IT!  A little goes a long way and the tingling sensation you feel on your face is pretty cool.  I LOVE the way my face feels when I wash it off!  I combine honey and lemon in with the mask sometimes, and it still works great.  I am hooked on this product and will use it as long as I can get it from now on!</li>
            <li> Im a male of tthe human specoes and after one day of use my human female mating partner said that my facial skin tissue apeared younger including smaller pores.</li>
            <li> Clay is good for detoxing hair and skin I use it mostly on my hair with a mixture of acv. Followed by a deep conditioner I feel the difference each time although I only do this once a month</li>
            <li> Love the product.  A must try</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t worked as described even with vinegar.</li>
            <li> Perfect with epsom salt and apple cider vinegar as a detox bath.</li>
            <li> Love love love!!! This stuff is amazing. If you&#x27;re looking for a great face mask, look no further. It cleanses your pores and leaves your skin feeling so clean. I will use this for the rest of my life! (Though it doesn&#x27;t smell very pleasant)</li>
            <li> Great product and seller</li>
            <li> Nothing of what it claims to be doing. I asked for a refund!</li>
            <li> This is my first review after using amazon for years. I have huge pores and a deep rooted whiteheaded pimple that wouldn&#x27;t come out. Estheticians have tried to get it out, I&#x27;ve tried to get it out, nothing worked. After two uses of this clay, my pores have shrunk significantly and my pimple rose to the top and came out! I was amazed. This clay is INCREDIBLE and I would recommend it to everyone. Seriously, try it!</li>
            <li> Must have facial at home</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given this product a few weeks but it breaks me out EVERY TIME. I know it works for most people but it didn&#x27;t bode well with my sensitive combination skin.</li>
            <li> Like make your face feel good</li>
            <li> Amazing.  I was pretty skeptical about using this as shampoo.  I mix with equal parts of apple cider vinegar and apply to my hair, root to tip and leave on for 30 minutes.  I use the remaining clay mix as a facial mask.  This mask is no joke.  Your face can&#x27;t move.  My hair is 3C and very dry.  My hair is baby soft and retains so much moisture after washing with the clay.  I broke up with shampoo after one use.  I will have to use my expensive name brand tea tree shampoo as a body wash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very clean pure powder and the apple vinegar recommended below taste like crap but its very good when mixing with the aztec powder.</li>
            <li> My teenager loves it!</li>
            <li> I Finally found a mask that works on my pores. No more break-outs or large pores.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff. I bought it in the wake of seeing all the five star reviews and likewise having heard incredible things about it from a friend who has awesome skin. I&#x27;m a skincare addict and have purchased/attempted a few different mud masks at the end of the day return to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I blend even parts apple vinegar and this in a glass bowl then blend it in with a brush. I leave it until dry and by then I am ready to take it off! The tingling feeling it comforts me that it is doing its job well. Without a doubt feel like my face gets detoxed and when I take it off my face is pretty red. That goes on for 20-30 minutes and I know my skin is being restored. Subsequent to flushing it off I utilize Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel and Rosewater toner I got off of amazon too and follow up with an additional hydrating cream. (I use Keihl&#x27;s).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it 6-10x each month relying upon how my face is getting along with hormonal breakouts or the intermittent pimple. It does force everything to the surface and detox your face so you may see new pimple development subsequently yet it&#x27;s simply because it is evacuating pimples which were becoming at any rate. On the off chance that you use it again the day after it will help keep your skin clear. Five stars!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very refreshing but I use pronexin now which worked a lot better for me</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any different after several weeks of use... it&#x27;s just a scam I think.</li>
            <li> I mix this about 60% clay to 40% apple cider vinegar. My skin becomes noticeably clearer for a few days after use. I have not experienced any negative reactions to the product like some have, and my skin is usually very sensitive. While it doesn&#x27;t smell very pleasant I use it before hopping in the shower and the smell doesn&#x27;t linger at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way for this product. I&#x27;d get enough to cover my face and neck with about 3-4 tablespoons of powder mixed with vinegar. Like most good things this will take a bit of time on your part to work properly. I recommend trying it mixed with apple cider vinegar first, and if that&#x27;s too much you can certainly use water. Highly recommend anyone try this out. It&#x27;ll surely become part of your regimen.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand what the fuss is about. :S</li>
            <li> Okay people you really are buying dirt from Amazon with this product. LOL! I read several reviews before purchasing this and listened to many recommendations. First whoever said use of baggie to mix and apply this was a genius. Put the product in the baggie agger water mix it up with the baggie over your hand inside out and rubbed the mask on your face after you covered your face turned the baggie right side out and put it in the trash. this is the least amount of mess. I might should worry about the clay clogging the pipes, but I really just use a super warm washcloth to remove the mask and let it drain down the sink. I haven&#x27;t had any issues so far. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend putting large chunks for cakey pieces of the mask down the drain. Now onto the mask itself: when this mask states that you can feel the pulse it is not exaggerating. You can feel the pull of the clay as it dries on your skin. You definitely know you&#x27;re getting a deep cleansing with this mask on. I also use the facial steamer in conjunction with this mask to ensure that my pores are not clogged whatsoever.</li>
            <li> What I would expected from a green clay.  Use it for clay hair masks.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff. A little goes a long way. Apple cider vinegar does wonders mixed with this.</li>
            <li> I love this mask! It makes my skin feel brand new! Soft and smooth. It also helps with my 17 year old son&#x27;s breakouts!</li>
            <li> love love love this mask</li>
            <li> Real good mask helps with oily skin. Works well when using apple cider vinegar. Read instructions before use and use at night time since face becomes red. Helps with prevention of black heads. Some reviewers said that helps with acne but I don&#x27;t agree, it does help prevent pores from clogging but if you have severe acne or get frequent cystic pimples this does not prevent them at all. It is a good facial clay.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mask for a bout a week now. The first time I used it, I combined the clay with organic apple cider vinegar, and found that it was a bit too strong-smelling for me. The other times I have used it (total of 3 times so far), I combined the clay with some water, a splash of ACV, some tea tree oil and Vitamin C capsule (broken apart), and I really like that combination. I mix all the ingredients together in a little plastic baggy, massage it all around, and scoop out the necessary amount from there. The clay goes on very smoothly and is refreshing on the face. I felt a little tingling sensation, probably from the added stuff, that was very nice. I let the clay dry on my face and upper portion of neck for about 15 minutes, until dry, and then washed off with warm water and a cloth towel. It tends to be a little difficult to get off the face, but that&#x27;s clay for you, and the result is a squeaky clean face. I follow this mask with cleanser and moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the product--I think there is a lot of the clay inside the jar to last a long time. I like the improvement in my skin texture after only one week of using it, and plan to continue using it religiously. The only reason for 4 stars is the price on Amazon--I happened to stop by a natural good store nearby 2 days ago and found it for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice, don&#x27;t really see what all the hype is but maybe I have to use it more regularly. It did feel like my face was totally drawn up when it was drying, kinda weird feeling but good, like it was tightening everything but who knows if after you rinse it off it actually tightens anything. It did help with drying out a pimple that was starting to form underneath the skin..i guess.</li>
            <li> Instantly i noticed a difference. My face is clearer no new breakout thank the heavens. I have used it for two weeks and I will never be without it again.</li>
            <li> We have used this for spa, and first aide I love this product - and it is natural. Love it love it love it.</li>
            <li> So far I like it. Though the smell with the apple cider can be overwhelming it feels great on my face. I use it once a week in place of my normal cleanser. It is messy and little annoying to wash off face however I have seen a difference in my face and really enjoy using this. I will buy this again once I run out.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff, it&#x27;s just really hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> I missed the fact that you need to buy other product to make this work.</li>
            <li> I used it 3 times since I had it. It makes my face itch really bad. My skin is a little sensative. I can really say what it does other than dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it, my face feeling much softer, brighter, I do this facial once a week its great</li>
            <li> i like it good for stretch marks too!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this facial. It is a bit of a hassle getting it off but is well worth it! My face feels like a baby&#x27;s bottom after taking it off. You do look like an alligator as the facial starts to dry and crack due to facial movements. Great for improving facial skin health.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! My face never felt so clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this.  My pores are shrinking!</li>
            <li> I love this mask! I mix it with Apple Cider Vinegar and use it at least once a week. It has really helped with my acne scars and that is the biggest reason I love this mask!</li>
            <li> This did live up to the hype and my skin looked much better after using it only once but I did not feel the pulsating feeling that was claimed (maybe I didn&#x27;t use enough).  A good manual for the specifics of using this clay would have been more beneficial, as in measurements for a face mask and some tips for blending the clay with water.  I had a huge mess the first couple of tries at cleaning up the tools I used as it gets very hard to blend the second you add water.  I found a helpful website about other uses for this clay and the foot detox, as weird as I thought it was, actually made me feel better-who knew!</li>
            <li> Love this product:) would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I got his for my teenage children that get occasional break out of acne. When they use this as directed it really seems to work great</li>
            <li> I ADORE THIS STUFF. Got this clay mask on the recommendation of a few friends who had used it. My skin is very sensitive, to the point where acne cleaners dry it out until it cracks and anything moisturizing makes me break out. This stuff is a miracle worker.&lt;br /&gt;I used it with apple cider vinegar (you can use water if you want) and put it on my very wrecked skin. I saw results immediately after, and the next morning my breakout had healed dramatically. The boyfriend uses it too to get rid of blackheads, and his skin is soft and smooth after he uses it.&lt;br /&gt;Best part? About a tablespoon of the stuff will make an entire, thick, face mask, so I can see this lasting a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy again!!</li>
            <li> Good buy.. Need more actually...</li>
            <li> Just did my first treatment--really like this stuff. Definitely will be using every week...my skin looks different--it&#x27;s got a little shine and glow to it. I&#x27;m also amazed at how quickly it shrunk the pores on my face.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know that you have to mix it with water yourself which is my only negative. Other wise it works awesome!</li>
            <li> Okay so I cant really say it works...I havent really seen a difference. But then again, ive been slacking on it. But when I first tried it on my sister she said i worked really good.  But I do love how it really tightens your face....P.S. dont leave it on toooo long cause it will leave your face red! I suggest doing it in the evening. I also suggest rinsing the mask off with a big bowl of water OUTSIDE, (ive read from reviews that it clogs drains) so I just rinse it outside and throw the water on the grass so I can avoid that problem cause Giiiirrrrlllll it does not dissolve very well. But I like it! Ill try to be more presistant with it!</li>
            <li> Just got it last night (:&lt;br /&gt;I already love it !!</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for years, ever since I read cleopatra used to use bentonite clay masks. It works wonders, like a mini facelift! I actually use this as part of my diy facial routine. I&#x27;m a woman of color with normal skin if this helps anyone</li>
            <li> Initial breakout for 2 week but after suffering through that my skin feels and looks great. Enough said. Will keep buying but from a different source that is cheaper.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling soft after the first use. I suggest mixing it with Apple cider vineger</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of money and I didn&#x27;t have to. This stuff is unbelievable.i don&#x27;t think my face has ever in 62 years been so clean !&lt;br /&gt;And now when I put creams on my face after this...they feel great. Probably because they are being used on clean skin.</li>
            <li> Works very well and is super fun to use. Although it is a bit tough to get everything off. It really helps with my acne and replenishes my skin. But make sure to use moisturizer after because it does dry out your face (which is good for acne) I recommend this product because it is so great.</li>
            <li> Recieved item! Great Product! Try it you will love it.</li>
            <li> Seems to work, but not like the reviews state.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to use this product because of all the great reviews. I had horrible acne growing up and now even in my 30&#x27;s. Unfortunately I have been breaking out horribly from it. I am hoping it is just getting all the junk out of my skin but I&#x27;m not sure. I&#x27;ve been mixing it with water maybe I&#x27;ll try it with apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty amazing. I have really horrible acne on my chin and t-zone area, and within one use they dried up and started to go away. I used it again the next day on my chin and they just disappeared! It was kind of hard to wash off but I think that was my fault because I didn&#x27;t use enough water. I gave it four stars because I was hoping it would help with my blackheads that I have literally all over my face, but it didn&#x27;t really seem to do much. Maybe with time it will go away though. Great product!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff really does do the job in cleaning your pores! It&#x27;s amazing. I used it on my hubby who has large pores and you can see them clogged...but after the mask his skin is super smooth and clean. It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> I have not seen any improvement yet...</li>
            <li> This mask is great! I use the apple cider vinegar and it really makes a difference in my skin. It says to do a very thick layer but if you want it to dry and don&#x27;t have all day, thinner is better.</li>
            <li> I love this face mask, it helps to keep my acne at bay while helping to keep my pores clear.  It isn&#x27;t a miracle worker, but as a part of my skin care regime, it has worked really well.  Be careful not to leave it on too long, or it may dry out your skin and cause some mild irritation.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for my face. And, my face have only  dark marks on my chin and cheeks. I hate that I have to finish this awful clay.</li>
            <li> This clay is like playing in the mud as a child! It has a great feel when applied. it drys hard -like so be prepared to work getting it off . once off my skin felt clean and free of any grime or old makeup. It is TRUELY a mud facial in a jar!</li>
            <li> Only used twice so far, but so far so good! Definitely feel the &amp;#34;pulsing&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is a really amazing clay mask. I mixed 1 tablespoon of the clay w/ 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and it yielded enough stuff for myself and my roommate! My skin felt and looked GREAT after.</li>
            <li> has helped clear up an acne problem I have had all my life. great product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any improvement in acne.</li>
            <li> Super messy and hard to mix</li>
            <li> People posting reviews and saying &amp;#34;not a miracle product&amp;#34; are just impatient and comparable to people that live a sedentary lifestyle and get mad when they aren&#x27;t skinny after working out twice. I got this stuff and have been using it for a week and already see and feel a tremendous difference. Things for our skin/physical appearance take time...and this is one everyone should wait out the time for!!! I will swear by this for many years to come.</li>
            <li> This facial mask is awesome!!! My skin feels so soft and clear. The price is great! I definitely recommend it and I would buy it again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a believer. After one use, my skin in brighter and my pores are CLEAN and TIGHT. Forget about expensive pore creams, acne treatments that won&#x27;t work... This stuff works and is amazing!! I love this stuff!! It&#x27;s changed my whole appearance. It&#x27;s drying, so I suggest a moisturizer afterwards. I felt like while the mask was on my face pulsates in a good way. It felt strange while washing it off, but afterwards.. Smooth skin!! I&#x27;ve used so many acne treatments.. This is the only one worth it.</li>
            <li> This does major wonders for my hair, skin, and teeth! From youtube and pint rest tutorials I was able to use this product with multiple uses. Mainly, I use this once or twice a week as a facial mask. And I also use it as a shampoo or deep condition hair mask once in a while.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It takes everything off your face like you will feel like a brand new person! If you have oily skin like me you need this!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to make homemade toothpaste. One year later, I still have about 1.5 inches left. Great product for making a very healthy, mouth friendly DIY Earthpaste.</li>
            <li> The best face mask I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I have only had a chance to use this once so far, but I&#x27;m already wondering why in the world I&#x27;ve been paying as much as I have for GlamGlow, Arbonne and other masks that don&#x27;t do nearly as much as this one does in one use. Yes, it is very messy and a little difficult to mix but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet with the apple cider vinegar, only water. But my 40 something face felt like a baby&#x27;s bottom after one 20 minute application, with visibly clearer skin and the glow I&#x27;d been missing for the last several months. My new beauty staple!</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!!!! I am a 27 year old African American woman who has had and still has trouble with acne and enlarged pores and this stuff really gets in and gives you a deep cleaning! I use it about 3x/week and it has really made a difference in my skin! Use the ACV to mix it and don&#x27;t make too much because you just end up wasting it, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Great product. I saw results after my first use.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper to make my own mask out of the same ingredients used in the expensive tubes of clay mask.  And I can add my own ingredients - LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> served the purpose quite well</li>
            <li> I have oily clogged skin prone to breakouts. This has not only helped the current breakouts but has helped prevent some. LOVE</li>
            <li> This needs to be mixed with water, only takes a small amount. Will last forever!</li>
            <li> This product is incredible! Rachel Zoe had tweeted about it so I figured I would give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;I was completely shocked how much my skin was glowing!  If you are contemplating this product, get it!</li>
            <li> Wash clean and not stimulate the skin. can i write Chinese?</li>
            <li> Please buy this product.  It is so good.</li>
            <li> Only used once so far.  But it seemed to help my face feel cleaner.f</li>
            <li> Love it will order again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not quite sure what to think about this clay. I used it a handful of times and didn&#x27;t really see any results at all. The last time I used it, my skin (on face) broke out in a TERRIBLE rash. I stopped using it. I have, however, heard wonderful things about this clay...Maybe it just wasn&#x27;t meant to be :(</li>
            <li> Its ok&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have severe acne in the first place, So my review is not the best bet&lt;br /&gt;I hardly use it</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING.  It does everything it claims to do.  It brighten my skin and removed all dirt from my skin.  I used this product the day before a presentation and even my professor was complimenting me on my skin.  This product is going to take me forever to use up, that is to say,  a little goes a long way.  I&#x27;ve used this product with apple cider vinegar.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works quite well and leaves the skin feeling super clean and soft</li>
            <li> Most awesome facial I&#x27;ve ever paid for or given myself</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair as well as my face and I absolutely love it. This leaves my hair clean and super soft. Once a week I give myself a clay facial, as the clay is drying it pulls the face really tight and it feels somewhat uncomfortable but once I rinse the clay off my skin is soft, clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I use it in my homemade toothpaste recipe, for detoxing the skin while in the sauna, and face masks.</li>
            <li> I am 21 years old, male. I have had acne since I was 14, this product is okay. Not the &amp;#34;miracle cure&amp;#34; but it isn&#x27;t something to shrug off. My skin likes the stuff, it just doesn&#x27;t prevent breakouts.</li>
            <li> I am just blown away by how amazing this product is and how inexpensive it is compared to all the other &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; products on the market that are like it that don&#x27;t work half as well as this... I have given away probably a whole pound container of this (and bought 3 of them now) just because It is so amazing and I want everyone to experience it too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> I had high expectation for this products. The reviews here about it are very persuasive so I went ahead and bought it, First day I tried it I mixed a couple spoons with organic apple cider vinegar as some reviewers say to do so. I applied and it and yes I felt the pulling and my skin tightening. After a couple mins my face was so itchy and burning. I washed it off and my skin was red and still itchy.  After a couple uses my skin got used to the mixture that it didn&#x27;t bother my skin anymore. I still continue to use this product but haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my skin. My blackhead and occasional acne is still there. I was hoping it would help with my skin problems or something. In the meantime let me not discourage you from buying it just don&#x27;t expect a miracle.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if this works or not. I&#x27;m on a prescription acne regimen and I feel like whenever I use this it makes me break out more. Feels cool when I use it though, I dig the stretching feeling. Probably won&#x27;t  use it very often.</li>
            <li> Definitely one of my favorite face masks! This stuff is the real deal. It say&#x27;s &amp;#34;see your face pulsate&amp;#34; on the side and this is NOT a joke. But it feels awesome. Really. You can feel the deep cleansing of your pores and all the dirt being sucked out. Whenever I get an unpleasant and always unexpected pimple, I put a little of this on as a spot treatment mixed with some apple cider vinegar and it brings it to a head without fail. This is a miracle for people who get the occasional cystic pimple!</li>
            <li> I admit to not reading the product information before purchasing, silly me.  When I opened the container it was in powder form, I then read the instructions.  The directions said to use vinegar or water to mix to a consistency of your choosing.  I used Bragg&#x27;s Organic Apple Cider Vinegar.  This clay mask is the real deal, as the mask began to dry on my face, I could feel the tension and pulling.  My cat stared at me the whole while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited for the mask to completely dry, my face felt distorted and I was sure my skin would be dry after rinsing, but... my skin was so smooth and so soft and bright, I&#x27;m honestly amazed.  It truly deep cleans, it gets everything, my pores got smaller.  I had to pull myself away from the mirror.  I didn&#x27;t expect the result, because of the tautness of the mask, very exhilarating. What a great product.  I highly recommend this purchase!</li>
            <li> This mask is amazing... I love it</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product. It doesn&#x27;t work for me. Maybe it only works for some but not everyone.</li>
            <li> This mask is probably the best face mask I&#x27;ve ever tried. I left it on for about 20 minutes and not only was my face extreme;y soft, but my pores were the smallest I&#x27;ve ever seen them. I have oily skin, acne prone skin and I can say that this mask has really improved the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li> Great face mask. This is my first time i am using any clay packs and also my first time that I am tempted to put on my face pack every 4-5 days...haha..Strong mask that helps in deep cleansing of skin and improving fairness. Washing it off is definitely a problem but i am okey with it as I think this mask has really added glow to my face. I have a very dry skin and never had any issues with black head. So, I do not know how it helps with it.  After I take the mask off I put rosehip seed oil on my face for moisturizing. I saw in comments that many of us are having problem in making fine paste out of it. I have never had that issue with mine so  what I do with it might help others as well. I take the clay  and add water/vinegar  and let it steep for about 5 minutes (i usually wash my face during this time). I come back to the clay and add some more water and make a paste out of it. It turns into a smoother paste. If we add a few (2-3) drops of some face oils, the paste becomes really smoother.  I found one awesome facemask recipe while going through some videos and I am really in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Half spoon seaweed kelp powder (i use organic ones)&lt;br /&gt;one spoon Aztec healing clay&lt;br /&gt;quarter spoon (or less) of vitamin c crystals&lt;br /&gt;Mix all those together and add water to make it of required consistency.&lt;br /&gt;Add a drop of tea tree oil and 3-4 drops of jojoba oil or any oil of your preference.&lt;br /&gt;Mix all those together and apply to your face and wash it off after 20-25 minutes or keep it on until you feel comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;You can adjust the quantities as you wish coz ratios that work perfectly for one skin might not be same for others.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy beautiful glowing skin.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of cleaning out my pores, and the price is great. I tried mixing it with half water and half lemon juice at first because I was waiting for my ACV. Once I had my ACV, I tried it that way as well. I don&#x27;t recommend that people with dry or sensitive skin use ACV with this mask. Water and a little lemon juice works best for me. When I mixed it with ACV, it felt like my skin was on fire. AVC also stinks, so that&#x27;s another downside.</li>
            <li> I just washed my face after the firts use, and I can honestly say clay works!!! I don&#x27;t have way to problematic skin however I always suffered of large pores and black dots on my face especially on my nose and forhead. I mixed the clay with water, it took 1 tea spoon of powder and one spoon of water to get ready. After 10 mins my skin tightened and started to pulsate strongly. It is a bit annoying the process of washing it over, however the result makes me to forget everything. I could hardly belive to see that my pores on the nose got smaller, really really smaller. I have some red pimples on my face, which remains as is, but the black acnes are gone and my pores are smaller. I cleaned my face with a lotion and It feels very soft and fresh now.I am very fond of this product, and will definitely use it each week and in case of any other changes will update the review.</li>
            <li> used only once so far, but my face felt cleaner and it was more clear after the mask, the only thing I didn&#x27;t really like is it is so messy, I would recommend taking off with a moist papertowel, otherwise it gets everywhere and might even clog the sink. but I was impressed with the rapid results.</li>
            <li> I wish I could be one of the success stories, but unfortunately this immediately broke my skin out in tiny pimples across my forehead and then larger bumps on my cheeks. I also woke up the next day with my eyelids swollen, which was super strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have terrible acne, but hoped this could give me a great deep clean occasionally, so I figured I&#x27;d try it. I didn&#x27;t mind mixing the clay and vinegar, and I loved the tingling feeling from the mask as well as how soft my skin felt immediately after, but I wouldn&#x27;t dare use it again, as my face literally looks 10x worse now with all of these pimples. It&#x27;s so bad that it looks like I have a rash!</li>
            <li> I got this Monday, January 5th. Ive used this 2 times a day, every day, with the exception of yesterday. The first day it almost immediately reduced the redness on my face, bumps and pimples. But then on about the 4-5th day, I started breaking out a lot! But after reading that this is normal, I kept using it. Now, Tuesday the 13th, 8 days after using it, My face has gotten a lot better. No more major red bumps. The redness on my face has reduced tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ATTENTION: This product it MESSY! I apply it twice a day. Not everyone has the luxury to shower twice a day as I do. But it works for me. I pour a little bit of BRAGG Apple Cider Vinegar in a teacup, pour a little bit of the clay, and mix it with my index finger. Then I apply it to my face. When I Shower, I get a hand towel and slowly press on my face, and rinse the towel. Little by little the mask will come off. I Do this so I don&#x27;t just peel and clog my drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would Recommend at first, to leave it for 15 minutes. Your face WILL get Itchy.. A LOT! but after you&#x27;ve gotten use to it (The Itch), let it stay longer. I leave it for about 25-35 minutes 2 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Also use this moisturizer, Its Popular in my country of Peru, Called &amp;#34;Portugal Concha De Nacar&amp;#34;. It Moisturizes and rejuvenates your skin. I got it mailed from a friend in Peru, It is really hard to find it around, at least here in VA. OR Amazon. But any preferred face moisturizer can work. I know from reading more reviews others have better recommendations on that part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This by far beats any other Clear n clear/ Neutrogena/ proactive etc. etc. crap.&lt;br /&gt;STAY AWAY from the 3 step treatments. IDK about you. but for met, it causes a lot of burning sensations and it just irritates my skin. I guess my face is very sensitive. IF YOU ARE JUST STARTING TO GET ACNE, DONT GET CHEMICALS, THEY WILL BURN YOUR SKIN AND LEAVE SCARS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the rate of use im going at, only 13 days and im already at the half point of the 1 pound tub. and got about 1/4 left of vinegar left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will keep updating as I proceed.alf point of the 1 pound tub. and got about 1/4 left of vinegar left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will keep updating as I proceed.</li>
            <li> I Love the way it made my skin feel! Although after taking the mask off, my forehead was slightly red but it went away within 20 min. My skin felt soft and smooth.. Will definitely be using this product regularly :)</li>
            <li> A great find!!  Easy to mix and apply.  Have been looking for something like this for a while.  I love the way my skin feels after a bit of pampering.  Great product at a very good price.</li>
            <li> when I used it for a face mask about two or three times a week I noice that my face was smoother, felt freshser and my acne got better. I still get a small random pimple here and there, its not a miracle worker but better than any acne cleanser I ever used.</li>
            <li> The mask works as intended! And there&#x27;s quite a lot of product. I made a mistake the first time I used it by putting too much on my face. So some of my face was tingling and some wasn&#x27;t because the areas were thicker. Now that I know, I&#x27;m excited to get into the habit of using it.</li>
            <li> Really really good it pulls you pimples out and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin 😊</li>
            <li> So here&#x27;s the deal...this stuff is the bomb. I can&#x27;t believe the results I&#x27;ve had in just a month. I have very oily, sensitive, acne prone skin. Well, that&#x27;s what I used to have.  I&#x27;ve seen results in texture, pore size reduction, and breakouts. It&#x27;s amazing.  I don&#x27;t slather on the 1/4 inch like the directions say, just a thin layer and I leave it on for 5 to 10 minutes. I use it about 3 times a week. Breakout, pore size, and redness have been losing their fight on my face and I am so thrilled. Plus, my my very oily skin is starting to behave. I will never be without Healing Clay ever again!</li>
            <li> I am freaking out! I mixed up the clay as per the instructions, and applied it to my face. I waited ten minutes and washed it off. My face is now burned. Really. I look like a lobster.  I used some lotion to help but I look awful and I have to work tommarow !!!  Be aware thus stuff will peel your face off.        ******update*****    So, after my initial freak out I&#x27;m here to review this product correctly. I had a red and blistery face for two days after I applied the mask. After using many lotions to get my face to get back to normal I&#x27;m feeling a bit less crazy. I could see this working on tougher skin or acne prone with good results.     My main complaint is that there was no warnings on this product. It&#x27;s basically a micro-derm abrasion in a jar. I&#x27;ve used plenty of mud masks in the past, and even ones that are tingly. I&#x27;ve never had this kind of reaction to any mud masks before.    It does say calcium bentonite on the bottle and I should have researched what that was before I put it on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a couple months about twice a week and MANNN, my skin is dramatically better. I&#x27;m 23 years old and my skin took a beating from teenage acne. My acne scars have diminished about 60%. My pores are much smaller THANK GOODNESS! My skin actually has a healthy look now. This stuff works! ONLY if you&#x27;re using it consistently. Nothing is going to work unless you&#x27;re faithful with if. I would recommend wash your mask off outside of something because after a while, this stuff can clog your bathtub. Other than that this stuff is MAGIC!! Enjoy(;</li>
            <li> I purchased this mask a few months ago but I waited a little bit before writing a review, to make sure that I can give a useful feedback.&lt;br /&gt;I have found the mask to be extremely effective in cleaning my pores. I tried to mix it with water first but then I realized it works better with apple cider vinegar. I usually leave it on for 20 minutes - not longer, because the ACV can irritate the skin and cause serious damage, as well. After the mask I usually put on some hydrating mask. I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in the texture of my skin and I also have fever breakouts. It is a must have!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1U1WRN3VK81UP]]I wouldn&#x27;t say this is amazing but it does work well for what it is and the price is great. I mix mine with tea tree oil and sulfur base product.</li>
            <li> Just used this for the first time. So far, I love it!  My face looked and felt so clean after I washed off the mask.  It seems to even help reduce the look of wrinkles initially. I ended up using an empty Lush cosmetics tub and filling it 2/3 with the clay, then added a mix of water and apple cider vinegar. It made a nice consistency and now I have several more masks pre made for whenever I choose to use it again. This seems easier than whipping it up every use.</li>
            <li> Upon reading the numerous amounts of good reviews on this product, I had high expectations. However, after the first use, I didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference. My skin looked and felt the same. I would recommend the Origin Charcoal Mask over this product, it&#x27;s definitely worth your money. I really am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice so far and I did experience the tightening on my face, I left it on for minutes. So far I hav noticed any changes but I&#x27;m gonna keep using it to see. I also ordered the 1lb container for like ten $, then found the 2lb at Walmart for like $7 so if it ends up working I&#x27;ll bu from there next time</li>
            <li> Havn&#x27;t used it for much time but i can feel it working and pores are almost completely  gone when i remove it but they come back the next day good product  thanks!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect this mask to perform miracles. Honestly my skin is pretty much the same after several uses. I still have redness, breakouts, and oiliness. It does however  *feel* like it works and leaves me with slightly improved skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad it was too good to be true, though it&#x27;s not bad product. Just not what the hype makes it out to be at all. Ugh.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely youth in a plastic tub. it makes the skin feel and look absolutely amazing. easy to use. i love it and it lasts a long time... will order again when i use all mine up.</li>
            <li> Went in the doctors office and found out i had stage 4 terminal cancer and only 30 days left to live.  Within just a few days of using this product I felt a crazy bodily change and went back to the doctors office to find out I didn&#x27;t have a single cancer cell in my body.  Great product would recommend!</li>
            <li> Use this 2 times a week. I am loving it. My skin is really soft after and doesn&#x27;t make me break out. I also do a foot bath once and a while with epsom salt so I started adding a touch of the clay to that for a great detox.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mostly 4a natural ( o and s for Lois system) w/ low porosity, slightly thin, and fine strands (whew!). That being said I purchased this to use for the max hydration method. The first day was AMAZING, my curls were poppin, and they were stretched too. The second day (the day without the cherry lola treatment) things started to go wrong my hair started to feel immensely dry, so I went to the mhm website and read the comments to see if someone else had the same problem. They did and three last who created the method says this clay can be drying for this treatment. So that came to an end but I think I will keep it as it is awesome for clarifying.</li>
            <li> Preparation and cleanup is a little messy, and the smell isn&#x27;t great, but this product is very clarifying and purifies your skin. Would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> i usually use queen Helene as my mask. BUT OMG!!!! with the braggs vinegar (already had using as a toner) it is THEEE SHIIITTT. no lie. i felt a difference in my skin after the first use. smoother, brighter. i have moderate acne, sometimes cystic, with lets say, alot but not TERRIBLE acne marks (I&#x27;ve seen terrible and if i don&#x27;t get this under control it will be there VERY soon) i use this two to three time a week, while doing homework, cleaning, or just having a &amp;#34;girl day&amp;#34; good way to treat yourself. and the one pounder is More then enough for one person.</li>
            <li> I got this product  For my daugther&lt;br /&gt;We have to try so many from pharmacy counter, sepas productos expensive&lt;br /&gt;Products she had blackheads, break out&lt;br /&gt;and poros, and all this isues  are finish&lt;br /&gt;It works!!!  She is only 18 years old&lt;br /&gt;Teeneger.</li>
            <li> Does what it promised. Cleans well.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS AMAZING CLAY!&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so the night I got it, I could not wait to use it! And just so I knew it wasn&#x27;t just a biased opinion, I tried it on my mama, sister, and myself! I used 1/4 of clay and equal amount of water. That was plenty for the 3 of us, I even had enough for my brother, but he refused to try it ha! Anyways, I put it on my face, let it do it&#x27;s thing, and then cleaned it off. My face looked and felt so clean, soft, and my skin felt like I had a tightening done and I was so just so impressed!!! Would suggest to my friends and will certainly buy again!!</li>
            <li> This mask one of my favorite ,..in my routuine.helps whatever it said on the package ,very happy purchased</li>
            <li> This stuff works! It does feel like it is &amp;#34;pulsing&amp;#34; pulling all the impurities out of your skin. I mix it with apple cider vinegar and just love it. It takes a little to get off like most masks but your skin looks great afterwards.</li>
            <li> it burned and itch a little at the beginning then gradually stopped&lt;br /&gt;really cleaned my pores</li>
            <li> I satisfy whit my purchases Thankyou</li>
            <li> I have used this a dozen or so times since I&#x27;ve bought it (mixing with apple cider vinegar), and I absolutely love it! I have to admit I was a little bit skeptical with the instructions of how it makes your skin pulsate, but I figured I&#x27;d try it because of the price. Since I&#x27;ve been using it, my skin looks and feels amazing, and it actually does make your skin tingle while it&#x27;s drying. For the price, it&#x27;s definitely a great buy, and I plan on purchasing again in the future!</li>
            <li> It helped clear up my pimples. I used to use this almost everyday till the pimples are gone now I am just using it once in a while. You can use water or vinegar. no need to use special equipment for mixing. you can make it thick or thin paste, it depends on how you like it. This small jar will last a really really long time. I recommend this to those who have oily faces like me..</li>
            <li> Great results from first time. It&#x27;s like having facial at home</li>
            <li> Gave this an extensive try and I just haven&#x27;t had the good results that so many people have had.  I&#x27;ve used it a few months, between 1-3 times a week.  I mix it with the Apple cider vinegar, cover my face, and leave it on about 20 minutes.  It&#x27;s a messy cleanup but it would be worth it if I saw results but I haven&#x27;t.  After taking it off, your skin will be red for 30 minutes or an hour.  After that, my skin does feel great, and maybe looks slightly better but I don&#x27;t notice any long term improvements and if anything I get worse acne the next day.  I&#x27;ve tried it for awhile so it&#x27;s not just purging.  It&#x27;s cheap, and a lot of people have gotten results so it may be worth a try but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Doesnt work. Clogged sink. Too messy</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!! I did notice a difderence in the firmness of my skin after use.</li>
            <li> The worst thing I have ever get. After using one time my face got all break outs lol. Sucks</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get to try it because the seal was broken.  Not going to put anything on my face that is not secure...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re anything like me you will search high and low on reviews reading all about a product before you purchase it, let me just tell you, this stuff is amazing. I have struggled with acne break outs since my teenage years (I am 20) and I have done everything to my skin you can possible imagine. This mask if the BEST and closest thing you will get to natural when dealing with your skin and actually seeing improvement. I was skeptiical of buying skin care products off of Amazon because you don&#x27;t really know what you&#x27;re getting but I truly believe in this product and definitely give it a 4 star rating. Just give it a try and you will not be disappointed. I use this mask 2-3 times a week and pre mix it and store in my refrigerator. A small tub of this stuff has lasted me 3 weeks now and I haven&#x27;t even gone through half of the actual product. IT LASTS AND WORKS! Best mask ever!</li>
            <li> This is a fun product.  If it does draw out metals and impurities, I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.  However, this is a GREAT facial mask.  It is the tightest face mask I&#x27;ve ever used and helps dry out my oily skin.  I don&#x27;t like how you have to mix the clay with water/apple cider vinegar.  I wish it came premixed.  It&#x27;s just tricky to get the right consistency.  You only need a tiny amount of water to every clay mixture.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time.  I used apple cider vinegar to mix with powder.  Made my skin feel nice.  It is a little messy to take off.</li>
            <li> I must say, I read a ton of awesome reviews regarding this product.  It is a must!!! I used it once and my skin is 1000x better.  Definitely will continue to use this in the future. 10 stars!</li>
            <li> Tried it and I like it.  I love clay masks.  I did notice that the clay did shrink My pores. Had a pore problem for years. I have been looking for something that would be effective in that area.  This is the product that produced results and I have tried many products.  I am looking forward to using this product weekly.</li>
            <li> This stuff should be used by anybody that has struggled with acne and even those who want clear skin who just need a weekly mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use 1 Teaspoon of the Aztec Clay &amp; 1 teaspoon of apple vinegar or water and mix in a very small bowl with your finger. Apply as much paste as you can on your face and let sit for as long as you can!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would strongly recommend as a mask for anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li> A MUST! I have some adult acne on my chin area. This mask is so awesome you can feel it working!!! After your skin glows!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now and i am very pleased with the results thus far. I definitely will buy this product again!</li>
            <li> This is a good product because India makes really good staff</li>
            <li> Great mask. I use with apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> I used this on my face. The key to getting your face to pulsate is leaving it on for 30/45 minutes if applied generously. It did leave my face blotchy reddish, but that went away. Really did shrink my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;ll try this on my 3c/4a hair one day, people on the web rant and rave about what this does for their hair!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but for this product I had to! I have a history with bad skin and I made a promise to myself that I would find the &amp;#34;perfect product&amp;#34; for me. All I can say is that I do not have to search anymore. This product is AMAZING! It left my skin feeling so fresh and new, and my blemishes slowly started fading away. I&#x27;m not going to lie, it is pretty intense, but all worth it! Best part about this product, besides the results, is the price. Very affordable and very worth it.</li>
            <li> It got rave reviews so I purchased it right away.... wrong move for me!!!!  It&#x27;s very messy to prepare!  The effect it had on my face was just the same effect I had with the other facial clay masks I use (St. Ives and Body Shop).</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and works like it says!</li>
            <li> I have had acne prone skin since I was 13 I&#x27;m 31 now and this is the first product I&#x27;ve found to trully unclog pores. Does dry out your skin a bit but if you already have oily skin it won&#x27;t be a bad thing I follow with age defying skin clearing serum which brings moisture right back into my skin and keeps it even.</li>
            <li> I am convinced this will give anyone perfect skin who tries it. With only two uses I see drastic results, my pores are smaller, acne vanished, amazing even skin tone. Never again will I use any other product for my face. Love that it&#x27;s all natural too. Only con is that your face will smell like smelly gym socks only while you have the mask on and its messy... but the results are worth it! Truly a miracle product.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve written althought I&#x27;ve ordered plenty things from Amazon. This stuff is amazing. Im 19 and have suffered acne since my early teens. The whole time it ranged from moderate to severe. The past few months have been horible. Ive has cystic acne in almost all of my problem areas. Constant redness and flakey skin. Ive tried everything. Name brands, dermatologist, three step systems. Nothing seemed to work for me. Id easly spend 100s of dollars. I came across this and figured Id give it a try. Im so thankful I did. I recieved this last night and tried it out. (I used water because im waiting for the ACV to come in). I didnt feel any trobbing so I started to worry that I did it wrong. Once I took it off (I used warm wet paper towels) and put on moisturizer I took a look in the mirror. I didnt really see much of a difference but my face did feel softer. I woke up this morning and was so excited. Almost all of the redness is gone and my face doesnt feel dry at all! I cant wait to see what several more times of using this will do!:) Definitely buying again.</li>
            <li> Love it(:&lt;br /&gt;I Add a few drops of aloe vera gel to my mask and tea tre oil .&lt;br /&gt;You ladies should try it.</li>
            <li> Great product that works very well for my needs. Thank you for offering a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Suddenly since using this like, twice a month, I haven&#x27;t had a breakout in weeks. My skin became much less combination and much more normal, it&#x27;s good, man. It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Def worth the hype. Great product</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Not gonna lie, it did leave my face quite dry after i used it, but it&#x27;s nothing that a good moisterizer can&#x27;t fix. Awsome price too, I&#x27;ve tried other clay masks from my beauty supcription boxes that run for about $35 for less product, this actually works better!</li>
            <li> I love the way my face feels after using this!</li>
            <li> Disappointing &#x3D;(....I&#x27;m so sad, I guess I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin...the 1st time I used it it felt fine, I felt tightness from it drying &amp; it seemed to do its job. The last 2 times I used it were terrible, it pulled my skin downward &amp; the &amp;#34;pulsating&amp;#34; feeling felt more like unbearable irritating spikes in my pores, I could barely keep it on my face I ran to wash it off but I thought I was being dramatic. I tried again today &amp; I literally got an allergic reaction my entire body was itching &amp; I only used a little on areas where I have large pores (cheeks, forehead) &amp; where I had a pimple (under my neck &amp; by my ear) BUT like I said MY ENTIRE BODY STARTED TO ITCH. I looked in the mirror &amp; my pores looked like they were getting larger, washed off immediately &amp; a crazy rash devolved on my back. I&#x27;m done, I tried a bunch of times &amp; I guess it&#x27;s a fact I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin OR my pores are too large &amp; I feel everything...idk but I tried...</li>
            <li> BEST MASK EVER. I am so happy I purchased this. At first I was really skeptical, after having tried drugstore &amp;#34;clay masks&amp;#34; that did nothing and trying a similar dry powder clay that totally aggravated and messed up my skin. This mask 1) really helps to clear up my breakouts 2) hasn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive skin 3) Has overall helped to brighten my skin and help lighten some old acne scars 4)is going to last sooooo long. It label says the 1 lb container is good for 10-15 uses but I have already used this product about ten times and I&#x27;ve used only about three spoonfuls of product, which is easily not even 1/6 the container. I always mix this with apple cider vinegar when I use it, and you really will feel your skin pulsate as it starts to dry. I usually end up leaving it on for around 20 minutes and then use a wet paper towel to remoisten the product and then to help buff it off my skin. I use this as a weekly treatment and as the weeks go by my skin just keeps looking better and better. Such a great price too.</li>
            <li> I use this mask almost every day and it is the best thing that ever happened to my face. Deep cleansing at its best.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and from what they wrote u bought this. And I&#x27;m so glad I did. Got a set for 2 of my friends also. His thing lasts since u are recommended not to do it too often because it removes good and bad dirt and oil. But I love it!</li>
            <li> I mixed this up and put it on my face.  At first the cool clay felt good.  Then it started to itch a bit, but I figured it was due to it drying.  It started to itch A LOT so I washed it off.  After I washed it all off, my face was red and blotchy and covered in hives.  It wasn&#x27;t good for me...it really agitated my skin...and it isn&#x27;t eligible for return.  Good thing it was only $8.</li>
            <li> its really clumpy. i cannot get the consistency smooth.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use it as the main ingredient in my homemade face masks. It works great.</li>
            <li> This product is not the easiest to remove and does leave your face tender and pink but it works!</li>
            <li> Okay I was looking for this exact type of mud mask.  The green hard crusty one that you mix yourself.  I just tried this today could not get a half inch on it on my face thats just crazy....my face IS BRIGHT RED AND BURNING WHERE THE MASK WAS APPLIED AND GENTLY REMOVED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review in a couple hours after the bright, burning red skin goes away... This feels like I had a chemical peel, just short of bleeding skin, this is what you will get when you use this stuff.  Oh and no throbbing like the reviews and product says thats the clay drying on your face.. no big miracle there...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  The redness is gone after an hour and my skin does look cleaner and over all glowing... I do like this stuff.  Just a note, use a cleaned out sour cream or cottage cheese container to mix it in and any extra use the next day.  As others have said DO NOT GET THIS IN YOUR DRAIN.  Use a large bowl filled with warm water and a wash cloth and dump it outside after you have removed this from your face.</li>
            <li> the first time I used it I used 2 tbsp clay and 2 tbsp raw acv and that was a little too much, but I put a decent layer on for 15 minutes (should&#x27;ve left it on a few minutes longer) came off in the shower with no problem, did not clog my sink, And my face feels soft.</li>
            <li> I first used this over a decade ago and it really is quite amazing. It&#x27;s fun to mix up, all goopy and muddy. It doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of scent added (I know it isn&#x27;t girly to not like to smell like a frickin flower, but I hate having smelly stuff under my nose!) so it works for my husband too! It&#x27;s kind of fun cause it works all over the body so I put it on his back and when we wash off we&#x27;re all nice and soft. That&#x27;s actually why I went looking for this and remembered it- the insane softness of your skin! It clears pores, tightens without drying, and leaves you so super soft... great buy!</li>
            <li> I bought this item because of the high reviews.  Everyone kept mentioning the pulsating and tightening but thats standard with clay based masks.  This mask actually makes me itch uncontrollably.  I have used other clay masks and have not experienced severe itching although I did experience a little when it began to tighten.  Not good if you have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of clearing skin pores.</li>
            <li> the description says you can feel your face pulse - you can actually SEE it pulse if you look in the mirror - super intense! leaves my face red for the first 30 minutes or so after removing it, but I can honestly say this is the best mask I&#x27;ve ever used - really deep-cleans my pores. I use it about twice a week but it feels like it&#x27;s gonna last forever! it dried out my face a bit the first couple of times I used it but I&#x27;ve started mixing apple cider vinegar with it and now my face is smooth and moisturized after every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had a huge problem with acne but I don&#x27;t even really get &amp;#34;strays&amp;#34; anymore; my face has never looked so clear and felt so clean :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this. I have great improvement on my face.</li>
            <li> i actually read another reviewer complain about this, but since all the others were possitive reviews, i purchased 2 lbs of it! it made my pores huge! it&#x27;s been almost 4 weeks and they are still huge! the other reviewer complained that it wrinkled her face - that didn&#x27;t happen to me...</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over 2 years now and it is amazing!! Your face really does pulsate. Yes, it will be red for a good half hour after you wash it off, but that is no reason to not try this product. It is not permanent! Yes you make break out. But that is because it is pulling everything to the surface. Even if you pay hundreds and thousands of dollars for microdermabrasion there is a chance you can break out. Take a breath and relax. The product is doing its job. Your face will feel super dry afterwards so make sure to moisturize your face afterwards. I have oily acne prone skin and this helps a lot. I would not recommend using it more than 1-2 times per week though. Don&#x27;t forget to mix it with ORGANIC apple cider vinegar. If you want to prevent clogged drains (cus let&#x27;s face it, we are paying for mud), get a big bowl with warm water, wash most of it off, throw that water outside, and then finish washing the rest of your face in the sink.</li>
            <li> This product is great for your skin.  They only recommendation is that I wouldn&#x27;t use it in your sink.  It sets up like concrete and it may clog your pipes.  I clean the bowl I use to mix it in outside.</li>
            <li> Love it! I have oily skin with large pores...this stuff helped so much with my breakouts. Will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> AMAZING product!!! Personally, I recommend to combine this mask with using of roller.  Using roller once a month and during the time between each month just apply this mask every other week.  You will see big difference!  Don&#x27;t forget to hydrate your skin as well!!  It&#x27;s very important.</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected, durable packaging, safety seal (nice bonus). I&#x27;m definitely excited to try this product since it has received so many rave reviews! :)</li>
            <li> I really like this mask and it can be used way more than the package says, so you get a lot for what you pay.  I think using the apple cider vinegar is the only way to go.</li>
            <li> I love the pulsing. I mix the clay with apple cider vinegar. Water can used too, but it&#x27;s lumpy and harder to use.  When the clay starts to dry my face gets very tight and begins to pulsate. My  skin gets super red and tight afterward. It leaves my  comolexion glowing.</li>
            <li> Good: I love this product enough to write a review about it-- i think this is my first good review in 5 years! My acne-prone skin hasn&#x27;t felt this good since before puberty. I use it 4 times a week and have hardly broken out since. Truly live changing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad: Messy! The mask will arrive as a dry mix. Instructions suggest mixing with apple cider vinegar. I mixed with water for the first few days and the result was a clumpy, watery mess and it was impossible to shape it into a nice, spreadable paste. Also, it can be painful if you let it dry to long, especially if you apply a thinner layer towards the outer edges of your face/wherever you apply the mask because the pull is SO INTENSE as it hardens. It will also crack and leave lines on your face if you laugh/make a face and then let it harden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;1. Get Apple Cider Vinegar. i use distilled, whatever. Just dont use only water.&lt;br /&gt;2. Let it dry completely at least every other time you use it. It needs thirty minutes to dry.&lt;br /&gt;3. Do it alone so you wont be tempted to laugh/talk/interact in any way that will make the mask crack and pull in painful directions&lt;br /&gt;4. Make sure you apply an EVEN layer. Pay special attention to the outer edges and make sure they aren&#x27;t too thin, or they will dry first and pull the hardest.&lt;br /&gt;5. Avoid delicate skin around the eyes and areas over your temples. The pull is so intense when it hardens completely. That little bit of skin by your temples needs to stretch to accommodate to the other skin around it (forehead and cheeks) I leave another space over my nose between my eyes.</li>
            <li> so bad effect in my face skin. I would say it does not work to me. After using this product, I have acne in my face.</li>
            <li> Wow! Awesome product. I use this for my hair. It made my hair shine!</li>
            <li> I got this product to help with black heads. It did not work and made a real mess anywhere you use it. Where do you rinse it off? With a hose in the backyard?&lt;br /&gt;My husband would die if he knew I rinsed it down the drain.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff. Does exactly what it says it will. Your pores will thank you !</li>
            <li> I have combination skin with minor breakouts (mostly my forehead &amp; chin area) &amp; eczema on the top of my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me first explain to you how I use this product:&lt;br /&gt;1. Mix equal parts of clay &amp; raw apple cider vinegar (it gives off a fizzy &amp; slightly bubbly sound &amp; reaction).&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply mixture to clean face.&lt;br /&gt;3. Feel your skin pulsate!&lt;br /&gt;4. After the mask completely dries rinse it off gently with warm water. This will take a while, depending on how thick of an application you did.&lt;br /&gt;5. Gently pat dry your face &amp; apply coconut oil &amp; massage gently.&lt;br /&gt;6. I mixed essential oils with my coconut oil to aid in my skin care. I&#x27;ve been alternating with 2 drops of lavender, Rosemary, Peppermint or Tea Tree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time using this clay was a week ago &amp; the last two times was back to back (I will be doing possibly 4 days straight ). I&#x27;ve noticed my skin tone is more evened out, no new breakouts, old acne drying up &amp; the eczema above my lip? Almost completely HEALED! I must say I was afraid at first to apply it on that area of my face but I went ahead anyways. The redness is gone, the dryness &amp; also the deep cut/painful crack I had from it being so dry is completely healed, AFTER TWO BACK TO BACK USES! Those who suffer from eczema knows those skin cracks are no joke. As a woman, or I guess for anyone in general having skin issues on the face can lower your self-esteem.  But this product healed it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my fianc&amp;eacute; who&#x27;ve only used this product once, experienced redness that resembled a rash like appearance. That lasted for a good two hours. After the redness faded his complexion appeared more evened out &amp; refreshed. Because of his sensitive skin we&#x27;ll only do this one a week. Also I didn&#x27;t apply essential oil for him because again, his face gave off a bright red rash appearance. I was afraid he was going to get upset since essential oils gives off a slight burning feeling lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall we love this product &amp; will continue to purchase this reasonably priced (so affordable) miracle in a tub!oduct &amp; will continue to purchase this reasonably priced (so affordable) miracle in a tub!</li>
            <li> I love this, first time using it and I felt the &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; sensation, I have small blackheads on my nose and right after I washed it, it was clean. My face felt softer and I did have a little redness but it went away in about 10 minutes. Some people say not to wash it off in the shower so I just got a small cotton towel and put warm water on it and rinsed it that way. Also i used two parts water and one part powder since it was a better consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**update** So I have this problem with dark area on my neck, no matter how much I scrub it doesn&#x27;t go away so I always thought it was a skin condition. Well I have used this mask twice on my neck and it&#x27;s actually noticeably whiter now. It actually looks normal. Seriously I am never using another mask ever again. Oh and all my blackheads that usually come back after a day haven&#x27;t come back.</li>
            <li> This product is everything I was hoping for. My acne is steadily getting better and better and I had a dramatically noticeable change in about 4 days.</li>
            <li> Loving this clay mask.  It&#x27;s a bit messy but it works.  I did put it in a Ziploc bag and mixed it.  When you leave it on your face it literally starts pulling like crazy as it dries which is uncomfortable but once you wash it off your skin feels fantastic.  I did get red marks on my forehead from it but they were gone by the morning so it&#x27;s not something I would do before you head out in public, definitely do it before bed.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love it!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and easy to use. Would recommend to a friend for sure.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this!!</li>
            <li> I have trouble sometimes using it because it clumps up, and there are no real instructions on how to mix it. I just use water and I think that might be wrong, but when I get it to work it really works.</li>
            <li> Great cleansing mask.</li>
            <li> Love it ,really helps calm breakouts and dry out pimples. For Bad acne Use everyday for most results that&#x27;s what I did and it does help reduce acne:-)</li>
            <li> I have very problem skin, pores, acne, oily..and i tried lots of procedures, even very expensive. They helped only temporarily and I&#x27;m very tired of all this. So, I decided not to waste money and treat my skin myself and fortunatelly I got results! my skin is getting better and better. I got some good skincare products from amazon, and this indian healing clay it one of them. Today I first tried this clay. Its very easy to use.and I am very happy I made the right choice! its first use and my skin is very clear, blackheads is reduced and hope they will disappear at all. Recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> The first few times I mixed it with water and had a lot of clumps in it. And it took very long to mix it. I was tired of it and then put it away. A few days ago I bought apple cider vinegar, and I tried to mix it with the vinegar today. The result was great. So easy to mix and it was very smooth and easy to apply.And I noticed that there were a lot of bubbles when pouring vinegar to the powder. So the powder should be a little alkaline. As our skin surface is weakly acid, I think using vinegar to neutralize is good. And after rinsing it this time, my skin felt much softer than before when using water.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I took one star off is that it doesn&#x27;t clean my white heads well. Maybe a few times more should have effect. But how much would you expect from such a low price clay? Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of facials and masks so I was interested to see results with this product. My skin is combination and I have acne scars from my teenage experience. I&#x27;ve also had laser, fills (once) and acid peels over the years.&lt;br /&gt;This was by far the most intense mask I&#x27;ve ever had, in terms of how tight my face got. Maybe that means I really needed it! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Folks: to make easy on / off here&#x27;s a suggestion that works great and a method esthetecians use:&lt;br /&gt;1. Take a small ceramic ramekin (2 inch) and a popsicle stick to stir and smooth out lumps with apple cider vinegar. I keep a $1 ramekin for my masks, fyi. It takes 3 seconds to prepare.&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply with your index and middle fingers into a thin layer once it&#x27;s an opaque green tinge is fine (not translucent)&lt;br /&gt;3. Wait 15 minutes. Feel your skin tighten and pulsate.&lt;br /&gt;4. Take 2 paper towels and thoroughly wet. Take a dry paper towel and line the inside of the sink to catch falling mask&lt;br /&gt;5. Take wet paper towels and gently open and place on your face, with your headed slightly tilted back, so that the entire towel is covering your face.&lt;br /&gt;6. Slowly press each section of your face so the moisture transfers to your face. Then slowly massage one section at a time to remove the mask. Fold towel in half, massage, repeat. Fold towel in half again, massage, repeat. Repeat with a fresh wet towel until all mask is removed. I had to use 2 towels twice.&lt;br /&gt;7. Rinse your face to remove any final residue. Gently towel dry.&lt;br /&gt;8. Apply toner. Let dry.&lt;br /&gt;9. Apply a lovely non pore clogging moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;10. Notice your lovely smooth skin!!&lt;br /&gt;Loved it!</li>
            <li> My oldest, best friend in Texas is using this as an auto-immune detox on skin, and passed on the tip. I ordered this and tried it today! Wow. Follow the instructions and use the organic Apple Cider Vinegar to get the tingling, pulling, cooling action - I used it on face, neck, arms and legs (which is what she told me she is doing, per a nutritionist). So I also got the Yerba Prima Bentonite Detox Pint, as well - and will be using the double combo for a detox in and out. Follow the directions carefully and be sure you consult with your health professionals.</li>
            <li> I just received my mask today and tried it for the first time. I used 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar, and 1 tbsp clay. That made a pretty perfect amount to use on my face and neck. I knew this was going to be an interesting experience when I added the vinegar and it fuzzed ominously.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t begin to feel anything aside from an intense itchiness until a few minutes in. That&#x27;s when my skin started to pulse and the mask started to tighten. Such a weird feeling, but I kind of liked the pulsating. It was oddly of soothing, like a massage.&lt;br /&gt;I left it on for about 10 minutes, since I have sensitive skin, and washed it off in the shower. I read that you should avoid washing it down the drain, but I found it pretty impossible not too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately afterwards, my skin is the expected irritated red and dry (nothing moisturizer can&#x27;t help), but it&#x27;s also insanely soft and smooth. My pores are diminished, and my face has this weird clean feeling I&#x27;ve never felt before. Almost like my skin is lighter, which was problem from the tightening and pulsating. It&#x27;s a strange feeling, but not a bad one. Kind of nice and relaxing. I&#x27;ve definitely never gotten such an immediate smoothing and softening affect from a mask before, so I like it so far.</li>
            <li> This feels pretty good on my skin, didn&#x27;t make me break out like a lot of other products do and it also seems to reduce black heads.  I like it a lot and it seems to be a pretty good value.  be skimpy on the clay, I made just a tiny bit, or so I thought, and it did m face, my husbands and there was plenty left over.</li>
            <li> I like this because it a very powerful face mask. It makes your face feel tight and you can really tell that it&#x27;s sucking bad toxins out of your skin. I have a couple complaints though. Mixing this with water gets messy and chunky and it never quite goes 100% perfectly. It can also be a little irritating because it is SO STRONG. Still worth a try though, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> At first, I freaked out. My skin was bright red and burned a little after removing this stuff. Within 20 minutes, my skin was back to its normal color and my pores were practically non existent! LOVE this stuff, these reviews do not lie. It feels a bit weird while it&#x27;s on, but it&#x27;s worth the results. I have super sensitive skin, and I was fine. I just wouldn&#x27;t use this first thing in the morning if you have to be somewhere right after. :)</li>
            <li> The girl friend loves it, leaves the skin smooth and very clean looking. I will be purchasing more in the near future thanks again.</li>
            <li> I have a naturally oily face. I am in my upper 20&#x27;s but this has been going on since I was 14.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have kind of a ball point nose. A regular nose with my tip like a ball.  I am also brown in skin tone.  Basically blackheads show up quickly and prominently on my nose.  I tried strips but he removal took some on and some off.  Also, they would come back withhin a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing.  I only have to use once a week mixed with the apple vinegar and it really works.  It clears my blackheads, especially my nose for exactly a week.  Its cheap and last me months too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is the clay has to go to the drain and I wonder if that would lead to future drainage problems.</li>
            <li> Does an outstanding job.  Great Product!</li>
            <li> Love this product! It&#x27;s now apart of my weekly routine. I can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t heard about it sooner.</li>
            <li> it works good on me~ although it cost time to stir, I still apply it three times a week~ you can see the change of your face after washed the mask~ it makes your skin more bright and humid~</li>
            <li> I took another person&#x27;s advice from here about the ziploc bag method of application and it worked like a charm. A little bit of product goes a long way and I can tell the container I bought will last me a long time. Can&#x27;t wait to see the results!</li>
