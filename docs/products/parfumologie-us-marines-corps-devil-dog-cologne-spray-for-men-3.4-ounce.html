            <li>This cologne smells amazing; the scent is a mixture of chewing tobacco, CS gas, CLP, and gun powder.</li>
            <li>For the price the bottle is a nice size.  </li>
            <li>I thought it smelled nice</li>
            <li>The bottle  and packaging are very cool!</li>
            <li>But, I&#x27;m glad he likes and enjoyed his gift!</li>
            <li>Blood&#x27;n&#x27;Guts would have been a better scent  to carry the name.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Love&#x27;s Baby Soft\\&quot; that just doesn&#x27;t line up with the DEVIL DOG spirit I was expecting.</li>
            <li>My wife told me it smells like gasoline and burns the nostrils, so I turned around, knife handed her, and told her this is the most motivated, dedicated cologne ever.</li>
            <li>it, I&#x27;m sure you will like it.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful with a light but masculine fragrance.</li>
            <li>More will be coming into this household.</li>
            <li>I might also add I have severe allergies to most fragrances</li>
            <li>I also love the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Will be ordering more from this seller.</li>
            <li>It is a fun bottle, and we all got a great laugh.</li>
            <li>I suppose it&#x27;s ok if you can tolerate the smell of cheap cologne (think Brute quality)</li>
            <li>good like the cologne put the price to high</li>
            <li>It was a huge hit.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s \\&quot;soft,\\&quot; not a word I even feel comfortable using without quotes when referring to the Marines...</li>
            <li>and citrus light mix.</li>
            <li>Wow, this cologne is the best I&#x27;ve ever used, the women love it and can&#x27;t seem to get enough of me when I wear it.  </li>
            <li>Got me a homerun the first night I used it !</li>
            <li>So, I guess it was worth it in the end.</li>
            <li>I will probably purchase more in the future</li>
            <li>For one, it doesn&#x27;t last (which might be the good part), then there&#x27;s that male version of</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been out of the corps for some time now and haven&#x27;t exercised much, and with one spray of this cologne I was able to go outside and run 3 miles in 18 minutes.</li>
            <li>I heard it&#x27;s made with real bits of devil dog, and 60% of the time it works all the time.</li>
            <li>It came earlier than expected which is always good.  </li>
            <li>Not only was this a special gift he loves the fragrance.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve never had so much action!</li>
            <li>Miraculously, after using this cologne for a few days, I am PTSD free.</li>

            <li> My dad is a retired Marine.  Not only was this a special gift he loves the fragrance.  Highly recommend for the marine in your life.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my self but gave to another devildog brother of mine when i found out today was his birthday....he loves it ....i just ordered my self another one ....Semper Fi</li>
            <li> Great smelling, have got compliments ever since I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But being a Devil Dog myself. Blood&#x27;n&#x27;Guts would have been a better scent  to carry the name.</li>
            <li> as described, smells great. citrus and woodsy notes. great anytime. long lasting without being over powering. smell like a marine</li>
            <li> I gave this to my father for Christmas and he absolutely loved it! Thanks for a great product that is also great smelling!</li>
            <li> The bottle gets the award, that&#x27;s where it ends. It&#x27;s \\&quot;soft,\\&quot; not a word I even feel comfortable using without quotes when referring to the Marines...even if it is over some silly cologne imitation representing their name. Whoever did this to them, must not have been able to make it through boot camp or something, and wanted to play a sick joke on our finest. For one, it doesn&#x27;t last (which might be the good part), then there&#x27;s that male version of \\&quot;Love&#x27;s Baby Soft\\&quot; that just doesn&#x27;t line up with the DEVIL DOG spirit I was expecting. It is a fun bottle, and we all got a great laugh. My 15 year old son who is Marine obsessed, LOVES the idea of it. So, I guess it was worth it in the end.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff.  Got me a homerun the first night I used it !</li>
            <li> I got this for my friend, Chris (who is currently serving in the Marines) as a birthday gift. He love it and says it smell great! This is a good product for men who are in the Marines or even just civilians too! :)</li>
            <li> For the price the bottle is a nice size.  It came earlier than expected which is always good.  The aroma is that sandalwood? and citrus light mix. Definitely different.  People will definitely ask you about it and could go either way.  I like it though.</li>
            <li> I purchased for my husband as a gag gift, but he actually wears it. I suppose it&#x27;s ok if you can tolerate the smell of cheap cologne (think Brute quality), Personally, I can&#x27;t wait for it to run out and may have to help it along in the bathroom sink when he&#x27;s not looking. But, I&#x27;m glad he likes and enjoyed his gift!</li>
            <li> I purchased for a Grandson going into the Marines. I thought it smelled nice and so did he. The bottle  and packaging are very cool!</li>
            <li> This cologne is awesome! I heard it&#x27;s made with real bits of devil dog, and 60% of the time it works all the time. My wife told me it smells like gasoline and burns the nostrils, so I turned around, knife handed her, and told her this is the most motivated, dedicated cologne ever. I&#x27;ve been out of the corps for some time now and haven&#x27;t exercised much, and with one spray of this cologne I was able to go outside and run 3 miles in 18 minutes. I automatically remembered every word to every cadence, and didn&#x27;t develop any blisters on my feet. This cologne smells amazing; the scent is a mixture of chewing tobacco, CS gas, CLP, and gun powder. Miraculously, after using this cologne for a few days, I am PTSD free. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Wow, this cologne is the best I&#x27;ve ever used, the women love it and can&#x27;t seem to get enough of me when I wear it.  I&#x27;ve never had so much action!</li>
            <li> This is actually a great smelling cologne. You will not be disapointed.&lt;br /&gt;Try it, I&#x27;m sure you will like it.</li>
            <li> this is an amazing smell  also the bottle sill be a great collection to marines.</li>
            <li> Just got it smells awesome !!!!!!!!  My dad is a retired USMC Veteran he loves it . I will probably purchase more in the future</li>
            <li> She loves the smell. I&#x27;m sold :) 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Great smell... Bought another</li>
            <li> Smells so good! I got it for my husband for our anniversary. He Jokingly said he was hopping it would small like &amp;#34;musty sweat because that&#x27;s what we smell like in the real world&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne.  I hope it doesn&#x27;t go away. If you have a Marine in your life, you may want to surprise him with cologne.</li>
            <li> I purchased 12 of these to give as gifts during my husband&#x27;s Marine Sniper Reunion. It was a huge hit.  Smells wonderful with a light but masculine fragrance. My husband always receives compliments when he wears it.  More will be coming into this household. I might also add I have severe allergies to most fragrances and this one does not bother me at all.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery.  Cologne has a really good, manly smell to it.  I also love the bottle.  With my husband being a Marine, I thought it would be neat to have this cologne but after receiving the cologne not only will I have the bottle but my husband will also be using the cologne.  Will be ordering more from this seller.</li>
            <li> Great scent, great value, great customer service/delivery time.  Keep up the great work Parfumologie!</li>
            <li> Was a good surprise gift for my Marine.</li>
            <li> My marine son got a kick out of this...Great stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> good like the cologne put the price to high..should not have to write a report on a review good or bad</li>
