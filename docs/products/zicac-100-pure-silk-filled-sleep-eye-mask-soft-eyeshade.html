            <li>The problem with most eye masks out there is the tendency to make the eyes too warm or to feel too bulky.</li>

            <li>You will love this if you get it.  </li>
            <li>I have more than one sleep mask</li>
            <li>I like this mask better than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>For most of us, silk is the remedy for that.</li>
            <li>I love that these have no Velcro</li>
            <li>Much better than the pair I got from walgreens.</li>

            <li>I like it ok.</li>
            <li>If light keeps you from sleeping well, a silk mask is one of your best options (soft, wicks moisture, odorless).</li>
            <li>Latex rubber is used in many elastic bands</li>
            <li>In short, this is the best eye shade I have ever worn.  </li>
            <li>Most bands have velcorw, which my hair gets caught in or its so bulky you can&#x27;t lay on it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a zicac silk eye mask every night for a year, and absolutely love it.</li>

            <li>this is by far the best for sleeping if you want a light and cool eye mask.  </li>
            <li>This light weight silk mask is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Worked perfectly &amp; hung to dry... which was very quickly.</li>
            <li>This product works very good if you like total darkness when sleeping.</li>
            <li>Works great, comfortable, but the price is high for the quality.</li>
            <li>The material is soft and my eyes feel great after using it.</li>
            <li>Smooth, comfortable and adjustable!</li>
            <li>sweat a lot in the Summers, and this one is The Coolest &amp; most comfortable during those</li>

            <li>Furthermore, it feels more comfortable and lightweight on my face.  </li>
            <li>Quality product...very soft silk which fells great on your skin.</li>
            <li>This particular one isn&#x27;t as great as the eye mask I bought years ago at the neighborhood pharmacy in Paris (the Parisians need their eye masks and earplugs) , but of all the ones I&#x27;ve purchased here, it seems to be the most comfortable, It&#x27;s light, airy, and blocks out the light.</li>
            <li>When I first touched it, it was like touching a silky cloud!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not allergic or especially sensitive, this mask might be a good choice, and many other reviewers here seem to have had a very good experience with it.</li>
            <li>My room is very bright and some masks let light through underneath the mask on the side of the nose, and/or in the middle front where the eyes are...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable and blocks out light and gives me more zzzzzzz&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>but being silk it slides off my face easily.</li>
            <li>Very nice, soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>It is nice, silky, pretty and all that</li>

            <li>Super soft, great adjustable band, blocks out all light and stays in place.  </li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced, areived very quickly, is soft, comfortable and fits beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few styles and this has worked the best for the ways in which my head tosses and turns all night.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an elastic that is adjustable for a tighter fit, and it also hasn&#x27;t lost its elasticity in 1.5 years of use (unlike others that just keep stretching and stretching).</li>
            <li>I liked it so much</li>
            <li>blocks the light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s either pressing your eyelids or falling off your head, and you can see light around the edges.  </li>
            <li>It may be filled with silk.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate that kind of customer care just as much as I like the product itself.</li>

            <li>It blocked out light</li>
            <li>It does not block out light sufficiently.</li>
            <li>It blocks out the light, it&#x27;s material feels comfortable</li>
            <li>The size will fit any head.</li>
            <li>I just wish it blocked out all the light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Zicac even includes a sample of the silk so you can test for yourself that it is genuine silk.</li>
            <li>Keeps the light out.  </li>

            <li>Light and breathable but kept the light out.  </li>

            <li>Comfortable and has adjustable straps.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite these oddities, the mask itself is an extremely comfortable, silky material.  </li>
            <li>Light weight and smooth fabric.</li>
            <li>This Zicac sleeping mask is made of silk and is filled with silk.  </li>
            <li>The mask is cheap and does not keep light out.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s in light,  it seems to be a piece of silk with a headband, has no defining frame so the band puts pressure on your eyes.  </li>
            <li>Does keep the light out</li>
            <li>Blocks out the light.</li>
            <li>I value the fit as not to allow light in, softness, and washability.</li>
            <li>Light is blocked out, plus I dont have to worry about keeping my face away from the air conditioner all night.  </li>
            <li>Out like a light in no time.</li>
            <li>Completely comfortable, you don&#x27;t mind it at all while sleeping.</li>
            <li>I was worried that tossing and turning would cause the mask to pop off over the top of my head, but I am able to wear the strap under my hair and over my ears and it&#x27;s very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This would also be a good product to take with you to work to catch a few Zzz s under the bright lights employers use to try and keep you awake.</li>
            <li>What they don&#x27;t realize is that naps are good and actually make workers more productive, just look at what they do for Congress.</li>
            <li>one is very thin, which is great for preventing overheating, but somehow is perfect for blocking light on the eyes, AND all around: it also goes higher on the forehead and well around the nose</li>
            <li>one puts a smile on my face!</li>
            <li>It has an adjustable band that was able to fit my husbands fairly large head.</li>
            <li>Super comfortable, the strap is elastic and adjustable (like a bra strap, if that helps) and no velcro to get stuck in your hair.  </li>
            <li>Because it is a bit thinner than my old mask, it is actually more malleable, and I find that it blocks out the better.  </li>

            <li>Overall, it is a great product worth the $.</li>
            <li>Essentials Sweet Dreams</li>
            <li>I have used kind of scratchy polyester eye masks and this soft silk</li>
            <li>so good product : simple but efficient !</li>
            <li>The price was right and shipping was free.</li>
            <li>Luckily I got two.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best sleeping mask I have ever had, and I spent up $30 for one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Furthermore, I believe that $8.19 is too high a price for this mask, and I will make sure not to buy from that company again.</li>
            <li>Overall, I was very pleased.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re sensitive, it may be best to avoid it or be very careful with trying it out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I went for the 100% pure silk mask and not a fake material.</li>
            <li>I have found my new absolute favorite sleeping mask!</li>
            <li>This is almost exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>They are made of a super comfortable material and are very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>Feather soft, adjustable, very comfortable headband.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a straight forward eye mask - this will do just fine.</li>
            <li>Large size helps to ensure that light is fully blocked.</li>
            <li>It blocks out light very well and it is so lightweight.</li>
            <li>and they really do block out all the light.  </li>
            <li>i bought it to block out light and it does that very well when its on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft silk, it blocks out the light and stays in place!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and just so, so soft.</li>
            <li>There are MUCH better ones out that truly keep the light out for about the same price.  </li>
            <li>Soft, light weight, and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Soft and comfortable and blocks out all light even on sunny days.</li>
            <li>This mask is soft, comfortable and reliably blocks light.</li>
            <li>However, it is well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m with most of the other reviewers here, this eye mask is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Still when it stays on it works terrificly and is cool and comfortable and blocks out all light.</li>
            <li>When I went to bed that night, I found that my kitty had chewed the band right in two.  </li>
            <li>Great mask - lets no light in and helps me go to sleep!</li>
            <li>It took a few tries to figure out what was the best fit.</li>
            <li>It is light - and the strap has a little size to it which is nice.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special about it ... the design is simple but efficient cause you really can&#x27;t see any light !</li>
            <li>I too, am ordering 2 more right this second.  </li>
            <li>The mask is very comfortable and provides a total blackout.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a comfortable sleep  mask.</li>
            <li>After sending 3 back from several companies, I finally found the perfect one.</li>
            <li>Not too hot, protects well.  </li>
            <li>It is wonderfully soft, light as a feather, and the strap doesn&#x27;t cut into my face if I sleep on my side.</li>
            <li>Do your eyes get hot and sweaty under a sleep mask?</li>
            <li>What happens next is what matters most.</li>
            <li>The one I used to use was a great thick one with lots of padding.</li>
            <li>You might think that something lightweight would be comfortable, but the opposite is true.</li>
            <li>I suggest going with a much thicker eye mask and avoiding anything that says silk!</li>
            <li>But this method for me is better than red eyes all day!</li>
            <li>(added bonus, the skin on my eyelids are also moistened, tiny wrinkles alleviated)</li>
            <li>The eye mask is soft and keeps out the light and does not distrub him from sleeping.  </li>
            <li>This mask is so soft, comfortable, and stays put for me.  </li>
            <li>It breathes and does not get hot.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to replace one I had accidentally left in a hotel room, and this one is even better.  </li>
            <li>I have bought 5 different Sleep Masks from \\&quot;amazon\\&quot; in the past 2 years, and this one IS one of the Best</li>
            <li>, I would prefer it positioned higher on the mask.  </li>
            <li>My husband likes to read in bed at night, but I often am the one to go to sleep first</li>
            <li>I have real difficulty sleeping when there is light in the room (e.g., curtains open or my wife reading in bed with the light on).  </li>
            <li>Extremely soft and comfortable while still completely blacking out all light.</li>
            <li>Completely blocks light.</li>
            <li>The fabric is SOOO soft, not itchy or cheap.</li>
            <li>My first eye mask and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a larger size and covers more of my face which works better to black out light.</li>
            <li>The mask is slightly padded but relatively thin, which is a good thing, as it conforms easily to the contours of the face, blocking most of the light.  </li>
            <li>I love this as it doesn&#x27;t give me a headache, the kind of headache similar to wearing a headband like all of the other masks I&#x27;ve tried would give me.</li>
            <li>Still, the mask was easily adjusted, and it definitely blocked out more light than any other sleep mask that I have owned to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I own two zicac silk masks, my husband has one for camping trips, my mom (who travels a lot and goes to bed at all hours) has SIX because she never wants to be without them!</li>
            <li>That one was quilted, which made it nice and thick, but because of this, it did not conform to my face as well, and thus it did not block out the light quite as well as I&#x27;d hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A few years ago I bought a mask from sleep essentials that was more substantial and did keep light out.</li>
            <li>Feels great on the face, very very soft and cozy, not too thick to disrupt sleep or head position, adjuster strap very comfortable to sleep with (No velcro to stick to your hair or pillow case, just a slider adjuster that is easy to use)</li>
            <li>The strap is super soft and not just elastic, but adjustable as well!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.as easily adjusted, and it definitely blocked out more light than any other sleep mask that I have owned to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is flimsy, the elastic is cheap and barely stapled on.</li>
            <li>They have enough height to easily cover the eyes with some area around also covered.</li>
            <li>Minor complaint and still the best mask I have tried -</li>
            <li>It certainly is a sleeping mask</li>
            <li>Silk\\&quot; Really does make a Positive difference, just like they say.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and minimal, which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>originally bought just one for myself, and now have purchased more masks for a few close friends and another back-up for myself!</li>
            <li>Comes in a nice little nylon pouch, too.</li>
            <li>It is large enough to block the light</li>
            <li>Wish the cut for the eye shape was a little deeper down on the cheek for better coverage, but overall pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>It has an elastic strap which adjusts with a simple slide feature--also quite comfortable, and much preferable to Velcro, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Very well thought of...</li>
            <li>The one problem I have is it slips off during my sleep, but I suppose there isn&#x27;t much that can be done about that.</li>
            <li>very well made sleep masks.  </li>
            <li>Instructions give the scent each of burning polyester, man-made silk (seems a contradiction in terms) and real worm-made silk.  </li>
            <li>Also listed are the skin protecting and comforting qualities of worm-made real silk.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It is comfortable and totally blacks everything out.</li>
            <li>This mask is made of real silk.  </li>
            <li>I have insomnia, so I am very picky.</li>
            <li>The adjustment to fit comfortably is similar to a bra strap adjuster so no Velcro, no stretchy bands.</li>
            <li>I put it in a pillow case &amp; used the hand wash or gentle cycle in the washing machine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d buy this again, and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>They took a while to arrive, but since they really do come from overseas (Sweden or something) that is understandable.</li>
            <li>This is a very choice of silk mask.</li>
            <li>No changes to report; I just wanted to confirm that this mask continues to work out very well.  </li>
            <li>No changes to report; I just wanted to confirm that this mask continues to work out very well.  </li>
            <li>I really would like to know what its purpose is.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s real silk.</li>
            <li>This completely shuts out the light and is soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to light when I sleep, which makes having a street lamp not too far out of my window a pain.</li>
            <li>I am just in receipt of the product package and cannot vouch yet for the usability of the mask - it looks nice -  but will post another review within a few weeks time.</li>
            <li>Blocks out the light so much better than others I have used in the past!</li>
            <li>The headband is adjustable for a snug or loose fit, and is not uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>This mask is easily adjusted with no velcro to create an awkward lump on the strap, lightly insulated and very comfortable and conforming to one&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li>I sleep with an air conditioner at all times, and the vents dont do that much of a good job keeping air from blowing on my face/eye area and thats not a good thing.  </li>
            <li>The only (slight) issue I had with the mask is that I wish that the cutout for the nose had been on a greater angle so that the mask would have lied more firmly against my nose, blocking light seeping into that area.  </li>
            <li>The new masks seem to be made of the same materials and they probably work the same, but these masks are much larger than I prefer (which might be good for some).</li>
            <li>Even when he keeps the lights low, I&#x27;ve found that this can interfere with me getting a good night&#x27;s sleep, so I began using sleep masks a few years ago.  </li>
            <li>Very soft and luxurious silk!  </li>
            <li>So very soft!</li>
            <li>highly recommended -</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would like to see them make the straps a little more sturdy than they are...</li>
            <li>This mask is pretty much the opposite.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it is real silk and very gentle on eyes especially if you  have allergies or are sensitive to dust and unnatural materials.</li>
            <li>, in search for another new mask, I turned to Amazon.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a cheap one that you can go to the local pharmacy and get for the same price or cheaper without having to wait.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many sleep masks over the years-most are molded, so they do not keep my eyes closed, or flimsy, or too big.</li>
            <li>The mask is silky and feels very soft on your face.  </li>
            <li>These are very soft.</li>
            <li>Soft, compact, breathes nicely, high quality.</li>
            <li>The fabric is very soft and the mask is adjustable to the size of the person&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>Others make me warm from too much insulation or heavy wide straps.</li>
            <li>This is just soft and no fragrance...perfect!</li>
            <li>I wore this last night for the first time, and all I can say is I was in sleep heaven.  </li>
            <li>Works well to black out light.</li>
            <li>Pure silk inside and outside as advertised.</li>
            <li>My grandson was having trouble with the early morning light peeking though his shades.  </li>
            <li>This ships directly from China</li>
            <li>It is very itchy, I have only used it a couple times, and now it is banished to a box somewhere.</li>
            <li>The mask covers the eyes completely without irritation.</li>
            <li>early.</li>
            <li>Did it&#x27;s job as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t be comparing to the lowest end stuff I have for flying, but was low cost and really feels luxurious on your eyes lids.</li>
            <li>This was quite soft and works as it supposed to.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and fits naturally so you can even sleep on your stomach.</li>
            <li>This soft silk mask is so comfy to wear.</li>
            <li>It feels kind of thin, but it does the job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice sleep mask, but the elastic strap seems a bit big and thick for me.  </li>
            <li>I work nights and during the day, it&#x27;s irritating to have light leaking in by my nose right into my eyes.</li>
            <li>What I got in the second order was not quite the same as the first.</li>
            <li>The first was a black mask similar in appearance to this one, but it was not a high quality product (I received it free from a hotel), and eventually, the elastic strap broke.  </li>
            <li>This one was both relatively inexpensive and received high reviews, so I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>This is a basic eye mask, black silk, which is comfortable unless you want one that does not touch your eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Exactly what was expected.</li>
            <li>I am a side sleeper and very few sleep masks are designed this sleek and smooth on the sides.</li>
            <li>My husband then purchased me a new mask in a local drug store.  </li>
            <li>This mask is the same soft silk material on both sides so you can use either side.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love the silk feel and thin face mask.</li>
            <li>Well worth the few bucks it cost</li>
            <li>Mask is large, adjustable, not too thick (some are so thick they are hot) - this one is just right!</li>
            <li>Instead it has a nice sliding system, very thin that you can&#x27;t feel.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a single piece of elastic that holds it to your head, so it digs into your eyes in the center, and the edges are loose, thus allowing in light.  </li>
            <li>But that could be due to how much I move in my sleep and not the masks fault.</li>
            <li>The silk feels soft and comfortable next to my eyes and is soothing when my eyes feel tired.</li>
            <li>silk is so comfy and smooth and the padding is thin enough to not be bulky, but thick enough to do the job of blocking light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super minimal, simple, and black.</li>
            <li>I also appreciate that it isn&#x27;t velcro, which is super uncomfortable and I&#x27;m not sure how other people sleep with that to be honest.</li>
            <li>I fall asleep easily with a mask on, but until I began using this mask, I often awakened from the discomfort of having the straps digging into my temples or irritating the back of my head.  </li>
            <li>I found I was washing my other masks very frequently, yet</li>

            <li> Surprisingly, it is sold and shipped from China</li>
            <li> Good for travel and rooms where you cannot darken it for sleeping.</li>

            <li> In fact, I just ordered another one to be sure that I always have one handy.</li>
            <li> The problem with most eye masks out there is the tendency to make the eyes too warm or to feel too bulky.</li>

            <li> Sweet dreams!!</li>

            <li> Plus it blocks out ALL the light!</li>
            <li> I love this one.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the mask I ordered from Kastonecorp, fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so silky and really feels great on your skin.</li>
            <li> You will love this if you get it.  </li>
            <li> I have more than one sleep mask</li>
            <li> I like this mask better than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> For most of us, silk is the remedy for that.</li>
            <li> I love that these have no Velcro</li>
            <li> Much better than the pair I got from walgreens.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with the quality of the silk mask.</li>
            <li> This mask more than met my expectations!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this silk eye mask.</li>
            <li> Blocks out light nicely</li>
            <li> yet it keeps the light fully blocked!</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> I like it ok.</li>
            <li> If light keeps you from sleeping well, a silk mask is one of your best options (soft, wicks moisture, odorless).</li>
            <li> Latex rubber is used in many elastic bands</li>
            <li> In short, this is the best eye shade I have ever worn.  </li>
            <li> Most bands have velcorw, which my hair gets caught in or its so bulky you can&#x27;t lay on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a zicac silk eye mask every night for a year, and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Washes nicely and keeps the original shape</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, with a great reasonable price, and most importantly it blocks out all the light!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s adjusted for me to very nearly the loosest point, which is great because I can tighten it more</li>
            <li> This one is easily adjustable, well-made, light-weight, and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best for sleeping if you want a light and cool eye mask.  </li>
            <li> This light weight silk mask is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly &amp; hung to dry... which was very quickly.</li>
            <li> This product works very good if you like total darkness when sleeping.</li>
            <li> Works great, comfortable, but the price is high for the quality.</li>
            <li> The material is soft and my eyes feel great after using it.</li>
            <li> Smooth, comfortable and adjustable!</li>
            <li> sweat a lot in the Summers, and this one is The Coolest &amp; most comfortable during those</li>
            <li> Furthermore, it feels more comfortable and lightweight on my face.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, it feels more comfortable and lightweight on my face.  </li>
            <li> Quality product...very soft silk which fells great on your skin.</li>
            <li> This particular one isn&#x27;t as great as the eye mask I bought years ago at the neighborhood pharmacy in Paris (the Parisians need their eye masks and earplugs) , but of all the ones I&#x27;ve purchased here, it seems to be the most comfortable, It&#x27;s light, airy, and blocks out the light.</li>
            <li> When I first touched it, it was like touching a silky cloud!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not allergic or especially sensitive, this mask might be a good choice, and many other reviewers here seem to have had a very good experience with it.</li>
            <li> My room is very bright and some masks let light through underneath the mask on the side of the nose, and/or in the middle front where the eyes are...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable and blocks out light and gives me more zzzzzzz&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> but being silk it slides off my face easily.</li>
            <li> Very nice, soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> It is nice, silky, pretty and all that</li>
            <li> While this is one of the cheaper options out there this one works just fine.</li>
            <li> Now I am just wearing a cotton bandana, cheap and easy.</li>
            <li> I bought this and was surprised pleasantly at the comfort level.</li>
            <li> Super soft, great adjustable band, blocks out all light and stays in place.  </li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced, areived very quickly, is soft, comfortable and fits beautifully.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few styles and this has worked the best for the ways in which my head tosses and turns all night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an elastic that is adjustable for a tighter fit, and it also hasn&#x27;t lost its elasticity in 1.5 years of use (unlike others that just keep stretching and stretching).</li>
            <li> I liked it so much</li>
            <li> blocks the light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s either pressing your eyelids or falling off your head, and you can see light around the edges.  </li>
            <li> It may be filled with silk.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate that kind of customer care just as much as I like the product itself.</li>
            <li> I can sleep through just about anything except light.</li>
            <li> It blocked out light</li>
            <li> It does not block out light sufficiently.</li>
            <li> It blocks out the light, it&#x27;s material feels comfortable</li>
            <li> The size will fit any head.</li>
            <li> I just wish it blocked out all the light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Zicac even includes a sample of the silk so you can test for yourself that it is genuine silk.</li>
            <li> Keeps the light out.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the cheap cotton ones you used to get on airplanes.</li>
            <li> It stays on comfortably all night and does not fall off or move around.</li>
            <li> These are flimsy and light comes through.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s comfortable, adjustable and lightweight.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately didn&#x27;t cost a lot to find that out.</li>
            <li> It has an adjustable strap so it will fit anybody from fatheads to skinny size.</li>
            <li> Light and breathable but kept the light out.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on all night, but blocks light well and is comfortable.</li>
            <li> it keeps 100% of the light of of my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Comfortable and has adjustable straps.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite these oddities, the mask itself is an extremely comfortable, silky material.  </li>
            <li> Light weight and smooth fabric.</li>
            <li> This Zicac sleeping mask is made of silk and is filled with silk.  </li>
            <li> The mask is cheap and does not keep light out.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s in light,  it seems to be a piece of silk with a headband, has no defining frame so the band puts pressure on your eyes.  </li>
            <li> Does keep the light out</li>
            <li> Blocks out the light.</li>
            <li> I value the fit as not to allow light in, softness, and washability.</li>
            <li> Light is blocked out, plus I dont have to worry about keeping my face away from the air conditioner all night.  </li>
            <li> Out like a light in no time.</li>
            <li> Completely comfortable, you don&#x27;t mind it at all while sleeping.</li>
            <li> I was worried that tossing and turning would cause the mask to pop off over the top of my head, but I am able to wear the strap under my hair and over my ears and it&#x27;s very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This would also be a good product to take with you to work to catch a few Zzz s under the bright lights employers use to try and keep you awake.</li>
            <li> What they don&#x27;t realize is that naps are good and actually make workers more productive, just look at what they do for Congress.</li>
            <li> one is very thin, which is great for preventing overheating, but somehow is perfect for blocking light on the eyes, AND all around: it also goes higher on the forehead and well around the nose</li>
            <li> one puts a smile on my face!</li>
            <li> It has an adjustable band that was able to fit my husbands fairly large head.</li>
            <li> Super comfortable, the strap is elastic and adjustable (like a bra strap, if that helps) and no velcro to get stuck in your hair.  </li>
            <li> Because it is a bit thinner than my old mask, it is actually more malleable, and I find that it blocks out the better.  </li>
            <li> Because it is a bit thinner than my old mask, it is actually more malleable, and I find that it blocks out the better.  </li>
            <li> (They even include a piece of silk that you can light on fire to make sure it&#x27;s made of real silk.)</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a great product worth the $.</li>
            <li> Essentials Sweet Dreams</li>
            <li> I have used kind of scratchy polyester eye masks and this soft silk</li>
            <li> so good product : simple but efficient !</li>
            <li> The price was right and shipping was free.</li>
            <li> Luckily I got two.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best sleeping mask I have ever had, and I spent up $30 for one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Furthermore, I believe that $8.19 is too high a price for this mask, and I will make sure not to buy from that company again.</li>
            <li> Overall, I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re sensitive, it may be best to avoid it or be very careful with trying it out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I went for the 100% pure silk mask and not a fake material.</li>
            <li> I have found my new absolute favorite sleeping mask!</li>
            <li> This is almost exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> They are made of a super comfortable material and are very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> Feather soft, adjustable, very comfortable headband.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a straight forward eye mask - this will do just fine.</li>
            <li> Large size helps to ensure that light is fully blocked.</li>
            <li> It blocks out light very well and it is so lightweight.</li>
            <li> and they really do block out all the light.  </li>
            <li> i bought it to block out light and it does that very well when its on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft silk, it blocks out the light and stays in place!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and just so, so soft.</li>
            <li> There are MUCH better ones out that truly keep the light out for about the same price.  </li>
            <li> Soft, light weight, and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Soft and comfortable and blocks out all light even on sunny days.</li>
            <li> This mask is soft, comfortable and reliably blocks light.</li>
            <li> However, it is well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m with most of the other reviewers here, this eye mask is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Still when it stays on it works terrificly and is cool and comfortable and blocks out all light.</li>
            <li> When I went to bed that night, I found that my kitty had chewed the band right in two.  </li>
            <li> Great mask - lets no light in and helps me go to sleep!</li>
            <li> It took a few tries to figure out what was the best fit.</li>
            <li> It is light - and the strap has a little size to it which is nice.  </li>
            <li> Nothing special about it ... the design is simple but efficient cause you really can&#x27;t see any light !</li>
            <li> I too, am ordering 2 more right this second.  </li>
            <li> The mask is very comfortable and provides a total blackout.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a comfortable sleep  mask.</li>
            <li> After sending 3 back from several companies, I finally found the perfect one.</li>
            <li> Not too hot, protects well.  </li>
            <li> It is wonderfully soft, light as a feather, and the strap doesn&#x27;t cut into my face if I sleep on my side.</li>
            <li> Do your eyes get hot and sweaty under a sleep mask?</li>
            <li> What happens next is what matters most.</li>
            <li> The one I used to use was a great thick one with lots of padding.</li>
            <li> You might think that something lightweight would be comfortable, but the opposite is true.</li>
            <li> I suggest going with a much thicker eye mask and avoiding anything that says silk!</li>
            <li> But this method for me is better than red eyes all day!</li>
            <li> (added bonus, the skin on my eyelids are also moistened, tiny wrinkles alleviated)</li>
            <li> The eye mask is soft and keeps out the light and does not distrub him from sleeping.  </li>
            <li> This mask is so soft, comfortable, and stays put for me.  </li>
            <li> It breathes and does not get hot.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace one I had accidentally left in a hotel room, and this one is even better.  </li>
            <li> I have bought 5 different Sleep Masks from \\&quot;amazon\\&quot; in the past 2 years, and this one IS one of the Best</li>
            <li> , I would prefer it positioned higher on the mask.  </li>
            <li> My husband likes to read in bed at night, but I often am the one to go to sleep first</li>
            <li> I have real difficulty sleeping when there is light in the room (e.g., curtains open or my wife reading in bed with the light on).  </li>
            <li> Extremely soft and comfortable while still completely blacking out all light.</li>
            <li> Completely blocks light.</li>
            <li> The fabric is SOOO soft, not itchy or cheap.</li>
            <li> My first eye mask and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a larger size and covers more of my face which works better to black out light.</li>
            <li> The mask is slightly padded but relatively thin, which is a good thing, as it conforms easily to the contours of the face, blocking most of the light.  </li>
            <li> I love this as it doesn&#x27;t give me a headache, the kind of headache similar to wearing a headband like all of the other masks I&#x27;ve tried would give me.</li>
            <li> Still, the mask was easily adjusted, and it definitely blocked out more light than any other sleep mask that I have owned to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I own two zicac silk masks, my husband has one for camping trips, my mom (who travels a lot and goes to bed at all hours) has SIX because she never wants to be without them!</li>
            <li> That one was quilted, which made it nice and thick, but because of this, it did not conform to my face as well, and thus it did not block out the light quite as well as I&#x27;d hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few years ago I bought a mask from sleep essentials that was more substantial and did keep light out.</li>
            <li> Feels great on the face, very very soft and cozy, not too thick to disrupt sleep or head position, adjuster strap very comfortable to sleep with (No velcro to stick to your hair or pillow case, just a slider adjuster that is easy to use)</li>
            <li> The strap is super soft and not just elastic, but adjustable as well!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.as easily adjusted, and it definitely blocked out more light than any other sleep mask that I have owned to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is flimsy, the elastic is cheap and barely stapled on.</li>
            <li> They have enough height to easily cover the eyes with some area around also covered.</li>
            <li> Minor complaint and still the best mask I have tried -</li>
            <li> It certainly is a sleeping mask</li>
            <li> Silk\\&quot; Really does make a Positive difference, just like they say.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and minimal, which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> originally bought just one for myself, and now have purchased more masks for a few close friends and another back-up for myself!</li>
            <li> Comes in a nice little nylon pouch, too.</li>
            <li> It is large enough to block the light</li>
            <li> Wish the cut for the eye shape was a little deeper down on the cheek for better coverage, but overall pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> It has an elastic strap which adjusts with a simple slide feature--also quite comfortable, and much preferable to Velcro, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> Very well thought of...</li>
            <li> The one problem I have is it slips off during my sleep, but I suppose there isn&#x27;t much that can be done about that.</li>
            <li> very well made sleep masks.  </li>
            <li> Instructions give the scent each of burning polyester, man-made silk (seems a contradiction in terms) and real worm-made silk.  </li>
            <li> Also listed are the skin protecting and comforting qualities of worm-made real silk.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It is comfortable and totally blacks everything out.</li>
            <li> This mask is made of real silk.  </li>
            <li> I have insomnia, so I am very picky.</li>
            <li> The adjustment to fit comfortably is similar to a bra strap adjuster so no Velcro, no stretchy bands.</li>
            <li> I put it in a pillow case &amp; used the hand wash or gentle cycle in the washing machine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d buy this again, and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> They took a while to arrive, but since they really do come from overseas (Sweden or something) that is understandable.</li>
            <li> This is a very choice of silk mask.</li>
            <li> No changes to report; I just wanted to confirm that this mask continues to work out very well.  </li>
            <li> No changes to report; I just wanted to confirm that this mask continues to work out very well.  </li>
            <li> I really would like to know what its purpose is.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s real silk.</li>
            <li> This completely shuts out the light and is soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to light when I sleep, which makes having a street lamp not too far out of my window a pain.</li>
            <li> I am just in receipt of the product package and cannot vouch yet for the usability of the mask - it looks nice -  but will post another review within a few weeks time.</li>
            <li> Blocks out the light so much better than others I have used in the past!</li>
            <li> The headband is adjustable for a snug or loose fit, and is not uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This mask is easily adjusted with no velcro to create an awkward lump on the strap, lightly insulated and very comfortable and conforming to one&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li> I sleep with an air conditioner at all times, and the vents dont do that much of a good job keeping air from blowing on my face/eye area and thats not a good thing.  </li>
            <li> The only (slight) issue I had with the mask is that I wish that the cutout for the nose had been on a greater angle so that the mask would have lied more firmly against my nose, blocking light seeping into that area.  </li>
            <li> The new masks seem to be made of the same materials and they probably work the same, but these masks are much larger than I prefer (which might be good for some).</li>
            <li> Even when he keeps the lights low, I&#x27;ve found that this can interfere with me getting a good night&#x27;s sleep, so I began using sleep masks a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> Very soft and luxurious silk!  </li>
            <li> So very soft!</li>
            <li> highly recommended -</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would like to see them make the straps a little more sturdy than they are...</li>
            <li> This mask is pretty much the opposite.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it is real silk and very gentle on eyes especially if you  have allergies or are sensitive to dust and unnatural materials.</li>
            <li> , in search for another new mask, I turned to Amazon.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a cheap one that you can go to the local pharmacy and get for the same price or cheaper without having to wait.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many sleep masks over the years-most are molded, so they do not keep my eyes closed, or flimsy, or too big.</li>
            <li> The mask is silky and feels very soft on your face.  </li>
            <li> These are very soft.</li>
            <li> Soft, compact, breathes nicely, high quality.</li>
            <li> The fabric is very soft and the mask is adjustable to the size of the person&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> Others make me warm from too much insulation or heavy wide straps.</li>
            <li> This is just soft and no fragrance...perfect!</li>
            <li> I wore this last night for the first time, and all I can say is I was in sleep heaven.  </li>
            <li> Works well to black out light.</li>
            <li> Pure silk inside and outside as advertised.</li>
            <li> My grandson was having trouble with the early morning light peeking though his shades.  </li>
            <li> This ships directly from China</li>
            <li> It is very itchy, I have only used it a couple times, and now it is banished to a box somewhere.</li>
            <li> The mask covers the eyes completely without irritation.</li>
            <li> early.</li>
            <li> Did it&#x27;s job as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t be comparing to the lowest end stuff I have for flying, but was low cost and really feels luxurious on your eyes lids.</li>
            <li> This was quite soft and works as it supposed to.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and fits naturally so you can even sleep on your stomach.</li>
            <li> This soft silk mask is so comfy to wear.</li>
            <li> It feels kind of thin, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice sleep mask, but the elastic strap seems a bit big and thick for me.  </li>
            <li> I work nights and during the day, it&#x27;s irritating to have light leaking in by my nose right into my eyes.</li>
            <li> What I got in the second order was not quite the same as the first.</li>
            <li> The first was a black mask similar in appearance to this one, but it was not a high quality product (I received it free from a hotel), and eventually, the elastic strap broke.  </li>
            <li> This one was both relatively inexpensive and received high reviews, so I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> This is a basic eye mask, black silk, which is comfortable unless you want one that does not touch your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was expected.</li>
            <li> I am a side sleeper and very few sleep masks are designed this sleek and smooth on the sides.</li>
            <li> My husband then purchased me a new mask in a local drug store.  </li>
            <li> This mask is the same soft silk material on both sides so you can use either side.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love the silk feel and thin face mask.</li>
            <li> Well worth the few bucks it cost</li>
            <li> Mask is large, adjustable, not too thick (some are so thick they are hot) - this one is just right!</li>
            <li> Instead it has a nice sliding system, very thin that you can&#x27;t feel.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a single piece of elastic that holds it to your head, so it digs into your eyes in the center, and the edges are loose, thus allowing in light.  </li>
            <li> But that could be due to how much I move in my sleep and not the masks fault.</li>
            <li> The silk feels soft and comfortable next to my eyes and is soothing when my eyes feel tired.</li>
            <li> silk is so comfy and smooth and the padding is thin enough to not be bulky, but thick enough to do the job of blocking light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super minimal, simple, and black.</li>
            <li> I also appreciate that it isn&#x27;t velcro, which is super uncomfortable and I&#x27;m not sure how other people sleep with that to be honest.</li>
            <li> I fall asleep easily with a mask on, but until I began using this mask, I often awakened from the discomfort of having the straps digging into my temples or irritating the back of my head.  </li>
            <li> I found I was washing my other masks very frequently, yet</li>
            <li> The problem with those is the small size--if they shift even just a little, then you get a light leak.</li>
            <li> Cant say enough how soft and cozy the silk filling feels as well as the mask itself.</li>
            <li> And I barely feel it on when it&#x27;s on-unlike other sleeping masks with bulgy straps.</li>
            <li> I had previously bought a few masks that claimed to be real silk but were actually nylon.  </li>
            <li> When I bought this sleep mask, I was a bit skeptical because I never thought sleep masks would be comfortable.</li>
            <li> Also the straps are thins but wide enough</li>
            <li> , shipping was a bit long</li>
            <li> so it will take a long time to get</li>
            <li> I like the strap to be snug enough to keep my eyes closed</li>
            <li> Shipping didn&#x27;t take too long.</li>
            <li> And when my order took a long time due to a shipping error, a company representative emailed me with the explanation and a heartfelt apology.</li>
            <li> This is my go to sleeping mask for as long as I need one!</li>
            <li> Plus I have dry eye problems and have begun to sleep with a strip of saran wrap over my eyes to keep them moist.  </li>
            <li> It came in a small package, wrapped only in plastic and accompanied by two things:  1) instructions that were entirely in Chinese (not that one really requires instructions for an eye mask, but still...), and 2) a small scrap of black fabric in a separate plastic bag, which I presume (since I cannot read the Chinese instructions) is intended to be used as a patch for the fabric</li>
            <li> Moreover, there is a single strap (not a double one, as is so common) and the strap is completely adjustable.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and she loves them, uses them every single night.  </li>
            <li> I do have a smaller head than average though</li>
            <li> Another reviewer had issue with the labeling being in Chinese-I did not care about that, but these had absolutely no labeling which I found strange.</li>
            <li> I have tried probably seven or eight different eye shades in the past, all with various degrees of discomfort.  </li>
            <li> It fits over the eyes so softly that you hardly know you are wearing it over the face.  </li>
            <li> , it helps to relax my eyes and keep them closed when I sleep.  </li>
            <li> I cannot keep my eyes totally closed at night, so</li>
            <li> I have washed it with the regular laundry a few times and it has held up well.</li>
            <li> Packaging is minimal.</li>
            <li> just a few english titles.  </li>
            <li> This is lightweight and effective and does not have an annoying scent like some others.  </li>
            <li> the mask is very small and doesn&#x27;t cover your eyes completely.</li>
            <li> soft, pretty dark, not great-fitting but not too bad.</li>
            <li> I did not pay attention to the seller when I reordered and it was some other company.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Or lying on my side the other masks pinched my ear.</li>
            <li> i purchased this mask because of other reviews.</li>
            <li> But other than that, it works well.</li>
            <li> Or perhaps the itchiness of this mask (also noted by another reviewer) may have been due to some other property of it.</li>
            <li> But a small irregular piece of fabric in a tiny separate plastic bag is included.  </li>
            <li> Eyeball movement isn&#x27;t a problem--I never feel it is too tight, probably because the straps are widely adjustable.</li>
            <li> We all make occasional mistakes, no matter how hard we try to avoid them.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it slides off my head at night.</li>
            <li> Obviously I waited quite a while for this to be delivered secondary to place of origin.</li>
            <li> Its almost as if its not there bc its so soft &amp; thin</li>
            <li> (although it, too, may slide down.</li>
            <li> I wish they had offered to send another one much earlier, this was just a little to late to be of value to me.</li>
            <li> A month and a half to receive...  </li>
            <li> It took slightly over a month to arrive from China, so don&#x27;t order it if you need one sooner.</li>
            <li> I had bought a different brand with a lavender in the filling that actually made me ill by the smell.  </li>
            <li> it fits a lil too tight around my head even with just 1 band.</li>
            <li> Band is too tight.</li>
            <li> If I tightened it too tight, I could feel the elastic band pressing on my eyes.</li>
            <li> My 2 little dogs manage to wake me</li>
            <li> This mask is lighter and  a little softer than the Bucky.</li>
            <li> I washed it a few times in the washer too, no problems.</li>
            <li> it took a long time to get and it was not worth what I paid for it not happy at all</li>
            <li> , so it took a few days longer than usual to arrive.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> If I have a difficult night trying to sleep, I find that my eyelashes are wacked out the next morning because of eye</li>
            <li> Seems a bit excessive for something that weighs about 2 oz.</li>
            <li> Too small for my face and slide all over the place .</li>
            <li> but it is too small to stay in place.</li>
            <li> This one has just an adjustment clip and is small so it does not interfere with me sleeping.</li>
            <li> Has a creepy feel and the single band is not comfortable.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong really just that it is difficult for me to get used to having something on my face while sleeping.</li>
            <li> but if you want it buy it at least two months ahead of time.</li>
            <li> The strap is also comfortable, which other masks fail at horribly.</li>
            <li> also it is very thin and the cheap thin elastic band must be made very tight to hold the mask in place,this in turn makes it very uncomfortable to wear!</li>
            <li> As far as sleeping masks go, this one does not look stupid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using eye masks since college and in that time gave tried about a dozen options from the paper thin, awful plastic ones like you used to get on long flights to enormous, plush chenille masks from bed, bath, and beyond.</li>
            <li> Both are WAY cheaper, and at least there are TWO well-placed straps on the XR, which keeps it OVER your eyes!</li>
            <li> It is just what I needed for sleeping late on a sunny morning!</li>
            <li> Alas, for me this mask produced severe itching and hives.  </li>
            <li> but they were so expensive.  </li>
            <li> I could not get used to the uncomfortable feeling on my eyes.  </li>
            <li> and they are adjustable WITHOUT VELCRO which I hate (catches hair and is too thick/bumpy behind my head).</li>
            <li> I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I was very disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get this because I ordered it with plenty of time.</li>
            <li> however i am very disappointed in the product itself!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft silk, it blocks out the light and stays in place!  I&#x27;m a side sleeper;  this one does not get in the way.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this one and will buy a &#x27;supply&#x27; soon!</li>
            <li> I love everything about this mask. After sending 3 back from several companies, I finally found the perfect one. My room is very bright and some masks let light through underneath the mask on the side of the nose, and/or in the middle front where the eyes are...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is very thin, which is great for preventing overheating, but somehow is perfect for blocking light on the eyes, AND all around: it also goes higher on the forehead and well around the nose and well underneath the eyes. Also the straps are thins but wide enough and they are adjustable WITHOUT VELCRO which I hate (catches hair and is too thick/bumpy behind my head). Instead it has a nice sliding system, very thin that you can&#x27;t feel. Very well thought of...</li>
            <li> Just a couple of pieces of silk that folds over when you put it on. Your better off using a sweat band.</li>
            <li> Love the silk feel and thin face mask. Forever can be used!</li>
            <li> Really nice don&#x27;t know you have it on it feel great on sort to touch really nice I like Nuff said</li>
            <li> I love this product! It is comfortable smooth and rests perfectly on my eyes without too much pressure! Plus it blocks out ALL the light!</li>
            <li> Mask is large, adjustable, not too thick (some are so thick they are hot) - this one is just right!</li>
            <li> it took a long time to get and it was not worth what I paid for it not happy at all</li>
            <li> This is the best eye mask out there. It&#x27;s comfortable and blocks out light and gives me more zzzzzzz&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve tried a few styles and this has worked the best for the ways in which my head tosses and turns all night. The contour masks don&#x27;t really work for a side sleeper, but this one is perfect for that. It&#x27;s easy to clean and just so, so soft. The strap is also comfortable, which other masks fail at horribly. It&#x27;s an elastic that is adjustable for a tighter fit, and it also hasn&#x27;t lost its elasticity in 1.5 years of use (unlike others that just keep stretching and stretching). I also appreciate that it isn&#x27;t velcro, which is super uncomfortable and I&#x27;m not sure how other people sleep with that to be honest. I love this one. And the price is perfect. I have two so I can wash one every now and then. The best investment for having a good night&#x27;s rest!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the mask I ordered from Kastonecorp, fulfilled by Amazon. It blocks out light very well and it is so lightweight. I liked it so much I ordered two more--one to travel with and one to gift. I did not pay attention to the seller when I reordered and it was some other company. What I got in the second order was not quite the same as the first. The new masks seem to be made of the same materials and they probably work the same, but these masks are much larger than I prefer (which might be good for some). Another reviewer had issue with the labeling being in Chinese-I did not care about that, but these had absolutely no labeling which I found strange. I think it matters which seller you choose and I preferred the product offered by Kastonecorp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so silky and really feels great on your skin. I&#x27;m so glad I went for the 100% pure silk mask and not a fake material. This is almost exactly what I was looking for! The only problem I have with it is that the mask seemed to be too big for my face. The silk touched both of my ears, which was still comfortable but seemed unnecessary. I do have a smaller head than average though so that probably has a lot to do with it!</li>
            <li> Not too hot, protects well.  blocks the light.Well designed double elastic.  You will love this if you get it.  but one!</li>
            <li> The best eye mask I&#x27;ve used.  Very comfortable and you can adjust the band for the perfect fit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something to help me sleep during the day, as I work at night. This completely shuts out the light and is soft. The one problem I have is it slips off during my sleep, but I suppose there isn&#x27;t much that can be done about that.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a single piece of elastic that holds it to your head, so it digs into your eyes in the center, and the edges are loose, thus allowing in light.  I just went to return it, and they don&#x27;t take returns.  There are MUCH better ones out that truly keep the light out for about the same price.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> A month and a half to receive...  It&#x27;s either pressing your eyelids or falling off your head, and you can see light around the edges.  I could never sleep in this.  It may be filled with silk.  Or cotton.  Maybe I&#x27;ll cut it open to see ...</li>
            <li> I have more than one sleep mask but this feels the best of them all. It is large enough to block the light so I can sleep. It is wonderfully soft, light as a feather, and the strap doesn&#x27;t cut into my face if I sleep on my side. It&#x27;s also lightweight enough that I can keep it tucked in my purse when I&#x27;m traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, shipping was a bit long but I&#x27;d order another one without hesitation. The price was right and shipping was free. No complaints whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I ordered two of these very well made sleep masks.  I took a nap a couple of hours after I received them and unintentionally left it on the bed when I got up.  When I went to bed that night, I found that my kitty had chewed the band right in two.  Luckily I got two.  The mask is silky and feels very soft on your face.  I will replace the one Kitty got!</li>
            <li> The Zicac would touch my eyelashes when I blinked.  Masks with cups can be found in about the same price range.  After buying this one, I tried and liked these three others better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bucky 40 Blinks Mask Ultralight Eye Mask,Black,One Size&lt;br /&gt;Dream Essentials Sweet Dreams Contoured Sleep Mask with Earplugs and Carry Pouch, Black&lt;br /&gt;Macks Dreamweaver Contoured Sleep Mask</li>
            <li> I like this mask better than others I&#x27;ve tried. This one is easily adjustable, well-made, light-weight, and very comfortable. Do your eyes get hot and sweaty under a sleep mask? For most of us, silk is the remedy for that. And when my order took a long time due to a shipping error, a company representative emailed me with the explanation and a heartfelt apology. I appreciate that kind of customer care just as much as I like the product itself. We all make occasional mistakes, no matter how hard we try to avoid them. What happens next is what matters most.</li>
            <li> I can sleep through just about anything except light. I started wearing an eye mask on occasion years ago when I worked the night shift. The one I used to use was a great thick one with lots of padding. It blocked out light and I loved it! This mask is pretty much the opposite. It is flimsy, the elastic is cheap and barely stapled on. It does not block out light sufficiently. You might think that something lightweight would be comfortable, but the opposite is true. I suggest going with a much thicker eye mask and avoiding anything that says silk!</li>
            <li> I ordered this 6 weeks before we went on vacation and never received it. I contacted the company twice and they said they sent it but I never received it. Amazon refunded my money but I was very disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get this because I ordered it with plenty of time. The company couldn&#x27;t provide tracking information when I asked for it. I&#x27;m sure this is a good product but if you want it buy it at least two months ahead of time. They offered to send another one two days before we left for our trip. I wish they had offered to send another one much earlier, this was just a little to late to be of value to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m with most of the other reviewers here, this eye mask is fantastic! I&#x27;ve been sleeping with eye masks for years, but always just the freebies from hotels and airplanes. The problem with those is the small size--if they shift even just a little, then you get a light leak. Because this one covers a much larger area of your face, so even if it doesn&#x27;t stay fully put while you toss and turn, your eyeballs and surrounding area are still covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The silk is so comfy and smooth and the padding is thin enough to not be bulky, but thick enough to do the job of blocking light. Also! As far as sleeping masks go, this one does not look stupid. It&#x27;s super minimal, simple, and black. No tacky girly embroidery, no logo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought just one for myself, and now have purchased more masks for a few close friends and another back-up for myself!</li>
            <li> It blocks out the light, it&#x27;s material feels comfortable but since it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;one size fits all&amp;#34; kinda product, it doesn&#x27;t cling to my face the way I hoped. But it still does the job after some tinkering so no stars off for that lol.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice satin/silk feel to it.</li>
            <li> I love that these have no Velcro and they really do block out all the light.  Much better than the pair I got from walgreens.</li>
            <li> While this is one of the cheaper options out there this one works just fine. It feels kind of thin, but it does the job. I would buy it again if I needed another one.</li>
            <li> This ships directly from China so it will take a long time to get and it&#x27;s bypassing US Customs safety checks (chemicals etc...). It certainly is a sleeping mask but it&#x27;s a cheap one that you can go to the local pharmacy and get for the same price or cheaper without having to wait.</li>
            <li> This is a basic eye mask, black silk, which is comfortable unless you want one that does not touch your eyelashes. It took slightly over a month to arrive from China, so don&#x27;t order it if you need one sooner. I prefer the \\&quot;Earth Therapeutics (or Dream Zone) Shut Eye Sleep Mask\\&quot;--I ordered 4 of those from Amazon.</li>
            <li> The best eye mask. Super soft, great adjustable band, blocks out all light and stays in place.  Great for travel and home use.  Washes nicely and keeps the original shape</li>
            <li> Very good product for the right price.The size will fit any head.Made from good fabric that will not irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> The silky fabric does not make up for the 4-6 week delivery timeline to receive the product. Perhaps there was a terrific revolt at the Zicac slave labor camp which resulted in shipment delays?</li>
            <li> Works well to black out light. It&#x27;s a larger size and covers more of my face which works better to black out light.</li>
            <li> The product is excellent, light and comfortable.the 100 percent silk gives you a nice soft feel. I recommend it!  Zicac. Really came threw with this product, very happy and will order more for my family .</li>
            <li> Super comfortable, the strap is elastic and adjustable (like a bra strap, if that helps) and no velcro to get stuck in your hair.  I like the strap to be snug enough to keep my eyes closed, it helps to relax my eyes and keep them closed when I sleep.  My eyes are no longer red in the morning.  I was worried that tossing and turning would cause the mask to pop off over the top of my head, but I am able to wear the strap under my hair and over my ears and it&#x27;s very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 2 downsides for me:&lt;br /&gt;1. If I have a difficult night trying to sleep, I find that my eyelashes are wacked out the next morning because of eye movement.&lt;br /&gt;2. I&#x27;m a side-sleeper, and often sleep on my face.  The mask leaves marks across my cheeks and over my eyes.  I tend to wake up a couple hours before I need to, so I just take the mask off and doze until I need to get up, giving my skin time to relax.  But this method for me is better than red eyes all day!</li>
            <li> It is 100% silk like advertised. I just wish it blocked out all the light. I work nights and during the day, it&#x27;s irritating to have light leaking in by my nose right into my eyes. I have to use a second mask in order to compensate. The material is soft and my eyes feel great after using it. I received the package earlier than promised, so there&#x27;s that.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with the quality of the silk mask. I have been using it for about a month now and it is holding up quite well.</li>
            <li> This mask more than met my expectations!&lt;br /&gt;Zicac even includes a sample of the silk so you can test for yourself that it is genuine silk. You set it on fire. Instructions give the scent each of burning polyester, man-made silk (seems a contradiction in terms) and real worm-made silk.  Also listed are the skin protecting and comforting qualities of worm-made real silk.  I have used kind of scratchy polyester eye masks and this soft silk one puts a smile on my face!</li>
            <li> I could actually still threw this mask so I wasn&#x27;t all that content.&lt;br /&gt;Plus it fits a lil too tight around my head even with just 1 band.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT SLEEP MASK, VERY COMFY!!! LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is lightweight and effective and does not have an annoying scent like some others.  Wish I&#x27;d bought it years ago!</li>
            <li> Keeps the light out.  Plus I have dry eye problems and have begun to sleep with a strip of saran wrap over my eyes to keep them moist.  Then I put this baby over the saran wrap to keep it in place.  Works like a charm!  (added bonus, the skin on my eyelids are also moistened, tiny wrinkles alleviated)</li>
            <li> My grandson was having trouble with the early morning light peeking though his shades.  He has me to get him black-out blinds but they were so expensive.  So I found these and ordered for him and he loves them!  The eye mask is soft and keeps out the light and does not distrub him from sleeping.  He does not go anywhere without his mask.</li>
            <li> It is very itchy, I have only used it a couple times, and now it is banished to a box somewhere. I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> this is junk. Has a creepy feel and the single band is not comfortable. I prefer the cheap cotton ones you used to get on airplanes.</li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T KNOW IF IT IS THIS MASK OR IF ALL OF THEM FEEL LIKE THIS.  I HAVE TRIED TO USE; HOWEVER I REALIZE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT IT IS OFF.  PERHAPS IT JUST TAKES GETTING USED TO.</li>
            <li> This is a great sleep mask but it might be too silky for its own good as several times I have woken up with it in my hair! Still when it stays on it works terrificly and is cool and comfortable and blocks out all light. I would recommend it and it has an excellent price.</li>
            <li> These are very soft. They mold around the front of the face well.  They have enough height to easily cover the eyes with some area around also covered.</li>
            <li> This mask is so soft, comfortable, and stays put for me.  If you are a restless sleeper, perhaps it wouldn&#x27;t.  I find it does the job I needed.  I recommend this mask.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this silk eye mask. It is very comfortable, very good quality and it is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever owned in keeping all light out. It stays on comfortably all night and does not fall off or move around. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> To thin  when tried on and the light comes in the sides. Band is too tight. Returned item for refund</li>
            <li> It works perfect for my needs. It is comfortable and totally blacks everything out. I would buy it again and have suggested it to my friends.</li>
            <li> This is the best sleeping mask I have used. Soft, light weight, and comfortable. The mask covers the eyes completely without irritation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice sleep mask, but the elastic strap seems a bit big and thick for me.  Other than that it&#x27;s good.  Wish I would have known it was shipping from Hong Kong and would take 5 weeks to get here, though.  Seems a bit excessive for something that weighs about 2 oz.</li>
            <li> The search is over! I cannot keep my eyes totally closed at night, so a sleep mask is a must to protect my eyes from drying out. I&#x27;ve tried many sleep masks over the years-most are molded, so they do not keep my eyes closed, or flimsy, or too big. This one fits perfectly the strap is sturdy and easily adjustable, and it is so soft. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a comfortable sleep  mask. I even bought 2 more as backups!</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, with a great reasonable price, and most importantly it blocks out all the light! I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This worked great, arrived long before its estimated delivery date, and was at a great price.  I would like to see them make the straps a little more sturdy than they are...that was the only reason for 4 stars rather than 5.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit the greatest but it gets the job done.  I am happy for what I paid for it.  Shipping didn&#x27;t take too long.</li>
            <li> I bought this and was surprised pleasantly at the comfort level. It works great and does not slip around while I sleep. Soft and comfortable and blocks out all light even on sunny days. If you need more darkness go for this!!</li>
            <li> I had previously bought a few masks that claimed to be real silk but were actually nylon.  This mask is made of real silk.  It breathes and does not get hot.  The strap is adjustable which is a nice feature.  I have washed it with the regular laundry a few times and it has held up well.</li>
            <li> Excellent! I&#x27;m a day sleeper and this mask is perfect for dimming the atmosphere and allowing me to fall asleep so much easier than before. Good quality material and craftsmanship is excellent.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this eye mask! Eye masks are like a box of chocolates..you know the rest. But this one is fab!</li>
            <li> Very soft and luxurious silk!  Very impressed with quality of silk and how it feels.  I had bought a different brand with a lavender in the filling that actually made me ill by the smell.  This is just soft and no fragrance...perfect!</li>
            <li> These are flimsy and light comes through.  Now I am just wearing a cotton bandana, cheap and easy.</li>
            <li> This has changed my life.  My 2 little dogs manage to wake me&lt;br /&gt;very early. This very comfortable mask lets me return to slumber&lt;br /&gt;immediately.  The use of a mask makes it very easy to turn off&lt;br /&gt;the mind and return to sleep. Also getting to sleep is faster.&lt;br /&gt;Try it. This has been a boone for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice just moves when you sleep and some light gets in.</li>
            <li> Smooth, comfortable and adjustable! No lumpy velcro, hurrah!! Blocks out light nicely and I think will last longer that the elastic banded kinds.</li>
            <li> This sleeping mask is great--it&#x27;s comfortable, adjustable and lightweight.  It is exactly as advertised and it arrived in perfect condition well within the estimated shipping window.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first as I have tried many sleep masks only to be disappointed. I have found my new absolute favorite sleeping mask! Its almost as if its not there bc its so soft &amp; thin yet it keeps the light fully blocked! I have insomnia, so I am very picky. I love this as it doesn&#x27;t give me a headache, the kind of headache similar to wearing a headband like all of the other masks I&#x27;ve tried would give me. Or lying on my side the other masks pinched my ear. The adjustment to fit comfortably is similar to a bra strap adjuster so no Velcro, no stretchy bands. Its great! I found I was washing my other masks very frequently, yet this I&#x27;ve only washed once. I put it in a pillow case &amp; used the hand wash or gentle cycle in the washing machine. Worked perfectly &amp; hung to dry... which was very quickly. This is my go to sleeping mask for as long as I need one!</li>
            <li> This sleeping mask is just perfect. When I first touched it, it was like touching a silky cloud! Love it. And I barely feel it on when it&#x27;s on-unlike other sleeping masks with bulgy straps. It also has No scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace one I had accidentally left in a hotel room, and this one is even better.  Very reasonably priced, areived very quickly, is soft, comfortable and fits beautifully.  I will try not to lose this one!</li>
            <li> Too small for my face and slide all over the place . And although I saw the reviews and said it had no eye cut-outs , I bought it anyway and it is a problem .</li>
            <li> Nothing special about it ... the design is simple but efficient cause you really can&#x27;t see any light ! and that&#x27;s what you ask for ! so good product : simple but efficient ! go for it !</li>
            <li> I give it two stars because it may work for some. It is nice, silky, pretty and all that but it is falling of my head during the night, slides of my head without any problem especially if my hair (slippery) is down.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer masks with two strings that hold it. Otherwise, it is real silk and very gentle on eyes especially if you  have allergies or are sensitive to dust and unnatural materials.</li>
            <li> Works great, comfortable, but the price is high for the quality.</li>
            <li> The silk is really nice but it is too small to stay in place. Fortunately didn&#x27;t cost a lot to find that out.</li>
            <li> This product works very good if you like total darkness when sleeping. It has an adjustable strap so it will fit anybody from fatheads to skinny size. I work nights so this product helps me sleep during the day. This would also be a good product to take with you to work to catch a few Zzz s under the bright lights employers use to try and keep you awake. What they don&#x27;t realize is that naps are good and actually make workers more productive, just look at what they do for Congress. ☺&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll be very pleased with this product. The only thing it won&#x27;t do is cure snoring.</li>
            <li> Silk feels great, good adjustable strap.  Wish the cut for the eye shape was a little deeper down on the cheek for better coverage, but overall pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> Light and breathable but kept the light out.  Did it&#x27;s job as far as I&#x27;m concerned. If you are looking for an inexpensive eye mask this is the one.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best sleeping mask I have ever had, and I spent up $30 for one. It is very comfortable, and block light perfectly!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on all night, but blocks light well and is comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have bought 5 different Sleep Masks from \\&quot;amazon\\&quot; in the past 2 years, and this one IS one of the Best two!&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;100% Silk\\&quot; Really does make a Positive difference, just like they say. It is the Softest of them all.&lt;br /&gt;And it keeps 100% of the light of of my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I sweat a lot in the Summers, and this one is The Coolest &amp; most comfortable during those conditions.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy this again, and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great mask - lets no light in and helps me go to sleep!</li>
            <li> I ordered 4 different I mask and this is by far the best for sleeping if you want a light and cool eye mask.  This mask is easily adjusted with no velcro to create an awkward lump on the strap, lightly insulated and very comfortable and conforming to one&#x27;s face.  Others make me warm from too much insulation or heavy wide straps. The only complain I have is the strap is at mid eye position which makes it sit directly above the ear, I would prefer it positioned higher on the mask.  Minor complaint and still the best mask I have tried - highly recommended - I now have 4 of them.</li>
            <li> Wow.  I just bought this to replace my cheapy travel mask and I need to use on occasion at home to help get to sleep. Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t be comparing to the lowest end stuff I have for flying, but was low cost and really feels luxurious on your eyes lids. Well worth the few bucks it cost</li>
            <li> Comfortable and has adjustable straps. Bigger than the unit I lost, but still works ok. I like it ok. Thanks</li>
            <li> This mask is the same soft silk material on both sides so you can use either side.&lt;br /&gt;I got it on Amazon on sale for under $6 delivered (using Prime) so you might want to put a price watch on it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll order another if the sale comes back!</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and she loves them, uses them every single night.  They are made of a super comfortable material and are very inexpensive.  They took a while to arrive, but since they really do come from overseas (Sweden or something) that is understandable.</li>
            <li> This was quite soft and works as it supposed to.  It is light - and the strap has a little size to it which is nice.  If you are looking for a straight forward eye mask - this will do just fine.</li>
            <li> If light keeps you from sleeping well, a silk mask is one of your best options (soft, wicks moisture, odorless). This is a very choice of silk mask. I have purchased two now.</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with this product. It is excellent for naps and sleeping in. The silk feels soft and comfortable next to my eyes and is soothing when my eyes feel tired.</li>
            <li> soft, pretty dark, not great-fitting but not too bad. For the price, it does the job. I wouldn&#x27;t count on it for long-term life but it works well for travel pouch.</li>
            <li> Perfect size, washes well, can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> My husband likes to read in bed at night, but I often am the one to go to sleep first given that I have to get up earlier for work in the morning.  Even when he keeps the lights low, I&#x27;ve found that this can interfere with me getting a good night&#x27;s sleep, so I began using sleep masks a few years ago.  The first was a black mask similar in appearance to this one, but it was not a high quality product (I received it free from a hotel), and eventually, the elastic strap broke.  My husband then purchased me a new mask in a local drug store.  That one was quilted, which made it nice and thick, but because of this, it did not conform to my face as well, and thus it did not block out the light quite as well as I&#x27;d hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in search for another new mask, I turned to Amazon.  This one was both relatively inexpensive and received high reviews, so I decided to try it.  Surprisingly, it is sold and shipped from China, so it took a few days longer than usual to arrive.  It came in a small package, wrapped only in plastic and accompanied by two things:  1) instructions that were entirely in Chinese (not that one really requires instructions for an eye mask, but still...), and 2) a small scrap of black fabric in a separate plastic bag, which I presume (since I cannot read the Chinese instructions) is intended to be used as a patch for the fabric if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite these oddities, the mask itself is an extremely comfortable, silky material.  It has an elastic strap which adjusts with a simple slide feature--also quite comfortable, and much preferable to Velcro, in my opinion.  The mask is slightly padded but relatively thin, which is a good thing, as it conforms easily to the contours of the face, blocking most of the light.  The only (slight) issue I had with the mask is that I wish that the cutout for the nose had been on a greater angle so that the mask would have lied more firmly against my nose, blocking light seeping into that area.  Still, the mask was easily adjusted, and it definitely blocked out more light than any other sleep mask that I have owned to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I definitely would recommend this product, and I will update my review if there are any changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 9/18/13:  No changes to report; I just wanted to confirm that this mask continues to work out very well.  Because it is a bit thinner than my old mask, it is actually more malleable, and I find that it blocks out the better.  Furthermore, it feels more comfortable and lightweight on my face.  I highly recommend this product.as easily adjusted, and it definitely blocked out more light than any other sleep mask that I have owned to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I definitely would recommend this product, and I will update my review if there are any changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 9/18/13:  No changes to report; I just wanted to confirm that this mask continues to work out very well.

            <li> i purchased this mask because of other reviews. however i am very disappointed in the product itself! the mask is very small and doesn&#x27;t cover your eyes completely. also it is very thin and the cheap thin elastic band must be made very tight to hold the mask in place,this in turn makes it very uncomfortable to wear! it took two weeks to arrive, what a disappointment!&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted! Good for travel and rooms where you cannot darken it for sleeping. Light weight and smooth fabric.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d go with Dream Zone Therapeutic or even the XR Brand. Both are WAY cheaper, and at least there are TWO well-placed straps on the XR, which keeps it OVER your eyes! The Dream Zone is just as comfy as this one, and smell great. (although it, too, may slide down.</li>
            <li> The mask is very comfortable and provides a total blackout.  It is just what I needed for sleeping late on a sunny morning!</li>
            <li> this is a good buy. but being silk it slides off my face easily. however i do toss and turn when i sleep. i bought it to block out light and it does that very well when its on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to light when I sleep, which makes having a street lamp not too far out of my window a pain. This mask is soft, comfortable and reliably blocks light. From day one I had no problem getting to sleep with the mask on. The headband is adjustable for a snug or loose fit, and is not uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I thought the mask itself was silk.  Guess I got suckered into the &amp;#34;silk filled&amp;#34; part.  A piece of junk--I gave it away.</li>
            <li> Very nice, soft and comfortable. No instructions for washing in English, only Chinese! Nothing wrong really just that it is difficult for me to get used to having something on my face while sleeping. But other than that, it works well.</li>
            <li> Alas, for me this mask produced severe itching and hives.  If you&#x27;re sensitive, it may be best to avoid it or be very careful with trying it out.  Although the face part seems to be silk as claimed, the elastic probably contains latex.  Or perhaps the itchiness of this mask (also noted by another reviewer) may have been due to some other property of it. Latex rubber is used in many elastic bands and I think that masks made with that should not be labeled hypoallergenic (as this one is).  If you&#x27;re not allergic or especially sensitive, this mask might be a good choice, and many other reviewers here seem to have had a very good experience with it.</li>
            <li> I have real difficulty sleeping when there is light in the room (e.g., curtains open or my wife reading in bed with the light on).  I have tried probably seven or eight different eye shades in the past, all with various degrees of discomfort.  I fall asleep easily with a mask on, but until I began using this mask, I often awakened from the discomfort of having the straps digging into my temples or irritating the back of my head.  This Zicac sleeping mask is made of silk and is filled with silk.  It fits over the eyes so softly that you hardly know you are wearing it over the face.  Moreover, there is a single strap (not a double one, as is so common) and the strap is completely adjustable.  I have found no difficulty with the mask shifting in place.  In short, this is the best eye shade I have ever worn.  In fact, I just ordered another one to be sure that I always have one handy.</li>
            <li> I should have never order this.  I could not get used to the uncomfortable feeling on my eyes.  Nice product just not for me.</li>
            <li> Made of silk, no Velcro or bulky fasteners. Covers quite well for side sleep.  I store it next to a lavender satchel when not in use.  I would definitely recommend tubbing this item.</li>
            <li> This light weight silk mask is very comfortable. Would buy again. Great for sleeping in or napping without the light.</li>
            <li> Maybe one does not need instructions for a sleeping mask.  But a small irregular piece of fabric in a tiny separate plastic bag is included.  I really would like to know what its purpose is.  Maybe one of these days I will find somebody who reads Chinese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opted for this mask because it was described as being hand washable.  I have not washed it yet and may edit this review once I know how it stands up to laundering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask has only one strap, and it causes some pressure on the eyes.  Maybe masks with two straps are better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, I believe that $8.19 is too high a price for this mask, and I will make sure not to buy from that company again.</li>
            <li> Pure silk inside and outside as advertised. Exactly what was expected.</li>
            <li> The mask is cheap and does not keep light out.  A few years ago I bought a mask from sleep essentials that was more substantial and did keep light out.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit, no matter what your head size.  It&#x27;s soft and fits naturally so you can even sleep on your stomach.</li>
            <li> This eye mask feels great on my face and I like that I can adjust the headband. Most bands have velcorw, which my hair gets caught in or its so bulky you can&#x27;t lay on it. This one has just an adjustment clip and is small so it does not interfere with me sleeping. My only complaint is it slides off my head at night. But that could be due to how much I move in my sleep and not the masks fault.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s in light,  it seems to be a piece of silk with a headband, has no defining frame so the band puts pressure on your eyes.  If you work nights like me then keep searching.</li>
            <li> He can sleep, I can move around the house</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t sleep without an eye mask. This is the best one I&#x27;ve ever had.  You should buy it! Now.</li>
            <li> The problem with most eye masks out there is the tendency to make the eyes too warm or to feel too bulky. This particular one isn&#x27;t as great as the eye mask I bought years ago at the neighborhood pharmacy in Paris (the Parisians need their eye masks and earplugs) , but of all the ones I&#x27;ve purchased here, it seems to be the most comfortable, It&#x27;s light, airy, and blocks out the light.</li>
            <li> This soft silk mask is so comfy to wear. Sleep like a baby.  Really a nice product. Came with a nice cloth bag to keep it in when not using.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and minimal, which is what I was looking for. Eyeball movement isn&#x27;t a problem--I never feel it is too tight, probably because the straps are widely adjustable. It&#x27;s adjusted for me to very nearly the loosest point, which is great because I can tighten it more should it ever become slack through wear (hasn&#x27;t happened yet). It blocks light perfectly. It&#x27;s real silk. It stays on all night. Packaging is minimal. It&#x27;s made and shipped from overseas, which I like: feels and is imported! (They even include a piece of silk that you can light on fire to make sure it&#x27;s made of real silk.)</li>
            <li> Does keep the light out</li>
            <li> Silky!  Comes in a nice little nylon pouch, too.</li>
            <li> Extremely soft and comfortable while still completely blacking out all light.</li>
            <li> Soft, compact, breathes nicely, high quality. I&#x27;ve been using a zicac silk eye mask every night for a year, and absolutely love it. I&#x27;ve been using eye masks since college and in that time gave tried about a dozen options from the paper thin, awful plastic ones like you used to get on long flights to enormous, plush chenille masks from bed, bath, and beyond. I own two zicac silk masks, my husband has one for camping trips, my mom (who travels a lot and goes to bed at all hours) has SIX because she never wants to be without them!</li>
            <li> Feather soft, adjustable, very comfortable headband. Completely blocks light. Washable &amp; affordable.  I&#x27;m buying 2 more today !  You will love it !</li>
            <li> This face mask is awesome. Feels great on the face, very very soft and cozy, not too thick to disrupt sleep or head position, adjuster strap very comfortable to sleep with (No velcro to stick to your hair or pillow case, just a slider adjuster that is easy to use) Large size helps to ensure that light is fully blocked. Cant say enough how soft and cozy the silk filling feels as well as the mask itself. No issues or complaints at all, love it!</li>
            <li> Obviously I waited quite a while for this to be delivered secondary to place of origin. However, it is well worth the wait. Quality product...very soft silk which fells great on your skin. Blocks out the light. It has a thin adjustable strap which is also comfortable. Also loved the Bucky 40 Blinks mask. I have gone through several since I work night shift. I value the fit as not to allow light in, softness, and washability. Eye masks do need to be hand washed regularly. This product and the Bucky are the best as far as I am concerned. This mask is lighter and  a little softer than the Bucky.</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed.  I sleep with an air conditioner at all times, and the vents dont do that much of a good job keeping air from blowing on my face/eye area and thats not a good thing.  I wore this last night for the first time, and all I can say is I was in sleep heaven.  Light is blocked out, plus I dont have to worry about keeping my face away from the air conditioner all night.  I too, am ordering 2 more right this second.  Sweet dreams!!</li>
            <li> When I bought this sleep mask, I was a bit skeptical because I never thought sleep masks would be comfortable. Period. The fabric is very soft and the mask is adjustable to the size of the person&#x27;s head. The only part I didn&#x27;t like was when I was adjusting the sleep mask. If I tightened it too tight, I could feel the elastic band pressing on my eyes. It took a few tries to figure out what was the best fit. In addition, I&#x27;m a side sleeper and this mask is perfect for that. Overall, I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am just in receipt of the product package and cannot vouch yet for the usability of the mask - it looks nice -  but will post another review within a few weeks time. My only comment here is that the product arrived with all Chinese verbiage on the package...just a few english titles.  When ordering a product from Amazon I expect to receive the information/care on the product in english.</li>
            <li> THIS is the sleeping mask I&#x27;ve been waiting for! I am a side sleeper and very few sleep masks are designed this sleek and smooth on the sides. The fabric is SOOO soft, not itchy or cheap. The strap is super soft and not just elastic, but adjustable as well! I wish the instructions were in English, and the shipping takes awhile from China, but there is nothing for sale like this in American stores. The price is a bargain.</li>
            <li> works perfect, fits nicely</li>
            <li> So very soft! Out like a light in no time. It has an adjustable band that was able to fit my husbands fairly large head. Blocks out the light so much better than others I have used in the past! Overall, it is a great product worth the $.</li>
            <li> My first eye mask and I love it. Completely comfortable, you don&#x27;t mind it at all while sleeping. I washed it a few times in the washer too, no problems.</li>
