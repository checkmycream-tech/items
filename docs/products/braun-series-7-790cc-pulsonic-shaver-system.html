            <li>best shaver ever I had!</li>
            <li>Best razor I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>It arrived from bed bath and beyond, which wasn&#x27;t the person I bought it from, but the seller to me must have ordered it from them, anyways, it came and from day one I&#x27;ve been nothing but impressed with this shaver.</li>
            <li>Best electric shaver I have owned...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy I bought this.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is the best.</li>
            <li>After 10 years I made the upgrade to Braun&#x27;s newest shaver, and I am impressed.  </li>
            <li>Best electric razor ever</li>
            <li>It shaves perfect on my cheeks but it doesn&#x27;t do a thing on my neck.</li>

            <li>Best electric shaved</li>
            <li>I have found this to be the best electric razor and with adjustments for shaving closeness, it gives a close shave without irritation.</li>
            <li>As I said I had no irritation whatsoever AND the best shave with an electric shaver ever.</li>
            <li>the stray hairs works best.  </li>
            <li>The bottom line is that after 6 months of use this is STILL the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve had in 50+ years of shaving.</li>
            <li>The cleaning system is also excellent and since it can be used in the shower I wash it in there and then run it through Braun&#x27;s cleanins system.</li>
            <li>Braun is still the best.</li>

            <li>It is not for travelers, but it is great for in-home use.  </li>

            <li>great close shave without the burn.</li>
            <li>Great value for the money.</li>
            <li>My husband, who the razor was purchased for, is extremely happy with the razor.</li>
            <li>Shaves great.</li>
            <li>Very nice great shaver.</li>
            <li>Love this Shaver!!</li>
            <li>You will love it too!!</li>
            <li>When I called to request a brush they were very courteous</li>
            <li>Cleaning system is very handy.  </li>
            <li>it is very nice as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The shave, both give very nice shaves</li>
            <li>This product is very nice</li>
            <li>While not a blade close shave, it provides a very nice result.</li>
            <li>I am now very happy with all aspects of this very fine product and the self cleaning/charging stand that comes with</li>
            <li>Very smooth and excellent cleaning/charging operation.</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>but it leaves his face so nice!</li>
            <li>I purchased the Braun Series 7 - 790cc shaver more than a year ago and have to say I am considering rebuilding my Series 5-8595 shaver, as it was the best thing that Braun ever made.  </li>
            <li>It does an excellent job over most of my face.</li>
            <li>But If you are in the market for an excellent shaver, don&#x27;t spend $200 on one, when you can get Panasonics&#x27; latest for $135</li>
            <li>but I love Braun shavers and this is the best one ever.</li>
            <li>I think that the 7 is a good choice if you&#x27;re buying it as a gift and want to make a great impression, but if you&#x27;re buying it for yourself, save some $$ and go for series 5.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent product, it sure comes to its cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best shaver I have had ,  close, smooth !</li>
            <li>That said, if you are pouring through the reviews and just want to get a good shaver that is noticeably better that the best three head versions, give this a try.</li>
            <li>This product is great and working good and using weekly once and my skin condition was good</li>
            <li>I loved my Braun the best and would still be using it (7 years), but my wife dropped it on the tile floor one too many times while cleaning the bathroom counters.  </li>
            <li>Awesome, clean, charge and sanitize all in one step!</li>
            <li>The Braun&#x27;s replaceable cleaning resivour system works perfectly, just swap out cartridges and your good to go, the Braun also smells very clean and sanitary when its done unlike the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;2nd</li>
            <li>Easily the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning is so easy and the shave is the best I have ever had from electric razor.</li>
            <li>I love it---it does a very good job.</li>
            <li>very good, I love it.</li>
            <li>Great razor and amazing customer service from Amazon</li>
            <li>works great shaves great out of box no time period to get use to and cleaning station keeps shaver in top condition</li>
            <li>The Braun 7-Series isn&#x27;t perfect, but it is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>And it does not do a good job of trimming either.</li>
            <li>, the lock for the mustache mode is not as good, and the trimmer does not seem as rugged and durable.</li>
            <li>Good shaver</li>
            <li>Good job Braun.</li>
            <li>Loved the quality besides that.</li>
            <li>Good shaver.  </li>
            <li>My son loved this item.  </li>
            <li>and I still think they do a good job.  </li>
            <li>Electrics were noisy and didn&#x27;t do a good job.</li>
            <li>The technology is that good.</li>
            <li>Pre-shave talcs are good, too.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer accessory works surprisingly well</li>
            <li>My husband loved his Christmas gift and has used it every day since he got it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m delighted with this product.</li>
            <li>Fits in your hand and looks good.</li>
            <li>It does a good job but does not shave as good as the series 5.</li>
            <li>The Best electric shaver available on the market.</li>
            <li>Gives good shave.</li>
            <li>Ease of use and a shave as good as any blade.</li>
            <li>I keep upgrading and I have always had good results from their products.</li>
            <li>so good</li>
            <li>My shave is every bit as good as a blade.</li>
            <li>Good to use.</li>
            <li>all this is a good purchase</li>
            <li>Just place the razor in the cleaning device, push a button, and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>good quality stuff.</li>
            <li>What is good for one guy isn&#x27;t for the over.</li>
            <li>I have used some of their razors that sell at Wal-Mart, but I decided to spend the money on what I thought to be a superior razor.</li>
            <li>Feels good in my hand.</li>
            <li>Good electric shaver.</li>
            <li>feel good good work</li>
            <li>but can get a really good shave.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line Braun is still the best foil razor available bar none, for me</li>
            <li>My husband has never had it so good.  </li>
            <li>Best razor available for the price.</li>
            <li>Got it for a good price.</li>
            <li>Good move.  </li>
            <li>This one... not as good.</li>
            <li>Good gift for my 32nd  birthday.</li>
            <li>Good quality and shave is just as close as a blade.</li>
            <li>and i get a good shave.</li>
            <li>Good shave though.</li>
            <li>I feel mislead by the good reviews.  </li>
            <li>This is about as good as it gets when shaving with an electric shaver</li>
            <li>So, looks like I made a good decision.</li>
            <li>Getting good use from it.</li>
            <li>I was especially impressed with how comfortable the razor feels in my hand, even when cranked up to the highest setting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also debatable if keeping a NiCad battery fully charged is good for it.    </li>
            <li>It gives a fairly close shave.  </li>
            <li>No electric shaver is as good as a razor.</li>
            <li>never thought that a shaving system could be that good and</li>
            <li>Gives a good, close shave with no discomfort.</li>
            <li>I bit the bullet (and had a coupon for a good discount).</li>
            <li>Three days, good luck.</li>
            <li>Received in a timely manner and good product.</li>
            <li>Gives a good shave every time.  </li>
            <li>but nothing good ever is.</li>
            <li>It is a good choice for me.</li>
            <li>Any time you can relieve the suffering of a loved one...</li>
            <li>Works as advertised with a good close shave.  </li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>My husband loved the shaver.</li>
            <li>Good close shave with NO ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>The shaver works as good as all of the good reviews.</li>
            <li>Best shaver and smooth shave without any cut.</li>
            <li>As I said before, a $200 investment out of the pocket of a college kid is a good amount</li>
            <li>good shave but</li>
            <li>too noisey and feel good</li>
            <li>Still not as good as a razor but close</li>
            <li>good electric razor.</li>
            <li>a good gift for my friend</li>
            <li>Mostly good razor.</li>

            <li>and it was good</li>
            <li>As good as anything I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>very powerful and good!!</li>
            <li>Gives a nice close shave and has indicator lights that show battery charging and what stage of cleaning - love the self cleaning feature!!</li>
            <li>I bought a Braun clean and renew a decade ago and it was the best shaver ever.  </li>
            <li>This razor provides an exceptionally close shave.  </li>
            <li>Probably the best shave I have ever had with an electric razor and the cleaning is SUPER convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cleaning system is great and leaves my face feeling smooth and great afterwards.</li>
            <li>When I used it to shave,I feel very comfortable, very clean, awesome experience!</li>
            <li>Great Razor shave much better than the cheaper electric razors that are there.</li>

            <li>this shaver can work perfectly as what is made to do: &amp;#34;Shaving&amp;#34; but it doesn&#x27;t have any smart features.</li>

            <li>The cleaning is nice too.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it can be rinsed under the tap but that really doesn&#x27;t provide the best cleaning NOR does it lubricate the shaver&#x27;s cutters.</li>
            <li>excellent razor except for shaving the neck area real close.</li>
            <li>Either or both of them may not effect you, so please consider your own situation before taking my review into account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>so good,It is very easy to shave the beard</li>
            <li>In general they are good to great quality and as good as I have found for electric shavers (I shave both face and head).</li>
            <li>are fine shavers, and either is a good buy imo.</li>
            <li>The unit comes with very good directions and works very well.</li>
            <li>So far, it is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve bought a lot of electric razors over the years and this one is the best so far.  </li>
            <li>And leaves my face smooth and smelling good.</li>

            <li>So far it works great!</li>
            <li>I shopped around, and for the $ and quality, this braun was by far the best!  </li>
            <li>Amazon shipping is the best as I received it within the 3-5 day range early.</li>
            <li>so far the best one I used</li>
            <li>I purchased the Braun Series 7 Model 797cc which is identical to the 790cc except for being specified in the manual as suitable for use in the shower which was a requirement for me.</li>
            <li>This shaver by far is the greatest thing since sliced bread!!!!</li>
            <li>None of them will ever be as close and as smooth s a good blade shave.</li>

            <li>As far an electric, the Braun Series 7 is the best I&#x27;ve had.</li>

            <li>Perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Braun shavers for years, and I have to say, this shaver so far, is their best effort to date.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>If a good shave is important to you, this is the shaver for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an old pro with electric razors, and this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best razor I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>The panasonic was pretty good, but not as good as this one.</li>
            <li>I love it, great close shave and quickly.  </li>
            <li>Excellent design, clear instructions, gives a smooth shave, easy to maintain, packaged well, comfortable to hold, cleaning station works well, I like it!!!</li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver and I have to admit I am very impressed and happy with my purchase (I am sixty years old).</li>
            <li>But mission accomplished because he loved this one!</li>
            <li>I very like, very good use, much better than I used to use panasonic</li>
            <li>More cumbersome than the 5000 series which I liked better</li>
            <li>Therefore, I went with this more espensive model -- and he agreed it&#x27;s worth it because it works great.  </li>
            <li>I have not used many electric razors, but this one is excellent, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>but it gives a good clean shave in 3 or 4 minutes time with no snagging or pulling.</li>
            <li>Battery life is excellent, shave quality is far better than Norelco&#x27;s, and the cleaning function is very civilized.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I am using electric shaver and I&#x27;m happy compare to manual</li>
            <li>At first the Braun was great.</li>
            <li>It as exactly as described and does a great job.</li>
            <li>I found an awesome deal on another popular bid and sell website and got the complete shaving system for $150 including free shipping.</li>
            <li>They are great on all types of skin - and give a pretty darn close</li>
            <li>The product is good, is not the original box, if the enclosed shipping / packing list is better</li>
            <li>is pretty great.</li>
            <li>Bought the 760 about 3 years ago and was pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>The latest shaves were very easy and my skin is much better now, than it was using a manual razor.     </li>
            <li>Very smooth save.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a very comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable on my face.</li>
            <li>Very smooth shaves.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable to hold in your hand, and well balanced weight-wise.  </li>
            <li>Not this one, its convenient, the self cleaning function is fantastic and battery life outstanding and the shave is close and leaves skin very smooth!  </li>
            <li>I have never been able to get a super good shave with this.  </li>
            <li>Excellent machine, i have had Braun shavers for the past 10 years and this is the best i have seen, solid - powerful, good technology and an easy clean shave, i am very happy with this product</li>
            <li>I had and used a Braun 36 Complete for 5 years and it was very good.</li>
            <li>So far, the shaver is doing a very good job.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with the electric shaver because of its ease of use.</li>
            <li>Had it for 5 days and it feels really good and shaves my face with heavy whiskers wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Well I have to admit that I 100% agree with most of the reviews here.</li>
            <li>I had hoped this razor would be able to overcome this</li>
            <li>It is only perfect.  </li>
            <li>Top of the line.</li>
            <li>It is able to get a close shave that lasts throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>but this shaver is definitely the best I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>I will have to admit I had to replace the motor and cutter head after I dropped it on a granite counter top, but it still asted 9 years after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: lock button is faulty and mostly gets non-functional</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not been satisfied with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>they get better every time.</li>
            <li>Shaving is actually enjoyable now.</li>
            <li>FORTUNATELY, the manufacturer provider a replacement!</li>
            <li>Really Love it....</li>
            <li>his life is better for having it.</li>
            <li>Really enjoying it.</li>
            <li>Will see if that is better.</li>
            <li>This came out on top.</li>
            <li>It cuts more of the hairs on every pass.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I swore I would never buy another Braun product but am glad I gave them another chance.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Im sure it sanitizes well, but doesn&#x27;t get all the hair off.</li>
            <li>I use it every day and love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Shaver is quiet, impressed with the Pulsonic.</li>
            <li>shaves better than norelco</li>
            <li>pleased with this</li>
            <li>Smooth shave!</li>
            <li>It was more money than he considered spending, but I was the one who ordered it.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Much better for trimming sideburns than a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is much better than relying on disposable razors when I&#x27;m traveling</li>
            <li>Been using the 7 Series for Many years.</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;d better take care of it.</li>
            <li>I tried so many electric razors nothing worked well.</li>
            <li>You do not have to use the elaborate cleaning and charging system.</li>
            <li>Finally I found a replacement and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>no sympathy which I suppose is ok give that was the contract.</li>
            <li>NOT ONLY THE BEST ELECTRIC RAZOR</li>
            <li>AFTER MANY HOURS OF RESEARCH</li>
            <li>A CHANCE FOR A BETTER SHAVE.  </li>
            <li>THIS HAS PROVEN TO BE ONE OF THE BEST DECISIONS IN PERSONAL CARE</li>
            <li>Thank you, Cynthia. :)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this razor</li>
            <li>NOT ONLY THE BEST ELECTRIC RAZOR</li>
            <li>AFTER MANY HOURS OF RESEARCH</li>
            <li>A CHANCE FOR A BETTER SHAVE.</li>
            <li>THIS HAS PROVEN TO BE ONE OF THE BEST DECISIONS IN PERSONAL CARE</li>
            <li>No, I don&#x27;t love it...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to love it.</li>
            <li>it provides the best overall shave.</li>
            <li>The shave this provides is better than most others I have tried.</li>
            <li>This electric razor are outstanding.</li>
            <li>more often.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never used a better shaver than this one.</li>
            <li>Husband loves it and may have converted him from Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;Shaves extremely smooth!</li>
            <li>Great shaver, very close shave.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I decided on buying this product.</li>
            <li>All in all its still most likely the best electric out there.</li>
            <li>Better than Phlips except noise louder.</li>
            <li>his beard is more like mine and the rotary isn&#x27;t working with his beard.</li>
            <li>For the money paid, I think we deserve better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned Braun shavers for more years than I can remember and have mostly been satisfied with them.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m fully satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li>I love this razor and just wish I had changed sooner.</li>
            <li>By doing it this way, my counter top is not cluttered and I use one cartridge a year.  </li>
            <li>I am finding too many missed hairs.</li>
            <li>Please make sure of it before you start using it .</li>
            <li>this lets me watch tv and shave and relax siting while shaving love</li>
            <li>I returned it and decided to spend a bit more money and do a bit of research.</li>
            <li>Need I say more?</li>
            <li>I spend a lot more time shaving with the Braun than I do with the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>have a series 7 from many years ago that I have to still dig out just for the quality trimmer.</li>
            <li>This razor performs better than any electric razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li>My biyfriend love this shaver</li>
            <li>glad j got it for him.</li>
            <li>~I love this one~</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for more than 30 years.  </li>
            <li>Ok I have owned a Braun series 5 electric razor for a couple of years now.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this shaved because it had been recommended by many sites for not causing razor bumps.</li>
            <li>The cleaning system is solid too, my best advice is what I was told by my Grandfather 30 years ago...</li>
            <li>My husband asked me to write this as he is IN LOVE with this shaver.</li>
            <li>the 7-790cc  provides a much better shave.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>even  better than my series 3</li>
            <li>The Panasonic Arc3 worked better for me with closer shave than the Arc4, but the Braun topped them both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>40$ Remington razor has a better trimmer than this overpriced shiny silver paperweight</li>
            <li>I love bells and whistles :)</li>
            <li>Just a great product at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>This one is even better.  </li>
            <li>You might pay a bit more</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this shaver.</li>
            <li>Do not go for a cheap kind as it does not work.</li>
            <li>You better believe it.</li>
            <li>He looks so much better now.</li>
            <li>This is the most overpriced, over rated, underperforming pos that I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>Well, I wasn&#x27;t pleased from the beginning</li>
            <li>The Braun ranked among the top razors for a close shave in Consumer Reports.</li>
            <li>5-series has a much more convenient slide-out trimmer that works well in all situations I used</li>
            <li>Phenomenal shaver, closer shave than with a steel bladed Atra</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not any better than the cheap razor I have!</li>
            <li>, I am sure it works for most of men</li>
            <li>A guy on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;liMN23Xqcis) gives some great instructions on how to do this and where to get a reasonable cleaning mixture to add to some alcohol and thus cut the cost.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not ther top of the line or</li>
            <li>read the reviews and saw it was top rated</li>
            <li>have had this razor for three months and am completely satisfied</li>
            <li>I think I could get a better shave with a disposable razor.</li>
            <li>I will say I love the carrying case that came with this one because we use it for travel</li>
            <li>Way better than the plastic version we got 5 years ago.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better or more reliable razor.  </li>
            <li>Not any more - the Ser. 7</li>
            <li>many guys over 50, I take blood thinners</li>
            <li>Love it .</li>
            <li>Have tried many razors and blades in my lifetime of 50+ years of shaving.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>Best shave I&#x27;ve had in the last 10 years ....</li>
            <li>I have been completely satisfied with it except for one thing.  </li>
            <li>Love it, took about 3 weeks to get to me but love the razor.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this thing gives the close shave I want without user a razer</li>
            <li>Sort of OK shave when it catches the beard</li>
            <li>Fantastic razor!</li>
            <li>Why so many shavers?</li>
            <li>Braun is a superb example of German craftsmanship.</li>
            <li>but I think you will find the Opti foil to deliver a better shave.</li>
            <li>You can, of course, use the oil that Braun provides (a drop rubbed onto the foil once a week) but the cleaning module is a much more elegant solution.  </li>
            <li>will know more about it after using it for a longer period of time.  </li>
            <li>This one does a MUCH better job of getting all those curly gray hairs.  </li>
            <li>The bells and whistles of this top of the line model are moot if it doesn&#x27;t shave close.  </li>
            <li>Love the one-piece foil/cutting block.  </li>
            <li>boy am I glad.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am so glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>I reluctantly decided to give the Braun a try and have enjoyed the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the product is ok.</li>
            <li>Not as pleased with the razor as I thought I would be.</li>
            <li>My series 5 shaved closer without as many passes.</li>
            <li>Love this shaver.</li>
            <li>Even though this does a great job on my hairy ass neck, I still like to finish it with a straight razor.  </li>
            <li>I use the most aggressive cut and have never had any irritation from this razor like I have from the rotary razors.</li>
            <li>think I won&#x27;t choose a Norelco shavers any more because I began to like Braun&#x27;s shaving products.</li>
            <li>how many times I go over it.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, keep searching and let me know if you find an electric razor that works better.</li>
            <li>I am completely pleased with mine.</li>
            <li>The clipper seems to work better.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the Norelco I used for many years.</li>
            <li>Does not shave close enough - had to return and get the Panasonic ES-LA93-K which was excellent.</li>
            <li>Love this shaver.</li>
            <li>I have found the Norelco series, 7,8, and 9 Aquamatic models give me a better shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;so much better than the Norelco</li>
            <li>What I like the most about this razor is that it does not irritate my skin or burn.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m considering to buy more for my father</li>
            <li>This is my second Braun shaver, best ever!</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd Braun and it is the best of them all.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>the Philips 1260,I think the Philips works better than braun...for me</li>
            <li>I am completely pleased with both.</li>
            <li>It costs more but doesn&#x27;t shave better molder Norelco.</li>
            <li>have yet to get any better than a blade shave</li>
            <li>I never had a shaver before, but I checked out most of them.  </li>
            <li>This is the top pick from Consumer&#x27;s reports and almost every barber in America.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I guess all is ok.</li>
            <li>I tried to look everywhere for this but with better price.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you cover your cleaning solution after use</li>
            <li>Well pleased with all aspects of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone interesting in changing from a blade.</li>
            <li>and I guess it probably is best to know when it needs cleaned as it also lubricates the razor at the same time.</li>
            <li>is okay</li>
            <li>Love the shaver</li>
            <li>I have always been a fan of Braun products and they have one of the best products that last many, many years</li>
            <li>IT IS THE BEST I have tried far too many post shave balms and this one is light years ahead of them all.</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco shavers exclusive for many years.</li>
            <li>Most blades gave me razor bumps.</li>
            <li>Just got my shaver and love it.</li>
            <li>I bought it based on the reviews online and not wanting to spend $400 on the top rated model.  </li>
            <li>Its better then most on the market, I&#x27;d give it a 5 if it were around 35$</li>
            <li>I love the panel that tells you the battery status and hygiene status as well as when to replace shaver head.  </li>
            <li>the price is better than any of the stores around my area.</li>
            <li>Much better than the 760.</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I think better than norelco.  </li>
            <li>Extremely pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>right at the 2 year mark (when the warranty is up), I cannot give it a good rating.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase and getting nice clean shaves.</li>
            <li>Wife got this for my christmas present and its very nice!</li>
            <li>I read a lot of reviews about this shaver before deciding to buy it and I recommend everyone interested read the more detailed reviews because there is a lot of great information in them.</li>
            <li>you want the best self cleaning razor available and price isn&#x27;t a top factor the 790cc is the one you want, if price is a factor then the 760cc gives just as good a shave with less bells and whistle.</li>
            <li>that keeps it clean, sanitized and smelling nice while sitting on your nightstand.  </li>
            <li>After my first use, I thought this was the best electric shaver I&#x27;d ever used, and that might still be true, but it is not as close or quick a shave as a Gillette Mach III.</li>
            <li>This always gives a nice close clean shave.  </li>
            <li>I have a light beard and this is the best electric shaver I have used, shaves really close and takes little time, great shaver!!</li>
            <li>Great product and highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I like very much for its good quality.</li>
            <li>So unexpected!Shaving more than Gillette clean!</li>
            <li>but he tells me this shaving system has been working great for him so far!!  </li>
            <li>great shave &amp; easy maintenance thanks to cleaner.</li>
            <li>Great shaver, the plug-in adapter makes a surprising high pitch noise when your shaver is charging, which worried me when I first plugged in my shaver, but all my research on the internet suggests its normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>i like very clean</li>
            <li>very clean shaven.</li>
            <li>Shaving is very clean</li>
            <li>straight up amazing!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Being a pilot I dont have a normal work schedule and the flexibility is great with the Braun.</li>
            <li>I bought this one after my norelco 1280x would consistently miss hairs and would take forever to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>Although the series 7 shaver feels better and more comfortable in my hand, it doesn&#x27;t shave any better.  </li>
            <li>This shaver does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>: It may not get used to your skin and stubble on the first try - even though it will still give a good shave.</li>
            <li>I figure 10 years + is pretty good service</li>
            <li>your beard over and over, and over, you can get a pretty good shave, but I have never equaled a blade.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first electric shaver I have ever owned that did as good a job as a razor.</li>
            <li>pretty darn good product.</li>
            <li>I have had older Braun razors and they were very nice.</li>
            <li>Worth the money!!</li>
            <li>I am happy with the new design of the head with the movement.  </li>
            <li>This thing is great, a lot better than my old series 5.</li>
            <li>I dry shave all the time, this baby is PERFECT.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced no pulling and it is fast and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Series 7 shaver because of the great shaves I have gotten from my Braun Series 5 360 Complete shaver and it&#x27;s Consumer Reports top rating.</li>
            <li>This is very easy to clean and take care of.</li>
            <li>I can clean it just fine on my own and all the self cleaning feature</li>
            <li>for the price of these shavers, a consistent bright and easily seen display should be par.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and comfortable shave</li>
            <li>the cleaning station is AWESOME however dont clean it and then go back and reshave your face if you missed a spot</li>
            <li>Not all faces are the same, but for me this is a very good product.</li>
            <li>The daily cleaning module is very good in cleaning the shaver.</li>
            <li>I expected the best and got it.</li>
            <li>A closer and cut free shave  :-)</li>
            <li>The shave is a lot closer and more comfortable than I was expecting.</li>
            <li>He loves it, and I love that his skin is so smooth after shaving with it.</li>
            <li>, I have been searching for the most comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>and this is the first one I&#x27;ve liked after having tried many.</li>
            <li>Best 190 buck I spent.</li>
            <li>Had an old Braun shaver and thought it was still great until I happened to purchase this model.  </li>
            <li>Never really found one that did a perfect job.  </li>
            <li>Everything as expected the best Braun shaver</li>
            <li>Smooth shave no irritation LOVE it.</li>
            <li>While no electric razor I&#x27;ve tried is as smooth as shaving with cream and a blade, this shaver does a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li>have a light beard, and have settled on cleaning once or twice per week at most.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>but so far I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It did not perform as well as my 5 year old Panasonic ES8249 (never changed the foil head or cutters) that still works great and</li>
            <li>most importantly doesn&#x27;t just do the job</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m quite happy about it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good razor, but way too noisy and it really irritated my face.</li>
            <li>but finally I found a good deal on this 790cc from braun and its by far the best razor ive ever used.</li>
            <li>gives a really close shave, almost as good as a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PHILIPS v. BRAUN.  </li>
            <li>Still have my Braun 8595 that has served me well for many years but was never this good even when new.</li>
            <li>I follow up with more shaving cream on the face and quickly shave with a Gillette Fusion Power razor to hit some of the spots missed by the Braun mostly around the neck.</li>
            <li>Cleaning action is very nice and works as advertised.</li>
            <li>And all are extra good reasons to observe Tip 1:  Rinse!</li>
            <li>I have had four other Braun shavers over the years, and this is the best yet.</li>
            <li>He had the original version of this from many years ago and never replaced it.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>Other than that a great razor!</li>
            <li>soon as I received it in the mail I was more than excited to use it.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully Amazon contacts me, or the original seller, and is able to work something out.  </li>
            <li>After reading many reviews concerning the cleaning system I have opted to clean the razor once a week and placing the cap on the cleaning solution between razor cleaning which I used once a week.</li>
            <li>My husband said it&#x27;s easy to use, and he loves the self-cleaning feature.</li>
            <li>and it cleans up easy.  </li>
            <li>and I love the hygiene indicator that tells you when to clean it.  </li>
            <li>Afta makes one that I like; it&#x27;s between a cream and a gel, so easy to smear on</li>
            <li>Easy to use and charge.  </li>
            <li>If you start with the easy stuff, the razor won&#x27;t cut as well by the end of your session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>Easy to fill and replace refill.</li>
            <li>Remove the plastic cap from the Braun Clean&amp;Renew™ cartridge and easily install in the plastic Station.</li>
            <li>Easily cleaned.</li>
            <li>It is also easy for travel.  </li>
            <li>Easy to take care.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use</li>
            <li>As I am bald, I am able to use this on my entire face and head and the comfort settings are great.  </li>
            <li>Cleans easily with the touch of a finger.  </li>
            <li>The adjustable head from easy to close works</li>
            <li>I have had a beard fro 30 years and except from trimming I have not shaved, but the Braun makes it easy and convenient..</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to hear it clean :-)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very easy to use, no injuries in the face anymore.</li>
            <li>Purchased for my husband - He didn&#x27;t make it easy -</li>
            <li>I just make sure to clean it once a week.</li>
            <li>I like the clean and renew - makes cleaning it much more easier and hygenic</li>
            <li>It is convenient, cleans easily.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to care for.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning is easy just put it its stand and push the button</li>
            <li>I would strongly encourage you to stay away from this piece of equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the cleaning system.fits very comfortlely in hand nice shape and design.best part about shaver is when</li>
            <li>Been using it for 2yrs and its still going strong.</li>
            <li>I have own 3 different tier Braun shavers, this is definitely a Good shaver</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended~</li>
            <li>Very good and long battery life.&lt;br /&gt;Side</li>
            <li>The self cleaning feature is very cool and keeps it suprisingly free of debris.</li>
            <li>Although the 7-series has a more powerful, higher-frequency linear motor and what looks like a more advanced shaving block as compared to the &amp;#34;conventional&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Incredibly close shaves and it cleans up better than any other razor I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>A beautifully designed shaver that is built to last.</li>
            <li>Always fresh, clean, and smelling nice because of the cleaning.  </li>
            <li>This has to be the best shaver hands down.</li>
            <li>The bottom line is that this shaver is hands down the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve used in the 62 years I&#x27;ve been shaving.</li>
            <li>World best shaver hands down.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best electric shaver out there!  </li>
            <li>Hands down the best electric shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a replacement and had it narrowed down to a Panasonic or this Braun and decided that the Braun would be best choice fro me since it can still be operated when the Batteries die with a cord supplied.  </li>
            <li>The shaver can clean my face faster and very clean.</li>
            <li>It definitely exceeded my expectations as it is easy to use, easy to clean, and most importantly gives me a great shave.</li>
            <li>thing is so smooth and easy, it feels like you&#x27;re wiping the whiskers off your face, regardless</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a finely made</li>
            <li>It does not matter if I skip a day, it is fine.  </li>
            <li>A head that lasts 6 months is fine with me.  </li>
            <li>I was so impressed with it at first that I ordered extra cleaning units.</li>
            <li>Perfect shave in half the time when compared to my Philips Norelco shavers.  </li>
            <li>easy and smooth.</li>
            <li>The first three times I used this razor were beyond phenomenal, and more than I could ever ask from any self-shaving product.  </li>
            <li>Close comfortable shave that floats easily over the skin with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>and he says that this one is definitely a super premium one!</li>
            <li>It leaves your face feeling very soft and give a good cut.</li>
            <li>Once I shelled out for this top of the line razor and used it the very first time....</li>
            <li>The best of these is the 790cc in my opinion, particularly because it does no sharp, stinging pinches when shaving.</li>
            <li>realize this thing has been touted by many reviewers as great for Black men, and I&#x27;m sure it works for some of us, but I&#x27;d like to throw out a word of caution out there to anyone buying it just for that reason.</li>
            <li>Fantastic, excellent shave for electric especially on my coarse greying beard.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is easy, the trimmer works well and it makes shaving fast for work.</li>
            <li>little on expesive side but its best razor on market</li>
            <li>A very good product, all that I expected.</li>
            <li>very good for sensitive skin, but you don&#x27;t get a very close</li>
            <li>The fact that it cleans itself too is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li>After days of research I found out that I needed the most powerful motor available for whatever model and brand</li>
            <li>The self-cleaning and charging station is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this shaver to anyone looking for a great electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Really nice appliance - well balanced in the hand, shaves very close &amp; leaves face feeling as if a razor did the cutting.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>you will be amazed how smooth your face it.&lt;br /&gt;- changeable speed.</li>
            <li>razor itself is comfortable to hold and to shave with, though.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, too.  </li>
            <li>The size is great for traveling and it&#x27;s fairly quiet for a foil electric</li>
            <li>This one is seemingly cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Great razor, my third Braun razor and</li>
            <li>I have always used a disposable razor and shaved using a fog free mirror as I showered.</li>
            <li>I received this as a Christmas present and it works great.</li>
            <li>The cleaning function is great and each solution pack lasts me about a month or so with regular use.</li>
            <li>replacement head is cheap</li>
            <li>Fantastic electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I get a close, smooth shave without any nicks or tugging.</li>
            <li>It has a self clean feature and the battery is strong.</li>
            <li>It gives a great close shave and has 3 different settings for the shave you want</li>
            <li>I bought it and am not a rater who has received the product free.  </li>
            <li>but, it&#x27;s made out of cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>We got it at such a great price.</li>
            <li>It is remarkably smooth.  </li>
            <li>I actually enjoy shaving and look forward to it.</li>
            <li>My second one; been using these for 10+ years -- and they are great.  </li>
            <li>I bought an electric shaver primarily because I can take it in my carry-on baggage, on this</li>
            <li>Does the job smoothly and comfortably.</li>
            <li>Great shaver with only one downfall.</li>
            <li>skin feels baby smooth every time, I don&#x27;t have to re-hit spots.</li>
            <li>Fast, efficient, cleans itself, nice trimmer, and holds a charge forever.</li>
            <li>This razor is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Going from a cheap 50 dollar electric to this is a huge step up.</li>
            <li>The cleaning system is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, however I think I will go with the Norelco next time.</li>
            <li>Simple to use, great product.</li>
            <li>This was a great Christmas present.</li>
            <li>Smooth and comfortable</li>
            <li>The shave is close and smooth and he thanks me almost daily for this great gift!</li>
            <li>Alcohol is cheap, the cartridge is not.  </li>
            <li>The razor gives a close and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use, clean and charge.  </li>
            <li>and I enjoy the close shave</li>
            <li>This is the primary reason for the 3 stars.  </li>
            <li>and every time since... did I realize I was missing out on the best shave ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There are adjustments for the head so that you can change it to fit the type of whiskers, and area that you are shaving.</li>
            <li>It is incredibly smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Smooth operation.</li>
            <li>and it has worked well at keeping my face shaved and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Also, I set it on the medium shave setting which, with the lotion, makes for a smooth shave after a couple of day beard.</li>
            <li>This one feels cheap.</li>
            <li>Extremely comfortable shave every time</li>
            <li>Overall it is great product.</li>
            <li>quality is important to me.</li>
            <li>I manage to get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was concerned about the vibrate feature, but it must help because this thing does such a great job shaving.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because I read reviews about how it was great for African Americans.</li>
            <li>and it becomes smooth just like a blade</li>
            <li>He loves it and enjoy any time he uses it</li>
            <li>However, there is an easy remedy: push the clean button on it then leave the bathroom and go to work</li>
            <li>Comfortable to hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>That was a shock after using the absolutely smooth Norelco with the rotating cutters.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gives a surprisingly smooth shave and I have had zero neck irritation.</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC SHAVER..</li>
            <li>A close, clean, easy shave every morning that cuts minutes off of my prep time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth, quieter then any others that I have tried, and gives a razor close shave every time.</li>
            <li>Smooth as an against the grain manual shave, without any of the redness or irritation.</li>
            <li>I have a light beard.  </li>
            <li>the price was lower than Walmart and free shipping took just two days.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve sometimes varied in design but regardless of the design, I would ALWAYS get razor burn regardless of how light I pressed</li>
            <li>The shave is close and comfortable.</li>
            <li>You have to shave against the grain with a blade to get those parts smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This will shave your face and it will leave it smooth.  </li>
            <li>Smooth.  </li>
            <li>I get smooth shaves without the wear and tear of manual razors.</li>
            <li>The battery unit charger also keeps track of the shaver&#x27;s cleanliness and cleans it with cleaning solution in a lower filled tray, when required.</li>
            <li>I get a close, comfortable, more blade like shave than I expected and have ever experienced.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using it</li>
            <li>I am 82 and beard is light.</li>
            <li>this thing is light years ahead of it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not ripping the hairs out like cheap electrics.  </li>
            <li>It says it&#x27;s just SD alcohol, but I haven&#x27;t been brave enough to top it off with a $0.45 worth of product.  </li>
            <li>it is good to shave the sensitive parts of your face.&lt;br /&gt;- washable head parts.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant about upgrading to a newer model, and had read lots of reviews about the 790cc model being good for people with sensitive</li>
            <li>Gives a much closer shave and love the cleaning system, always gives the shaver a nice fresh smell.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>Having to pay $15-20 for shipping + insurance may not be a good idea for a 2-year old shaver that soon will need to replace the head.</li>
            <li>There might be a better electric razor out there somewhere made by some company, but if so it couldn&#x27;t be much or any better than this Braun.</li>
            <li>SO FAR SO GOOD.</li>
            <li>It is superior to my eleven year old Braun.  </li>
            <li>By far the easiest and most effective electric shaver I have ever owned</li>
            <li>The  Series 7-790 is much superior to my old Braun...</li>
            <li>The Braun series 7 gave a smooth and close shave that is very rare for any electric razor.</li>
            <li>(if you remember the old loosen the top and let it run to clean hair out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun is gentle on your skin and great for close shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very well made, and shaves close!!!</li>
            <li>Very powerful to use.</li>
            <li>so far, new razor has been very good, easy to use, clean and maintain..</li>
            <li>With this system I have a nice clean shaver ready every morning.</li>
            <li>It shaves clean and is easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>This is flat out One Great Shaver..</li>
            <li>The new one shaves ok but looks very cheap and plasticy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if is the best out there because Im not going to buy and test all of them, other than that this is a great product I used it every day, I love it.</li>
            <li>I am thankful that Amazon was willing to take care of the refund very smoothly.</li>
            <li>Clean, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>The flex head allows the shaver to stay on the skin and the results are a smooth and clean shave.</li>
            <li>It affords a clean comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning and charging system is quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a long term Braun user having purchased an 8995, which I loved, many years ago.</li>
            <li>I have a super sensitive skin (it was sensitive to the best of the razors) to an extent that even if I shaved on consecutive days, I would have rashes on neck area.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure the dock/cleaner is still working because the light are on and whatnot.  </li>
            <li>He had to get used to it at first, but is pleased now</li>
            <li>It cleans and disinfects just as well as the original cartridge with the added cost savings.</li>
            <li>I was overcharged, but whatever, it was worth it!  </li>
            <li>this is his first braun and he love it</li>
            <li>Having purchased my first Braun shaver almost 30 years ago, I had gone through 4 models since that time and had been completely satisfied with the quality, until now.  </li>
            <li>Braun has improved the shave experience significantly.  </li>
            <li>If your shaving experiences have been similar to mine then you have a much better than even chance of getting the same excellent performance as I from this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>If the replacement foil had been designed like the original, it would still be a 5 star.  </li>
            <li>There is not a replacement head configured like the original on the market.  </li>
            <li>The self-cleaning module isn&#x27;t travel friendly.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I enjoyed it for the first shave</li>
            <li>The ES-25ST will go into a higher RPM when it senses areas that are needing more shaving power....</li>
            <li>Not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Best razor I have ever used, no more nicks.</li>
            <li>The shave is fast, smooth and very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>This new one is just amazing.</li>
            <li>Does a very good job shaving, almost as close as a triple blade razor without the mess.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only on day 2, so I can&#x27;t comment on reliability or durability, but so far I&#x27;m extremely impressed.</li>
            <li>I have always wanted a clean look and a clean look is what this gives and</li>
            <li>the built-in display never indicates it is clean unless I run the stand&#x27;s cleaning cycle.  </li>
            <li>It leaves the razor clean and lubricated, a process I have to repeat every three days</li>
            <li>Has to be plugged in all the time to clean.</li>
            <li>once a week I clean the head with alcohol.  </li>
            <li>i never ever used a electric razor till yesterday,,this clean s itself  and lubercates itself as well..</li>
            <li>Its super comfortable.</li>
            <li>And its really clean.</li>
            <li>No hairs in the sink to clean up afterwards.</li>
            <li>then use a cheapo electric razor to clean up where I missed in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve changed the heads and always kept it clean and lubricated with no avail..</li>
            <li>Clean and close shaves all over except for mustache and bottom of the neck for myself.</li>
            <li>I then pull the Braun shaving head off and clean it under the faucet.</li>
            <li>The shaver leaves your face super smooth and when he is done it&#x27;s holder is self cleaning.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t offer a completely clean shave</li>
            <li>it cannot clean my beard at all.</li>
            <li>I am giving this shaver 4 stars out of 5 because although I love the way it shaves and it is well made I dislike its ergonomics compared with my 10 year-old Braun which this one replaced (the old one broke after many years of use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do use my Water Pic sometimes to clean the head between the times I use the system cleaning.  </li>
            <li>The clean and renew system is a winner too.</li>
            <li>My razor comes out clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>Close shave feels almost as clean as a shave with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>No monkeying around with it to clean it.  </li>
            <li>Quick, close, comfortable shaves.</li>
            <li>yourself some money too, don&#x27;t run a clean cycle after every shave.  </li>
            <li>: Efficient and clean.</li>
            <li>I like that you can use the heat function to clean and then use the shaver soon after.</li>
            <li>They said the shaver provides a clean, close, no-nicks shave.  </li>
            <li>There is no way to clean it thoroughly when traveling.</li>
            <li>You can take it apart and manually clean it</li>
            <li>It never gets my neck clean.</li>
            <li>And the shaver bottom indicates status of shaver battery charge and degree of need to clean.</li>
            <li>Plows through a 4 day growth, clean shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have to use a shaver then use a razor blade and shaving cream for a truly clean shave.</li>
            <li>It takes longer for it to clean itself than suggested.</li>
            <li>I recommend running self clean every 4 or so shaves because the alcohol based</li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t have to take it apart and brush clean the blades every time.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a breeze to clean with the cleaning ports</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very clean shave</li>
            <li>need to be clean for clean shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clean and close shave without the cuts or abrasion burns.  </li>
            <li>I will never use a blade razor again, as close and clean as this shaver gets.  </li>
            <li>It leaves a close shave almost as good as my old Mach3, but in the end I don&#x27;t have to keep buying hundreds of dollars worth of blades.</li>
            <li>After 25 years of a love-hate relationship with electric shavers, spending way too much money on &amp;#34;the next best thing,&amp;#34; and hoping to get a quick, comfortable, smooth shave...I really like this razor.</li>
            <li>He says it is easy and gives him a shave better than his wet shave which is amazing to him.</li>
            <li>Apparently with any Braun shaver, you will only get an excellent shave until the original cartridge wears out.</li>
            <li>I was also concerned that I was wasting money on cleaning solution, but I love knowing the razor is clean and ready to go each morning.</li>
            <li>So I made sure that the shaver was clean, using the included system which I was familiar with from the older 8995.  </li>
            <li>Amazingly, given the extra time it took to shave 3 days growth I experienced utterly zero trace of skin irritation.</li>
            <li>I then waited a few days and experimented with the higher power settings, neither of which were impressive considering the price and the hype about this</li>
            <li>I love Bruan razors; they are gentle on my baby face.</li>
            <li>The  790 is a overall a good value .&lt;br</li>
            <li>I kept that one in good working order by changing the foils and blades every year and cleaning it regularly.  </li>
            <li>I love this so much, i haven&#x27;t used my safety razor since i bought this a month ago.</li>
            <li>this is the way to go for a full beard gentleman.  </li>
            <li>Good for an electric, but it didn&#x27;t shave close enough for me.  </li>
            <li>I have since taken the plunge and switched to a straight razor, much better level of shave.</li>
            <li>:  The shaver by itself is really good, but consider using a pre-shave lotion or gel to even further enhance the speed of shaving.  </li>
            <li>but I really had many hopes before purchasing...</li>
            <li>He says he is going to switch from regular razor blade shaving to this because it&#x27;s so good.</li>
            <li>this is my fourth Braun and they were all not ads good as the fist one.</li>
            <li>The second one lasted about two years, although it&#x27;s still good to go.</li>
            <li>So I did some more research and came across this promising shaver.</li>
            <li>It offers different levels of cleaning based on the time and frequency used, but most of all it just works great from start to finish.</li>
            <li>frankly,it is a good shaver,and have a very low price.</li>
            <li>Best electric shaver for smooth shaving and durability, but also most expensive.</li>
            <li>good shaver！eazy to use and low noise</li>
            <li>For years I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers which while good for the money on the low end, leave me having to shave twice a day.</li>
            <li>This is what i really want amzing i love it</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really cool.  </li>
            <li>- would have paid the full price without the promotion.  </li>
            <li>-  this suggests that the shaver needs a full cleaning almost every day, which is what BRAUN state in the instruction booklet.</li>
            <li>The self cleaning function is cool</li>
            <li>This is the only shaver I have found over the years that does not cause irritation and still gives me a good shave.    </li>
            <li>Similarly I was impressed with how smooth it can be on the low settings.</li>
            <li>Nice close shave and no irritation even though I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gift to my friend and looks so cool when I opened the box.</li>
            <li>shipping was fast and the price was even better than I thought...</li>
            <li>It&#x60;s not bad</li>
            <li>Not a bad replacement for the Panasonic ES-LA63.</li>
            <li>There is no need for any pre-shave but it is important to shave in relatively dry conditions in order to achieve good glide with the shaver.</li>
            <li>Gives a pretty close shave and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>but this is a little better very pleased with the results smooth shave</li>
            <li>Even if you don&#x27;t brush out the head before running the cleaning cycle, it comes out very clean and ready to go.</li>
            <li>the price here was great compared to a lot of other sellers on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Great product - - - everything I expected!</li>
            <li>The Braun 790cc feels perfect and balanced in your hand (this is important since your hand position is changing constantly when shaving to get to different areas of your face &amp; neck), the Panasonic just doesn&#x27;t feel right after using the Braun,&lt;br</li>
            <li>This new Braun just doesn&#x27;t seem to do as good a job as either of my older ones.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been switching back and forth between my aging inexpensive Panasonic wet/dry and the Gillette Power Fusion blade (which is excellent) but decided to step up to a new electric and after much reading of reviews decided on the Braun Series 7 Model 797cc.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that, but it is still a comfortable shaver and can give a pretty smooth shave when done right.</li>
            <li>I like a fresh, clean, fully charged shave every time.</li>
            <li>Nice comfortable shave as compared to my last Braun electric.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t evaporate so quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is my 3rd Braun over the last 20 years and the best one yet.</li>
            <li>The cleaning system is super.</li>
            <li>Close, quick shave.  </li>
            <li>It gives him a close quick shave and does not irritate his face.</li>
            <li>I rarely use a straight razor any more.  </li>
            <li>Gives a close shave, convenient, and quick for a electric razor.</li>
            <li>I suspect that the metal is inferior, resulting in the hole occurring so quickly (without undue abuse by myself).  </li>
            <li>This shaver does not remove hair adequately.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews like the many others I had done before and decided to look on line for this particular shaving system.</li>
            <li>Super</li>
            <li>The cleaning cycle is quick.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, comfortable and fast.  </li>
            <li>Extraordinary shaver.  </li>
            <li>3rd Braun I&#x27;ve owned, they just keep getting better &amp; better.</li>
            <li>It performs adequately for an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s adequate performance levels.</li>
            <li>I expected more, to be honest.  </li>
            <li>I find it does not give a quick shave nor does it give a close shave.</li>
            <li>A quick shave makes me have end up with a 5 oclock shadow at the end of it.</li>
            <li>I can get a quick shave 5 mins before walking out the door and flying for hours knowing I have atleast 12 hours before I need to shave again</li>
            <li>Close and quick shaves.</li>
            <li>The skin is healthy, it doesn&#x27;t irritate as much as my older ones.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend you try it, you will love it.</li>
            <li>I thought this item will be more high tech</li>
            <li>have been a magic shave user since high school (30+ years)</li>
            <li>It has a great self cleaning system that&#x27;s a little noisy but very efficient in keeping the shaver in top condition.</li>
            <li>This shaver is fast and very clean on the face and worth the money.  </li>
            <li>It may be cheap white metal instead of good stainless steel.  </li>
            <li>So soft!I like it very much!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice that it can just do a quick clean cycle that only takes minutes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other Braun electric shavers and this is the best by far.  </li>
            <li>As good as my last Braun was, this is night and day better than my old one Braun shaver.  </li>
            <li>Quality is good, battery lasts long time, cleang and comfort.</li>
            <li>Smooth, non-irritating, fast and every time a clean conditioned/clean shaver.</li>
            <li>Delighted with how easily, quickly and closely it shaves • Shaving dry is not a problem and requires no healing/soothing/smelly lotion afterwards.</li>
            <li>I wanted to purchase something high quality and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>But if you want top-of-the-line and a very clean shave, I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I figured the new technology would be better.  </li>
            <li>this new series by Braun is even better.</li>
            <li>This Braun Series 7-790cc arrived very quickly, less than 48 hours and in 5.0 shape, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>and it really came with strong engine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>a really strong and fast engine that speed up your shaving time.</li>
            <li>The cleaning kit is straight forward and easy to use too.</li>
            <li>First off, let me say I really like this shaver in most respects.</li>
            <li>The Braun Series 7-790cc gives a good shave in dry mode.</li>
            <li>Does just as good a job as the Norelco only a bit slower but much easier to clean.</li>
            <li>For me, allowing the hair to grow for 2-3 days is best and I believe it&#x27;s because the hair is now long enough to be efficiently guided into the foil.(when</li>
            <li>It can clean the shave very fast.</li>
            <li>Recommended to choose the standard packaging, environmentally friendly packaging is very easily damaged.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it would last me more years!</li>
            <li>Suffered through the first month and was told it would get better and sure enough it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I tried the top end Norelco 3D shaver (as well as a few lower end Norelcos), and as much as I wanted to like them (better than foils on a few days growth, excellent customer service and good value, especially on the cheaper models), I found all models to be irritating.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Panasonic has gotten MUCH louder!!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>He was pretty excited to use his and the fact that it has a self cleaning holder</li>
            <li>I love this 790cc so far!</li>
            <li>Razor is useful, for a friend I liked it, the price is very favorable, can be used normally in China.</li>
            <li>love the 3 speeds... easy to hold and solid</li>
            <li>Use it on a daily basis, clean up is very easy</li>
            <li>First electric razor I have ever used that did no require a blade to clean up my face with.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine but doesn&#x27;t really give you a close shave.</li>
            <li>With the Braun I can get ready and get a quick shave in before a saturday night!</li>
            <li>First off, ive been shaving for about 16 yrs now, the first 13 with a reg. mach 3 style razor and it worked fine, but it got too expesive which led me on a search for a cheaper alternative.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and it does a great job.</li>
            <li>fast, close , comfortable shave</li>
            <li>this is my third braun shaver and this 7-790cc is by far the best so far.</li>
            <li>Earlier reviews were thorough enough that I could shop intelligently for the product, and they were accurate.  </li>
            <li>IT IS SUCH AN AMAZING TOOL for my husband.</li>
            <li>This shaving system is great for a man with a heavy beard.  </li>
            <li>I really like it, Smooth and  close with not as many passes as my old one.</li>
            <li>(mine is the neck) and be as light and gentle as you can while pressing the razor to the skin.</li>
            <li>However, it was rougher on my skin than my old Panasonic and did not give me a better shave.</li>
            <li>But after too many years of trying too many &amp;#34;shavers&amp;#34; that simply wouldn&#x27;t do the whole job - beard, stray hairs, trimming -</li>
            <li>Not too loud; charge stays for more than a week.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this razor is worth</li>
            <li>I had a nice, simple, Phillips Norelco XL Shaver that provided a nice close shave for years until it finally died.  </li>
            <li>Love it so far.</li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s pricey, but I think it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of reviews and settled on this one and am well pleased with it thus far (about 3 months).</li>
            <li>The price is steep, but Braun quality is worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Love this razor so far ...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good as expected</li>
            <li>My husband has sensitive skin and has tried many electric razors.  </li>
            <li>What I love about it is the closeness of the shave coupled with a complete lack of irritation.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>It is well worth it for the price in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>IT IS FULLY WORTH THE PRICE.  </li>
            <li>It came on time and has been well worth the money.</li>
            <li>IT IS FULLY WORTH THE PRICE.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It works even better than my old 5 series shaver.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t use the cleaner that often, but I will rinse it out on my own after each use and only put it in the cleaner when it needs to be charged.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic shaver and SOOOO much better than the Series 5 (with the possible exception of the flimsier trimmer).</li>
            <li>I like the charge gauge to really get a good feel for how power you have left.  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m pleased as I could be</li>
            <li>and it seems well worth the price paid.</li>
            <li>(cost a lot, but worth it).</li>
            <li>Shaved off almost a weeks worth of growth</li>
            <li>The trimmer leaves what to be desired, feels a bit flimsy and doesn&#x27;t look like it belongs on such a nice shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Totally worth the cost.</li>
            <li>and so do I when it comes to shaving so keeping it fresh</li>
            <li>Close shave...much better than my old 8 series.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s well worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so useful.</li>
            <li>The 8995 would have been near the top of the line at the time.  </li>
            <li>And the smile on his face...priceless.</li>
            <li>so you know you get your moneys worth.</li>
            <li>So far I have 0 complaints I love this thing.  </li>
            <li>The old Braun had a more useful display than the one on the bottom of this</li>
            <li>The holes in the foil are only of one kind and do not let hair into it well.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t your face worth a couple of coffees a month?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the price though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The old series 6 shaved closer, and didn&#x27;t require as many passes to get it all (or the face contortion).  </li>
            <li>This shaver is fun to use.  </li>
            <li>it is worth every cent.  </li>
            <li>Always good as expected, have used Braun shaver 24 years.</li>
            <li>I own a Braun coffee maker for several years now, still working well.</li>
            <li>that was useful.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s well worth the hih price.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;d say this is 100% worth it for a day to day shaver.  </li>
            <li>I now own two of these shaving systems, one in each of two different residences.</li>
            <li>still getting use to it, but so far I love it</li>
            <li>My husband lost his old Braun shaver he got more than 8 yrs ago.</li>
            <li>Replaced my 10 year old Braun with this newer model; love the close shave.</li>
            <li>but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>Pricey, but well worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price of 159.00.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s powerful.</li>
            <li>the sounds of the electric motor sounds substantial and powerful.</li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave and has very useful and functional features.</li>
            <li>He has since beginning to shave, some 55 years ago, always used a straight razor, so this is a very new expirience, which he is enjoying.</li>
            <li>Not as clean of a shave as with a razor but good enough to appear shelved and professional at work.</li>
            <li>I almost purchased this shaver, but luckily I read the reviews for the replacement cartridges first.</li>
            <li>I love the ability to charge the razor and clean it all at the same time.  </li>
            <li>But the biggest problem I had with this unit was that I had to keep going over the same areas more than once in order to get a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>Motor sounds good running --- not as if it is going to seize up at any moment as on other electrics.</li>
            <li>, very close shave with no irritation or bit, user friendly</li>
            <li>It is indeed superior to other Braun models.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It provides a much closer shave than my original model.</li>
            <li>This shaver gives a good shave but there were other problems.</li>
            <li>Quiet, runs for a long time on one charge and provides a very good shave.</li>
            <li>I go right over my lips to not miss a hair</li>
            <li>and I will get something to drink right after shaving</li>
            <li>This time, one broke right before the warranty is up</li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>So instead of returning the product right away</li>
            <li>just right..</li>
            <li>It has the right heft to the shaver and there is no plasticky feel to it as there is with a Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Just plugged it in right out of the box.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research to find the right one.  </li>
            <li>Based upon reviews and websites this is the right razor.  </li>
            <li>As you can see it doesn&#x27;t look like the right one.</li>
            <li>-- you have to twist the shaver a bit to get it in just the right spot for it to charge.</li>
            <li>after seeing some of the other reviewers&#x27; issues, but so far, so good!</li>
            <li>Using the cleaner really helps keep the blades clean and shaving close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>clean really works</li>
            <li>an outstanding Razor, not my first one, my old Braun wore out and I had to get another Braun.</li>
            <li>Much quieter, close shave and seems easier to clean too.</li>
            <li>a positive note, the Braun gives a better shave from a smaller shaver head than those huge Panasonics and  unwieldy Norelcos.</li>
            <li>I broke down and used a gift card, cash back dollars and my credit card to buy this wonderful device.  </li>
            <li>I have a very heavy beard and this is by far the best electric razor I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>This is my third Braun over some twenty years and I freely admit this is better than the last, which was better than the first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had expected a new shaver at this price would provide a great shaving experience.  </li>
            <li>Quiet, smooth and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I find that shaving a half hour after my shower provides the best overall shave, however if that is not an option, shave before showering.</li>
            <li>It is quick and gentle--no more red cheeks!</li>
            <li>My new 7-790cc pleases me as a fine purchase selection.</li>
            <li>I now get more control, better, quicker charging and the ability to use wet which really improves the shave.</li>
            <li>initial impression was not terrific since I was used to the very close shave I always received from a two bladed Sensor XL, but as the owner&#x27;s manual suggested, I did use the Braun Series 7 790cc for another 5 shaves to enable some experimentation/practice, and once I got used to it and the different settings for the various parts of my face and neck, I became more and more impressed.</li>
            <li>one and take it for a ride, could be exciting ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>1st razor I invested in normally get cheap ones.</li>
            <li>As much based on my personal experience with their products over the years as the many available reviews.  </li>
            <li>Please wrote more detail informations of goods as possible as you can, that like be origin, what kind of material, technical.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my fiance, and it leaves his face feeling as smooth as if he had just shaved with a normal razor blade.</li>
            <li>The shaver does get warm if you use it for too long.</li>
            <li>The higher RPM for cleaning of the ES8249 is not missed on the ES-25ST; it works just fine with the normal speed.</li>
            <li>I think a better job can be done quickly by popping off the head, rinsing it with hot water, spraying with alcohol, brushing off the motor output area with the provided brush, and popping the head back on.</li>
            <li>Smooth as a baby&#x27;s new borne butt.  </li>
            <li>Not brand new razor smooth but close.</li>
            <li>He certainly does like the ease of cleaning!</li>
            <li>That said even if you didn&#x27;t the cleaning system is still worth it because of how clean and new the shaver feels each time it&#x27;s used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted something quick and fast.</li>
            <li>Amazon is great because of the add on suggestions, so also purchased the extra cleaning solution and extra blade</li>
            <li>Series 7 is not as good a razor as the Series 5 I previously had.</li>
            <li>Close shave; easy to clean; solid</li>
            <li>The cleaning solution is easily replaced and if you only clean when the indicator is at 2 or 3, the solution lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li>you DO NOT have to take the Cleaning station with you when you travel, the charging cord plugs directly into the razor itself and cleaning it by hand is easy.  </li>
            <li>It quick charges and cleans so its ready to go as soon as I need it.</li>
            <li>However I am happy to say that the Series 7-760  has met those same standards and I look forward to using it for the next 5 to 7 years.</li>
            <li>I would go so far as to say that it is easily 95% of what one would expect from a blade shave.</li>
            <li>Does not give a clean shave in nooks and hollows that easily -- you have to try different angles.</li>
            <li>I also found the 3D worked better when using a shaving gel and not dry.  </li>
            <li>The shave is a lot better and closer - cheeks and particularly under the chin and on the neck feel smooth, and the hairs that grow in different directions on the neck were all trimmed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everyone had a good deal going on because it was around Black Friday</li>
            <li>But keep in mind a good prep and post shave is key if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>also, a good post shave is KEY for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>just what I wanted fast, quick, easy and no mess.</li>
            <li>Maintenance is also very convenient!I like it very much!</li>
            <li>On my first shave with this, I think I was a little disappointed, but for the price, I was probably expecting it to be perfect with a flawless shave on the first pass.</li>
            <li>Five stars for very smooth shave, but only four for the cleaning module instructions.</li>
            <li>and send another one to my friend ,he like it very much</li>
            <li>like the product very much.</li>
            <li>My husband very much likes his Braun.</li>
            <li>With a Braun you press the shaver moderately against the face unlike a Norelco which requires a very light touch.</li>
            <li>He likes it very much.</li>
            <li>If shaving with a new Gillette blade is considered the closest shave- 5 stars, and the old Norelco a strong 3 stars ( electric is never as close as blade), this Braun just doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;cut it\\&quot; !</li>
            <li>Good razor but a little pricy.</li>
            <li>Finally, shave until your face &amp;#34;looks&amp;#34; clean rather than &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; smooth.</li>
            <li>First, the self cleaning process seems to do a good job at cleaning the razor blades, and foil, but does not clean the outer part of the foil (the plastic parts of either side of the foils).</li>
            <li>I stopped short of 5 stars as the pop out trimmer is not as handy as the older units when it came to tidying up my beard -</li>
            <li>Relatively quiet, very smooth, and a nice close shave with minimal effort.</li>
            <li>It feels more substantial; but, after using it for several weeks now I believe my 20 year old braun achieved a closer shave (the older trimmer worked better also).  </li>
            <li>powerful.&lt;br /&gt;- The vibrating action makes a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>However, I am overall satisfied eith this product.</li>
            <li>Note that this is the first electric shaver he has used in over 45 years -</li>
            <li>or some nice features like how many minutes you spent for your last shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First let me say that I know a traditional blade is always better</li>
            <li>This is the first electric shaver I have used/owned after using blades for over 50 years.</li>
            <li>First, I bought this off walmart.com, because at the time, with rebates, it was about $40 cheaper.</li>
            <li>I rarely use this, so its not too much a concern to me.</li>
            <li>but with some things to be aware of&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast arrival however doesn&#x27;t give a close shave!</li>
            <li>Comfortable to hold, not too loud.  </li>
            <li>For an electric razor, it&#x27;s pretty quiet.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves with one and hasn&#x27;t seen a  bump since!</li>
            <li>Cleaning light indicates the shaver requires cleaning after about 3 shaves, but the battery light indicates that it will go a long time before charging is required.</li>
            <li>I shower first.</li>
            <li>This comes 97% close to be exact.</li>
            <li>I have had this shaver for about 4 months now, this is my first electric razor.</li>
            <li>The 790cc is maybe just a tad more powerful, but really, I can&#x27;t tell a big difference.</li>
            <li>The big improvement over the 8585 is the handle  design which makes the grip much better and improves the maneuverability of the shaver.</li>
            <li>It is very noisy and vibrates a lot!</li>
            <li>This razor is exactly what my husband has been looking for.</li>
            <li>Thanks!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful and shaves fast and close.</li>
            <li>fix it the first time.  </li>
            <li>My first time in my life I choose to go with an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>Even when you pass over it from the correct direction the razor might not get it on the first pass.  </li>
            <li>Seems better to shave daily, rather than shaving longer stubble</li>
            <li>The first time it happened, I contacted Braun and let them know it broke immediately after the warranty...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to go back to the Panasonic which is now NOT well made but shaves better  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different shavers that my wife thinks that I am a nut case.</li>
            <li>This 790 model is much quieter than past models (wife is quite happy about that).</li>
            <li>(at least that&#x27;s what the razor tells me, another great feature).</li>
            <li>My first one lasted about three years before the popup trimmer popped off altogether.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>At the time I would have never of spent that kind of money on a shaver, but my wife had no problem and I am so grateful for her splurging.</li>
            <li>I bought one when they first came out years ago &amp;</li>
            <li>So, when it came time to replace my last one I gravitated to Braun again and decided to get one of the top models.  </li>
            <li>This was my first series 7 from Braun.</li>
            <li>but this is the first time in my 70 years of life and</li>
            <li>( in their defense they have better razors with a bigger price tag, you get what you pay for)  </li>
            <li>It is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I have been shaving with various non-electric razors most of my life.  </li>
            <li>First foil shaver that I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>But overall is one of the better shavers that I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>YOU CANNOT RETURN THIS ITEM BE AWARE.</li>
            <li>first it gave me horrendous shaving burn, but I stuck with it.</li>
            <li>Consistent with the Consumer Reports review, this shaver performs as advertised.</li>
            <li>Importantly, It does not have plastic type of guard to protect the foil part even though it has soft carrying case(bag).</li>
            <li>My husband thought he would never be able to get a close shave again since he is no longer allowed to use a regular razor after heart surgery.</li>
            <li>I chose it over the one that ranked first for a close shave for two reasons.</li>
            <li>Not as close as the razor but pretty damn close.</li>
            <li>I first put Gillette Foamy shaving cream on my face and shave with the Braun.</li>
            <li>Because it was my first go with this razor and</li>
            <li>That is, trying to get as many of the &amp;#34;straggler hairs&amp;#34; as possible.</li>
            <li>First electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>Any man would LOVE to have this for a present so grab this up.</li>
            <li>For all intents and purposes this is my first electric razor.</li>
            <li>Highly recommand!!</li>
            <li>Great shaver works well on thick beards.</li>
            <li>Shave is not close enough and the cleaning is more cumbersome than the Norellco.</li>
            <li>Works great for my husband whose hair is really thick.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;m writing a review for any product on Amazon</li>
            <li>The first thing is the vibration.</li>
            <li>Running it under hot water does the job I guess because you can&#x27;t take the shaving head apart.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s very well built and does the job!</li>
            <li>The first place I use it is to shave my head, which it does so effortlessly.</li>
            <li>It does make a higher pitched noise when using it</li>
            <li>First time buyer of a Braun shaved.</li>
            <li>No burns or irritation from electric razor, which is a first in my experience.</li>
            <li>The shorter coming that the shake and noise are bit higher.</li>
            <li>This is my second top of the line Braun.</li>
            <li>My first still works after eight years with just shaver head replacements.</li>
            <li>Very close shave!</li>
            <li>I used first one for 10 years.</li>
            <li>Thought I would try an electric razor for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Wanted to see if the technology had changed or improved since last using one many years ago.  </li>
            <li>Yes it costs $80 more ea year, but it makes the razor last 15 years</li>
            <li>Using Aramis lotion or Lectric Shave helps and you must not wash your face before you shave or shave when you first get up.</li>
            <li>In additional,  I really enjoy the trim setting that allows you to get a normal shave or a really close shave.</li>
            <li>Do the head first and then the face.  </li>
            <li>Today Saturday, I tried to use the self-cleaning for the first time.</li>
            <li>but I am starting to love it.</li>
            <li>It only takes more time to shave than a manual razor.</li>
            <li>and I know I had cleaned it 2 times before that, between my first</li>
            <li>I would buy it again in a heartbeat if I had the money, but sadly I do not.  </li>
            <li>I am sure all the razors aren&#x27;t defective, especially when looking at this products rockstar ratings!  </li>
            <li>I have had several (too many to remember) rotary razors</li>
            <li>I decided to go with a Panisonic model electric shaver instead, as the reviews for their replacement cartridges are stellar.</li>
            <li>The first head must be defective.  </li>
            <li>However, the first time I tried it, I was amazed ...  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very upset with this razor!  </li>
            <li>I just replaced my first container of cleaner conditioner.</li>
            <li>This will feel great for you IF you never tried a Panasonic &amp;#60;made in Japan&amp;#62; ever checked where Braun are made lately?</li>
            <li>I was very surprised as to how much my shave was closer and still felt better than my older Braun shaver.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so good that 24 hours later is like 8 hours later with the Norelco I was using (a cheap 30 dollar model when new</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor if you want a quick shave that doesn&#x27;t irritate your face.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing electric razor especially for African American skin which most electric razors aren&#x27;t friendly too.</li>
            <li>I put my old one at my cabin and have found that I truly can&#x27;t wait to get home to use the new one because it feels so much better.</li>
            <li>Shave is more comfortable with less skin irritation and closer shave.</li>
            <li>I have owned several Braun shavers, Remignton and others and never before gotten a full clean shave.</li>
            <li>The clean deck is seem not much useful, water cleanning is ok</li>
            <li>This is my second time buying this product, the first lasting about a good 4 - 4.5 years.</li>
            <li>nice product works extremely well</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to affect anything, the shaver still seems clean, runs smoothly the next use, and the next cleaning cycle works just fine.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to affect anything, the shaver still seems clean, runs smoothly the next use, and the next cleaning cycle works just fine.</li>
            <li>I  am back to using my old Norelco with a set of new heads and it does a much superior job compared to this piece of junk.  </li>
            <li>which drys my now dry face and hair and provides a clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Seriously, this is one heck of a great shaver.</li>
            <li>I did notice in the manual that if the shaver is relatively clean and battery fully charged, the status display should be dim.</li>
            <li>At times I&#x27;ve noticed a dim blinking in the display, so perhaps with increased use it will brighten when the unit is not so clean and charged.</li>
            <li>You can just remove the cover and clean it the old fashioned way.</li>
            <li>Owned an older version and this was no disappointment.  </li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t clean my old one until I had run the battery out.</li>
            <li>Overall, the razor is good but it just can&#x27;t compete with a traditional razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I especially like the cleaning action that it performs on its own.</li>
            <li>You can get the same or better product for much less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update August 13, 2014</li>
            <li>For a heavy beard (after 2-3 days of not shaving), I use the Lab Series Lotion to lubricate before shaving which works well to set up my beard for a more comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>It works quite nicely, the only downside is that the cleaning mode is loud.  </li>
            <li>The shave as a whole is much better than competitors and will not go back to a rotary style shaver.</li>
            <li>I replaced my old Series 7 with this updated model and am quite pleased thus far.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast, love this shaver my last Braun shaver lasted over 10&lt;br /&gt;Years</li>
            <li>With others, i have to go back and forth several times to get a good shave.  </li>
            <li>It was a positive change, it has the closest shave and never harms the skin.  </li>
            <li>This one always topped the lists with positive reviews an after using I can see why.  </li>
            <li>Let me start this off with something positive....</li>
            <li>I have facial hair that routinely kills normal shaver about every nine months, plus they never gave me a really smooth shave -- for special events</li>
            <li>in the beginning the results were not good but after 1 week the results are great as I got used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The razor still shaves as expected but again, when you spend the money to buy a top of the line razor you expect it to last more than 18 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I had pretty much given up on electric razors.</li>
            <li>Oh well -- a minor annoyance for an otherwise outstanding shaving system.</li>
            <li>It shaves very close and cleans itself very well!</li>
            <li>that pretty much copies the Braun, but</li>
            <li>The razor gets hot, and it vibrates very noisily.  </li>
            <li>My first Braun and I really like it.</li>
            <li>a small price for a good article</li>
            <li>life is good, i usually put it in the cleaning station after use, which charges as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>life is good, i usually put it in the cleaning station after use, which charges as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The razor gives a good shave, thought no better than the 39.95 ones for sale.</li>
            <li>All of these (so far) have held true.</li>
            <li>This Braun Series 7-790cc is a good razor, however, I was not satisfied.</li>
            <li>This coming from the guy that liked the old one so much he went with the same brand.</li>
            <li>I now use this razor on the extra sensitive mode and it is FAR superior to any electric razor I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li>Operates very smoothly and quietly compared to most other electrics.     </li>
            <li>clean, smelling fresh, properly sanitized.</li>
            <li>For the last month I have had to go over my face many times to get a decent shave.  </li>
            <li>I just spent 2 weeks in the hospital and it took off all the growth easily!</li>
            <li>I have a lemon fresh practically brand new shaver to work with.</li>
            <li>I owned a previous model and it was amazing.  </li>
            <li>this razor would easily get 5 stars if the pop up trimmer wasn&#x27;t a total joke.</li>
            <li>I have noticed in the last week that the head doesn&#x27;t pivot as easily as it did before</li>
            <li>a previous series braun and i liked that one to</li>
            <li>Long lasting battery - 3-4 times and counting, good for travel too.</li>
            <li>plenty of power to cut through the toughest facial hair, and it holds a charge for well over a full week worth of shaves at over 10 to 12 minutes per shave.</li>
            <li>most of my adult life, and really liked the two (2) Braun 3550 single foil shavers (long since discontinued).</li>
            <li>It comes with one cleaning cartridge which is a sturdy plastic container holding the liquid cleaner which is largely alcohol.</li>
            <li>It will take either the Smart or the Opti foil cartridges</li>
            <li>I give the razor a quick brush clean after every shave and then do the electric clean every third or fourth shave to hopefully prolong the cleaning cartridge refills.</li>
            <li>More simple than DE, same discomfort with the problems of a DE, and not as cool haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>think Philips shavers ones may be better, especially the new ones</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for an earlier model I had enjoyed using for 7 years but wanted a new one.</li>
            <li>I have been always buying Braun products due to their nice design and the high quality of the product.</li>
            <li>squaring off the sideburns is easy with the trimmer (which works very well), but doesn&#x27;t shave close enough for me.</li>
            <li>According to the owners manual you can clean the shaver with hot running water and put  a small drop of light machine oil on top of the Foil &amp; Cutter cassette each week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this shaver for several weeks</li>
            <li>The Braun Pulsonic razor is the most comfortable, fast &amp; long lasting electric razor on the market.  </li>
            <li>But this one is VERY comfortable (and for me a razor is really rough).</li>
            <li>and it looks perfectly clean, but the indicator, apparently, doesn&#x27;t quite agree.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary: if your facial hair grows in a normal pattern and have a full head of hair, consider yourself lucky and buy this razor.  </li>
            <li>My husband still prefers his Gillette Fusion, but it is very good in a pinch or in a secondary shave later on in the day.</li>
            <li>wish braun company makes it more user friendly and make charging method easy than using complicated channels.</li>
            <li>The pulsonic feature of the shaver doesn&#x27;t seem to make a huge difference on occasional use</li>
            <li>Additionally it is very difficultt to get a close shave with this system.</li>
            <li>It however does not provide as close a shave as a straight edge.</li>
            <li>Have been using the Series -7900cc for the past couple of months now and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>i really miss those features</li>
            <li>Yes, never in a million years did I think I would pay this much for a shaver.  </li>
            <li>: cleaning system is great and u can refill it with Philips Norelco cleaning fluid which probably has same fluid and is much cheaper</li>
            <li>Otherwise a much quieter sand smoother shave.</li>
            <li>I found it provides a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>This razor gives my husband a really close shave.</li>
            <li>Shaves close and all the spots without much effort.</li>
            <li>Much closer than my Braun</li>
            <li>Much cheaper and works just as well with no downside.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write reviews very often</li>
            <li>The Braun is much faster, but still missed hairs and caused breakouts.</li>
            <li>Comes with cleaning system at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Performs very well.</li>
            <li>and it won&#x27;t give you a very close shave.</li>
            <li>tried straight razors as well.</li>
            <li>It is plenty fast.</li>
            <li>No this electric shaver does not get as close as a straight razor, but you cannot tell unless you put my skin follicles under a microscope.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have much luck with electric shavers before.</li>
            <li>Shaves faster, quiter  and much closer than any electric I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>So, I contacted Amazon customer service and they immediately sent a replacement of the whole unit that arrived in two days.</li>
            <li>but would have preferred a straight edge rather than</li>
            <li>A friend recommended to use electric shavers and that really did the trick, it reduce my ingrown hairs by a bunch and eventually they were gone.</li>
            <li>The cleaning cycle works really well and the cartridge of cleaner doesn&#x27;t run out as fast as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>Get the whole package including the cleaner, it works really well.</li>
            <li>The electric is much easier on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>As an added bonus it is much easier on my face than a blade.</li>
            <li>works very well.  </li>
            <li>This is a well made shaver, very robust heads</li>
            <li>The 790 does an excellent job cutting through 3 and even 5 day growth however.  </li>
            <li>I really like this shaver.</li>
            <li>I got tired of the shaving cream razor method and this is just great.</li>
            <li>However, this one really caught my attention.</li>
            <li>I was looking to get away from replacement costs when I switched from my straight razor.</li>
            <li>thanks..</li>
            <li>The replacement parts are much cheaper than the competitors.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy construction.</li>
            <li>We get a really close shave and</li>
            <li>Very rarely do I really regret a purchase, this time I do.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t use after shave either; does your face really need chemicals splashed on it?)&lt;br /</li>
            <li>and he really likes the cleaning feature.  </li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>You have to really dig into your skin and thus get nicked by the blades.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really needed to be replaced yet, but I like to have it on hand when it does need replacement.</li>
            <li>the power switch need a very big push!, but in a word, fantastic.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much to say for the pros that aren&#x27;t already in the product description.</li>
            <li>BUT it really had some issues I didn&#x27;t care for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>:When shaving the Panasonic seems MUCH bulkier the Braun.</li>
            <li>You get a really close shave without all the irritation and discomfort</li>
            <li>I get a real close shave too.</li>
            <li>real downside of the 7-series, however, is its pop-up trimmer.</li>
            <li>Which means I&#x27;ll keep the 790 as a backup and go back to the 320s-4 as the primary.  </li>
            <li>This whole thing has me contemplating something I haven&#x27;t thought of doing for a couple of decades, which is to try a blade again.  </li>
            <li>This shaver continues to allow me to spend as much time as I want to get the job done without the irritation.</li>
            <li>this is wet shaving using shaving gel, but by doing that, I get WAY closer than I was ever able to get with another electric razor.</li>
            <li>I really like the feel and cut from this shaver.  </li>
            <li>While I had reservations about the price, I pulled the trigger anyway in hopes of finally getting a bump free shaving experience, but it just didn&#x27;t work out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>addition to taking longer to shave AND leaving way too much hair on my face</li>
            <li>it comes with and hit a button and it determines how much it needs to be cleaned, whether it needs to be charged or not and it dows all that with the touch of a button.</li>
            <li>Cuts close and fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Wow, have to say it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li>it shaves in a straight line (unlike the rotary motion that Philips specifies) - much easier to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really quietest Braune yet.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Great quality, poor flip up trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I dislike the pop up trimmer&#x27;s angle straight out of the body of the shaver...</li>
            <li>The shaver gave me a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>Oct 2015; I had the Series 5 and the Series 7 gives a much, much closer shave, plus the additional adjustments for a closer shave</li>
            <li>Works better than I expected</li>
            <li>Should have invested in this 790cc model much sooner.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>This unit works very efficiently.  </li>
            <li>Makes life so much easier.</li>
            <li>Shave against the grain and using a foil like this Braun, shave in straight motions and at 90 degrees to the face.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it that much yet, but all in all</li>
            <li>It is far better than the last razor and cuts very close.  </li>
            <li>but I think this one really warrants 5 stars from me.</li>
            <li>I follow the instructions and get a really close</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m convinced that the hygiene meter means absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>It shaves close, although I really don&#x27;t care if not as close as a blade, if I wanted that close, I would still be using a blade.</li>
            <li>Very quiet.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This shaver shaves you really close without the nicks and cuts that sometime accompany a close shaver.  </li>
            <li>Clean,quickly,easy to use and not too much noise.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>but for the rest of us, this 790cc will do the job and do it very well.</li>
            <li>I have since thrown them all away along with the whole cleaning unit.</li>
            <li>In fact, it&#x27;s almost as close as a safety razor, and over my 70 years I have always preferred a safety razor when I really wanted to have a close shave.  </li>
            <li>The amazon price is much cheaper than you buy at China.</li>
            <li>Shaves are much closer with no burn.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I received this as a Christmas gigt and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I have a light beard and multiple passes are needed to shave any area.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just as fast as any electric model on the market.</li>
            <li>packaging was much appreciated (no clam-shell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much quieter and shaves much closer and faster.  </li>
            <li>with sales or a rebate, you are going to spend over a hundred dollars, perhaps even as much as a hundred and fifty for this razor.  </li>
            <li>Really like the gauge though</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant before buying this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning port works very well</li>
            <li>It shaves my face and neck very efficiently with no irritation.</li>
            <li>does not shave neck real close.</li>
            <li>Real close shave.</li>
            <li>and I really wish I could like the razor</li>
            <li>It shaves very well</li>
            <li>It does share really well</li>
            <li>I had been waiting close to a year to justify spending this much for it.  </li>
            <li>: it&#x27;s much quieter than Braun&#x27;s 760.</li>
            <li>My wife tends to complain that I make too much noise shaving.</li>
            <li>Thanks Braun</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>Really like this razor.  </li>
            <li>Rather, I suck it up and pay way too much for the cartridge.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me and let it grow for over a day, or have fast growing hair, it will be agonizing to use.</li>
            <li>This really is the closest electric shaver shave I have had.  </li>
            <li>They also state that the cleaning cartridge is good for about 30 cleanings, and that it should be replaced at least every 8 weeks because the lubricant will settle to the bottom of the solution.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Braun, my last one finally went out</li>
            <li>I am absolutely sure that I could return it as safely as it got here, but the law/ shipping policies are rules that cannot be broken by a college kid.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think shaving could get much better than with my (ten years old)</li>
            <li>but its nice and quiet with different settings you can use...been using for about a month and havent had to replace the head or the gel.</li>
            <li>Braun on the other hand is quite quiet and shaving early morning is no longer a problem, honestly you can even hear when the heads hit whiskers vs a clean area, sounds funny</li>
            <li>Very powerful, so not very quiet.  </li>
            <li>Very nice looking machine; feels good in the hand (a heavy, expensive feel), and glides well across the face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cleaner cartridge lasted me about 5 weeks before I had my first change (which was simple, and quick).</li>
            <li>I generally have to do a quick shave with the razor afterwards.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The razor isn&#x27;t exactly quiet, but the steady hum of the Braun foil is far more acceptable than the chunky buzzing of the Norelco rotary.  </li>
            <li>Let me make a long review short, LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>old 7 series was 2 or 3 years old and still on the original blades.  </li>
            <li>I shaved in less than 5 minutes now, so is definitely a quick smooth shave, no pain</li>
            <li>I really prefer the clean feeling of a traditional shave</li>
            <li>but I am able to shave every other day with no problem</li>
            <li>Braun has always delivered a shave better than other brands for me.</li>
            <li>I have owned the top of the line arc 5 panasonic razor and found it extremely paniful</li>
            <li>The Norelco came close, but it irritated my skin like many other people.</li>
            <li>Much better than I expected!</li>
            <li>I found the Braun 5 to be the better of the other 2</li>
            <li>The original had multiple configuration holes.  </li>
            <li>My first Braun electric razor is now eight years old and still works!</li>
            <li>Better shave than other electric shavres that I have tried.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t think of anything else better to use other than a Harry&#x27;s blade.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please make a smart decision and avoid this as much as you can unless your skin is quite immune and you are ok with some black spots on your face</li>
            <li>Although the braun 790cc has a high price tag it is worth it if you suffer from sensitive skin like I do.</li>
            <li>and the money spent to buy it is well worth it!!</li>
            <li>worth the higher price for such a well-manufactured product.</li>
            <li>Keep it in the stand and clean it once daily.  </li>
            <li>AS I GOT OLDER, AND WITH THE NEEDED MEDICINE FOR AGING PROBLEMS, MY SKIN GOT VERY TENDER.  </li>
            <li>AS I GOT OLDER, AND WITH THE NEEDED MEDICINE FOR AGING PROBLEMS, MY SKIN GOT VERY TENDER.</li>
            <li>The cleaning solution last me about 45 days or so, but I clean and charge mine after every use.</li>
            <li>I clean one or two times a week and don&#x27;t notice a difference in operation compared to daily cleaning.</li>
            <li>The only way to clean it is in it&#x27;s cleaning stand.</li>
            <li>I could open the Norelco cutters up and clean them.    </li>
            <li>but my wife still says \\&quot;what&#x27;s that?\\&quot; from the living room when I clean it and the shaver cycles on &amp; off several times.    </li>
            <li>This is my first experience with a foil razor, but, so far, I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I now only clean the thing with the docking station once every month or two.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The charging stand pumps a cleaning fluid across the foil while the unit is activated to clean.</li>
            <li>It sterilizes the blades and lubricates them properly so you do not need to use oil or manually clean it every time you shave.</li>
            <li>I only wish that I didnt have to clean it every 3-4 days (with system) but that can be negotiated around.</li>
            <li>Also, the Braun shaver is easier to clean using only liquid soap and water.</li>
            <li>Most days I just cut the long hairs and reduce everything down to a uniform stubble unless I really want to look nice, then I spend the extra 5-6 minutes to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend cleaning cartridge depend how much you shave.  </li>
            <li>Eventually as your face adjusts to the new shaver you can lengthen the shave and shave to that smooth feel, about ten minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For special occasions (once a month or so) I shave with a regular razor after shaving with the electical razor.</li>
            <li>The Braun is a worthwhile purchase for me due to its adaptability/flexibility, easiness of maintenance, and high quality.</li>
            <li>In fact it was still going strong 6 years later, but I bought this because my old one was looking beat up</li>
            <li>Good price for the product,lot less noisy than my last one .</li>
            <li>The new version is pure garbage.  </li>
            <li>It comes with three settings designed to give either a gentle, normal, or close shave.</li>
            <li>I guess i was just surprised when I first discovered this (about 1 month into using the shaver).</li>
            <li>I guess i was just surprised when I first discovered this (about 1 month into using the shaver).</li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver and so far I have no complaints.</li>
            <li>It is pretty loud when it cleans but</li>
            <li>I knew I wanted the higher end 790 but didn&#x27;t want to pay the near 200 price tag at the time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry shaving the razor is good but not nearly as good.</li>
            <li>Have yet to use the trimmer element or switch to an intensity higher than the sensitive one but trust me</li>
            <li>the battery often won&#x27;t last through 2 full shaves.</li>
            <li>although it shaves much better than any competitor, I have to work at the softer hairs down the neck</li>
            <li>He has a very tough beard, but this shaver gets rid of it beautifully.  </li>
            <li>This one works really well and the cleaning feature seems to work better than my last Braun, needless to say I&#x27;m quiet Satisfied :-)</li>
            <li>I bought new one!</li>
            <li>My husband loves his new razor!</li>
            <li>and it still works as if new!</li>
            <li>but new one is much closer.</li>
            <li>I have previously used a Norelco 3 head rotary for many years.</li>
            <li>I typically upgrade to better features as opposed to having one die on me.</li>
            <li>Much better than previous Braun shaver.</li>
            <li>I had a Braun (forgot the model #) for years before this, and this one is better than the previous one.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s some tugging as I shave, but this razor does it faster and better than previous razors I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Bought as a replacement for my previous 5 series I owed for many years.</li>
            <li>And the battery life seems better than my previous Brauns.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to get more than six hours out of a shave, compared to eight to ten with a traditional razor.</li>
            <li>I had been using a much older Braun and a Norelco.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;ll shave with this 790 and then finish up with one of my older shavers.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this mainly for travel.  </li>
            <li>The fluid drys up too quickly.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price and the base is very impressive.</li>
            <li>Sure, buying the cleaning cartridges is spendy but there are simple ways to refill them yourself or make the factory ones last.</li>
            <li>If you have hair which grows from various directions on a patch of skin, you have to pass the razor over the same spot from many directions to get it all.  </li>
            <li>I had been using an older Braun shaver and it was time to move on.</li>
            <li>only negative I would say is that the trimmer is not that great.  </li>
            <li>Main use was to shave my head.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have particularly dense stubble, but I would say my skin is quite sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>How could a famous manufacturer let such obvious malfunctioned product out is beyond my understanding.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cleaning mechanism looks to be decently designed.</li>
            <li>Getting a close shave is possible but it takes me many repetitions over the same area to achieve it.</li>
            <li>expected far better craftsmanship from Braun.</li>
            <li>This is the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned that actually can cut my beard and leave a pretty close</li>
            <li>- I got a super price from Amazon, especially with the $30.00 coupon.</li>
            <li>Today I changed shaver heads and it was back to a quick close shave again.  </li>
            <li>I owned an older Braun series 7,but</li>
            <li>have actually gone back to my $30 rotary razor and it gives a much better shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shave is decent but you still need to spend some time getting a close shave.</li>
            <li>The cleaning liquid last several months and keeps my blades in top order.</li>
            <li>I chose this to replace an older, cheaper  Norelco.</li>
            <li>My main motivation for getting this was reduced costs of ownership.</li>
            <li>I had a 5 Series immediately prior to this purchase and several models (over many years) of Norelco Rotary Shavers but none shaved as closely as this 7 Series.  </li>
            <li>It is still within 30 days of the original purchase, and 3 weeks since my first use, but due to policies regarding shipping and flammable chemicals I am not allowed to return the item.  </li>
            <li>For my Asian beard (larger diameter hairs), it does not work any better than a Norelco with rotary blades.  </li>
            <li>The shave quality seemed to drop off rapidly after a month, but is decent.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is its lack of power storage that can last more that an hour or so.  </li>
            <li>Fluid cartridges wear out quickly.</li>
            <li>The replacement works perfectly and confirmed for me why Amazon Prime is where I go first no matter what I&#x27;m buying -- big or small item, big or small price.</li>
            <li>It shaves much closer than the old one!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver</li>
            <li>I have used many methods such as an old fashioned straight razor which left my skin beat up and irritated.</li>
            <li>in all, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li>When I hold this shaver in my hands it feels a durable high end product it comes with the cleaning kit</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s what he uses exclusively and praises it highly.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>As a Panasonic user, I was reluctant to change to Braun, but made the move because it rated so high on the &amp;#34;closest shave&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone choosing an electric razor.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The 7 series is high quality and has some features that separate it from lower numbered series.</li>
            <li>I feel the cost is high for what the performance is.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s high tech compared to Gillette blade shaving and the Norelco.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have used Philips nerolco 3D and been using Gillette Mach3 since high school.</li>
            <li>I highly reccamend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended,</li>
            <li>I expect it will last for many years and continue to perform like new with proper maintenance.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little while to finish a shave and the usual areas are problematic but the result is very good for an electric razor.</li>
            <li>Very quiet, very smooth, supper long battery.</li>
            <li>(that was a few years back) by sanitizing it and just an all around comfortable good close shave and extremely reliable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Obviously everybody&#x27;s beard is different and some shavers will work fine for one person and not so much for others.</li>
            <li>rue the cleaning feature is nice but it pulls my hairs on my face when it&#x27;s hardly grown out.  </li>
            <li>had an older broun system and tryed a philips new one, and both are not even close to this one.</li>
            <li>It is quieter and the cleaning process seems to not use as much liquid as the old one.  </li>
            <li>I still have to touch up from time to time with a regular razor since I have facial hair, but for mowing the unpopulated areas it is fast and smooth.</li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave and there is no skin irritation or razor burns even on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>because i do my head as well as my face does seem to take longer than i expected to get a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve discovered that doing the bulk of the shaving dry then hitting the shower with a dab of Gillette shave cream to clean up</li>
            <li>One problem, my old Remington MS 290 that I bought for $50 at Wal-Mart shaves MUCH closer than this 7-790cc.</li>
            <li>My son is very self conscious about his razor burn on his neck.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive face and straight razors</li>
            <li>I am wondering if this unit will drink cleaning fluid pretty fast.</li>
            <li>the rare times I have longer facial hair, this thing still powers through.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend, particularly if you are African American dealing with stubborn in grown hairs.</li>
            <li>I have not complained to the vendors.  </li>
            <li>liquid that comes with this is not fit for most .</li>
            <li>Normally with the 5 series I would have to go over and over my face to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li>Longer whiskers took a few more swipes to get rid of.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the bit extra cost.  </li>
            <li>I had a 7 series and went to the 3 series for a few years but am very glad I switched back.  </li>
            <li>well worth the extra bucks over the cost of lessor shavers in the Braun product line.</li>
            <li>I do think it uses more fluid than my old one did, but only because it has a gauge</li>
            <li>For now, I&#x27;ll call it a good choice, but not a great choice.</li>
            <li>They last a long time but when one wears out and I get a new one the newer ones are better.</li>
            <li>I shaved with braun 790 as soon as I got it out of the package, the whole shaving experince was smooth, took less time to shave with no leftover hair residue or skin irritation.</li>
            <li>An additional plus is that it is easy on my skin and the former constant redness in neck caused by a blade has gone away too.</li>
            <li>Not a big deal, occasionally, simply wetting a finger and wiping it across the plastic parts cleans it off easily.</li>
            <li>Not a big deal, occasionally, simply wetting a finger and wiping it across the plastic parts cleans it off easily.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to use and it has actually reduced overall irritation (I was warned this might increase?).  </li>
            <li>I tried this 790 series and it does a very good job but a little hard on the skin.  </li>
            <li>very nice ,just the cleaning cartridge is quite expensive</li>
            <li>Very nice but complicated.</li>
            <li>Braun is sending a new cutter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this shaver now for 15 months and just now ordered a new replacement foil cartridge for it on amazon.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone looking for a new shaver.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a new razor, this is the one for you.  </li>
            <li>and I decided to look for a new razor .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Philips rotary shavers for over 25 years and needed to buy a new head -</li>
            <li>A new head every 2 months is out of the question at $33 a head.</li>
            <li>The new shaver head I bought is made in Germany and seems to be a quality product.</li>
            <li>When I pick up my shaver each morning, it is like a brand new shaver...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I could not be happier with my new Braun 790 cc.</li>
            <li>I like the new Cleaning system too</li>
            <li>So instead of replacing the parts I decided it was time for a new model, thinking the series 7 would be an upgrade.  </li>
            <li>I understand the irritation issues but with any new electric razor it takes a week or two before your skin will adapt to it</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m new to electric razors</li>
            <li>they get me new one</li>
            <li>Clippings and skin oils keep all those others from ever getting close as new.  </li>
            <li>Just like new again.</li>
            <li>The new Braun Series 7 performs fantastically.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to electric razors, and are unsure of their merits, do yourself a favor and give this one a try.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend loves his new razor and uses it all the time.</li>
            <li>Brand new razor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE:  Braun sent me a new foil cartridge as a &amp;#34;goodwill gesture&amp;#34; and the razor no longer pulls hair.  </li>
            <li>would recomend to anyone in the market for a new electric shaver</li>
            <li>thinking maybe it&#x27;s because my face is not used to a new razor</li>
            <li>How could such seemingly good engineers place the trimmer where it is so hard to see?</li>
            <li>Shifted over to razors to get that smooth face feeling but the cost and waste was too much so</li>
            <li>Quiet and smooth beyond belief with enough gee wiz gizmo&#x27;s to satisfy the techy.</li>
            <li>It ensures no irritation, smells fantastic but not over powering, and it actually slows the growth rate of my facial hair.</li>
            <li>It is much quieter than the Panasonic and holds a charge pretty long.</li>
            <li>Other than that minor complaint it appears to be an excellent shaver.</li>
            <li>however, the device is very loud and the shaving isn&#x27;t as close as represented in all the reviews.</li>
            <li>i always use the pop up trimmer to shave my neck because it is very sensitive and electric razors just cant get the hairs, but this trimmer that pops up is just garbage.</li>
            <li>My husband has very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Only reason I needed to buy a new one is due to My dropping it to many times and breaking it otherwise</li>
            <li>Its easy to use, understand, self cleaning, long lasting and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m interested to see how it holds up over time (we&#x27;ve only had it a week or so)</li>
            <li>have purchased many electric shavers over the past years.</li>
            <li>Obviously, not as close as a blade, but does get pretty darn close.</li>
            <li>The actual shaver head is much more contained than the Series 5 which subsequently requires using the cleaning station versus just simply brushing it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been using the Pulsonic Shaver and this replaced his old one!  </li>
            <li>When I could not find any useful information on Braun&#x27;s website, I emailed their customer service and it took about three days to hear back, without any real answers to my two simple questions:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>This is the first one that actually replaced my Mach 3.</li>
            <li>I have used a schick 3 for most of my shaving life along with other similar razors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a traditional disposable razor for 20 years and this was my first electric.  </li>
            <li>, however I hold it to a higher standard because of the price.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>This will get just as close as a normal razor when used correctly and will not destroy your face if you take your time with it.</li>
            <li>but it is LOUD!</li>
            <li>My old shaver was a Braun, and I loved that one, but sadly I won&#x27;t be making any Braun purchases again after wasting so much money on this product.</li>
            <li>It was time for a new foil and blade on the old one which amounts to 1/3 of the cost of this new.  </li>
            <li>My previous shaver was a high end Norelco and after many years I thought I&#x27;d try something different.</li>
            <li>The blade foil cover pops off too easily when shaving if your face is damp from the shower and thus a little sticky.</li>
            <li>but if you have darker or thicker facial hair and need or want a clean shave that will last all day</li>
            <li>Clean and sharp.</li>
            <li>It does a fine job, but so did my old ancient norelco that just got handed down to a grandchild.  </li>
            <li>I thought with ten years of technological advances that this shaver would be even better, but it doesn&#x27;t shave nearly as close as my other shaver does.</li>
            <li>the new one is soft and cheapened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everywhere on my face is smooth, there are no more gray straggles that refuse to be cut, my sideburns are straight and with my bride&#x27;s help I keep a well trimmed look around my neck.  </li>
            <li>I guess I was sold on all the bells and whistles and the fact that is was really cheap during Black Friday ($129)</li>
            <li>Heavy, noisy with strong vibration.</li>
            <li>Still would recommend the razor, and if I have to, I will most likely be buying another one sometime down the road.</li>
            <li>Lectric Shave (or the store brand) is fine, although a little slippery/messy to apply.  </li>
            <li>there was a digital countdown in previous modules that shows how many minutes it require for finish the cleaning process.</li>
            <li>Cuts the shaving time in half from our first Braun shaver when we *first started shaving</li>
            <li>I have owned this Braun shaver for around 3 years and have been able to compare it with Panasonic´s Arc5 Wet and Dry shaver, which I have used for about 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Braun model left stubble over various parts of my face, it snagged, there was mild irritation and even some redness under the neck area.  </li>
            <li>I only got a few red marks my first time out, and I am confident that was user error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well it still shaves just as well, but this model occasionally grabs my hair in areas if I approach from a certain angle</li>
            <li>I rarely use this, so its not too much a concern to me.or blades, and foil, but does not clean the outer part of the foil (the plastic parts of either side of the foils).</li>
            <li>The shaver does a nice job on my tough beard.  </li>
            <li>(I was anxious to see how this thing could clean itself!)</li>
            <li>I have tried all the major brands of shavers and always went back to favor and shaving cream until my wife bought me my first Braun 700 series which was called then the pulsar or something like that.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s definitely worth mentioning because I have a tough beard (I have to use 1 quality razor, or 2 cheap razors per shave), and I have to keep going over spots to get everything, but the battery still lasts.</li>
            <li>Housing unit can be a little loud, but not too bothersome and most cycles are quite short.</li>
            <li>The price is a little steep at around $180-$200, but I think the self-cleaning system and smooth cut is well worth the extra cash, besides, you only get one face</li>
            <li>I find this a convenient feature that does a better job than a brush or hot water with less mess.  </li>
            <li>A Q-tip will clear the clog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A clear winner.</li>
            <li>I had to drop one star because it does not do the upper lip very well nor does it clip the hairs up near the nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I went back to the 320 and found that it gave me a shave that was nearly as close, and possibly no worse than the 790 but without the pain.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t pay too much attention to the front page reviews with like 1000 plus people wow&#x27;ing and fawning over this product.  </li>
            <li>Being in the military I didnt want to purchase a shaver that couldnt get a smooth enough shave and be out $200.</li>
            <li>the digital screen on the shaver doesn&#x27;t include more than battery and hygiene meter, and i believe the hygiene meter is only depend on the operating time not really hygiene meter.</li>
            <li>so it is just a showoff screen that doesn&#x27;t include old features like when did you change the foil and cutter.</li>
            <li>and i wish that Braun to include it on the screen like old modules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li>that I&#x27;ve had since the early 2000&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>did have to take a start away because the cleaning system does not use as much of the cleaner as my last before replacing the cartridge</li>
            <li>the only problem I had was buying the whole kit to get the shaver.</li>
            <li>Old one was six years old and still worked</li>
            <li>Boy I feel old.</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace a old Philips Arcitec.  </li>
            <li>I upgraded from a 5+ year old Braun 390 razor.  </li>
            <li>I get ingrown hairs as a result of shaving, and this has eliminated them almost completely.</li>
            <li>I want to be in and out in about a minute, which I had no problem with my old Phillips Norelco XL Shaver.  </li>
            <li>I ended up buying a Safety Razor because no electric razor came close to the shaving experience of old fashioned shaving.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t possibly get as closer shave as the safety razors, which takes much longer and requires some skills.</li>
            <li>If you ensure you&#x27;re going directly against the grain, combined with a couple of passes, you will get those pesky hairs wiped out.</li>
            <li>It also handles a couple days of stubble with no trouble at all.</li>
            <li>I have a medium beard and somewhat sensitive neck.  </li>
            <li>Had an early version of this shaver that lasted for 12 years.</li>
            <li>It even worked well after nearly a month without shaving.</li>
            <li>(If I shave in the morning and go out at night I have to shave again) and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know what to expect here but was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I have a Braun shaver that is 7 years old</li>
            <li>I initially was a bit put off by spending so much on a shaver, but do not regret the purchase at all.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate his sensitive skin like his old one had.</li>
            <li>Also you can plug the cord directly into the razor to recharge.</li>
            <li>This razor is very noisy, rattleing like it is going to fall apart any second.  </li>
            <li>but it was getting old and not providing the shave I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a lot of electric razors but this razor has given me the closest shave so far.</li>
            <li>And, it is quieter than my 10-year old Braun.  </li>
            <li>old now, I have never been a fan of any electric razor even though I have tried a couple over the years.</li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver after my old 7000 series gave up the ghost.  </li>
            <li>The shaver is a step up from the old one</li>
            <li>I am now on my second 7 series and my wife just ordered me my third one as a back up because the battery after many years is starting to show signs of losing its charge but still shaving well</li>
            <li>This is the very first time this has ever happened with any other electric shaver I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>and wow,</li>
            <li>So far this razor has met all expectations i had for it.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t wow me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If i did not pay a lot for this thing and if my old trimmer didn&#x27;t die one me, I would return it.</li>
            <li>I prefer my old Philips.</li>
            <li>Wow, a bit pricey</li>
            <li>No point in upgrading whatsoever if your old &amp; trusted shaver is still working.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of electric shavers, I have a weird beard growing pattern on the neck area below the jawbone, so most of them do not work perfectly, this still is not perfect but with shaving in different angles!</li>
            <li>After one head change the finish on the pivoting head is flaking off, the locking function broke, then the locking button completely broke</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s pretty minor.</li>
            <li>replaced my old braun razor.</li>
            <li>However, it still shaves so he is still using the old one.  </li>
            <li>my old one retired, and I&#x27;m not looking back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First one I had was a &amp;#34;Sixtant&amp;#34; that I had some one bring over from Europe long before they went on sale here.</li>
            <li>I upgraded from an old Panasonic and thought I would give Braun a try.</li>
            <li>Since my old Braun bit the dust</li>
            <li>Its all ready to go the next time you need</li>
            <li>I would sell mine that I used twice so far, and not to shave my pubes yet for 150$.  Message me</li>
            <li>It works well on my seventy-two year old face.</li>
            <li>Naturally, I read the reviews here and elsewhere before purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>Got this to replace my old Series 3 shaver which died on me.  </li>
            <li>I bought this on sale to replace my 8 year old series 6.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning cycle is loud.</li>
            <li>Has it totally replaced my use of straight razors?</li>
            <li>Never thought in my lifetime I would spend this much money on a shaver, finally bit the bullet based on reviews and purchased the Braun Series 7...</li>
            <li>but issues with shaving fast enough?</li>
            <li>Given the oppurtunity I would buy the old modle.</li>
            <li>Cleaning unit seems to function well so far.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier -- so far -- with this.</li>
            <li>This Braun shaving system is, by far, the finest piece of machinery I&#x27;ve ever handled in my life.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The 3 different settings work very well.</li>
            <li>The pulsonic action of this model provides a quicker and easier shave.  </li>
            <li>and have learned to much prefer the Braun product in its various incarnations.</li>
            <li>Compared to my old Braun model #5414 this shaver is a delight.  </li>
            <li>I plugged the charger directly into the razor; still nothing.  </li>
            <li>Amazon refuses return/replacement because this item is &amp;#34;hazmat.&amp;#34; (thanks for the short end of the stick, Amazon.)</li>
            <li>After just a short time owning it, I no longer get a very close shave.</li>
            <li>I use Nivea mens sensitive post shave balm that I got at Walmart for 6$</li>
            <li>I am also very pleasantly surprised by the way it shaves.</li>
            <li>It works well, is quiet, and gives a very close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Phyllis</li>
            <li>recently began shaving my head, and went to a barber to get a straight razor shave.</li>
            <li>used multiple electric razors before and never had any issues  but for sure  this one is not fit for everyone .&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try to come back and update after a few more months, but all in all I am please with how it has performed.</li>
            <li>The base does a wonderful job cleaning &amp; maintaining the shaver.</li>
            <li>cleaning base is awesome</li>
            <li>My beard is fairly thick, so if I let it go for more than 2-3 days</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, all modern electric shavers are going to deliver the goods, albeit some may be more irritating to the face/neck than others.</li>
            <li>The automatic cleaning system base is simply superb.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, this just does not do a good job.  </li>
            <li>Have used prior versions of this shaver/cleaner-base from Braun and was very pleased; the only reason I bought this one was because my previous model finally died after five years.</li>
            <li>I like the shave mostly, but i am surprised to not hear more complaints about this, but the trimmer is next to useless!</li>
            <li>The Braun 7-799cc meet my expectations as one of the top electric shavers for African American men with hair that curls back or lay flat.</li>
            <li>This is my second after my first had lost most of its &amp;#34;umph&amp;#34;  and the battery is weak.</li>
            <li>I have a passion for electric shavers and when a new shaver comes out, I generally have to try it.</li>
            <li>Let dry for 5 minutes and start shaving the neck first.</li>
            <li>The lithium-ion battery level indicator was barely changed following the shave so if for some reason I didn&#x27;t have power available to charge the shaver I expect that I&#x27;d be able to get quite a few shaves out of it even with my heavy beard.  </li>
            <li>I just remove the head, blast it with hot water in the kitchen sink, let it dry and put electric shaver lubricant on it before I use it.</li>
            <li>The base is bulky and takes up precious bathroom space, but it&#x27;s worth it knowing that the razor is clean and</li>
            <li>The indicator never shows less than a full charge.</li>
            <li>I then put it back together and dry it off with a quick blast with my hair dryer.</li>
            <li>and it dries down to a powdery finish quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all kinds of electric shavers over the past 25 years, including several Brauns, and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>cleaning really works, and the fluid leaves a pleasant smell on the cutting</li>
            <li>/&gt;Prior to buying this shaver, I had an older model Braun (similar foil system to 790)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I was pleased at how close a shave I could get (with some practice), but disappointed in how many passes over my face I have to do.  </li>
            <li>than rebuilding my older razor, I have to say this will be the last Braun that I will purchase, as the quality is not there anymore.  </li>
            <li>I finally got one as a Christmas present and let me be the first to say that this shaver is all it is cracked up to be.</li>
            <li>I shave once a day, it usually can last 1 month or more before recharging.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had experience with lesser models of Braun in years past and they have performed OK but still would give me razor burn.</li>
            <li>Not as quiet as a rotary but quieter than Panasonic and older Bruan models.</li>
            <li>Overall, decent.</li>
            <li>This time the box is different from the other two, it was not the original box from the factory.</li>
            <li>Every electric shaver I have ever used, except this one, always occasionally stung and pinched, particularly when shaving the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty stuck here, back to regular shaving</li>
            <li>I first got one of the Phillips Norelco circular shavers but due to my thick hair it took me 20 minutes or more to shave.</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s not necessary to use the cleaning solution after each use, there are other ways to clean it.</li>
            <li>I recently saw this Braun and the high reviews and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>my experience of trying out various high priced electric shavers, this shaver gives the closest shave&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried electric razors in the past (specifically, rotary Norelco razors) but they always left too much stubble on my face and were a pain to clean and charge.</li>
            <li>I will use my old case from my last Braun Shaver for traveling with the new 7 series shaver.  </li>
            <li>As expected there is no way the shaver head will last 18 months before needing to be changed, unless you do not want a quick close shave.  </li>
            <li>the lather causes the whiskers to lie flat), Wet, they caused excess irritation, and dry, they get hotter than a clothing iron; more irritation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As long as you used it every 3-4 days it will work very well.  </li>
            <li>It works very well and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very convenient and now I tend to have shaved face all week long as it is not a hassle to get a shave like when I was using a razor.</li>
            <li>I shaved last night, nearly 20 hours ago and my beard has only grown in as much as it does the day after a blade shave, if that.</li>
            <li>I have used blades for roughly 20 years and this is my first electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>My early 90’s Braun version was better equipped to handle this delicate but necessary chore.</li>
            <li>Other cool features are digital screen, variable shaving sensitivity but not necessity.</li>
            <li>how full the reservoir is you have to remove the shaver for a few seconds and re-insert it</li>
            <li>Good shaver, little noisy, hard to just recharge without the cleaning process.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I very much like the look and feel of the 7-series, its gizmos like the extra indicator lights and a somewhat more advanced base, but in terms of &amp;#34;core&amp;#34; functionality it adds no value over the 5-series.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found my bumps have subsided, and I experience little or no irritation (though it takes more time than rotary or wet</li>
            <li>it says it is super dirty and wants a full cleaning.</li>
            <li>I only charge the shaver when the batter runs down and at that time I get out the unit, plug it in, load the cartridge and clean it.  </li>
            <li>To cut down on the expense of the Braun cleaning cartridges, I tried a larger refill but the liquid doesn&#x27;t seem to clean or lubricate it as well as the Braun cartridges.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m disappointed with this item because I had high hopes for a great shave.  </li>
            <li>main differences between the Panasonic and the Braun shavers are: Braun is slightly faster and a full battery charge is enough for about 6 to 7 shaves whereas, Panasonic lasts only for about 3 to 4 shaves.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While some say it is noisy, I don&#x27;t think it is substantially different to other shavers that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty quick to shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i will probably use this for the next 5 years, unless a new breakthrouh happens in electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:</li>
            <li>and i will probably use this for the next 5 years, unless a new breakthrouh happens in electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:</li>
            <li>The cleaning system keeps it next to brand new.</li>
            <li>gap is much smaller on the new foil.</li>
            <li>My previous version were both 3 series shavers and the diffference between them and the 7 series is worth the added cost.</li>
            <li>Very weight, reflects the German manufacturing skills, but the noise is too big, shaving no PHILPS province strength</li>
            <li>OMG, I did not know what I was missing, Close, comfortable and, yes, got extra kisses from my bride of 48 years...</li>
            <li>I then dry my face and quickly run the Braun in dry mode over my face again.</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s a decent shave all around, and the only ones who will likely notice the difference (besides me) will be my 10 month old and my wife.</li>
            <li>but you really need to run it over your face several times in different ways to catch 95% of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>I shave everyday and this thing is quick and convenient.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and i break out on my neck region with regular razors.</li>
            <li>is literally throwing away a couple hundred bucks, and no one wants to do that without exercising every single option beforehand.  </li>
            <li>I can gurantee that no other electric shavers can come close to this BRAUN shaver.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare it to any other electric shavers because I haven&#x27;t tried them, but for those interested in switching from blades this might be helpful.  </li>
            <li>I looked at all of the major brands of electric razors and choose from the customer recommendations.</li>
            <li>I have two major complaints with this razor.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty bummed I received a product that seems defective, and due to shipping policies, I cannot return the item for a refund.  </li>
            <li>No other shaver would work on my neck.</li>
            <li>soft long moustache cant shave very clear</li>
            <li>Clean water is little, never enough to use, function is lacking</li>
            <li>and I can adjust the power level down for a more concentrated less aggravated feel.</li>
            <li>The linear motion required to get an even shave is less natural than the circular motion of the Norelco and seems to require more attention to keep from missing a spot.</li>
            <li>I tried many other brands and even a few rotary style.</li>
            <li>Although it is a little work the results are well worth it.</li>
            <li>your through shaving your skin is smooth.no problem with razor burn .a little bit over priced but well worth</li>
            <li>Little pricey but worth it.  </li>
            <li>more difficult with the main shaving head.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to any body rather you just start shaving or been shaving for long time.</li>
            <li>It is important to change the cleaning solution and change the head, as it does get dull after about six months.  </li>
            <li>general</li>
            <li>It cleans and generally maintains itself</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t shave your head, and aren&#x27;t shaving peach fuzz, I suspect that this complaint isn&#x27;t relevant to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Replaced my 10-year old Braun and the technical advancement is apparent.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning cycle is loud for ~ 2 minutes, then the rest of it is silent.  </li>
            <li>After two years of use, painting around the shaver head began to peel off, probably by action of the cleaning fluid.</li>
            <li>I NEVER PLANNED OR EXPECTED TO SPEND AS MUCH FOR AN ELECTRIC RAZOR.  </li>
            <li>I NEVER PLANNED OR EXPECTED TO SPEND AS MUCH FOR AN ELECTRIC RAZOR.</li>
            <li>I had an early generation one and finally upgraded after 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>no complaints except the charger/cleaner is big and loud.  </li>
            <li>Loud, made increasing noises, didn&#x27;t cut close starting @ around 6 months of use!!</li>
            <li>As a result of the bumps I developed (while still using an electric shaver), I engaged in extensive experimentation with both rotary, foil and blade razors, and I think the reader will find that, as diverse as our faces are, so will your results vary.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No regrets here...</li>
            <li>I had a Braun very similar to this that was going on 10 years  old.  </li>
            <li>Keep in mind that the 320 head was several months old at this point.  </li>
            <li>no regrets.  </li>
            <li>This model is noisier than my old Shaver, but no big deal.</li>
            <li>Two days growth it may hang or pull if you&#x27;re not careful with it.</li>
            <li>After about a month and a few weeks, I can see a few hairs in the paper filter underneath but it seems to be functioning very well still, and the lemony smell is fantastic in the morning.</li>
            <li>but when a guy like me with sensitive skin can go over areas multiple times, not feel ANY burning after and get a close shave that rivals some of</li>
            <li>Apparently, there have been issues with this razor holding a charge, and issues with the dock.  </li>
            <li>I finally bought a replacement for my old Braun shaver.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic needs a charge to operate apparently.  </li>
            <li>It probably works better with the people with thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not cheap but worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The self cleaning feature is nice but expensive.</li>
            <li>This used to be a major problem for me with electric shavers and in particular with the Norelco rotary types which would rub my skin raw trying to get a reasonably close shave.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions for the shaved (use trimmer to trim down longer hair, pull.skin when shaving, etc.) and got razor bumps after my first use.</li>
            <li>but I will definitely try new technologies in future</li>
            <li>This unit is more expensive than other razors, but I feel like it&#x27;s worth the premium.  </li>
            <li>Just one pass of up and down , left and right</li>
            <li>It just does not hold a charge as long and I wanted to try something new.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this system especially if it keeps performing as it has so far!</li>
            <li>but this is the exact same shaver, except the other one is waterproof.</li>
            <li>but as usual it is not that clean as a regular razor</li>
            <li>Little pricey but much better/closer shave than my old Remington.</li>
            <li>/&gt;BTW, does anyone have any other recommendations for a quality straight foil razor?</li>
            <li>Sharp and fast.  </li>
            <li>He previously used Norelco but they just didn&#x27;t last long and he messed up when he tried to clean the blades.  </li>
            <li>It toggles up to stand straight out from the OTHER SIDE of the razor.</li>
            <li>The only problem is, its likely to last about 20 yrs and once the new cooler shaver comes out you wont have a reason to buy it</li>
            <li>cutting is quick and clean.</li>
            <li>On the front of your neck, you have to go over the same spot in different angles for the hair to completely come off.</li>
            <li>Gave it only 4.5 because I miss the trimmer being near the end of the shaver instead of the middle.  </li>
            <li>This does a fine job of knocking down a day&#x27;s growth or less.</li>
            <li>Although the Series 7 shouldn&#x27;t be used in the shower due to the cord plug-in area possibly getting water in it you certainly can use it over the sink.</li>
            <li>The cleaning process is so easy with the base, kits are perhaps expensive for lasting a month if you clean it everyday but its very easy to self clean if you want too.</li>
            <li>The base used a cartridge filled with alcohol to clean the foils and it estimates that one cartridge could last between one and a half to two months if you clean the foils every day like the manual</li>
            <li>My first purchase was actually a Phillips aqua touch that cost about half the price .</li>
            <li>have tried a few different types of razors for black men to help with razor bumps and skin irritation and after a while I ended up back with magic shave.  </li>
            <li>As someone with very sensitive skin (so sensitive that it gets red from one pass of other electric shavers I&#x27;ve tried), this is a god send.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also takes up too much counter space and just not worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed a couple of flaws so far, with regards to the cleaning process, both of which are minor.</li>
            <li>And if this one lasts as much as my old one did, it pays off in the long run.</li>
            <li>I waited far too long to make this purchase.  </li>
            <li>:  Adjustable shaving system for sensitive to not sensitive skin conditions.  </li>
            <li>A few notes  first off like my model five</li>
            <li>My previous 360/5-series has lasted me a long time, been repaired once and kept right on truckin&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Once again I called the main customer service who said send it back to the service center.  </li>
            <li>cuz when i received old one the clean and renew part is broken</li>
            <li>The first one lasted about 10 years, which just died recently, causing me to purchase this one and handing down my four year old (same basic model, only in white) system to my teenage son.  </li>
            <li>Have used for only a short time, but so far has worked as advertised  I especially like the cleaning feature and the design that allows cleaning and charging in the same stand.</li>
            <li>I kept with this shaver for so long because my chest and neck are sensitive, so once I find a razor that doesn&#x27;t constantly give me razor bumps in those areas, I stick with it.</li>
            <li>it last as long as my old one.</li>
            <li>It is adequate for using on the sideburns, but really clumsy for the moustache (my case), as the shaving head obscures the view in the mirror.</li>
            <li>Bear in mind that I have relatively fine hair, and I can&#x27;t imagine how anybody with a tough beard could use this shaver.  </li>
            <li>After reading various reviews and comments about the Braun Series 7-790cc, I decided to give this foil shaver a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing the Braun Series 7-7900cc to other models I would recommend it highly over both the Panasonic Arc3 and Arc4, with the Panasonic Arc3 the runner up.  </li>
            <li>It took a longer time to shave, but with the Braun Series 7 it is taking at least more then 60% less time.</li>
            <li>The cleaner works well and last much longer than the previous models.</li>
            <li>In general you will find that it takes at least three weeks for your face to adjust to the new shaver so persevere and do not go back and forth with your older razor/shaver.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver here based on many positive feedback but the hygiene indicator was already bad on arrival.</li>
            <li>It worked ok, but never liked it like my previous Braun, it still worked but, had to switch back to Braun.</li>
            <li>base is also an improvement over the 5-series - holds a shaver more positively, has better contact with the charging terminals on the shaver, less likely to loose contact due to the agitation during the cleaning cycles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This model delivers a very close shave with little effort.</li>
            <li>It will take a little while to get used too as it shaves very close.</li>
            <li>and this does a decent job of trimming it down.</li>
            <li>not worth the high dollar cost</li>
            <li>What a huge waste of my time!!!</li>
            <li>I am hoping this new Braun will function for several years as well as my other shaver has.</li>
            <li>The burn died down considerably, HOWEVER!!-</li>
            <li>Too bad, this is a good machine.</li>
            <li>Although a DE shaved me well, it was time consuming, painful on occasion, a nd because of all the hot water and hot cream needed to shave it would make me sweat sometimes haha which would irritate me further and basically ruin my morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> best shaver ever I had!</li>
            <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> It arrived from bed bath and beyond, which wasn&#x27;t the person I bought it from, but the seller to me must have ordered it from them, anyways, it came and from day one I&#x27;ve been nothing but impressed with this shaver.</li>
            <li> Best electric shaver I have owned...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very happy I bought this.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is the best.</li>
            <li> After 10 years I made the upgrade to Braun&#x27;s newest shaver, and I am impressed.  </li>
            <li> Best electric razor ever</li>
            <li> It shaves perfect on my cheeks but it doesn&#x27;t do a thing on my neck.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with this razor after switching from a Norelco triple head.</li>
            <li> He says he gets the best shave of his life with no razor burns or bumps.  </li>
            <li> It does excellent job.</li>
            <li> Best electric shaved</li>
            <li> I have found this to be the best electric razor and with adjustments for shaving closeness, it gives a close shave without irritation.</li>
            <li> As I said I had no irritation whatsoever AND the best shave with an electric shaver ever.</li>
            <li> the stray hairs works best.  </li>
            <li> The bottom line is that after 6 months of use this is STILL the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve had in 50+ years of shaving.</li>
            <li> The cleaning system is also excellent and since it can be used in the shower I wash it in there and then run it through Braun&#x27;s cleanins system.</li>
            <li> Braun is still the best.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this razor.</li>
            <li> Used it twice now and get the best shave ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s an excellent electric shaver</li>
            <li> Excellent shave quality.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>

            <li> My husband, who the razor was purchased for, is extremely happy with the razor.</li>
            <li> Shaves great.</li>
            <li> Very nice great shaver.</li>
            <li> Love this Shaver!!</li>
            <li> You will love it too!!</li>
            <li> When I called to request a brush they were very courteous</li>
            <li> Cleaning system is very handy.  </li>
            <li> it is very nice as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The shave, both give very nice shaves</li>
            <li> This product is very nice</li>
            <li> While not a blade close shave, it provides a very nice result.</li>
            <li> I am now very happy with all aspects of this very fine product and the self cleaning/charging stand that comes with</li>
            <li> Very smooth and excellent cleaning/charging operation.</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> but it leaves his face so nice!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Braun Series 7 - 790cc shaver more than a year ago and have to say I am considering rebuilding my Series 5-8595 shaver, as it was the best thing that Braun ever made.  </li>
            <li> It does an excellent job over most of my face.</li>
            <li> But If you are in the market for an excellent shaver, don&#x27;t spend $200 on one, when you can get Panasonics&#x27; latest for $135</li>
            <li> but I love Braun shavers and this is the best one ever.</li>
            <li> I think that the 7 is a good choice if you&#x27;re buying it as a gift and want to make a great impression, but if you&#x27;re buying it for yourself, save some $$ and go for series 5.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excellent product, it sure comes to its cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Best shaver I have had ,  close, smooth !</li>
            <li> That said, if you are pouring through the reviews and just want to get a good shaver that is noticeably better that the best three head versions, give this a try.</li>
            <li> This product is great and working good and using weekly once and my skin condition was good</li>
            <li> I loved my Braun the best and would still be using it (7 years), but my wife dropped it on the tile floor one too many times while cleaning the bathroom counters.  </li>
            <li> Awesome, clean, charge and sanitize all in one step!</li>
            <li> The Braun&#x27;s replaceable cleaning resivour system works perfectly, just swap out cartridges and your good to go, the Braun also smells very clean and sanitary when its done unlike the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;2nd</li>
            <li> Easily the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning is so easy and the shave is the best I have ever had from electric razor.</li>
            <li> I love it---it does a very good job.</li>
            <li> very good, I love it.</li>
            <li> Great razor and amazing customer service from Amazon</li>
            <li> works great shaves great out of box no time period to get use to and cleaning station keeps shaver in top condition</li>
            <li> The Braun 7-Series isn&#x27;t perfect, but it is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> And it does not do a good job of trimming either.</li>
            <li> , the lock for the mustache mode is not as good, and the trimmer does not seem as rugged and durable.</li>
            <li> Good shaver</li>
            <li> Good job Braun.</li>
            <li> Loved the quality besides that.</li>
            <li> Good shaver.  </li>
            <li> My son loved this item.  </li>
            <li> and I still think they do a good job.  </li>
            <li> Electrics were noisy and didn&#x27;t do a good job.</li>
            <li> The technology is that good.</li>
            <li> Pre-shave talcs are good, too.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer accessory works surprisingly well</li>
            <li> My husband loved his Christmas gift and has used it every day since he got it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m delighted with this product.</li>
            <li> Fits in your hand and looks good.</li>
            <li> It does a good job but does not shave as good as the series 5.</li>
            <li> The Best electric shaver available on the market.</li>
            <li> Gives good shave.</li>
            <li> Ease of use and a shave as good as any blade.</li>
            <li> I keep upgrading and I have always had good results from their products.</li>
            <li> so good</li>
            <li> My shave is every bit as good as a blade.</li>
            <li> Good to use.</li>
            <li> all this is a good purchase</li>
            <li> Just place the razor in the cleaning device, push a button, and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> Good thing</li>
            <li> good quality stuff.</li>
            <li> What is good for one guy isn&#x27;t for the over.</li>
            <li> I have used some of their razors that sell at Wal-Mart, but I decided to spend the money on what I thought to be a superior razor.</li>
            <li> Feels good in my hand.</li>
            <li> Good electric shaver.</li>
            <li> feel good good work</li>
            <li> but can get a really good shave.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line Braun is still the best foil razor available bar none, for me</li>
            <li> My husband has never had it so good.  </li>
            <li> Best razor available for the price.</li>
            <li> Got it for a good price.</li>
            <li> Good move.  </li>
            <li> This one... not as good.</li>
            <li> Good gift for my 32nd  birthday.</li>
            <li> Good quality and shave is just as close as a blade.</li>
            <li> and i get a good shave.</li>
            <li> Good shave though.</li>
            <li> I feel mislead by the good reviews.  </li>
            <li> This is about as good as it gets when shaving with an electric shaver</li>
            <li> So, looks like I made a good decision.</li>
            <li> Getting good use from it.</li>
            <li> I was especially impressed with how comfortable the razor feels in my hand, even when cranked up to the highest setting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also debatable if keeping a NiCad battery fully charged is good for it.    </li>
            <li> It gives a fairly close shave.  </li>
            <li> No electric shaver is as good as a razor.</li>
            <li> never thought that a shaving system could be that good and</li>
            <li> Gives a good, close shave with no discomfort.</li>
            <li> I bit the bullet (and had a coupon for a good discount).</li>
            <li> Three days, good luck.</li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner and good product.</li>
            <li> Gives a good shave every time.  </li>
            <li> but nothing good ever is.</li>
            <li> It is a good choice for me.</li>
            <li> Any time you can relieve the suffering of a loved one...</li>
            <li> Works as advertised with a good close shave.  </li>
            <li> Good value.</li>
            <li> My husband loved the shaver.</li>
            <li> Good close shave with NO ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> The shaver works as good as all of the good reviews.</li>
            <li> Best shaver and smooth shave without any cut.</li>
            <li> As I said before, a $200 investment out of the pocket of a college kid is a good amount</li>
            <li> good shave but</li>
            <li> too noisey and feel good</li>
            <li> Still not as good as a razor but close</li>
            <li> good electric razor.</li>
            <li> a good gift for my friend</li>

            <li> Gives a nice close shave and has indicator lights that show battery charging and what stage of cleaning - love the self cleaning feature!!</li>
            <li> I bought a Braun clean and renew a decade ago and it was the best shaver ever.  </li>
            <li> This razor provides an exceptionally close shave.  </li>
            <li> Probably the best shave I have ever had with an electric razor and the cleaning is SUPER convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I did a lot of research on the best razor for the head and this stands up to all of the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> this shaver can work perfectly as what is made to do: &amp;#34;Shaving&amp;#34; but it doesn&#x27;t have any smart features.</li>
            <li> Very nice price to buy it,Very easy to use,</li>

            <li> Nice razor.</li>

            <li> nice gift foe father.</li>
            <li> BRAUN has an intensity control - a really nice</li>
            <li> Nice price with frustration-free package.</li>
            <li> The cleaning is nice too.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it can be rinsed under the tap but that really doesn&#x27;t provide the best cleaning NOR does it lubricate the shaver&#x27;s cutters.</li>
            <li> excellent razor except for shaving the neck area real close.</li>
            <li> Either or both of them may not effect you, so please consider your own situation before taking my review into account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I own a Panosonic shaver ,but it no longer holds a charge for longer than 30 seconds.</li>

            <li> Best shaver I have it and thanks Amazon for your customer service</li>
            <li> This unit has a flip-up trimmer that is quite effective for trimming the Burns and &#x27;stash.  </li>

            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> so good,It is very easy to shave the beard</li>
            <li> In general they are good to great quality and as good as I have found for electric shavers (I shave both face and head).</li>
            <li> are fine shavers, and either is a good buy imo.</li>
            <li> The unit comes with very good directions and works very well.</li>

            <li> So far it works great!</li>
            <li> I shopped around, and for the $ and quality, this braun was by far the best!  </li>
            <li> Amazon shipping is the best as I received it within the 3-5 day range early.</li>
            <li> so far the best one I used</li>
            <li> I purchased the Braun Series 7 Model 797cc which is identical to the 790cc except for being specified in the manual as suitable for use in the shower which was a requirement for me.</li>
            <li> This shaver by far is the greatest thing since sliced bread!!!!</li>
            <li> None of them will ever be as close and as smooth s a good blade shave.</li>
            <li> For years, I have used Braun electric shavers and by far, this is the best one i&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> As far an electric, the Braun Series 7 is the best I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> In happy worth my choice.</li>
            <li> Perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun shavers for years, and I have to say, this shaver so far, is their best effort to date.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> If a good shave is important to you, this is the shaver for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an old pro with electric razors, and this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best razor I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> The panasonic was pretty good, but not as good as this one.</li>
            <li> I love it, great close shave and quickly.  </li>
            <li> Excellent design, clear instructions, gives a smooth shave, easy to maintain, packaged well, comfortable to hold, cleaning station works well, I like it!!!</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver and I have to admit I am very impressed and happy with my purchase (I am sixty years old).</li>
            <li> But mission accomplished because he loved this one!</li>
            <li> I very like, very good use, much better than I used to use panasonic</li>
            <li> More cumbersome than the 5000 series which I liked better</li>
            <li> Therefore, I went with this more espensive model -- and he agreed it&#x27;s worth it because it works great.  </li>
            <li> I have not used many electric razors, but this one is excellent, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> but it gives a good clean shave in 3 or 4 minutes time with no snagging or pulling.</li>
            <li> Battery life is excellent, shave quality is far better than Norelco&#x27;s, and the cleaning function is very civilized.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I am using electric shaver and I&#x27;m happy compare to manual</li>
            <li> At first the Braun was great.</li>
            <li> It as exactly as described and does a great job.</li>
            <li> I found an awesome deal on another popular bid and sell website and got the complete shaving system for $150 including free shipping.</li>
            <li> They are great on all types of skin - and give a pretty darn close</li>
            <li> The product is good, is not the original box, if the enclosed shipping / packing list is better</li>
            <li> is pretty great.</li>
            <li> Bought the 760 about 3 years ago and was pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> The latest shaves were very easy and my skin is much better now, than it was using a manual razor.     </li>
            <li> Very smooth save.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a very comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> Very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Very comfortable on my face.</li>
            <li> Very smooth shaves.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to hold in your hand, and well balanced weight-wise.  </li>
            <li> Not this one, its convenient, the self cleaning function is fantastic and battery life outstanding and the shave is close and leaves skin very smooth!  </li>
            <li> I have never been able to get a super good shave with this.  </li>
            <li> Excellent machine, i have had Braun shavers for the past 10 years and this is the best i have seen, solid - powerful, good technology and an easy clean shave, i am very happy with this product</li>
            <li> I had and used a Braun 36 Complete for 5 years and it was very good.</li>
            <li> So far, the shaver is doing a very good job.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with the electric shaver because of its ease of use.</li>
            <li> Had it for 5 days and it feels really good and shaves my face with heavy whiskers wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Well I have to admit that I 100% agree with most of the reviews here.</li>
            <li> I had hoped this razor would be able to overcome this</li>
            <li> It is only perfect.  </li>
            <li> Top of the line.</li>
            <li> It is able to get a close shave that lasts throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> but this shaver is definitely the best I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> I will have to admit I had to replace the motor and cutter head after I dropped it on a granite counter top, but it still asted 9 years after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : lock button is faulty and mostly gets non-functional</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not been satisfied with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> they get better every time.</li>
            <li> Shaving is actually enjoyable now.</li>
            <li> FORTUNATELY, the manufacturer provider a replacement!</li>
            <li> Really Love it....</li>
            <li> his life is better for having it.</li>
            <li> Really enjoying it.</li>
            <li> Will see if that is better.</li>
            <li> This came out on top.</li>
            <li> It cuts more of the hairs on every pass.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I swore I would never buy another Braun product but am glad I gave them another chance.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Im sure it sanitizes well, but doesn&#x27;t get all the hair off.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Shaver is quiet, impressed with the Pulsonic.</li>
            <li> shaves better than norelco</li>
            <li> pleased with this</li>
            <li> Smooth shave!</li>
            <li> It was more money than he considered spending, but I was the one who ordered it.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Much better for trimming sideburns than a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is much better than relying on disposable razors when I&#x27;m traveling</li>
            <li> Been using the 7 Series for Many years.</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;d better take care of it.</li>
            <li> I tried so many electric razors nothing worked well.</li>
            <li> You do not have to use the elaborate cleaning and charging system.</li>
            <li> Finally I found a replacement and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> no sympathy which I suppose is ok give that was the contract.</li>
            <li> NOT ONLY THE BEST ELECTRIC RAZOR</li>
            <li> AFTER MANY HOURS OF RESEARCH</li>
            <li> A CHANCE FOR A BETTER SHAVE.  </li>
            <li> THIS HAS PROVEN TO BE ONE OF THE BEST DECISIONS IN PERSONAL CARE</li>
            <li> Thank you, Cynthia. :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this razor</li>
            <li> NOT ONLY THE BEST ELECTRIC RAZOR</li>
            <li> AFTER MANY HOURS OF RESEARCH</li>
            <li> A CHANCE FOR A BETTER SHAVE.</li>
            <li> THIS HAS PROVEN TO BE ONE OF THE BEST DECISIONS IN PERSONAL CARE</li>
            <li> No, I don&#x27;t love it...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to love it.</li>
            <li> it provides the best overall shave.</li>
            <li> The shave this provides is better than most others I have tried.</li>
            <li> This electric razor are outstanding.</li>
            <li> more often.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never used a better shaver than this one.</li>
            <li> Husband loves it and may have converted him from Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;Shaves extremely smooth!</li>
            <li> Great shaver, very close shave.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I decided on buying this product.</li>
            <li> All in all its still most likely the best electric out there.</li>
            <li> Better than Phlips except noise louder.</li>
            <li> his beard is more like mine and the rotary isn&#x27;t working with his beard.</li>
            <li> For the money paid, I think we deserve better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Braun shavers for more years than I can remember and have mostly been satisfied with them.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m fully satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li> I love this razor and just wish I had changed sooner.</li>
            <li> By doing it this way, my counter top is not cluttered and I use one cartridge a year.  </li>
            <li> I am finding too many missed hairs.</li>
            <li> Please make sure of it before you start using it .</li>
            <li> this lets me watch tv and shave and relax siting while shaving love</li>
            <li> I returned it and decided to spend a bit more money and do a bit of research.</li>
            <li> Need I say more?</li>
            <li> I spend a lot more time shaving with the Braun than I do with the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> have a series 7 from many years ago that I have to still dig out just for the quality trimmer.</li>
            <li> This razor performs better than any electric razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li> My biyfriend love this shaver</li>
            <li> glad j got it for him.</li>
            <li> ~I love this one~</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than 30 years.  </li>
            <li> Ok I have owned a Braun series 5 electric razor for a couple of years now.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this shaved because it had been recommended by many sites for not causing razor bumps.</li>
            <li> The cleaning system is solid too, my best advice is what I was told by my Grandfather 30 years ago...</li>
            <li> My husband asked me to write this as he is IN LOVE with this shaver.</li>
            <li> the 7-790cc  provides a much better shave.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> even  better than my series 3</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Arc3 worked better for me with closer shave than the Arc4, but the Braun topped them both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 40$ Remington razor has a better trimmer than this overpriced shiny silver paperweight</li>
            <li> I love bells and whistles :)</li>
            <li> Just a great product at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> This one is even better.  </li>
            <li> You might pay a bit more</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this shaver.</li>
            <li> Do not go for a cheap kind as it does not work.</li>
            <li> You better believe it.</li>
            <li> He looks so much better now.</li>
            <li> This is the most overpriced, over rated, underperforming pos that I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Well, I wasn&#x27;t pleased from the beginning</li>
            <li> The Braun ranked among the top razors for a close shave in Consumer Reports.</li>
            <li> 5-series has a much more convenient slide-out trimmer that works well in all situations I used</li>
            <li> Phenomenal shaver, closer shave than with a steel bladed Atra</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not any better than the cheap razor I have!</li>
            <li> , I am sure it works for most of men</li>
            <li> A guy on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;liMN23Xqcis) gives some great instructions on how to do this and where to get a reasonable cleaning mixture to add to some alcohol and thus cut the cost.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not ther top of the line or</li>
            <li> read the reviews and saw it was top rated</li>
            <li> have had this razor for three months and am completely satisfied</li>
            <li> I think I could get a better shave with a disposable razor.</li>
            <li> I will say I love the carrying case that came with this one because we use it for travel</li>
            <li> Way better than the plastic version we got 5 years ago.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better or more reliable razor.  </li>
            <li> Not any more - the Ser. 7</li>
            <li> many guys over 50, I take blood thinners</li>
            <li> Love it .</li>
            <li> Have tried many razors and blades in my lifetime of 50+ years of shaving.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve had in the last 10 years ....</li>
            <li> I have been completely satisfied with it except for one thing.  </li>
            <li> Love it, took about 3 weeks to get to me but love the razor.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Love this thing gives the close shave I want without user a razer</li>
            <li> Sort of OK shave when it catches the beard</li>
            <li> Fantastic razor!</li>
            <li> Why so many shavers?</li>
            <li> Braun is a superb example of German craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> but I think you will find the Opti foil to deliver a better shave.</li>
            <li> You can, of course, use the oil that Braun provides (a drop rubbed onto the foil once a week) but the cleaning module is a much more elegant solution.  </li>
            <li> will know more about it after using it for a longer period of time.  </li>
            <li> This one does a MUCH better job of getting all those curly gray hairs.  </li>
            <li> The bells and whistles of this top of the line model are moot if it doesn&#x27;t shave close.  </li>
            <li> Love the one-piece foil/cutting block.  </li>
            <li> boy am I glad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am so glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> I reluctantly decided to give the Braun a try and have enjoyed the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the product is ok.</li>
            <li> Not as pleased with the razor as I thought I would be.</li>
            <li> My series 5 shaved closer without as many passes.</li>
            <li> Love this shaver.</li>
            <li> Even though this does a great job on my hairy ass neck, I still like to finish it with a straight razor.  </li>
            <li> I use the most aggressive cut and have never had any irritation from this razor like I have from the rotary razors.</li>
            <li> think I won&#x27;t choose a Norelco shavers any more because I began to like Braun&#x27;s shaving products.</li>
            <li> how many times I go over it.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, keep searching and let me know if you find an electric razor that works better.</li>
            <li> I am completely pleased with mine.</li>
            <li> The clipper seems to work better.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Much better than the Norelco I used for many years.</li>
            <li> Does not shave close enough - had to return and get the Panasonic ES-LA93-K which was excellent.</li>
            <li> Love this shaver.</li>
            <li> I have found the Norelco series, 7,8, and 9 Aquamatic models give me a better shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;so much better than the Norelco</li>
            <li> What I like the most about this razor is that it does not irritate my skin or burn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering to buy more for my father</li>
            <li> This is my second Braun shaver, best ever!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Braun and it is the best of them all.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> the Philips 1260,I think the Philips works better than braun...for me</li>
            <li> I am completely pleased with both.</li>
            <li> It costs more but doesn&#x27;t shave better molder Norelco.</li>
            <li> have yet to get any better than a blade shave</li>
            <li> I never had a shaver before, but I checked out most of them.  </li>
            <li> This is the top pick from Consumer&#x27;s reports and almost every barber in America.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I guess all is ok.</li>
            <li> I tried to look everywhere for this but with better price.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you cover your cleaning solution after use</li>
            <li> Well pleased with all aspects of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone interesting in changing from a blade.</li>
            <li> and I guess it probably is best to know when it needs cleaned as it also lubricates the razor at the same time.</li>
            <li> is okay</li>
            <li> Love the shaver</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of Braun products and they have one of the best products that last many, many years</li>
            <li> IT IS THE BEST I have tried far too many post shave balms and this one is light years ahead of them all.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers exclusive for many years.</li>
            <li> Most blades gave me razor bumps.</li>
            <li> Just got my shaver and love it.</li>
            <li> I bought it based on the reviews online and not wanting to spend $400 on the top rated model.  </li>
            <li> Its better then most on the market, I&#x27;d give it a 5 if it were around 35$</li>
            <li> I love the panel that tells you the battery status and hygiene status as well as when to replace shaver head.  </li>
            <li> the price is better than any of the stores around my area.</li>
            <li> Much better than the 760.</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I think better than norelco.  </li>
            <li> Extremely pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> right at the 2 year mark (when the warranty is up), I cannot give it a good rating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase and getting nice clean shaves.</li>
            <li> Wife got this for my christmas present and its very nice!</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews about this shaver before deciding to buy it and I recommend everyone interested read the more detailed reviews because there is a lot of great information in them.</li>
            <li> you want the best self cleaning razor available and price isn&#x27;t a top factor the 790cc is the one you want, if price is a factor then the 760cc gives just as good a shave with less bells and whistle.</li>
            <li> that keeps it clean, sanitized and smelling nice while sitting on your nightstand.  </li>
            <li> After my first use, I thought this was the best electric shaver I&#x27;d ever used, and that might still be true, but it is not as close or quick a shave as a Gillette Mach III.</li>
            <li> This always gives a nice close clean shave.  </li>
            <li> I have a light beard and this is the best electric shaver I have used, shaves really close and takes little time, great shaver!!</li>
            <li> Great product and highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> I like very much for its good quality.</li>
            <li> So unexpected!Shaving more than Gillette clean!</li>
            <li> but he tells me this shaving system has been working great for him so far!!  </li>
            <li> great shave &amp; easy maintenance thanks to cleaner.</li>
            <li> Great shaver, the plug-in adapter makes a surprising high pitch noise when your shaver is charging, which worried me when I first plugged in my shaver, but all my research on the internet suggests its normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> i like very clean</li>
            <li> very clean shaven.</li>
            <li> Shaving is very clean</li>
            <li> straight up amazing!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being a pilot I dont have a normal work schedule and the flexibility is great with the Braun.</li>
            <li> I bought this one after my norelco 1280x would consistently miss hairs and would take forever to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> Although the series 7 shaver feels better and more comfortable in my hand, it doesn&#x27;t shave any better.  </li>
            <li> This shaver does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> : It may not get used to your skin and stubble on the first try - even though it will still give a good shave.</li>
            <li> I figure 10 years + is pretty good service</li>
            <li> your beard over and over, and over, you can get a pretty good shave, but I have never equaled a blade.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first electric shaver I have ever owned that did as good a job as a razor.</li>
            <li> pretty darn good product.</li>
            <li> I have had older Braun razors and they were very nice.</li>
            <li> Worth the money!!</li>
            <li> I am happy with the new design of the head with the movement.  </li>
            <li> This thing is great, a lot better than my old series 5.</li>
            <li> I dry shave all the time, this baby is PERFECT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced no pulling and it is fast and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Series 7 shaver because of the great shaves I have gotten from my Braun Series 5 360 Complete shaver and it&#x27;s Consumer Reports top rating.</li>
            <li> This is very easy to clean and take care of.</li>
            <li> I can clean it just fine on my own and all the self cleaning feature</li>
            <li> for the price of these shavers, a consistent bright and easily seen display should be par.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and comfortable shave</li>
            <li> the cleaning station is AWESOME however dont clean it and then go back and reshave your face if you missed a spot</li>
            <li> Not all faces are the same, but for me this is a very good product.</li>
            <li> The daily cleaning module is very good in cleaning the shaver.</li>
            <li> I expected the best and got it.</li>
            <li> A closer and cut free shave  :-)</li>
            <li> The shave is a lot closer and more comfortable than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> He loves it, and I love that his skin is so smooth after shaving with it.</li>
            <li> , I have been searching for the most comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> and this is the first one I&#x27;ve liked after having tried many.</li>
            <li> Best 190 buck I spent.</li>
            <li> Had an old Braun shaver and thought it was still great until I happened to purchase this model.  </li>
            <li> Never really found one that did a perfect job.  </li>
            <li> Everything as expected the best Braun shaver</li>
            <li> Smooth shave no irritation LOVE it.</li>
            <li> While no electric razor I&#x27;ve tried is as smooth as shaving with cream and a blade, this shaver does a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li> have a light beard, and have settled on cleaning once or twice per week at most.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but so far I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It did not perform as well as my 5 year old Panasonic ES8249 (never changed the foil head or cutters) that still works great and</li>
            <li> most importantly doesn&#x27;t just do the job</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m quite happy about it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good razor, but way too noisy and it really irritated my face.</li>
            <li> but finally I found a good deal on this 790cc from braun and its by far the best razor ive ever used.</li>
            <li> gives a really close shave, almost as good as a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PHILIPS v. BRAUN.  </li>
            <li> Still have my Braun 8595 that has served me well for many years but was never this good even when new.</li>
            <li> I follow up with more shaving cream on the face and quickly shave with a Gillette Fusion Power razor to hit some of the spots missed by the Braun mostly around the neck.</li>
            <li> Cleaning action is very nice and works as advertised.</li>
            <li> And all are extra good reasons to observe Tip 1:  Rinse!</li>
            <li> I have had four other Braun shavers over the years, and this is the best yet.</li>
            <li> He had the original version of this from many years ago and never replaced it.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Other than that a great razor!</li>
            <li> soon as I received it in the mail I was more than excited to use it.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully Amazon contacts me, or the original seller, and is able to work something out.  </li>
            <li> After reading many reviews concerning the cleaning system I have opted to clean the razor once a week and placing the cap on the cleaning solution between razor cleaning which I used once a week.</li>
            <li> My husband said it&#x27;s easy to use, and he loves the self-cleaning feature.</li>
            <li> and it cleans up easy.  </li>
            <li> and I love the hygiene indicator that tells you when to clean it.  </li>
            <li> Afta makes one that I like; it&#x27;s between a cream and a gel, so easy to smear on</li>
            <li> Easy to use and charge.  </li>
            <li> If you start with the easy stuff, the razor won&#x27;t cut as well by the end of your session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> Easy to fill and replace refill.</li>
            <li> Remove the plastic cap from the Braun Clean&amp;Renew™ cartridge and easily install in the plastic Station.</li>
            <li> Easily cleaned.</li>
            <li> It is also easy for travel.  </li>
            <li> Easy to take care.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use</li>
            <li> As I am bald, I am able to use this on my entire face and head and the comfort settings are great.  </li>
            <li> Cleans easily with the touch of a finger.  </li>
            <li> The adjustable head from easy to close works</li>
            <li> I have had a beard fro 30 years and except from trimming I have not shaved, but the Braun makes it easy and convenient..</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to hear it clean :-)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very easy to use, no injuries in the face anymore.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my husband - He didn&#x27;t make it easy -</li>
            <li> I just make sure to clean it once a week.</li>
            <li> I like the clean and renew - makes cleaning it much more easier and hygenic</li>
            <li> It is convenient, cleans easily.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to care for.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning is easy just put it its stand and push the button</li>
            <li> I would strongly encourage you to stay away from this piece of equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the cleaning system.fits very comfortlely in hand nice shape and design.best part about shaver is when</li>
            <li> Been using it for 2yrs and its still going strong.</li>
            <li> I have own 3 different tier Braun shavers, this is definitely a Good shaver</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended~</li>
            <li> Very good and long battery life.&lt;br /&gt;Side</li>
            <li> The self cleaning feature is very cool and keeps it suprisingly free of debris.</li>
            <li> Although the 7-series has a more powerful, higher-frequency linear motor and what looks like a more advanced shaving block as compared to the &amp;#34;conventional&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Incredibly close shaves and it cleans up better than any other razor I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> A beautifully designed shaver that is built to last.</li>
            <li> Always fresh, clean, and smelling nice because of the cleaning.  </li>
            <li> This has to be the best shaver hands down.</li>
            <li> The bottom line is that this shaver is hands down the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve used in the 62 years I&#x27;ve been shaving.</li>
            <li> World best shaver hands down.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best electric shaver out there!  </li>
            <li> Hands down the best electric shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a replacement and had it narrowed down to a Panasonic or this Braun and decided that the Braun would be best choice fro me since it can still be operated when the Batteries die with a cord supplied.  </li>
            <li> The shaver can clean my face faster and very clean.</li>
            <li> It definitely exceeded my expectations as it is easy to use, easy to clean, and most importantly gives me a great shave.</li>
            <li> thing is so smooth and easy, it feels like you&#x27;re wiping the whiskers off your face, regardless</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a finely made</li>
            <li> It does not matter if I skip a day, it is fine.  </li>
            <li> A head that lasts 6 months is fine with me.  </li>
            <li> I was so impressed with it at first that I ordered extra cleaning units.</li>
            <li> Perfect shave in half the time when compared to my Philips Norelco shavers.  </li>
            <li> easy and smooth.</li>
            <li> The first three times I used this razor were beyond phenomenal, and more than I could ever ask from any self-shaving product.  </li>
            <li> Close comfortable shave that floats easily over the skin with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> and he says that this one is definitely a super premium one!</li>
            <li> It leaves your face feeling very soft and give a good cut.</li>
            <li> Once I shelled out for this top of the line razor and used it the very first time....</li>
            <li> The best of these is the 790cc in my opinion, particularly because it does no sharp, stinging pinches when shaving.</li>
            <li> realize this thing has been touted by many reviewers as great for Black men, and I&#x27;m sure it works for some of us, but I&#x27;d like to throw out a word of caution out there to anyone buying it just for that reason.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, excellent shave for electric especially on my coarse greying beard.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is easy, the trimmer works well and it makes shaving fast for work.</li>
            <li> little on expesive side but its best razor on market</li>
            <li> A very good product, all that I expected.</li>
            <li> very good for sensitive skin, but you don&#x27;t get a very close</li>
            <li> The fact that it cleans itself too is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li> After days of research I found out that I needed the most powerful motor available for whatever model and brand</li>
            <li> The self-cleaning and charging station is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this shaver to anyone looking for a great electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Really nice appliance - well balanced in the hand, shaves very close &amp; leaves face feeling as if a razor did the cutting.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> you will be amazed how smooth your face it.&lt;br /&gt;- changeable speed.</li>
            <li> razor itself is comfortable to hold and to shave with, though.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, too.  </li>
            <li> The size is great for traveling and it&#x27;s fairly quiet for a foil electric</li>
            <li> This one is seemingly cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Great razor, my third Braun razor and</li>
            <li> I have always used a disposable razor and shaved using a fog free mirror as I showered.</li>
            <li> I received this as a Christmas present and it works great.</li>
            <li> The cleaning function is great and each solution pack lasts me about a month or so with regular use.</li>
            <li> replacement head is cheap</li>
            <li> Fantastic electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I get a close, smooth shave without any nicks or tugging.</li>
            <li> It has a self clean feature and the battery is strong.</li>
            <li> It gives a great close shave and has 3 different settings for the shave you want</li>
            <li> I bought it and am not a rater who has received the product free.  </li>
            <li> but, it&#x27;s made out of cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> We got it at such a great price.</li>
            <li> It is remarkably smooth.  </li>
            <li> I actually enjoy shaving and look forward to it.</li>
            <li> My second one; been using these for 10+ years -- and they are great.  </li>
            <li> I bought an electric shaver primarily because I can take it in my carry-on baggage, on this</li>
            <li> Does the job smoothly and comfortably.</li>
            <li> Great shaver with only one downfall.</li>
            <li> skin feels baby smooth every time, I don&#x27;t have to re-hit spots.</li>
            <li> Fast, efficient, cleans itself, nice trimmer, and holds a charge forever.</li>
            <li> This razor is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Going from a cheap 50 dollar electric to this is a huge step up.</li>
            <li> The cleaning system is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, however I think I will go with the Norelco next time.</li>
            <li> Simple to use, great product.</li>
            <li> This was a great Christmas present.</li>
            <li> Smooth and comfortable</li>
            <li> The shave is close and smooth and he thanks me almost daily for this great gift!</li>
            <li> Alcohol is cheap, the cartridge is not.  </li>
            <li> The razor gives a close and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use, clean and charge.  </li>
            <li> and I enjoy the close shave</li>
            <li> This is the primary reason for the 3 stars.  </li>
            <li> and every time since... did I realize I was missing out on the best shave ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There are adjustments for the head so that you can change it to fit the type of whiskers, and area that you are shaving.</li>
            <li> It is incredibly smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Smooth operation.</li>
            <li> and it has worked well at keeping my face shaved and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Also, I set it on the medium shave setting which, with the lotion, makes for a smooth shave after a couple of day beard.</li>
            <li> This one feels cheap.</li>
            <li> Extremely comfortable shave every time</li>
            <li> Overall it is great product.</li>
            <li> quality is important to me.</li>
            <li> I manage to get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was concerned about the vibrate feature, but it must help because this thing does such a great job shaving.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I read reviews about how it was great for African Americans.</li>
            <li> and it becomes smooth just like a blade</li>
            <li> He loves it and enjoy any time he uses it</li>
            <li> However, there is an easy remedy: push the clean button on it then leave the bathroom and go to work</li>
            <li> Comfortable to hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> That was a shock after using the absolutely smooth Norelco with the rotating cutters.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gives a surprisingly smooth shave and I have had zero neck irritation.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC SHAVER..</li>
            <li> A close, clean, easy shave every morning that cuts minutes off of my prep time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth, quieter then any others that I have tried, and gives a razor close shave every time.</li>
            <li> Smooth as an against the grain manual shave, without any of the redness or irritation.</li>
            <li> I have a light beard.  </li>
            <li> the price was lower than Walmart and free shipping took just two days.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve sometimes varied in design but regardless of the design, I would ALWAYS get razor burn regardless of how light I pressed</li>
            <li> The shave is close and comfortable.</li>
            <li> You have to shave against the grain with a blade to get those parts smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This will shave your face and it will leave it smooth.  </li>
            <li> Smooth.  </li>
            <li> I get smooth shaves without the wear and tear of manual razors.</li>
            <li> The battery unit charger also keeps track of the shaver&#x27;s cleanliness and cleans it with cleaning solution in a lower filled tray, when required.</li>
            <li> I get a close, comfortable, more blade like shave than I expected and have ever experienced.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using it</li>
            <li> I am 82 and beard is light.</li>
            <li> this thing is light years ahead of it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not ripping the hairs out like cheap electrics.  </li>
            <li> It says it&#x27;s just SD alcohol, but I haven&#x27;t been brave enough to top it off with a $0.45 worth of product.  </li>
            <li> it is good to shave the sensitive parts of your face.&lt;br /&gt;- washable head parts.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about upgrading to a newer model, and had read lots of reviews about the 790cc model being good for people with sensitive</li>
            <li> Gives a much closer shave and love the cleaning system, always gives the shaver a nice fresh smell.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> Having to pay $15-20 for shipping + insurance may not be a good idea for a 2-year old shaver that soon will need to replace the head.</li>
            <li> There might be a better electric razor out there somewhere made by some company, but if so it couldn&#x27;t be much or any better than this Braun.</li>
            <li> SO FAR SO GOOD.</li>
            <li> It is superior to my eleven year old Braun.  </li>
            <li> By far the easiest and most effective electric shaver I have ever owned</li>
            <li> The  Series 7-790 is much superior to my old Braun...</li>
            <li> The Braun series 7 gave a smooth and close shave that is very rare for any electric razor.</li>
            <li> (if you remember the old loosen the top and let it run to clean hair out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun is gentle on your skin and great for close shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very well made, and shaves close!!!</li>
            <li> Very powerful to use.</li>
            <li> so far, new razor has been very good, easy to use, clean and maintain..</li>
            <li> With this system I have a nice clean shaver ready every morning.</li>
            <li> It shaves clean and is easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> This is flat out One Great Shaver..</li>
            <li> The new one shaves ok but looks very cheap and plasticy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if is the best out there because Im not going to buy and test all of them, other than that this is a great product I used it every day, I love it.</li>
            <li> I am thankful that Amazon was willing to take care of the refund very smoothly.</li>
            <li> Clean, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> The flex head allows the shaver to stay on the skin and the results are a smooth and clean shave.</li>
            <li> It affords a clean comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning and charging system is quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long term Braun user having purchased an 8995, which I loved, many years ago.</li>
            <li> I have a super sensitive skin (it was sensitive to the best of the razors) to an extent that even if I shaved on consecutive days, I would have rashes on neck area.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure the dock/cleaner is still working because the light are on and whatnot.  </li>
            <li> He had to get used to it at first, but is pleased now</li>
            <li> It cleans and disinfects just as well as the original cartridge with the added cost savings.</li>
            <li> I was overcharged, but whatever, it was worth it!  </li>
            <li> this is his first braun and he love it</li>
            <li> Having purchased my first Braun shaver almost 30 years ago, I had gone through 4 models since that time and had been completely satisfied with the quality, until now.  </li>
            <li> Braun has improved the shave experience significantly.  </li>
            <li> If your shaving experiences have been similar to mine then you have a much better than even chance of getting the same excellent performance as I from this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny!  </li>
            <li> If the replacement foil had been designed like the original, it would still be a 5 star.  </li>
            <li> There is not a replacement head configured like the original on the market.  </li>
            <li> The self-cleaning module isn&#x27;t travel friendly.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed it for the first shave</li>
            <li> The ES-25ST will go into a higher RPM when it senses areas that are needing more shaving power....</li>
            <li> Not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Best razor I have ever used, no more nicks.</li>
            <li> The shave is fast, smooth and very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> This new one is just amazing.</li>
            <li> Does a very good job shaving, almost as close as a triple blade razor without the mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only on day 2, so I can&#x27;t comment on reliability or durability, but so far I&#x27;m extremely impressed.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted a clean look and a clean look is what this gives and</li>
            <li> the built-in display never indicates it is clean unless I run the stand&#x27;s cleaning cycle.  </li>
            <li> It leaves the razor clean and lubricated, a process I have to repeat every three days</li>
            <li> Has to be plugged in all the time to clean.</li>
            <li> once a week I clean the head with alcohol.  </li>
            <li> i never ever used a electric razor till yesterday,,this clean s itself  and lubercates itself as well..</li>
            <li> Its super comfortable.</li>
            <li> And its really clean.</li>
            <li> No hairs in the sink to clean up afterwards.</li>
            <li> then use a cheapo electric razor to clean up where I missed in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve changed the heads and always kept it clean and lubricated with no avail..</li>
            <li> Clean and close shaves all over except for mustache and bottom of the neck for myself.</li>
            <li> I then pull the Braun shaving head off and clean it under the faucet.</li>
            <li> The shaver leaves your face super smooth and when he is done it&#x27;s holder is self cleaning.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t offer a completely clean shave</li>
            <li> it cannot clean my beard at all.</li>
            <li> I am giving this shaver 4 stars out of 5 because although I love the way it shaves and it is well made I dislike its ergonomics compared with my 10 year-old Braun which this one replaced (the old one broke after many years of use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do use my Water Pic sometimes to clean the head between the times I use the system cleaning.  </li>
            <li> The clean and renew system is a winner too.</li>
            <li> My razor comes out clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> Close shave feels almost as clean as a shave with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> No monkeying around with it to clean it.  </li>
            <li> Quick, close, comfortable shaves.</li>
            <li> yourself some money too, don&#x27;t run a clean cycle after every shave.  </li>
            <li> : Efficient and clean.</li>
            <li> I like that you can use the heat function to clean and then use the shaver soon after.</li>
            <li> They said the shaver provides a clean, close, no-nicks shave.  </li>
            <li> There is no way to clean it thoroughly when traveling.</li>
            <li> You can take it apart and manually clean it</li>
            <li> It never gets my neck clean.</li>
            <li> And the shaver bottom indicates status of shaver battery charge and degree of need to clean.</li>
            <li> Plows through a 4 day growth, clean shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to use a shaver then use a razor blade and shaving cream for a truly clean shave.</li>
            <li> It takes longer for it to clean itself than suggested.</li>
            <li> I recommend running self clean every 4 or so shaves because the alcohol based</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t have to take it apart and brush clean the blades every time.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a breeze to clean with the cleaning ports</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very clean shave</li>
            <li> need to be clean for clean shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clean and close shave without the cuts or abrasion burns.  </li>
            <li> I will never use a blade razor again, as close and clean as this shaver gets.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a close shave almost as good as my old Mach3, but in the end I don&#x27;t have to keep buying hundreds of dollars worth of blades.</li>
            <li> After 25 years of a love-hate relationship with electric shavers, spending way too much money on &amp;#34;the next best thing,&amp;#34; and hoping to get a quick, comfortable, smooth shave...I really like this razor.</li>
            <li> He says it is easy and gives him a shave better than his wet shave which is amazing to him.</li>
            <li> Apparently with any Braun shaver, you will only get an excellent shave until the original cartridge wears out.</li>
            <li> I was also concerned that I was wasting money on cleaning solution, but I love knowing the razor is clean and ready to go each morning.</li>
            <li> So I made sure that the shaver was clean, using the included system which I was familiar with from the older 8995.  </li>
            <li> Amazingly, given the extra time it took to shave 3 days growth I experienced utterly zero trace of skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I then waited a few days and experimented with the higher power settings, neither of which were impressive considering the price and the hype about this</li>
            <li> I love Bruan razors; they are gentle on my baby face.</li>
            <li> The  790 is a overall a good value .&lt;br</li>
            <li> I kept that one in good working order by changing the foils and blades every year and cleaning it regularly.  </li>
            <li> I love this so much, i haven&#x27;t used my safety razor since i bought this a month ago.</li>
            <li> this is the way to go for a full beard gentleman.  </li>
            <li> Good for an electric, but it didn&#x27;t shave close enough for me.  </li>
            <li> I have since taken the plunge and switched to a straight razor, much better level of shave.</li>
            <li> :  The shaver by itself is really good, but consider using a pre-shave lotion or gel to even further enhance the speed of shaving.  </li>
            <li> but I really had many hopes before purchasing...</li>
            <li> He says he is going to switch from regular razor blade shaving to this because it&#x27;s so good.</li>
            <li> this is my fourth Braun and they were all not ads good as the fist one.</li>
            <li> The second one lasted about two years, although it&#x27;s still good to go.</li>
            <li> So I did some more research and came across this promising shaver.</li>
            <li> It offers different levels of cleaning based on the time and frequency used, but most of all it just works great from start to finish.</li>
            <li> frankly,it is a good shaver,and have a very low price.</li>
            <li> Best electric shaver for smooth shaving and durability, but also most expensive.</li>
            <li> good shaver！eazy to use and low noise</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers which while good for the money on the low end, leave me having to shave twice a day.</li>
            <li> This is what i really want amzing i love it</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really cool.  </li>
            <li> - would have paid the full price without the promotion.  </li>
            <li> -  this suggests that the shaver needs a full cleaning almost every day, which is what BRAUN state in the instruction booklet.</li>
            <li> The self cleaning function is cool</li>
            <li> This is the only shaver I have found over the years that does not cause irritation and still gives me a good shave.    </li>
            <li> Similarly I was impressed with how smooth it can be on the low settings.</li>
            <li> Nice close shave and no irritation even though I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gift to my friend and looks so cool when I opened the box.</li>
            <li> shipping was fast and the price was even better than I thought...</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s not bad</li>
            <li> Not a bad replacement for the Panasonic ES-LA63.</li>
            <li> There is no need for any pre-shave but it is important to shave in relatively dry conditions in order to achieve good glide with the shaver.</li>
            <li> Gives a pretty close shave and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> but this is a little better very pleased with the results smooth shave</li>
            <li> Even if you don&#x27;t brush out the head before running the cleaning cycle, it comes out very clean and ready to go.</li>
            <li> the price here was great compared to a lot of other sellers on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product - - - everything I expected!</li>
            <li> The Braun 790cc feels perfect and balanced in your hand (this is important since your hand position is changing constantly when shaving to get to different areas of your face &amp; neck), the Panasonic just doesn&#x27;t feel right after using the Braun,&lt;br</li>
            <li> This new Braun just doesn&#x27;t seem to do as good a job as either of my older ones.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been switching back and forth between my aging inexpensive Panasonic wet/dry and the Gillette Power Fusion blade (which is excellent) but decided to step up to a new electric and after much reading of reviews decided on the Braun Series 7 Model 797cc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that, but it is still a comfortable shaver and can give a pretty smooth shave when done right.</li>
            <li> I like a fresh, clean, fully charged shave every time.</li>
            <li> Nice comfortable shave as compared to my last Braun electric.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t evaporate so quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Braun over the last 20 years and the best one yet.</li>
            <li> The cleaning system is super.</li>
            <li> Close, quick shave.  </li>
            <li> It gives him a close quick shave and does not irritate his face.</li>
            <li> I rarely use a straight razor any more.  </li>
            <li> Gives a close shave, convenient, and quick for a electric razor.</li>
            <li> I suspect that the metal is inferior, resulting in the hole occurring so quickly (without undue abuse by myself).  </li>
            <li> This shaver does not remove hair adequately.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews like the many others I had done before and decided to look on line for this particular shaving system.</li>
            <li> Super</li>
            <li> The cleaning cycle is quick.  </li>
            <li> Smooth, comfortable and fast.  </li>
            <li> Extraordinary shaver.  </li>
            <li> 3rd Braun I&#x27;ve owned, they just keep getting better &amp; better.</li>
            <li> It performs adequately for an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s adequate performance levels.</li>
            <li> I expected more, to be honest.  </li>
            <li> I find it does not give a quick shave nor does it give a close shave.</li>
            <li> A quick shave makes me have end up with a 5 oclock shadow at the end of it.</li>
            <li> I can get a quick shave 5 mins before walking out the door and flying for hours knowing I have atleast 12 hours before I need to shave again</li>
            <li> Close and quick shaves.</li>
            <li> The skin is healthy, it doesn&#x27;t irritate as much as my older ones.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend you try it, you will love it.</li>
            <li> I thought this item will be more high tech</li>
            <li> have been a magic shave user since high school (30+ years)</li>
            <li> It has a great self cleaning system that&#x27;s a little noisy but very efficient in keeping the shaver in top condition.</li>
            <li> This shaver is fast and very clean on the face and worth the money.  </li>
            <li> It may be cheap white metal instead of good stainless steel.  </li>
            <li> So soft!I like it very much!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice that it can just do a quick clean cycle that only takes minutes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other Braun electric shavers and this is the best by far.  </li>
            <li> As good as my last Braun was, this is night and day better than my old one Braun shaver.  </li>
            <li> Quality is good, battery lasts long time, cleang and comfort.</li>
            <li> Smooth, non-irritating, fast and every time a clean conditioned/clean shaver.</li>
            <li> Delighted with how easily, quickly and closely it shaves • Shaving dry is not a problem and requires no healing/soothing/smelly lotion afterwards.</li>
            <li> I wanted to purchase something high quality and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> But if you want top-of-the-line and a very clean shave, I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I figured the new technology would be better.  </li>
            <li> this new series by Braun is even better.</li>
            <li> This Braun Series 7-790cc arrived very quickly, less than 48 hours and in 5.0 shape, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> and it really came with strong engine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a really strong and fast engine that speed up your shaving time.</li>
            <li> The cleaning kit is straight forward and easy to use too.</li>
            <li> First off, let me say I really like this shaver in most respects.</li>
            <li> The Braun Series 7-790cc gives a good shave in dry mode.</li>
            <li> Does just as good a job as the Norelco only a bit slower but much easier to clean.</li>
            <li> For me, allowing the hair to grow for 2-3 days is best and I believe it&#x27;s because the hair is now long enough to be efficiently guided into the foil.(when</li>
            <li> It can clean the shave very fast.</li>
            <li> Recommended to choose the standard packaging, environmentally friendly packaging is very easily damaged.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it would last me more years!</li>
            <li> Suffered through the first month and was told it would get better and sure enough it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I tried the top end Norelco 3D shaver (as well as a few lower end Norelcos), and as much as I wanted to like them (better than foils on a few days growth, excellent customer service and good value, especially on the cheaper models), I found all models to be irritating.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Panasonic has gotten MUCH louder!!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> He was pretty excited to use his and the fact that it has a self cleaning holder</li>
            <li> I love this 790cc so far!</li>
            <li> Razor is useful, for a friend I liked it, the price is very favorable, can be used normally in China.</li>
            <li> love the 3 speeds... easy to hold and solid</li>
            <li> Use it on a daily basis, clean up is very easy</li>
            <li> First electric razor I have ever used that did no require a blade to clean up my face with.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine but doesn&#x27;t really give you a close shave.</li>
            <li> With the Braun I can get ready and get a quick shave in before a saturday night!</li>
            <li> First off, ive been shaving for about 16 yrs now, the first 13 with a reg. mach 3 style razor and it worked fine, but it got too expesive which led me on a search for a cheaper alternative.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> fast, close , comfortable shave</li>
            <li> this is my third braun shaver and this 7-790cc is by far the best so far.</li>
            <li> Earlier reviews were thorough enough that I could shop intelligently for the product, and they were accurate.  </li>
            <li> IT IS SUCH AN AMAZING TOOL for my husband.</li>
            <li> This shaving system is great for a man with a heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> I really like it, Smooth and  close with not as many passes as my old one.</li>
            <li> (mine is the neck) and be as light and gentle as you can while pressing the razor to the skin.</li>
            <li> However, it was rougher on my skin than my old Panasonic and did not give me a better shave.</li>
            <li> But after too many years of trying too many &amp;#34;shavers&amp;#34; that simply wouldn&#x27;t do the whole job - beard, stray hairs, trimming -</li>
            <li> Not too loud; charge stays for more than a week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this razor is worth</li>
            <li> I had a nice, simple, Phillips Norelco XL Shaver that provided a nice close shave for years until it finally died.  </li>
            <li> Love it so far.</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s pricey, but I think it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews and settled on this one and am well pleased with it thus far (about 3 months).</li>
            <li> The price is steep, but Braun quality is worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love this razor so far ...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good as expected</li>
            <li> My husband has sensitive skin and has tried many electric razors.  </li>
            <li> What I love about it is the closeness of the shave coupled with a complete lack of irritation.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money</li>
            <li> It is well worth it for the price in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> IT IS FULLY WORTH THE PRICE.  </li>
            <li> It came on time and has been well worth the money.</li>
            <li> IT IS FULLY WORTH THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It works even better than my old 5 series shaver.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t use the cleaner that often, but I will rinse it out on my own after each use and only put it in the cleaner when it needs to be charged.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic shaver and SOOOO much better than the Series 5 (with the possible exception of the flimsier trimmer).</li>
            <li> I like the charge gauge to really get a good feel for how power you have left.  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m pleased as I could be</li>
            <li> and it seems well worth the price paid.</li>
            <li> (cost a lot, but worth it).</li>
            <li> Shaved off almost a weeks worth of growth</li>
            <li> The trimmer leaves what to be desired, feels a bit flimsy and doesn&#x27;t look like it belongs on such a nice shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Totally worth the cost.</li>
            <li> and so do I when it comes to shaving so keeping it fresh</li>
            <li> Close shave...much better than my old 8 series.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s well worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so useful.</li>
            <li> The 8995 would have been near the top of the line at the time.  </li>
            <li> And the smile on his face...priceless.</li>
            <li> so you know you get your moneys worth.</li>
            <li> So far I have 0 complaints I love this thing.  </li>
            <li> The old Braun had a more useful display than the one on the bottom of this</li>
            <li> The holes in the foil are only of one kind and do not let hair into it well.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t your face worth a couple of coffees a month?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the price though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The old series 6 shaved closer, and didn&#x27;t require as many passes to get it all (or the face contortion).  </li>
            <li> This shaver is fun to use.  </li>
            <li> it is worth every cent.  </li>
            <li> Always good as expected, have used Braun shaver 24 years.</li>
            <li> I own a Braun coffee maker for several years now, still working well.</li>
            <li> that was useful.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s well worth the hih price.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;d say this is 100% worth it for a day to day shaver.  </li>
            <li> I now own two of these shaving systems, one in each of two different residences.</li>
            <li> still getting use to it, but so far I love it</li>
            <li> My husband lost his old Braun shaver he got more than 8 yrs ago.</li>
            <li> Replaced my 10 year old Braun with this newer model; love the close shave.</li>
            <li> but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Pricey, but well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price of 159.00.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s powerful.</li>
            <li> the sounds of the electric motor sounds substantial and powerful.</li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave and has very useful and functional features.</li>
            <li> He has since beginning to shave, some 55 years ago, always used a straight razor, so this is a very new expirience, which he is enjoying.</li>
            <li> Not as clean of a shave as with a razor but good enough to appear shelved and professional at work.</li>
            <li> I almost purchased this shaver, but luckily I read the reviews for the replacement cartridges first.</li>
            <li> I love the ability to charge the razor and clean it all at the same time.  </li>
            <li> But the biggest problem I had with this unit was that I had to keep going over the same areas more than once in order to get a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> Motor sounds good running --- not as if it is going to seize up at any moment as on other electrics.</li>
            <li> , very close shave with no irritation or bit, user friendly</li>
            <li> It is indeed superior to other Braun models.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It provides a much closer shave than my original model.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a good shave but there were other problems.</li>
            <li> Quiet, runs for a long time on one charge and provides a very good shave.</li>
            <li> I go right over my lips to not miss a hair</li>
            <li> and I will get something to drink right after shaving</li>
            <li> This time, one broke right before the warranty is up</li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> So instead of returning the product right away</li>
            <li> just right..</li>
            <li> It has the right heft to the shaver and there is no plasticky feel to it as there is with a Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Just plugged it in right out of the box.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research to find the right one.  </li>
            <li> Based upon reviews and websites this is the right razor.  </li>
            <li> As you can see it doesn&#x27;t look like the right one.</li>
            <li> -- you have to twist the shaver a bit to get it in just the right spot for it to charge.</li>
            <li> after seeing some of the other reviewers&#x27; issues, but so far, so good!</li>
            <li> Using the cleaner really helps keep the blades clean and shaving close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> clean really works</li>
            <li> an outstanding Razor, not my first one, my old Braun wore out and I had to get another Braun.</li>
            <li> Much quieter, close shave and seems easier to clean too.</li>
            <li> a positive note, the Braun gives a better shave from a smaller shaver head than those huge Panasonics and  unwieldy Norelcos.</li>
            <li> I broke down and used a gift card, cash back dollars and my credit card to buy this wonderful device.  </li>
            <li> I have a very heavy beard and this is by far the best electric razor I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> This is my third Braun over some twenty years and I freely admit this is better than the last, which was better than the first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had expected a new shaver at this price would provide a great shaving experience.  </li>
            <li> Quiet, smooth and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I find that shaving a half hour after my shower provides the best overall shave, however if that is not an option, shave before showering.</li>
            <li> It is quick and gentle--no more red cheeks!</li>
            <li> My new 7-790cc pleases me as a fine purchase selection.</li>
            <li> I now get more control, better, quicker charging and the ability to use wet which really improves the shave.</li>
            <li> initial impression was not terrific since I was used to the very close shave I always received from a two bladed Sensor XL, but as the owner&#x27;s manual suggested, I did use the Braun Series 7 790cc for another 5 shaves to enable some experimentation/practice, and once I got used to it and the different settings for the various parts of my face and neck, I became more and more impressed.</li>
            <li> one and take it for a ride, could be exciting ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 1st razor I invested in normally get cheap ones.</li>
            <li> As much based on my personal experience with their products over the years as the many available reviews.  </li>
            <li> Please wrote more detail informations of goods as possible as you can, that like be origin, what kind of material, technical.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiance, and it leaves his face feeling as smooth as if he had just shaved with a normal razor blade.</li>
            <li> The shaver does get warm if you use it for too long.</li>
            <li> The higher RPM for cleaning of the ES8249 is not missed on the ES-25ST; it works just fine with the normal speed.</li>
            <li> I think a better job can be done quickly by popping off the head, rinsing it with hot water, spraying with alcohol, brushing off the motor output area with the provided brush, and popping the head back on.</li>
            <li> Smooth as a baby&#x27;s new borne butt.  </li>
            <li> Not brand new razor smooth but close.</li>
            <li> He certainly does like the ease of cleaning!</li>
            <li> That said even if you didn&#x27;t the cleaning system is still worth it because of how clean and new the shaver feels each time it&#x27;s used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted something quick and fast.</li>
            <li> Amazon is great because of the add on suggestions, so also purchased the extra cleaning solution and extra blade</li>
            <li> Series 7 is not as good a razor as the Series 5 I previously had.</li>
            <li> Close shave; easy to clean; solid</li>
            <li> The cleaning solution is easily replaced and if you only clean when the indicator is at 2 or 3, the solution lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> you DO NOT have to take the Cleaning station with you when you travel, the charging cord plugs directly into the razor itself and cleaning it by hand is easy.  </li>
            <li> It quick charges and cleans so its ready to go as soon as I need it.</li>
            <li> However I am happy to say that the Series 7-760  has met those same standards and I look forward to using it for the next 5 to 7 years.</li>
            <li> I would go so far as to say that it is easily 95% of what one would expect from a blade shave.</li>
            <li> Does not give a clean shave in nooks and hollows that easily -- you have to try different angles.</li>
            <li> I also found the 3D worked better when using a shaving gel and not dry.  </li>
            <li> The shave is a lot better and closer - cheeks and particularly under the chin and on the neck feel smooth, and the hairs that grow in different directions on the neck were all trimmed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everyone had a good deal going on because it was around Black Friday</li>
            <li> But keep in mind a good prep and post shave is key if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> also, a good post shave is KEY for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> just what I wanted fast, quick, easy and no mess.</li>
            <li> Maintenance is also very convenient!I like it very much!</li>
            <li> On my first shave with this, I think I was a little disappointed, but for the price, I was probably expecting it to be perfect with a flawless shave on the first pass.</li>
            <li> Five stars for very smooth shave, but only four for the cleaning module instructions.</li>
            <li> and send another one to my friend ,he like it very much</li>
            <li> like the product very much.</li>
            <li> My husband very much likes his Braun.</li>
            <li> With a Braun you press the shaver moderately against the face unlike a Norelco which requires a very light touch.</li>
            <li> He likes it very much.</li>
            <li> If shaving with a new Gillette blade is considered the closest shave- 5 stars, and the old Norelco a strong 3 stars ( electric is never as close as blade), this Braun just doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;cut it\\&quot; !</li>
            <li> Good razor but a little pricy.</li>
            <li> Finally, shave until your face &amp;#34;looks&amp;#34; clean rather than &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; smooth.</li>
            <li> First, the self cleaning process seems to do a good job at cleaning the razor blades, and foil, but does not clean the outer part of the foil (the plastic parts of either side of the foils).</li>
            <li> I stopped short of 5 stars as the pop out trimmer is not as handy as the older units when it came to tidying up my beard -</li>
            <li> Relatively quiet, very smooth, and a nice close shave with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> It feels more substantial; but, after using it for several weeks now I believe my 20 year old braun achieved a closer shave (the older trimmer worked better also).  </li>
            <li> powerful.&lt;br /&gt;- The vibrating action makes a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> However, I am overall satisfied eith this product.</li>
            <li> Note that this is the first electric shaver he has used in over 45 years -</li>
            <li> or some nice features like how many minutes you spent for your last shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First let me say that I know a traditional blade is always better</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver I have used/owned after using blades for over 50 years.</li>
            <li> First, I bought this off walmart.com, because at the time, with rebates, it was about $40 cheaper.</li>
            <li> I rarely use this, so its not too much a concern to me.</li>
            <li> but with some things to be aware of&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast arrival however doesn&#x27;t give a close shave!</li>
            <li> Comfortable to hold, not too loud.  </li>
            <li> For an electric razor, it&#x27;s pretty quiet.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves with one and hasn&#x27;t seen a  bump since!</li>
            <li> Cleaning light indicates the shaver requires cleaning after about 3 shaves, but the battery light indicates that it will go a long time before charging is required.</li>
            <li> I shower first.</li>
            <li> This comes 97% close to be exact.</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for about 4 months now, this is my first electric razor.</li>
            <li> The 790cc is maybe just a tad more powerful, but really, I can&#x27;t tell a big difference.</li>
            <li> The big improvement over the 8585 is the handle  design which makes the grip much better and improves the maneuverability of the shaver.</li>
            <li> It is very noisy and vibrates a lot!</li>
            <li> This razor is exactly what my husband has been looking for.</li>
            <li> Thanks!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful and shaves fast and close.</li>
            <li> fix it the first time.  </li>
            <li> My first time in my life I choose to go with an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> Even when you pass over it from the correct direction the razor might not get it on the first pass.  </li>
            <li> Seems better to shave daily, rather than shaving longer stubble</li>
            <li> The first time it happened, I contacted Braun and let them know it broke immediately after the warranty...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to go back to the Panasonic which is now NOT well made but shaves better  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different shavers that my wife thinks that I am a nut case.</li>
            <li> This 790 model is much quieter than past models (wife is quite happy about that).</li>
            <li> (at least that&#x27;s what the razor tells me, another great feature).</li>
            <li> My first one lasted about three years before the popup trimmer popped off altogether.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> At the time I would have never of spent that kind of money on a shaver, but my wife had no problem and I am so grateful for her splurging.</li>
            <li> I bought one when they first came out years ago &amp;</li>
            <li> So, when it came time to replace my last one I gravitated to Braun again and decided to get one of the top models.  </li>
            <li> This was my first series 7 from Braun.</li>
            <li> but this is the first time in my 70 years of life and</li>
            <li> ( in their defense they have better razors with a bigger price tag, you get what you pay for)  </li>
            <li> It is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with various non-electric razors most of my life.  </li>
            <li> First foil shaver that I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> But overall is one of the better shavers that I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> YOU CANNOT RETURN THIS ITEM BE AWARE.</li>
            <li> first it gave me horrendous shaving burn, but I stuck with it.</li>
            <li> Consistent with the Consumer Reports review, this shaver performs as advertised.</li>
            <li> Importantly, It does not have plastic type of guard to protect the foil part even though it has soft carrying case(bag).</li>
            <li> My husband thought he would never be able to get a close shave again since he is no longer allowed to use a regular razor after heart surgery.</li>
            <li> I chose it over the one that ranked first for a close shave for two reasons.</li>
            <li> Not as close as the razor but pretty damn close.</li>
            <li> I first put Gillette Foamy shaving cream on my face and shave with the Braun.</li>
            <li> Because it was my first go with this razor and</li>
            <li> That is, trying to get as many of the &amp;#34;straggler hairs&amp;#34; as possible.</li>
            <li> First electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> Any man would LOVE to have this for a present so grab this up.</li>
            <li> For all intents and purposes this is my first electric razor.</li>
            <li> Highly recommand!!</li>
            <li> Great shaver works well on thick beards.</li>
            <li> Shave is not close enough and the cleaning is more cumbersome than the Norellco.</li>
            <li> Works great for my husband whose hair is really thick.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;m writing a review for any product on Amazon</li>
            <li> The first thing is the vibration.</li>
            <li> Running it under hot water does the job I guess because you can&#x27;t take the shaving head apart.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s very well built and does the job!</li>
            <li> The first place I use it is to shave my head, which it does so effortlessly.</li>
            <li> It does make a higher pitched noise when using it</li>
            <li> First time buyer of a Braun shaved.</li>
            <li> No burns or irritation from electric razor, which is a first in my experience.</li>
            <li> The shorter coming that the shake and noise are bit higher.</li>
            <li> This is my second top of the line Braun.</li>
            <li> My first still works after eight years with just shaver head replacements.</li>
            <li> Very close shave!</li>
            <li> I used first one for 10 years.</li>
            <li> Thought I would try an electric razor for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Wanted to see if the technology had changed or improved since last using one many years ago.  </li>
            <li> Yes it costs $80 more ea year, but it makes the razor last 15 years</li>
            <li> Using Aramis lotion or Lectric Shave helps and you must not wash your face before you shave or shave when you first get up.</li>
            <li> In additional,  I really enjoy the trim setting that allows you to get a normal shave or a really close shave.</li>
            <li> Do the head first and then the face.  </li>
            <li> Today Saturday, I tried to use the self-cleaning for the first time.</li>
            <li> but I am starting to love it.</li>
            <li> It only takes more time to shave than a manual razor.</li>
            <li> and I know I had cleaned it 2 times before that, between my first</li>
            <li> I would buy it again in a heartbeat if I had the money, but sadly I do not.  </li>
            <li> I am sure all the razors aren&#x27;t defective, especially when looking at this products rockstar ratings!  </li>
            <li> I have had several (too many to remember) rotary razors</li>
            <li> I decided to go with a Panisonic model electric shaver instead, as the reviews for their replacement cartridges are stellar.</li>
            <li> The first head must be defective.  </li>
            <li> However, the first time I tried it, I was amazed ...  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very upset with this razor!  </li>
            <li> I just replaced my first container of cleaner conditioner.</li>
            <li> This will feel great for you IF you never tried a Panasonic &amp;#60;made in Japan&amp;#62; ever checked where Braun are made lately?</li>
            <li> I was very surprised as to how much my shave was closer and still felt better than my older Braun shaver.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so good that 24 hours later is like 8 hours later with the Norelco I was using (a cheap 30 dollar model when new</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor if you want a quick shave that doesn&#x27;t irritate your face.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing electric razor especially for African American skin which most electric razors aren&#x27;t friendly too.</li>
            <li> I put my old one at my cabin and have found that I truly can&#x27;t wait to get home to use the new one because it feels so much better.</li>
            <li> Shave is more comfortable with less skin irritation and closer shave.</li>
            <li> I have owned several Braun shavers, Remignton and others and never before gotten a full clean shave.</li>
            <li> The clean deck is seem not much useful, water cleanning is ok</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying this product, the first lasting about a good 4 - 4.5 years.</li>
            <li> nice product works extremely well</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to affect anything, the shaver still seems clean, runs smoothly the next use, and the next cleaning cycle works just fine.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to affect anything, the shaver still seems clean, runs smoothly the next use, and the next cleaning cycle works just fine.</li>
            <li> I  am back to using my old Norelco with a set of new heads and it does a much superior job compared to this piece of junk.  </li>
            <li> which drys my now dry face and hair and provides a clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this is one heck of a great shaver.</li>
            <li> I did notice in the manual that if the shaver is relatively clean and battery fully charged, the status display should be dim.</li>
            <li> At times I&#x27;ve noticed a dim blinking in the display, so perhaps with increased use it will brighten when the unit is not so clean and charged.</li>
            <li> You can just remove the cover and clean it the old fashioned way.</li>
            <li> Owned an older version and this was no disappointment.  </li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t clean my old one until I had run the battery out.</li>
            <li> Overall, the razor is good but it just can&#x27;t compete with a traditional razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I especially like the cleaning action that it performs on its own.</li>
            <li> You can get the same or better product for much less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update August 13, 2014</li>
            <li> For a heavy beard (after 2-3 days of not shaving), I use the Lab Series Lotion to lubricate before shaving which works well to set up my beard for a more comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> It works quite nicely, the only downside is that the cleaning mode is loud.  </li>
            <li> The shave as a whole is much better than competitors and will not go back to a rotary style shaver.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old Series 7 with this updated model and am quite pleased thus far.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast, love this shaver my last Braun shaver lasted over 10&lt;br /&gt;Years</li>
            <li> With others, i have to go back and forth several times to get a good shave.  </li>
            <li> It was a positive change, it has the closest shave and never harms the skin.  </li>
            <li> This one always topped the lists with positive reviews an after using I can see why.  </li>
            <li> Let me start this off with something positive....</li>
            <li> I have facial hair that routinely kills normal shaver about every nine months, plus they never gave me a really smooth shave -- for special events</li>
            <li> in the beginning the results were not good but after 1 week the results are great as I got used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The razor still shaves as expected but again, when you spend the money to buy a top of the line razor you expect it to last more than 18 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I had pretty much given up on electric razors.</li>
            <li> Oh well -- a minor annoyance for an otherwise outstanding shaving system.</li>
            <li> It shaves very close and cleans itself very well!</li>
            <li> that pretty much copies the Braun, but</li>
            <li> The razor gets hot, and it vibrates very noisily.  </li>
            <li> My first Braun and I really like it.</li>
            <li> a small price for a good article</li>
            <li> life is good, i usually put it in the cleaning station after use, which charges as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> life is good, i usually put it in the cleaning station after use, which charges as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The razor gives a good shave, thought no better than the 39.95 ones for sale.</li>
            <li> All of these (so far) have held true.</li>
            <li> This Braun Series 7-790cc is a good razor, however, I was not satisfied.</li>
            <li> This coming from the guy that liked the old one so much he went with the same brand.</li>
            <li> I now use this razor on the extra sensitive mode and it is FAR superior to any electric razor I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li> Operates very smoothly and quietly compared to most other electrics.     </li>
            <li> clean, smelling fresh, properly sanitized.</li>
            <li> For the last month I have had to go over my face many times to get a decent shave.  </li>
            <li> I just spent 2 weeks in the hospital and it took off all the growth easily!</li>
            <li> I have a lemon fresh practically brand new shaver to work with.</li>
            <li> I owned a previous model and it was amazing.  </li>
            <li> this razor would easily get 5 stars if the pop up trimmer wasn&#x27;t a total joke.</li>
            <li> I have noticed in the last week that the head doesn&#x27;t pivot as easily as it did before</li>
            <li> a previous series braun and i liked that one to</li>
            <li> Long lasting battery - 3-4 times and counting, good for travel too.</li>
            <li> plenty of power to cut through the toughest facial hair, and it holds a charge for well over a full week worth of shaves at over 10 to 12 minutes per shave.</li>
            <li> most of my adult life, and really liked the two (2) Braun 3550 single foil shavers (long since discontinued).</li>
            <li> It comes with one cleaning cartridge which is a sturdy plastic container holding the liquid cleaner which is largely alcohol.</li>
            <li> It will take either the Smart or the Opti foil cartridges</li>
            <li> I give the razor a quick brush clean after every shave and then do the electric clean every third or fourth shave to hopefully prolong the cleaning cartridge refills.</li>
            <li> More simple than DE, same discomfort with the problems of a DE, and not as cool haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> think Philips shavers ones may be better, especially the new ones</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for an earlier model I had enjoyed using for 7 years but wanted a new one.</li>
            <li> I have been always buying Braun products due to their nice design and the high quality of the product.</li>
            <li> squaring off the sideburns is easy with the trimmer (which works very well), but doesn&#x27;t shave close enough for me.</li>
            <li> According to the owners manual you can clean the shaver with hot running water and put  a small drop of light machine oil on top of the Foil &amp; Cutter cassette each week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this shaver for several weeks</li>
            <li> The Braun Pulsonic razor is the most comfortable, fast &amp; long lasting electric razor on the market.  </li>
            <li> But this one is VERY comfortable (and for me a razor is really rough).</li>
            <li> and it looks perfectly clean, but the indicator, apparently, doesn&#x27;t quite agree.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary: if your facial hair grows in a normal pattern and have a full head of hair, consider yourself lucky and buy this razor.  </li>
            <li> My husband still prefers his Gillette Fusion, but it is very good in a pinch or in a secondary shave later on in the day.</li>
            <li> wish braun company makes it more user friendly and make charging method easy than using complicated channels.</li>
            <li> The pulsonic feature of the shaver doesn&#x27;t seem to make a huge difference on occasional use</li>
            <li> Additionally it is very difficultt to get a close shave with this system.</li>
            <li> It however does not provide as close a shave as a straight edge.</li>
            <li> Have been using the Series -7900cc for the past couple of months now and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> i really miss those features</li>
            <li> Yes, never in a million years did I think I would pay this much for a shaver.  </li>
            <li> : cleaning system is great and u can refill it with Philips Norelco cleaning fluid which probably has same fluid and is much cheaper</li>
            <li> Otherwise a much quieter sand smoother shave.</li>
            <li> I found it provides a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> This razor gives my husband a really close shave.</li>
            <li> Shaves close and all the spots without much effort.</li>
            <li> Much closer than my Braun</li>
            <li> Much cheaper and works just as well with no downside.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews very often</li>
            <li> The Braun is much faster, but still missed hairs and caused breakouts.</li>
            <li> Comes with cleaning system at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Performs very well.</li>
            <li> and it won&#x27;t give you a very close shave.</li>
            <li> tried straight razors as well.</li>
            <li> It is plenty fast.</li>
            <li> No this electric shaver does not get as close as a straight razor, but you cannot tell unless you put my skin follicles under a microscope.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have much luck with electric shavers before.</li>
            <li> Shaves faster, quiter  and much closer than any electric I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> So, I contacted Amazon customer service and they immediately sent a replacement of the whole unit that arrived in two days.</li>
            <li> but would have preferred a straight edge rather than</li>
            <li> A friend recommended to use electric shavers and that really did the trick, it reduce my ingrown hairs by a bunch and eventually they were gone.</li>
            <li> The cleaning cycle works really well and the cartridge of cleaner doesn&#x27;t run out as fast as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Get the whole package including the cleaner, it works really well.</li>
            <li> The electric is much easier on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> As an added bonus it is much easier on my face than a blade.</li>
            <li> works very well.  </li>
            <li> This is a well made shaver, very robust heads</li>
            <li> The 790 does an excellent job cutting through 3 and even 5 day growth however.  </li>
            <li> I really like this shaver.</li>
            <li> I got tired of the shaving cream razor method and this is just great.</li>
            <li> However, this one really caught my attention.</li>
            <li> I was looking to get away from replacement costs when I switched from my straight razor.</li>
            <li> thanks..</li>
            <li> The replacement parts are much cheaper than the competitors.  </li>
            <li> Very sturdy construction.</li>
            <li> We get a really close shave and</li>
            <li> Very rarely do I really regret a purchase, this time I do.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t use after shave either; does your face really need chemicals splashed on it?)&lt;br /</li>
            <li> and he really likes the cleaning feature.  </li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> You have to really dig into your skin and thus get nicked by the blades.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really needed to be replaced yet, but I like to have it on hand when it does need replacement.</li>
            <li> the power switch need a very big push!, but in a word, fantastic.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much to say for the pros that aren&#x27;t already in the product description.</li>
            <li> BUT it really had some issues I didn&#x27;t care for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> :When shaving the Panasonic seems MUCH bulkier the Braun.</li>
            <li> You get a really close shave without all the irritation and discomfort</li>
            <li> I get a real close shave too.</li>
            <li> real downside of the 7-series, however, is its pop-up trimmer.</li>
            <li> Which means I&#x27;ll keep the 790 as a backup and go back to the 320s-4 as the primary.  </li>
            <li> This whole thing has me contemplating something I haven&#x27;t thought of doing for a couple of decades, which is to try a blade again.  </li>
            <li> This shaver continues to allow me to spend as much time as I want to get the job done without the irritation.</li>
            <li> this is wet shaving using shaving gel, but by doing that, I get WAY closer than I was ever able to get with another electric razor.</li>
            <li> I really like the feel and cut from this shaver.  </li>
            <li> While I had reservations about the price, I pulled the trigger anyway in hopes of finally getting a bump free shaving experience, but it just didn&#x27;t work out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> addition to taking longer to shave AND leaving way too much hair on my face</li>
            <li> it comes with and hit a button and it determines how much it needs to be cleaned, whether it needs to be charged or not and it dows all that with the touch of a button.</li>
            <li> Cuts close and fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Wow, have to say it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li> it shaves in a straight line (unlike the rotary motion that Philips specifies) - much easier to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really quietest Braune yet.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Great quality, poor flip up trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I dislike the pop up trimmer&#x27;s angle straight out of the body of the shaver...</li>
            <li> The shaver gave me a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> Oct 2015; I had the Series 5 and the Series 7 gives a much, much closer shave, plus the additional adjustments for a closer shave</li>
            <li> Works better than I expected</li>
            <li> Should have invested in this 790cc model much sooner.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> This unit works very efficiently.  </li>
            <li> Makes life so much easier.</li>
            <li> Shave against the grain and using a foil like this Braun, shave in straight motions and at 90 degrees to the face.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it that much yet, but all in all</li>
            <li> It is far better than the last razor and cuts very close.  </li>
            <li> but I think this one really warrants 5 stars from me.</li>
            <li> I follow the instructions and get a really close</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m convinced that the hygiene meter means absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> It shaves close, although I really don&#x27;t care if not as close as a blade, if I wanted that close, I would still be using a blade.</li>
            <li> Very quiet.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This shaver shaves you really close without the nicks and cuts that sometime accompany a close shaver.  </li>
            <li> Clean,quickly,easy to use and not too much noise.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> but for the rest of us, this 790cc will do the job and do it very well.</li>
            <li> I have since thrown them all away along with the whole cleaning unit.</li>
            <li> In fact, it&#x27;s almost as close as a safety razor, and over my 70 years I have always preferred a safety razor when I really wanted to have a close shave.  </li>
            <li> The amazon price is much cheaper than you buy at China.</li>
            <li> Shaves are much closer with no burn.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I received this as a Christmas gigt and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> I have a light beard and multiple passes are needed to shave any area.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just as fast as any electric model on the market.</li>
            <li> packaging was much appreciated (no clam-shell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much quieter and shaves much closer and faster.  </li>
            <li> with sales or a rebate, you are going to spend over a hundred dollars, perhaps even as much as a hundred and fifty for this razor.  </li>
            <li> Really like the gauge though</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant before buying this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning port works very well</li>
            <li> It shaves my face and neck very efficiently with no irritation.</li>
            <li> does not shave neck real close.</li>
            <li> Real close shave.</li>
            <li> and I really wish I could like the razor</li>
            <li> It shaves very well</li>
            <li> It does share really well</li>
            <li> I had been waiting close to a year to justify spending this much for it.  </li>
            <li> : it&#x27;s much quieter than Braun&#x27;s 760.</li>
            <li> My wife tends to complain that I make too much noise shaving.</li>
            <li> Thanks Braun</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> Really like this razor.  </li>
            <li> Rather, I suck it up and pay way too much for the cartridge.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and let it grow for over a day, or have fast growing hair, it will be agonizing to use.</li>
            <li> This really is the closest electric shaver shave I have had.  </li>
            <li> They also state that the cleaning cartridge is good for about 30 cleanings, and that it should be replaced at least every 8 weeks because the lubricant will settle to the bottom of the solution.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Braun, my last one finally went out</li>
            <li> I am absolutely sure that I could return it as safely as it got here, but the law/ shipping policies are rules that cannot be broken by a college kid.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think shaving could get much better than with my (ten years old)</li>
            <li> but its nice and quiet with different settings you can use...been using for about a month and havent had to replace the head or the gel.</li>
            <li> Braun on the other hand is quite quiet and shaving early morning is no longer a problem, honestly you can even hear when the heads hit whiskers vs a clean area, sounds funny</li>
            <li> Very powerful, so not very quiet.  </li>
            <li> Very nice looking machine; feels good in the hand (a heavy, expensive feel), and glides well across the face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cleaner cartridge lasted me about 5 weeks before I had my first change (which was simple, and quick).</li>
            <li> I generally have to do a quick shave with the razor afterwards.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The razor isn&#x27;t exactly quiet, but the steady hum of the Braun foil is far more acceptable than the chunky buzzing of the Norelco rotary.  </li>
            <li> Let me make a long review short, LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> old 7 series was 2 or 3 years old and still on the original blades.  </li>
            <li> I shaved in less than 5 minutes now, so is definitely a quick smooth shave, no pain</li>
            <li> I really prefer the clean feeling of a traditional shave</li>
            <li> but I am able to shave every other day with no problem</li>
            <li> Braun has always delivered a shave better than other brands for me.</li>
            <li> I have owned the top of the line arc 5 panasonic razor and found it extremely paniful</li>
            <li> The Norelco came close, but it irritated my skin like many other people.</li>
            <li> Much better than I expected!</li>
            <li> I found the Braun 5 to be the better of the other 2</li>
            <li> The original had multiple configuration holes.  </li>
            <li> My first Braun electric razor is now eight years old and still works!</li>
            <li> Better shave than other electric shavres that I have tried.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t think of anything else better to use other than a Harry&#x27;s blade.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please make a smart decision and avoid this as much as you can unless your skin is quite immune and you are ok with some black spots on your face</li>
            <li> Although the braun 790cc has a high price tag it is worth it if you suffer from sensitive skin like I do.</li>
            <li> and the money spent to buy it is well worth it!!</li>
            <li> worth the higher price for such a well-manufactured product.</li>
            <li> Keep it in the stand and clean it once daily.  </li>
            <li> AS I GOT OLDER, AND WITH THE NEEDED MEDICINE FOR AGING PROBLEMS, MY SKIN GOT VERY TENDER.  </li>
            <li> AS I GOT OLDER, AND WITH THE NEEDED MEDICINE FOR AGING PROBLEMS, MY SKIN GOT VERY TENDER.</li>
            <li> The cleaning solution last me about 45 days or so, but I clean and charge mine after every use.</li>
            <li> I clean one or two times a week and don&#x27;t notice a difference in operation compared to daily cleaning.</li>
            <li> The only way to clean it is in it&#x27;s cleaning stand.</li>
            <li> I could open the Norelco cutters up and clean them.    </li>
            <li> but my wife still says \\&quot;what&#x27;s that?\\&quot; from the living room when I clean it and the shaver cycles on &amp; off several times.    </li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a foil razor, but, so far, I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I now only clean the thing with the docking station once every month or two.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The charging stand pumps a cleaning fluid across the foil while the unit is activated to clean.</li>
            <li> It sterilizes the blades and lubricates them properly so you do not need to use oil or manually clean it every time you shave.</li>
            <li> I only wish that I didnt have to clean it every 3-4 days (with system) but that can be negotiated around.</li>
            <li> Also, the Braun shaver is easier to clean using only liquid soap and water.</li>
            <li> Most days I just cut the long hairs and reduce everything down to a uniform stubble unless I really want to look nice, then I spend the extra 5-6 minutes to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend cleaning cartridge depend how much you shave.  </li>
            <li> Eventually as your face adjusts to the new shaver you can lengthen the shave and shave to that smooth feel, about ten minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For special occasions (once a month or so) I shave with a regular razor after shaving with the electical razor.</li>
            <li> The Braun is a worthwhile purchase for me due to its adaptability/flexibility, easiness of maintenance, and high quality.</li>
            <li> In fact it was still going strong 6 years later, but I bought this because my old one was looking beat up</li>
            <li> Good price for the product,lot less noisy than my last one .</li>
            <li> The new version is pure garbage.  </li>
            <li> It comes with three settings designed to give either a gentle, normal, or close shave.</li>
            <li> I guess i was just surprised when I first discovered this (about 1 month into using the shaver).</li>
            <li> I guess i was just surprised when I first discovered this (about 1 month into using the shaver).</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver and so far I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> It is pretty loud when it cleans but</li>
            <li> I knew I wanted the higher end 790 but didn&#x27;t want to pay the near 200 price tag at the time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry shaving the razor is good but not nearly as good.</li>
            <li> Have yet to use the trimmer element or switch to an intensity higher than the sensitive one but trust me</li>
            <li> the battery often won&#x27;t last through 2 full shaves.</li>
            <li> although it shaves much better than any competitor, I have to work at the softer hairs down the neck</li>
            <li> He has a very tough beard, but this shaver gets rid of it beautifully.  </li>
            <li> This one works really well and the cleaning feature seems to work better than my last Braun, needless to say I&#x27;m quiet Satisfied :-)</li>
            <li> I bought new one!</li>
            <li> My husband loves his new razor!</li>
            <li> and it still works as if new!</li>
            <li> but new one is much closer.</li>
            <li> I have previously used a Norelco 3 head rotary for many years.</li>
            <li> I typically upgrade to better features as opposed to having one die on me.</li>
            <li> Much better than previous Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun (forgot the model #) for years before this, and this one is better than the previous one.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s some tugging as I shave, but this razor does it faster and better than previous razors I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Bought as a replacement for my previous 5 series I owed for many years.</li>
            <li> And the battery life seems better than my previous Brauns.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to get more than six hours out of a shave, compared to eight to ten with a traditional razor.</li>
            <li> I had been using a much older Braun and a Norelco.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;ll shave with this 790 and then finish up with one of my older shavers.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this mainly for travel.  </li>
            <li> The fluid drys up too quickly.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price and the base is very impressive.</li>
            <li> Sure, buying the cleaning cartridges is spendy but there are simple ways to refill them yourself or make the factory ones last.</li>
            <li> If you have hair which grows from various directions on a patch of skin, you have to pass the razor over the same spot from many directions to get it all.  </li>
            <li> I had been using an older Braun shaver and it was time to move on.</li>
            <li> only negative I would say is that the trimmer is not that great.  </li>
            <li> Main use was to shave my head.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have particularly dense stubble, but I would say my skin is quite sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> How could a famous manufacturer let such obvious malfunctioned product out is beyond my understanding.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cleaning mechanism looks to be decently designed.</li>
            <li> Getting a close shave is possible but it takes me many repetitions over the same area to achieve it.</li>
            <li> expected far better craftsmanship from Braun.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned that actually can cut my beard and leave a pretty close</li>
            <li> - I got a super price from Amazon, especially with the $30.00 coupon.</li>
            <li> Today I changed shaver heads and it was back to a quick close shave again.  </li>
            <li> I owned an older Braun series 7,but</li>
            <li> have actually gone back to my $30 rotary razor and it gives a much better shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shave is decent but you still need to spend some time getting a close shave.</li>
            <li> The cleaning liquid last several months and keeps my blades in top order.</li>
            <li> I chose this to replace an older, cheaper  Norelco.</li>
            <li> My main motivation for getting this was reduced costs of ownership.</li>
            <li> I had a 5 Series immediately prior to this purchase and several models (over many years) of Norelco Rotary Shavers but none shaved as closely as this 7 Series.  </li>
            <li> It is still within 30 days of the original purchase, and 3 weeks since my first use, but due to policies regarding shipping and flammable chemicals I am not allowed to return the item.  </li>
            <li> For my Asian beard (larger diameter hairs), it does not work any better than a Norelco with rotary blades.  </li>
            <li> The shave quality seemed to drop off rapidly after a month, but is decent.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is its lack of power storage that can last more that an hour or so.  </li>
            <li> Fluid cartridges wear out quickly.</li>
            <li> The replacement works perfectly and confirmed for me why Amazon Prime is where I go first no matter what I&#x27;m buying -- big or small item, big or small price.</li>
            <li> It shaves much closer than the old one!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver</li>
            <li> I have used many methods such as an old fashioned straight razor which left my skin beat up and irritated.</li>
            <li> in all, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> When I hold this shaver in my hands it feels a durable high end product it comes with the cleaning kit</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what he uses exclusively and praises it highly.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> As a Panasonic user, I was reluctant to change to Braun, but made the move because it rated so high on the &amp;#34;closest shave&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone choosing an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The 7 series is high quality and has some features that separate it from lower numbered series.</li>
            <li> I feel the cost is high for what the performance is.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s high tech compared to Gillette blade shaving and the Norelco.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have used Philips nerolco 3D and been using Gillette Mach3 since high school.</li>
            <li> I highly reccamend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended,</li>
            <li> I expect it will last for many years and continue to perform like new with proper maintenance.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little while to finish a shave and the usual areas are problematic but the result is very good for an electric razor.</li>
            <li> Very quiet, very smooth, supper long battery.</li>
            <li> (that was a few years back) by sanitizing it and just an all around comfortable good close shave and extremely reliable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Obviously everybody&#x27;s beard is different and some shavers will work fine for one person and not so much for others.</li>
            <li> rue the cleaning feature is nice but it pulls my hairs on my face when it&#x27;s hardly grown out.  </li>
            <li> had an older broun system and tryed a philips new one, and both are not even close to this one.</li>
            <li> It is quieter and the cleaning process seems to not use as much liquid as the old one.  </li>
            <li> I still have to touch up from time to time with a regular razor since I have facial hair, but for mowing the unpopulated areas it is fast and smooth.</li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave and there is no skin irritation or razor burns even on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> because i do my head as well as my face does seem to take longer than i expected to get a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve discovered that doing the bulk of the shaving dry then hitting the shower with a dab of Gillette shave cream to clean up</li>
            <li> One problem, my old Remington MS 290 that I bought for $50 at Wal-Mart shaves MUCH closer than this 7-790cc.</li>
            <li> My son is very self conscious about his razor burn on his neck.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive face and straight razors</li>
            <li> I am wondering if this unit will drink cleaning fluid pretty fast.</li>
            <li> the rare times I have longer facial hair, this thing still powers through.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend, particularly if you are African American dealing with stubborn in grown hairs.</li>
            <li> I have not complained to the vendors.  </li>
            <li> liquid that comes with this is not fit for most .</li>
            <li> Normally with the 5 series I would have to go over and over my face to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> Longer whiskers took a few more swipes to get rid of.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the bit extra cost.  </li>
            <li> I had a 7 series and went to the 3 series for a few years but am very glad I switched back.  </li>
            <li> well worth the extra bucks over the cost of lessor shavers in the Braun product line.</li>
            <li> I do think it uses more fluid than my old one did, but only because it has a gauge</li>
            <li> For now, I&#x27;ll call it a good choice, but not a great choice.</li>
            <li> They last a long time but when one wears out and I get a new one the newer ones are better.</li>
            <li> I shaved with braun 790 as soon as I got it out of the package, the whole shaving experince was smooth, took less time to shave with no leftover hair residue or skin irritation.</li>
            <li> An additional plus is that it is easy on my skin and the former constant redness in neck caused by a blade has gone away too.</li>
            <li> Not a big deal, occasionally, simply wetting a finger and wiping it across the plastic parts cleans it off easily.</li>
            <li> Not a big deal, occasionally, simply wetting a finger and wiping it across the plastic parts cleans it off easily.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to use and it has actually reduced overall irritation (I was warned this might increase?).  </li>
            <li> I tried this 790 series and it does a very good job but a little hard on the skin.  </li>
            <li> very nice ,just the cleaning cartridge is quite expensive</li>
            <li> Very nice but complicated.</li>
            <li> Braun is sending a new cutter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this shaver now for 15 months and just now ordered a new replacement foil cartridge for it on amazon.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone looking for a new shaver.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a new razor, this is the one for you.  </li>
            <li> and I decided to look for a new razor .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Philips rotary shavers for over 25 years and needed to buy a new head -</li>
            <li> A new head every 2 months is out of the question at $33 a head.</li>
            <li> The new shaver head I bought is made in Germany and seems to be a quality product.</li>
            <li> When I pick up my shaver each morning, it is like a brand new shaver...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I could not be happier with my new Braun 790 cc.</li>
            <li> I like the new Cleaning system too</li>
            <li> So instead of replacing the parts I decided it was time for a new model, thinking the series 7 would be an upgrade.  </li>
            <li> I understand the irritation issues but with any new electric razor it takes a week or two before your skin will adapt to it</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m new to electric razors</li>
            <li> they get me new one</li>
            <li> Clippings and skin oils keep all those others from ever getting close as new.  </li>
            <li> Just like new again.</li>
            <li> The new Braun Series 7 performs fantastically.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to electric razors, and are unsure of their merits, do yourself a favor and give this one a try.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves his new razor and uses it all the time.</li>
            <li> Brand new razor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  Braun sent me a new foil cartridge as a &amp;#34;goodwill gesture&amp;#34; and the razor no longer pulls hair.  </li>
            <li> would recomend to anyone in the market for a new electric shaver</li>
            <li> thinking maybe it&#x27;s because my face is not used to a new razor</li>
            <li> How could such seemingly good engineers place the trimmer where it is so hard to see?</li>
            <li> Shifted over to razors to get that smooth face feeling but the cost and waste was too much so</li>
            <li> Quiet and smooth beyond belief with enough gee wiz gizmo&#x27;s to satisfy the techy.</li>
            <li> It ensures no irritation, smells fantastic but not over powering, and it actually slows the growth rate of my facial hair.</li>
            <li> It is much quieter than the Panasonic and holds a charge pretty long.</li>
            <li> Other than that minor complaint it appears to be an excellent shaver.</li>
            <li> however, the device is very loud and the shaving isn&#x27;t as close as represented in all the reviews.</li>
            <li> i always use the pop up trimmer to shave my neck because it is very sensitive and electric razors just cant get the hairs, but this trimmer that pops up is just garbage.</li>
            <li> My husband has very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Only reason I needed to buy a new one is due to My dropping it to many times and breaking it otherwise</li>
            <li> Its easy to use, understand, self cleaning, long lasting and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m interested to see how it holds up over time (we&#x27;ve only had it a week or so)</li>
            <li> have purchased many electric shavers over the past years.</li>
            <li> Obviously, not as close as a blade, but does get pretty darn close.</li>
            <li> The actual shaver head is much more contained than the Series 5 which subsequently requires using the cleaning station versus just simply brushing it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been using the Pulsonic Shaver and this replaced his old one!  </li>
            <li> When I could not find any useful information on Braun&#x27;s website, I emailed their customer service and it took about three days to hear back, without any real answers to my two simple questions:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> This is the first one that actually replaced my Mach 3.</li>
            <li> I have used a schick 3 for most of my shaving life along with other similar razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a traditional disposable razor for 20 years and this was my first electric.  </li>
            <li> , however I hold it to a higher standard because of the price.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> This will get just as close as a normal razor when used correctly and will not destroy your face if you take your time with it.</li>
            <li> but it is LOUD!</li>
            <li> My old shaver was a Braun, and I loved that one, but sadly I won&#x27;t be making any Braun purchases again after wasting so much money on this product.</li>
            <li> It was time for a new foil and blade on the old one which amounts to 1/3 of the cost of this new.  </li>
            <li> My previous shaver was a high end Norelco and after many years I thought I&#x27;d try something different.</li>
            <li> The blade foil cover pops off too easily when shaving if your face is damp from the shower and thus a little sticky.</li>
            <li> but if you have darker or thicker facial hair and need or want a clean shave that will last all day</li>
            <li> Clean and sharp.</li>
            <li> It does a fine job, but so did my old ancient norelco that just got handed down to a grandchild.  </li>
            <li> I thought with ten years of technological advances that this shaver would be even better, but it doesn&#x27;t shave nearly as close as my other shaver does.</li>
            <li> the new one is soft and cheapened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everywhere on my face is smooth, there are no more gray straggles that refuse to be cut, my sideburns are straight and with my bride&#x27;s help I keep a well trimmed look around my neck.  </li>
            <li> I guess I was sold on all the bells and whistles and the fact that is was really cheap during Black Friday ($129)</li>
            <li> Heavy, noisy with strong vibration.</li>
            <li> Still would recommend the razor, and if I have to, I will most likely be buying another one sometime down the road.</li>
            <li> Lectric Shave (or the store brand) is fine, although a little slippery/messy to apply.  </li>
            <li> there was a digital countdown in previous modules that shows how many minutes it require for finish the cleaning process.</li>
            <li> Cuts the shaving time in half from our first Braun shaver when we *first started shaving</li>
            <li> I have owned this Braun shaver for around 3 years and have been able to compare it with Panasonic´s Arc5 Wet and Dry shaver, which I have used for about 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Braun model left stubble over various parts of my face, it snagged, there was mild irritation and even some redness under the neck area.  </li>
            <li> I only got a few red marks my first time out, and I am confident that was user error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well it still shaves just as well, but this model occasionally grabs my hair in areas if I approach from a certain angle</li>
            <li> I rarely use this, so its not too much a concern to me.or blades, and foil, but does not clean the outer part of the foil (the plastic parts of either side of the foils).</li>
            <li> The shaver does a nice job on my tough beard.  </li>
            <li> (I was anxious to see how this thing could clean itself!)</li>
            <li> I have tried all the major brands of shavers and always went back to favor and shaving cream until my wife bought me my first Braun 700 series which was called then the pulsar or something like that.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s definitely worth mentioning because I have a tough beard (I have to use 1 quality razor, or 2 cheap razors per shave), and I have to keep going over spots to get everything, but the battery still lasts.</li>
            <li> Housing unit can be a little loud, but not too bothersome and most cycles are quite short.</li>
            <li> The price is a little steep at around $180-$200, but I think the self-cleaning system and smooth cut is well worth the extra cash, besides, you only get one face</li>
            <li> I find this a convenient feature that does a better job than a brush or hot water with less mess.  </li>
            <li> A Q-tip will clear the clog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A clear winner.</li>
            <li> I had to drop one star because it does not do the upper lip very well nor does it clip the hairs up near the nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I went back to the 320 and found that it gave me a shave that was nearly as close, and possibly no worse than the 790 but without the pain.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t pay too much attention to the front page reviews with like 1000 plus people wow&#x27;ing and fawning over this product.  </li>
            <li> Being in the military I didnt want to purchase a shaver that couldnt get a smooth enough shave and be out $200.</li>
            <li> the digital screen on the shaver doesn&#x27;t include more than battery and hygiene meter, and i believe the hygiene meter is only depend on the operating time not really hygiene meter.</li>
            <li> so it is just a showoff screen that doesn&#x27;t include old features like when did you change the foil and cutter.</li>
            <li> and i wish that Braun to include it on the screen like old modules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;ve had since the early 2000&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> did have to take a start away because the cleaning system does not use as much of the cleaner as my last before replacing the cartridge</li>
            <li> the only problem I had was buying the whole kit to get the shaver.</li>
            <li> Old one was six years old and still worked</li>
            <li> Boy I feel old.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a old Philips Arcitec.  </li>
            <li> I upgraded from a 5+ year old Braun 390 razor.  </li>
            <li> I get ingrown hairs as a result of shaving, and this has eliminated them almost completely.</li>
            <li> I want to be in and out in about a minute, which I had no problem with my old Phillips Norelco XL Shaver.  </li>
            <li> I ended up buying a Safety Razor because no electric razor came close to the shaving experience of old fashioned shaving.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t possibly get as closer shave as the safety razors, which takes much longer and requires some skills.</li>
            <li> If you ensure you&#x27;re going directly against the grain, combined with a couple of passes, you will get those pesky hairs wiped out.</li>
            <li> It also handles a couple days of stubble with no trouble at all.</li>
            <li> I have a medium beard and somewhat sensitive neck.  </li>
            <li> Had an early version of this shaver that lasted for 12 years.</li>
            <li> It even worked well after nearly a month without shaving.</li>
            <li> (If I shave in the morning and go out at night I have to shave again) and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect here but was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I have a Braun shaver that is 7 years old</li>
            <li> I initially was a bit put off by spending so much on a shaver, but do not regret the purchase at all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate his sensitive skin like his old one had.</li>
            <li> Also you can plug the cord directly into the razor to recharge.</li>
            <li> This razor is very noisy, rattleing like it is going to fall apart any second.  </li>
            <li> but it was getting old and not providing the shave I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a lot of electric razors but this razor has given me the closest shave so far.</li>
            <li> And, it is quieter than my 10-year old Braun.  </li>
            <li> old now, I have never been a fan of any electric razor even though I have tried a couple over the years.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver after my old 7000 series gave up the ghost.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is a step up from the old one</li>
            <li> I am now on my second 7 series and my wife just ordered me my third one as a back up because the battery after many years is starting to show signs of losing its charge but still shaving well</li>
            <li> This is the very first time this has ever happened with any other electric shaver I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> and wow,</li>
            <li> So far this razor has met all expectations i had for it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t wow me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If i did not pay a lot for this thing and if my old trimmer didn&#x27;t die one me, I would return it.</li>
            <li> I prefer my old Philips.</li>
            <li> Wow, a bit pricey</li>
            <li> No point in upgrading whatsoever if your old &amp; trusted shaver is still working.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of electric shavers, I have a weird beard growing pattern on the neck area below the jawbone, so most of them do not work perfectly, this still is not perfect but with shaving in different angles!</li>
            <li> After one head change the finish on the pivoting head is flaking off, the locking function broke, then the locking button completely broke</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s pretty minor.</li>
            <li> replaced my old braun razor.</li>
            <li> However, it still shaves so he is still using the old one.  </li>
            <li> my old one retired, and I&#x27;m not looking back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First one I had was a &amp;#34;Sixtant&amp;#34; that I had some one bring over from Europe long before they went on sale here.</li>
            <li> I upgraded from an old Panasonic and thought I would give Braun a try.</li>
            <li> Since my old Braun bit the dust</li>
            <li> Its all ready to go the next time you need</li>
            <li> I would sell mine that I used twice so far, and not to shave my pubes yet for 150$.  Message me</li>
            <li> It works well on my seventy-two year old face.</li>
            <li> Naturally, I read the reviews here and elsewhere before purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> Got this to replace my old Series 3 shaver which died on me.  </li>
            <li> I bought this on sale to replace my 8 year old series 6.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning cycle is loud.</li>
            <li> Has it totally replaced my use of straight razors?</li>
            <li> Never thought in my lifetime I would spend this much money on a shaver, finally bit the bullet based on reviews and purchased the Braun Series 7...</li>
            <li> but issues with shaving fast enough?</li>
            <li> Given the oppurtunity I would buy the old modle.</li>
            <li> Cleaning unit seems to function well so far.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier -- so far -- with this.</li>
            <li> This Braun shaving system is, by far, the finest piece of machinery I&#x27;ve ever handled in my life.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The 3 different settings work very well.</li>
            <li> The pulsonic action of this model provides a quicker and easier shave.  </li>
            <li> and have learned to much prefer the Braun product in its various incarnations.</li>
            <li> Compared to my old Braun model #5414 this shaver is a delight.  </li>
            <li> I plugged the charger directly into the razor; still nothing.  </li>
            <li> Amazon refuses return/replacement because this item is &amp;#34;hazmat.&amp;#34; (thanks for the short end of the stick, Amazon.)</li>
            <li> After just a short time owning it, I no longer get a very close shave.</li>
            <li> I use Nivea mens sensitive post shave balm that I got at Walmart for 6$</li>
            <li> I am also very pleasantly surprised by the way it shaves.</li>
            <li> It works well, is quiet, and gives a very close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Phyllis</li>
            <li> recently began shaving my head, and went to a barber to get a straight razor shave.</li>
            <li> used multiple electric razors before and never had any issues  but for sure  this one is not fit for everyone .&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try to come back and update after a few more months, but all in all I am please with how it has performed.</li>
            <li> The base does a wonderful job cleaning &amp; maintaining the shaver.</li>
            <li> cleaning base is awesome</li>
            <li> My beard is fairly thick, so if I let it go for more than 2-3 days</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, all modern electric shavers are going to deliver the goods, albeit some may be more irritating to the face/neck than others.</li>
            <li> The automatic cleaning system base is simply superb.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this just does not do a good job.  </li>
            <li> Have used prior versions of this shaver/cleaner-base from Braun and was very pleased; the only reason I bought this one was because my previous model finally died after five years.</li>
            <li> I like the shave mostly, but i am surprised to not hear more complaints about this, but the trimmer is next to useless!</li>
            <li> The Braun 7-799cc meet my expectations as one of the top electric shavers for African American men with hair that curls back or lay flat.</li>
            <li> This is my second after my first had lost most of its &amp;#34;umph&amp;#34;  and the battery is weak.</li>
            <li> I have a passion for electric shavers and when a new shaver comes out, I generally have to try it.</li>
            <li> Let dry for 5 minutes and start shaving the neck first.</li>
            <li> The lithium-ion battery level indicator was barely changed following the shave so if for some reason I didn&#x27;t have power available to charge the shaver I expect that I&#x27;d be able to get quite a few shaves out of it even with my heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> I just remove the head, blast it with hot water in the kitchen sink, let it dry and put electric shaver lubricant on it before I use it.</li>
            <li> The base is bulky and takes up precious bathroom space, but it&#x27;s worth it knowing that the razor is clean and</li>
            <li> The indicator never shows less than a full charge.</li>
            <li> I then put it back together and dry it off with a quick blast with my hair dryer.</li>
            <li> and it dries down to a powdery finish quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of electric shavers over the past 25 years, including several Brauns, and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> cleaning really works, and the fluid leaves a pleasant smell on the cutting</li>
            <li> /&gt;Prior to buying this shaver, I had an older model Braun (similar foil system to 790)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I was pleased at how close a shave I could get (with some practice), but disappointed in how many passes over my face I have to do.  </li>
            <li> than rebuilding my older razor, I have to say this will be the last Braun that I will purchase, as the quality is not there anymore.  </li>
            <li> I finally got one as a Christmas present and let me be the first to say that this shaver is all it is cracked up to be.</li>
            <li> I shave once a day, it usually can last 1 month or more before recharging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had experience with lesser models of Braun in years past and they have performed OK but still would give me razor burn.</li>
            <li> Not as quiet as a rotary but quieter than Panasonic and older Bruan models.</li>
            <li> Overall, decent.</li>
            <li> This time the box is different from the other two, it was not the original box from the factory.</li>
            <li> Every electric shaver I have ever used, except this one, always occasionally stung and pinched, particularly when shaving the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty stuck here, back to regular shaving</li>
            <li> I first got one of the Phillips Norelco circular shavers but due to my thick hair it took me 20 minutes or more to shave.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s not necessary to use the cleaning solution after each use, there are other ways to clean it.</li>
            <li> I recently saw this Braun and the high reviews and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> my experience of trying out various high priced electric shavers, this shaver gives the closest shave&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried electric razors in the past (specifically, rotary Norelco razors) but they always left too much stubble on my face and were a pain to clean and charge.</li>
            <li> I will use my old case from my last Braun Shaver for traveling with the new 7 series shaver.  </li>
            <li> As expected there is no way the shaver head will last 18 months before needing to be changed, unless you do not want a quick close shave.  </li>
            <li> the lather causes the whiskers to lie flat), Wet, they caused excess irritation, and dry, they get hotter than a clothing iron; more irritation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As long as you used it every 3-4 days it will work very well.  </li>
            <li> It works very well and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very convenient and now I tend to have shaved face all week long as it is not a hassle to get a shave like when I was using a razor.</li>
            <li> I shaved last night, nearly 20 hours ago and my beard has only grown in as much as it does the day after a blade shave, if that.</li>
            <li> I have used blades for roughly 20 years and this is my first electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> My early 90’s Braun version was better equipped to handle this delicate but necessary chore.</li>
            <li> Other cool features are digital screen, variable shaving sensitivity but not necessity.</li>
            <li> how full the reservoir is you have to remove the shaver for a few seconds and re-insert it</li>
            <li> Good shaver, little noisy, hard to just recharge without the cleaning process.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I very much like the look and feel of the 7-series, its gizmos like the extra indicator lights and a somewhat more advanced base, but in terms of &amp;#34;core&amp;#34; functionality it adds no value over the 5-series.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found my bumps have subsided, and I experience little or no irritation (though it takes more time than rotary or wet</li>
            <li> it says it is super dirty and wants a full cleaning.</li>
            <li> I only charge the shaver when the batter runs down and at that time I get out the unit, plug it in, load the cartridge and clean it.  </li>
            <li> To cut down on the expense of the Braun cleaning cartridges, I tried a larger refill but the liquid doesn&#x27;t seem to clean or lubricate it as well as the Braun cartridges.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with this item because I had high hopes for a great shave.  </li>
            <li> main differences between the Panasonic and the Braun shavers are: Braun is slightly faster and a full battery charge is enough for about 6 to 7 shaves whereas, Panasonic lasts only for about 3 to 4 shaves.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While some say it is noisy, I don&#x27;t think it is substantially different to other shavers that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty quick to shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i will probably use this for the next 5 years, unless a new breakthrouh happens in electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:</li>
            <li> and i will probably use this for the next 5 years, unless a new breakthrouh happens in electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:</li>
            <li> The cleaning system keeps it next to brand new.</li>
            <li> gap is much smaller on the new foil.</li>
            <li> My previous version were both 3 series shavers and the diffference between them and the 7 series is worth the added cost.</li>
            <li> Very weight, reflects the German manufacturing skills, but the noise is too big, shaving no PHILPS province strength</li>
            <li> OMG, I did not know what I was missing, Close, comfortable and, yes, got extra kisses from my bride of 48 years...</li>
            <li> I then dry my face and quickly run the Braun in dry mode over my face again.</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s a decent shave all around, and the only ones who will likely notice the difference (besides me) will be my 10 month old and my wife.</li>
            <li> but you really need to run it over your face several times in different ways to catch 95% of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> I shave everyday and this thing is quick and convenient.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and i break out on my neck region with regular razors.</li>
            <li> is literally throwing away a couple hundred bucks, and no one wants to do that without exercising every single option beforehand.  </li>
            <li> I can gurantee that no other electric shavers can come close to this BRAUN shaver.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare it to any other electric shavers because I haven&#x27;t tried them, but for those interested in switching from blades this might be helpful.  </li>
            <li> I looked at all of the major brands of electric razors and choose from the customer recommendations.</li>
            <li> I have two major complaints with this razor.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty bummed I received a product that seems defective, and due to shipping policies, I cannot return the item for a refund.  </li>
            <li> No other shaver would work on my neck.</li>
            <li> soft long moustache cant shave very clear</li>
            <li> Clean water is little, never enough to use, function is lacking</li>
            <li> and I can adjust the power level down for a more concentrated less aggravated feel.</li>
            <li> The linear motion required to get an even shave is less natural than the circular motion of the Norelco and seems to require more attention to keep from missing a spot.</li>
            <li> I tried many other brands and even a few rotary style.</li>
            <li> Although it is a little work the results are well worth it.</li>
            <li> your through shaving your skin is smooth.no problem with razor burn .a little bit over priced but well worth</li>
            <li> Little pricey but worth it.  </li>
            <li> more difficult with the main shaving head.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to any body rather you just start shaving or been shaving for long time.</li>
            <li> It is important to change the cleaning solution and change the head, as it does get dull after about six months.  </li>
            <li> general</li>
            <li> It cleans and generally maintains itself</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t shave your head, and aren&#x27;t shaving peach fuzz, I suspect that this complaint isn&#x27;t relevant to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Replaced my 10-year old Braun and the technical advancement is apparent.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning cycle is loud for ~ 2 minutes, then the rest of it is silent.  </li>
            <li> After two years of use, painting around the shaver head began to peel off, probably by action of the cleaning fluid.</li>
            <li> I NEVER PLANNED OR EXPECTED TO SPEND AS MUCH FOR AN ELECTRIC RAZOR.  </li>
            <li> I NEVER PLANNED OR EXPECTED TO SPEND AS MUCH FOR AN ELECTRIC RAZOR.</li>
            <li> I had an early generation one and finally upgraded after 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> no complaints except the charger/cleaner is big and loud.  </li>
            <li> Loud, made increasing noises, didn&#x27;t cut close starting @ around 6 months of use!!</li>
            <li> As a result of the bumps I developed (while still using an electric shaver), I engaged in extensive experimentation with both rotary, foil and blade razors, and I think the reader will find that, as diverse as our faces are, so will your results vary.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No regrets here...</li>
            <li> I had a Braun very similar to this that was going on 10 years  old.  </li>
            <li> Keep in mind that the 320 head was several months old at this point.  </li>
            <li> no regrets.  </li>
            <li> This model is noisier than my old Shaver, but no big deal.</li>
            <li> Two days growth it may hang or pull if you&#x27;re not careful with it.</li>
            <li> After about a month and a few weeks, I can see a few hairs in the paper filter underneath but it seems to be functioning very well still, and the lemony smell is fantastic in the morning.</li>
            <li> but when a guy like me with sensitive skin can go over areas multiple times, not feel ANY burning after and get a close shave that rivals some of</li>
            <li> Apparently, there have been issues with this razor holding a charge, and issues with the dock.  </li>
            <li> I finally bought a replacement for my old Braun shaver.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic needs a charge to operate apparently.  </li>
            <li> It probably works better with the people with thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not cheap but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The self cleaning feature is nice but expensive.</li>
            <li> This used to be a major problem for me with electric shavers and in particular with the Norelco rotary types which would rub my skin raw trying to get a reasonably close shave.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions for the shaved (use trimmer to trim down longer hair, pull.skin when shaving, etc.) and got razor bumps after my first use.</li>
            <li> but I will definitely try new technologies in future</li>
            <li> This unit is more expensive than other razors, but I feel like it&#x27;s worth the premium.  </li>
            <li> Just one pass of up and down , left and right</li>
            <li> It just does not hold a charge as long and I wanted to try something new.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this system especially if it keeps performing as it has so far!</li>
            <li> but this is the exact same shaver, except the other one is waterproof.</li>
            <li> but as usual it is not that clean as a regular razor</li>
            <li> Little pricey but much better/closer shave than my old Remington.</li>
            <li> /&gt;BTW, does anyone have any other recommendations for a quality straight foil razor?</li>
            <li> Sharp and fast.  </li>
            <li> He previously used Norelco but they just didn&#x27;t last long and he messed up when he tried to clean the blades.  </li>
            <li> It toggles up to stand straight out from the OTHER SIDE of the razor.</li>
            <li> The only problem is, its likely to last about 20 yrs and once the new cooler shaver comes out you wont have a reason to buy it</li>
            <li> cutting is quick and clean.</li>
            <li> On the front of your neck, you have to go over the same spot in different angles for the hair to completely come off.</li>
            <li> Gave it only 4.5 because I miss the trimmer being near the end of the shaver instead of the middle.  </li>
            <li> This does a fine job of knocking down a day&#x27;s growth or less.</li>
            <li> Although the Series 7 shouldn&#x27;t be used in the shower due to the cord plug-in area possibly getting water in it you certainly can use it over the sink.</li>
            <li> The cleaning process is so easy with the base, kits are perhaps expensive for lasting a month if you clean it everyday but its very easy to self clean if you want too.</li>
            <li> The base used a cartridge filled with alcohol to clean the foils and it estimates that one cartridge could last between one and a half to two months if you clean the foils every day like the manual</li>
            <li> My first purchase was actually a Phillips aqua touch that cost about half the price .</li>
            <li> have tried a few different types of razors for black men to help with razor bumps and skin irritation and after a while I ended up back with magic shave.  </li>
            <li> As someone with very sensitive skin (so sensitive that it gets red from one pass of other electric shavers I&#x27;ve tried), this is a god send.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also takes up too much counter space and just not worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed a couple of flaws so far, with regards to the cleaning process, both of which are minor.</li>
            <li> And if this one lasts as much as my old one did, it pays off in the long run.</li>
            <li> I waited far too long to make this purchase.  </li>
            <li> :  Adjustable shaving system for sensitive to not sensitive skin conditions.  </li>
            <li> A few notes  first off like my model five</li>
            <li> My previous 360/5-series has lasted me a long time, been repaired once and kept right on truckin&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Once again I called the main customer service who said send it back to the service center.  </li>
            <li> cuz when i received old one the clean and renew part is broken</li>
            <li> The first one lasted about 10 years, which just died recently, causing me to purchase this one and handing down my four year old (same basic model, only in white) system to my teenage son.  </li>
            <li> Have used for only a short time, but so far has worked as advertised  I especially like the cleaning feature and the design that allows cleaning and charging in the same stand.</li>
            <li> I kept with this shaver for so long because my chest and neck are sensitive, so once I find a razor that doesn&#x27;t constantly give me razor bumps in those areas, I stick with it.</li>
            <li> it last as long as my old one.</li>
            <li> It is adequate for using on the sideburns, but really clumsy for the moustache (my case), as the shaving head obscures the view in the mirror.</li>
            <li> Bear in mind that I have relatively fine hair, and I can&#x27;t imagine how anybody with a tough beard could use this shaver.  </li>
            <li> After reading various reviews and comments about the Braun Series 7-790cc, I decided to give this foil shaver a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing the Braun Series 7-7900cc to other models I would recommend it highly over both the Panasonic Arc3 and Arc4, with the Panasonic Arc3 the runner up.  </li>
            <li> It took a longer time to shave, but with the Braun Series 7 it is taking at least more then 60% less time.</li>
            <li> The cleaner works well and last much longer than the previous models.</li>
            <li> In general you will find that it takes at least three weeks for your face to adjust to the new shaver so persevere and do not go back and forth with your older razor/shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver here based on many positive feedback but the hygiene indicator was already bad on arrival.</li>
            <li> It worked ok, but never liked it like my previous Braun, it still worked but, had to switch back to Braun.</li>
            <li> base is also an improvement over the 5-series - holds a shaver more positively, has better contact with the charging terminals on the shaver, less likely to loose contact due to the agitation during the cleaning cycles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This model delivers a very close shave with little effort.</li>
            <li> It will take a little while to get used too as it shaves very close.</li>
            <li> and this does a decent job of trimming it down.</li>
            <li> not worth the high dollar cost</li>
            <li> What a huge waste of my time!!!</li>
            <li> I am hoping this new Braun will function for several years as well as my other shaver has.</li>
            <li> The burn died down considerably, HOWEVER!!-</li>
            <li> Too bad, this is a good machine.</li>
            <li> Although a DE shaved me well, it was time consuming, painful on occasion, a nd because of all the hot water and hot cream needed to shave it would make me sweat sometimes haha which would irritate me further and basically ruin my morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It may be useful to point out that my beard is second to none in terms of being thick and wiry.</li>
            <li> My 5 star rating is relative to other electric shavers, as I would prefer to wet shave with a safety razor, but certain areas of face just refuse to tolerate</li>
            <li> It is also hard to shave in hot weather when my skin is not entirely dry.  </li>
            <li> My old razor out preformed it and did not have to use any cleaner just plain old water.</li>
            <li> I had to take medicines extensively both internal and on externally on skin to clear those spots due to the skin infection caused by it .&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping my 10+ year old other Braun just because its trimmer is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, locking mechanism for shaving head broke after a couple of weeks (quality German engineering, anyone?)</li>
            <li> Clean up is expensive and if you have sensitive skin do NOT buy...</li>
            <li> Shaving the neck, particularly just below my jaw line, proves to be difficult.</li>
            <li> I have had no problems with other aspects of the razor and cleaning system so far.</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s given me the closest shaves of any of the other shavers that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning fluid doesn&#x27;t last long and needs to be replaced every 1-2 months.&lt;br /&gt;Replacement cleaning fluid can be costly over life of razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the money.battery last long enough for me to shave my face and head with lots left.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally disappointed with the way its been complicated to use…i knew many people might have given good review but its not user friendly…</li>
            <li> It was nice for a few years, but I began experimenting with countless pre-shaves,(I tired of the dry itchy feeling) which may have been the catalyst for my bumps, (or the shaver was beginning to age?)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its a little high</li>
            <li> I took my old razor and did  one side of my face (Rotary) and did the other half with my new Braun.</li>
            <li> If things change further down the road with this shaver I will update my review but based on my personal experience with Braun products I would indeed be quite surprised to discover it to be a dud.  </li>
            <li> you will notice that the chance for your skin for irritating is so less comparing to old modules that needs a lot of time you move back and force the shaving machine over your skin.&lt;br /&gt;- Advanced foil and cutter that really try to catch every small tiny hair and cut it.</li>
            <li> Well the mirror finally broke and I am too lazy to go through the whole routine of washing, lathering, shaving and cleaning up.</li>
            <li> Never the less, the cleaning base really does a good job on cleaning the blade and saves me from wasting time cleaning.</li>
            <li> My wife gave my first one at least ten years ago, but the switch started giving me problems.</li>
            <li> It does not seem likely to last as long as the razor lptobably will.</li>
            <li> First, it had a more stable base to sit in</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive face that is subject to in grown hairs.</li>
            <li> Besides the overpricing, the only down side so far is I wish there was a way to disassemble the shave head for easier cleaning under a water faucet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a pretty hard reviewer.  </li>
            <li> This razor&#x27;s very long life is shown by the fact I shave my whole head with it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Shave first, shower, wait for my face to dry, and feel for small beard areas that could use an even quicker touch-up with the Braun.</li>
            <li> I expected a much closer shave with a lot less work.</li>
            <li> Three cleaning cartridges run about $20 so a single will run about $7 and last you one month &amp;#34;if&amp;#34; you use the cleaning module on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> If I have no stubble to knock down first it takes me a min and a half.</li>
            <li> I have not used again so expensive razor, it really is not the same value for money,Scratch is very clean, nothing left.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensative to razors and in the past, others have caused razor bumps.  </li>
            <li> I accepted a long time ago that I would never get the same shave from an electric as a blade</li>
            <li> I have not had the system long enough to warrant five stars and in my mind there is always room for improvement.</li>
            <li> I contorted my face and stretched out the skin and shaved in different directions to no avail.  </li>
            <li> And such long battery life.</li>
            <li> , the battery last a long time.</li>
            <li> The problem with the latter is that you&#x27;ll continue to shave too long in order to achieve that baby butt smoothness and this will result in irritation.</li>
            <li> Doubt it will last long.</li>
            <li> last part felt long winded</li>
            <li> My only real gripe is with the cleaning base, it is noisy and I am not too confident in the job it does.</li>
            <li> I ready other reviews which mentioned Braun being bought by another company and the quality going down</li>
            <li> It takes me about 3 mins to shave down my stubble and have a completely shaven face.</li>
            <li> little harder to clean manually than I would have expected (as when you are on a trip), but very satisfied with the automatic cleaning done by the re-charging base.</li>
            <li> My reason for 4 stars instead of five is simply the light gauge display is not bright as my previous Braun shaver ...</li>
            <li> Like new everyday.  </li>
            <li> I tend to buy a new razor every few years because the replacement heads just don&#x27;t seem to be up to par with the ones that come with the razor itself.</li>
            <li> the battery can last very long.</li>
            <li> : I have a bit of a cow-lick on my neck and some of the whiskers lay very flat against my skin.  </li>
            <li> I only use it for dry shaving anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> only dry</li>
            <li> My old Philips was faster and skipped less.</li>
            <li> I have all kinds of crazy whorls in my beard on my neck and this razor is able to closely shave these areas without having to move the razor in 8 different directions.  </li>
            <li> Previously had a Braun that was about 10+ years old.</li>
            <li> The Braun 7 is what I expected from German engineering with a solid design and close shave.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;After a few months of using this shaver, I went back to my old Panasonic.</li>
            <li> how long it would last if I took it on a long trip.</li>
            <li> The docking station is a bit loud when cleaning the razor, but the audible part of the cleaning lasts for only a few seconds.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was tired of paying $30 plus dollars a month on razor blades and needed a better solution to this costly problem of having to shave everyday for work.</li>
            <li> charging base is heating up the alcohol it uses to clean itself which seems like it makes the unit use it up quickly.  </li>
            <li> The drag is so much less using the razor due to the Braun being used first.</li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t realize those uses were only going to be limited to 4 times.  </li>
            <li> Instructions for use of the cleaning module are not very clear.</li>
            <li> I seriously doubt any electric shaver will get to be as close as a regular shave, but this one certainly does not.</li>
            <li> I am pretty proficient at using electric razors, and this one is seriously faster than anything I have used before, but it is nowhere close to a blade.</li>
            <li> The other obvious ongoing cost is the replacement of the cutter/comb head which doesn&#x27;t last forever and is recommended to be replaced every 18 months.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to ever build up, so I&#x27;m guessing some of the hair doesn&#x27;t get washed down and gets stuck there, then the next cleaning cycle washes that down, but some of the newly shaved hair gets stuck in its place.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to ever build up, so I&#x27;m guessing some of the hair doesn&#x27;t get washed down and gets stuck there, then the next cleaning cycle washes that down, but some of the newly shaved hair gets stuck in its place.</li>
            <li> I had an older version of this razor and bought this as a replacement once that one finally broke (after at least 7 years I&#x27;ll add).</li>
            <li> For such an expensive razor I wanted a little more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s honestly amazing nothing bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> Although the trimmer works well, it&#x27;s a bit more awkward located there.</li>
            <li> It is obviously a cheap fake version.</li>
            <li> Holds charge for long time.  </li>
            <li> can shave my neck and face with this razor, as long as I had shaved the day before, within 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> The shaver was returned promptly but was not fixed.  </li>
            <li> If I want an equivalently close shave it takes me 4 times as long with the electric.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had done it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> My life long blade shaver and can of shaving cream have been relegated to under-sink storage.</li>
            <li> I been wanting one of these shavers for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t know how long to use.</li>
            <li> I expected big things having read all the glowing reviews.  </li>
            <li> youll have this shaver for a long , long time to come .</li>
            <li> The head swivel lock broke before long.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ve just been using a razor too long...</li>
            <li> Have used electric shavers for a long time.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve come a long way baby.  </li>
            <li> Read the warning about this fluid carefully.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it that long</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> He waited too long to try it out</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to shave but there is still come stubble.</li>
            <li> shaver is also larger than I expected.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to try electric over razor blade.</li>
            <li> Shaved with Norelco rotary for a long time.  </li>
            <li> but it is convenient and will save me money in the long run&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Been a braun fan a long time...</li>
            <li> I should have bought this long ago, would have saved a lot of time and money.  </li>
            <li> It gives a closer shave with no face burning and the battery lasts for a really long time.  </li>
            <li> Some tips I have learned are: shave 1+ hours after waking up in the morning, use a small amount of baby powder 10 minutes before you start the shave to get skin bone dry, during this 10 minute intermission massage the facial hair against the grain with your hands to lift hairs off the surface of the skin, shave your trouble area first</li>
            <li> The whole unit is heavy and clunsey compaired the the previous model.</li>
            <li> Thus I must shave every couple of days (3 at the outside) or things quickly get uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I grow a thick beard and even after not shaving for a few days this thing cuts it off quickly and without pulling.</li>
            <li> I had the original braun electric razor with self cleaning/recharger and it never did a bad job, in fact the only reason I bought this one, the 7-790cc, was because I couldn&#x27;t find replacement blades for my old one anymore.</li>
            <li> I wish Braun and other electric razor cleaners would develop a cleaning station where the fluid can be capped, or make it easier to empty the fluid into a storage container</li>
            <li> The battery broke and was not able to be replaced, so we searched for a new one.</li>
            <li> why I like the Braun series in the past) is very small and cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I have had it off the charger for a few days, but never long enough to deplete the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> seriously did not find one thing wrong with it, very satisfied with it</li>
            <li> seriously did not find one thing wrong with it, very satisfied with it</li>
            <li> I have used several of the major brands in the past and then purchased the Braun series 5.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for several months and the blades still feel sharp with no pulling.</li>
            <li> For years I have been a DE shaver due to trying to minimize irritation and because of all the fanatics who rave about it on Badger and Blade and similar sites.</li>
            <li> I always do extensive research before buying my shavers, toothbrushes or other electronics.</li>
            <li> a sharp knife from the cuttlery section at target might give you the same result.</li>
            <li> If you like Remington foils or other similar styles, Braun is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple different shaving creams in order to eliminate or even reduce the razor rash on my neck with little luck.</li>
            <li> Also I find the cleaning station to be really loud and it leaves your shaver a little wet when it&#x27;s done.</li>
            <li> These cartridges last about 8 weeks assuming one uses the cleaner every other day or so.</li>
            <li> I have strayed over the years and tried other brands only to always return to the King, just as Bud is the King of beers.</li>
            <li> Looked around, sampled the other big brand with rotating heads, then found this one with a promotion.  </li>
            <li> Not with the occasional whisker or stray fleck that just refuses every other razor and shaver.  </li>
            <li> To shave (as braun recommends) I always hold my skin taught, and with this shaver, I hardly have to put any pressure at all to shave (compared to my older model).</li>
            <li> Awesome shaver!&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing bad I can say about this shaver, it&#x27;s on the expensive side</li>
            <li> If you are going to use it to shave your head, use it before bed or when you wake up, not after you wash you head, you head will be to dry</li>
            <li> but it doesnt matter for me because I just dry my face after, put on lectric shave</li>
            <li> Can shave dry (may or may not matter to you, but it can be convenient when traveling)&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> The Clean &amp; Renew Refills are too expensive.</li>
            <li> Of the 2 months that I have been using this, I&#x27;ve only gotten razor burn on my chest maybe 3 or 4 times, and have not had any on my neck (compared to my old shaver of razor burn on chest &amp; neck at least 1-2 times per week).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an older Braun Series 7 shaver model for at least 6 years.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it came in a box directly from Braun and had we neded to return it for some reason,there was no invoice or packing slip or return instructions in the box at all.  </li>
            <li> The main complaint I have is about the quality of the metal in the shaving head.  </li>
            <li> It comes in second, closely behind a straight razor shave.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have one tiny red bump or irritation the few times I used the razor.  </li>
            <li> It was expensive, but if it lasts as long as my last Braun, it will definitely be worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> He is Jamaican &amp; ever single shaver has bumped him up.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a razor and unless it miraculously wiped the stubble from my face with a single wave of my hand...</li>
            <li> Been shaving with it for two weeks and haven&#x27;t gotten a single ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> I have to shave every single day.</li>
            <li> On a limited income cannot afford scam advertising on an inferior product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping the shaver as it does the job, but I can guarantee you the series 7 will not be with me half as long as the last series 6.  </li>
            <li> little heavy, but the heft is what allows the cutters to remain steady in the cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> policy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shaved half my face with the Braun and the other with my normal razor; hands down the razor was closer.</li>
            <li> I usually get a bit of a burn there from my old Norelco&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I wanted to give a negative rating but there is no negative rating</li>
            <li> 50 years of  shaving always used a blade now old age has made me lazy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s harder to find replacement blades and now the shaver isn&#x27;t keeping the charge as long.  </li>
            <li> Second, I&#x27;ve noticed that within the &amp;#34;well&amp;#34; that the shaver hangs upside down in, after a cleaning process, there is some left over hair that does not get washed down.</li>
            <li> Second, I&#x27;ve noticed that within the &amp;#34;well&amp;#34; that the shaver hangs upside down in, after a cleaning process, there is some left over hair that does not get washed down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does eventually give you a close shave after about 5-10 minutes of slowly back and forth, up and down movements.  </li>
            <li> Finally I buckled down and decided to buy and electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I have whiskers that lay down next to my skin and this razor gets them no problem.</li>
            <li> I particularly like to use it to thin out my beard and then shave it off entirely after I haven&#x27;t shaved for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> use the cleaning solution every other shave, and I close the little pull-tab each time and store the fluid until next time.</li>
            <li> the new head design (well, newer than 25 years ago) actually cuts slightly longer hairs at least as well as the Philips.  </li>
            <li> I have used regular razors with multiple blades which left my skin feeling dried out and stiff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many electric razors, only to be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s price or less will do the same job.</li>
            <li> My 3 previous electric shavers were the Philips Norelco 8000 Series, last Model: 1290X/42 almost $300 bucks.</li>
            <li> I had used two Norelco rotary (tri-head) shavers in the past, but took several years off and used only disposable razors (Mach III - XV, and counting).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked into replacement batteries, but they are pretty expensive for this model, and I know that if I do any fiddling around with the razor&#x27;s battery compartments it will definitely void any warranty I might have.  </li>
            <li> and they had a record of my previous call, but no research had been done; told to call back again in two weeks.</li>
            <li> The other model did not do this, so 4 stars for this minor irritant.</li>
            <li> If you have any hairs that lay flat or if any get a little long, this razor will not pick them up and shave&#x27;em.</li>
            <li> I previously had a Braun 8 series that was over 10 years old and still doing well until the power cord went missing.</li>
            <li> sent this razor to the service center after the first few months and it came back just as bad, if not worse.  </li>
            <li> I gave only three stars because, even with all the bells and whistles of this thing, I still have stubble on my neck and a little on my jaw line.</li>
            <li> face any time soon before shaving (sounds a little grungy; wash after if necessary), and don&#x27;t use any pre-shave.</li>
            <li> The old shaver came with a hard travel case...</li>
            <li> I will report back with a 12 month update or sooner if let down by a failure (not expected)!!</li>
            <li> People said it would be a faster shave with the electric shavers but not with the Phillips Norelco, it was a painful 20 minutes or more shave and than I had to touch up with the blade.</li>
            <li> I had long been a Remington man, but I always had trouble with stray long hairs that needed a blade to get.  </li>
            <li> but at least i  don&#x27;t have to worry about bleeding as i did with my regular razor (especially the head which tends to bleed profusely when nicked).  </li>
            <li> I know that sounds crazy but it really does, I can now go 3 days with no shaving and my facial hair will be the same as if I didn&#x27;t shave for 1 day.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected from an electric razor.</li>
            <li> The head also comes with a switch to lock it into a roughly 90 degree position to make shaving moustaches easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not quite as expected.  </li>
            <li> It lacks the elegance that is expected from Braun products</li>
            <li> Expected a quality product and got one.</li>
            <li> I still give it four stars because it works well, but it just doesn&#x27;t have the quality feel that I expected.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t make the same mistake trying to save a few dollars and upgrade to the Series 7.</li>
            <li> and I will receive a bitter taste.</li>
            <li> No consideration given for the fact that the service center</li>
            <li> It is harder to get the head off of the 7 than the 5.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about dropping a wet shaver in the shower and breaking it.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who was having trouble with skin irritation from his prior electric razor.</li>
            <li> I am careful not to let the part of the head with the hole in it come into contact with my skin, otherwise it will pull and hurt.  </li>
            <li> I left it in a hotel on travel a few years ago</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Panasonics (used them mostly wet, which is counter to how electrics operate...</li>
            <li> This razor gives a very close shave except under the chin, seems to leave behind a bit of stubble.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning system does not work as expected.</li>
            <li> My heavy beard makes it necessary to work at it</li>
            <li> But wet shaving is outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works as well as my old standby 8987 model which is not available any more and the replacement parts are either poorly made or way too expensive.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> The razor is everything i expected.</li>
            <li> only had for a few weeks so will update as required.</li>
            <li> It shaves closely with minimal passes.</li>
            <li> My sons have told me this shaver is such an upgrade from the Braun shavers that I bought for them a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s what we expected.  </li>
            <li> I am Sasquatch, but have not yet explored further areas for this device, but have no doubt that it would destroy any haired area it is applied to.</li>
            <li> I had to laugh because it was just silly to me.</li>
            <li> I do like the wet use of the 3D though -</li>
            <li> A big waste of money for all the features too.  </li>
            <li> I figure it&#x27;s all he expected.</li>
            <li> &gt;  Return Processing Center</li>
            <li> I rarely wet shave anymore.</li>
            <li> We also received it a lot sooner than we expected.</li>
            <li> I believe the alcohol disappears even if you&#x27;re not really using it)</li>
            <li> As a lifelong Remington micro-screen user I decided a change was needed.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 22 year old son who has a thick beard and sensative skin.  </li>
            <li> He has sensitive skin and thick hair.</li>
            <li> I get a little annoyed by the hygiene bar going down so quickly</li>
            <li> About nine (9) years ago I tracked down a Grundig shaver (also long discontinued, but once considered the Mercedes of electric shavers).&lt;br</li>
            <li> After less than one month of use, the shaving head developed a small hole in one end of the foil.  </li>
            <li> The main difference I found between the two is the subjective &amp;#34;look and feel&amp;#34; - the sturdy, heavy and solid 7-series feels like a premium product compared the 5-series which feels &amp;#34;plasticy&amp;#34; in comparison (only in comparison - don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> but right now it is an expensive decoration on my bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes me almost 3 times as long to shave now over my previous razor</li>
            <li> then I go at a very slight angle with the same pressure to get bbs skin with this razor.</li>
            <li> and I also know that I have thick, dark facial hair which definitely makes a difference.</li>
            <li> It was the only one that did not leave my face raw if I got a close shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The razor head lasts about six months, according to the razor&#x27;s indicator, but they actually last at least twice that long.</li>
            <li> I suggest this 7 model as it is the same head and cutting performance as the higher price models.  </li>
            <li> With the new electric razor I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t switch over much earlier.</li>
            <li> One thing I did notice was that a number of people complained about it irritating skin or it not shaving fast enough.</li>
            <li> Among other things, it cut my shaving time in half.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As with other electric shavers.</li>
            <li> , I agree with the videos supporting this and its competition are on point, you can&#x27;t really go wrong.</li>
            <li> I have even used other electric razors that do not deliver what they promise.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the first one sent had a faulty cleaning function, which I didn&#x27;t realize for two months.</li>
            <li> Using Amazon and its suppliers, I&#x27;ve always had a UPS or other labels sent for the return at not cost to me.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the lack of quality now relates to the PG purchase of Braun, but it is obvious that the quality is not there anymore.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Electric razors, on the other hand, leave my face alone, but they don&#x27;t quite to the job a blade does.</li>
            <li> Recommend this over Norelco or other shavers.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first about not having the wet shave option but who needs it when it shaves like this!</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;m not sure what the big fuss is over this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Bought for my husband after our son took his other one.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to tryout Brauns other shavers like the series 1, 3, or 5, but I do know the series 7 790cc model is the one for me and my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no louder then any other shave I&#x27;ve heard.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely noisy but I give five stars anyway.</li>
            <li> He wouldn&#x27;t use any other razor.</li>
            <li> I have had a beard for the past forty some years and as a result have only trimmed.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have read the other 1 star reviews before I bought this razor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why anybody would ever consider shaving with any other device.</li>
            <li> Because the shaver&#x27;s blades cannot be accessed due to the cartridge nature, the cleaning module is a must.</li>
            <li> Also the 3D would leave small nicks from time to time making my neck very red.  </li>
            <li> I just hope that in 9 months it doesn&#x27;t give up the ghost like all the other brands do.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, I plan to use the cleaning cycle once a week and shake out the head/rinse with water</li>
            <li> other days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I remember my husband telling me how much we wanted this because for work he has to shave everyday and his old one just wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore.  </li>
            <li> No more cuts and the shave is close enough.</li>
            <li> The one down side is that it&#x27;s not a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Center foil gets hairs laying down.</li>
            <li> I have a very thick beard and very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> (my previous seven series shaver had the trimmer slide shut mechanism break, would not stay locked closed but still worked).</li>
            <li> The charge only lasts for a short duration and does a poor job of shaving.  </li>
            <li> : I shave by head and this razor does a very poor job consistently shaving the finer hairs of my head.  </li>
            <li> (heavy duty whiskers not a young mans peach fuzz) in less time than it would have taken to shave a 1/4 of my face using the 5.  </li>
            <li> A refill usually lasts me about a month and a half, so I order then in four packs from Amazon which last me six months.</li>
            <li> For the money I spent I expected a unit that would last at least a few years.</li>
            <li> Other then that, that is the only negative.</li>
            <li> I assume the electronics are dumb and just count how long it has been used vs when it was last cleaned using the machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very complicated trying to figure out how to clean it.  </li>
            <li> Even with the addition of the sensitivity options, the cut is the same as the older model, which was a bit disappointing after reading the marketing hype.  </li>
            <li> The razor Head is way to complex, it does not clean well, harder to put it back on, i dont notice an imrovement in shaving ability, and it pulls hair.</li>
            <li> even when i&#x27;d have hardly any stubble it would snag my hair repeatedly to the point it felt like it was pulling my facial out.</li>
            <li> I am someone who needs to shave every day, and on average I shave 6-7 days a week.</li>
            <li> I have tried several electronic razors over the years and never liked them.  </li>
            <li> The quality of shaving is below average.</li>
            <li> it is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Things labeled in the user manual in one location on the shaver were actually on another location.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s confusing to use the charger and washer if you read the manual.</li>
            <li> After using the razor for several weeks, I realized that this is not the case, at least for me.</li>
            <li> Only negative - inadequate trimmer for side burns or nose.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just not worth the risk using a blade razor.  </li>
            <li> Goes at least 2 wks shaving daily</li>
            <li> Not worth the cost for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;e expensive, but I really like what it does.</li>
            <li> Swivel head is less active.</li>
            <li> I thought at least is would have been in a retail store box, instead it was just in a brown shipping box, makes me feel like I got a 2nd hand or re-furbished one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I bought it and really cant recommend the razor</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the cleaner/renewer is a bit noisy.</li>
            <li> not worth the money so save it</li>
            <li> The only negative is the cleaning station&#x27;s ongoing cost.  </li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned Braun does not stand behind their products.</li>
            <li> I love the cleaning base.</li>
            <li> ok, the base would leak everywhere from the cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband to replace his 5-yr old version that was broken.  </li>
            <li> Give it a few tries and then it becomes easier and easier.</li>
            <li> I like the alcohol cleaning system on the Braun much better than the Panasonic soap base cleaning solution</li>
            <li> It was still clearing my thick, Irish-German beard off my face daily without dulling.</li>
            <li> However, due to the fact that I had to get a stem cell transplant and my immune system would be temporarily wiped out, I was told that I should seriously consider using an electric razor to ensure I would not cut or nick my skin and possibly get an infection.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you need to use a trimmer to get the hairs down to a manageable length.</li>
            <li> In my opinion it all comes down to preference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is, hands down.</li>
            <li> Hands down beats the 5 in closeness, speed, and no irritation at all.  </li>
            <li> All it comes down to, is which type of shave head do you prefer.  </li>
            <li> I have ever used hands down.</li>
            <li> I use the Philips Norelco BG2040 for face and down there.</li>
            <li> I just saw where it went down to $145.00.</li>
            <li> The Norelco&#x27;s, the Panasonic&#x27;s, the Braun&#x27;s of the world get close to the skin and often get all the way down</li>
            <li> but, this razor beats it hands down.  </li>
            <li> cuts extremely close!</li>
            <li> I was a little set aside due to a shipping error.</li>
            <li> started out in the lowest setting and found it too weak to properly give anything even remotely close to a shave.</li>
            <li> When that 3rd failure Norelco crapped out, I did the research and came to the conclusion I needed to switch Brands, from Philips Norelco to Braun.</li>
            <li> word of advice, get this on or around black friday, as it will go down about $30 in price.</li>
            <li> Packaging is too crude, such a large company will give the box?</li>
            <li> Feels cheaper than previous models.  </li>
            <li> This razor takes less time to shave.  </li>
            <li> I typically use one and refill it with 100% isopropyl alcohol.</li>
            <li> Probably made by elves in the Black Forest.</li>
            <li> Previously, I used a Panasonic but never got the shave I wanted.</li>
            <li> His face feels smoother, less bumpy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll find out later, how expensive the constant need for refills  will be..  </li>
            <li> Sounds like this may be a typical &amp;#34;cost saving&amp;#34; move on the part of the manufacturer by using inferior metal in the construction of the shaving head.</li>
            <li> I was thinking about another one, but I cabn&#x27;t see spending $200 for a razor when one half</li>
            <li> For that price, that is ridiculous, and I am sending it back.</li>
            <li> Was using rotary shavers previously and this out shines them.  </li>
            <li> you are looking for the smoothest shave with less irritation to the skin, I would recommend that you give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABM</li>
            <li> My shaving time has been cut in half.  </li>
            <li> 5-series, this did not translate into a closer shave, a faster shave, or less skin irritation.</li>
            <li> the fact that my beard had 3 days growth I expected that given my face was not used to this shaver i expected at least some problems in the irritation department.</li>
            <li> Much less skin irritation compared to the razor if used every day.</li>
            <li> My old cheap, terrible, electric razor died and I decided to look for a high-end electric razor.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this razor model is not an improvement over the previous version.</li>
            <li> The hair pulling has never been a problem with previous models, but with this model it is a problem.</li>
            <li> I prefer the previous model.</li>
            <li> Bought for my dad on black friday</li>
            <li> I choose this razor based upon the performance of my previous Braun.</li>
            <li> and I think that is what caused the sensation of a smoother shave with less irritation.</li>
            <li> This Braun replaced the Braun I had for 12 years previously.</li>
            <li> Less shaving fall out on shoulders.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quieter than my previous shaver but the power button is less convenient.</li>
            <li> The stand also feels cheaper than the previous one and doesn&#x27;t let you just drop the shaver in</li>
            <li> Sadly, the fourth time that I used it, all of a sudden, it stopped working.  </li>
            <li> Have used it for 2 days now and it blows away my previous shavers.</li>
            <li> Slight annoyance that after 4-5 shaves</li>
            <li> I previously owned a Norelco, a Remington, and a Braun.  </li>
            <li> This thing did the job in less time, with less mess, with almost a blade razor closeness.  </li>
            <li> It takes him less time to shave, and he doesn&#x27;t have to mess with shaving cream or clean-up, so it&#x27;s a win-win.</li>
            <li> how long they are.&lt;br /&gt;Sounds cheesy, but I&#x27;m serious - its really that nice.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The left behind hairs are mostly tiny or hard to get neckline hairs</li>
            <li> It even gets the little hairs that typically get away with my previous model.</li>
            <li> minor complaint</li>
            <li> But the packing is really a mess.</li>
            <li> My husband said, &amp;#34;makes a mess though&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> very sharp and cleaned clearly.but noisy,a little bit too aloud</li>
            <li> I shave against the grain in slow long strokes</li>
            <li> I expect Amazon will investigate this matter and provide me a correct self-cleaning base unit to replace the &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; cheap imitation thud.</li>
            <li> Really tight shave</li>
            <li> , I never seen my beard so tight, not even with</li>
            <li> My base system was also broken out of the box and does not pull fluid up to the razor to clean it, it just charges and vibrates dry.  </li>
            <li> , the previous chargers do not fit this model.</li>
            <li> The biggest and only complaint I have is that it doesnt give a close shave like my past</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t get little hairs all over the sink because the &amp;#34;housing unit&amp;#34; cleans it all for him.</li>
            <li> Although the norelco did cut a little smoother around the neck area.</li>
            <li> little noisy, but not so that it bothers me.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> but a little bit expensisive</li>
            <li> that the cleaning pods need to be replaced monthly (they can cost as little as $5) and the razor cartridge needs to be replaced every 18 months.</li>
            <li> , yes, I&#x27;m disappointed that I spent $200, and all I got was something equivalent to what I already had and that is now 4 years old for a third of the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but a little noisy.</li>
            <li> It also seems to be a little quieter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I know its a little pricey</li>
            <li> : The cleaner is a little louder than I would like</li>
            <li> Cleaning is a little pain in the butt even with the cleaning kit.</li>
            <li> , how little I repeated the area or use of a lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I once had a little triple foil Remington that would blow this thing away, and at one fifth the cost.  </li>
            <li> Little to NO beard hair pulling.  </li>
            <li> After using this razor for several months I have to say it sucks!</li>
            <li> The razor takes a little getting used to so give it 1 month before you decide to return it.</li>
            <li> Little did I know that the 790, besides the 3 shaving modes, had another surprise for me.</li>
            <li> no burning face....smooth skin for about 2 days before it feels a little stubbly......</li>
            <li> It is not a great way to start the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun has been less than helpful, simply saying the foil is not covered by the warranty.  </li>
            <li> Just got and it mowed down a 6 day beard!</li>
            <li> I have very thick facial hair</li>
            <li> but I am getting out my anger and frustration in this post while trying to remain calm and collected....</li>
            <li> Inconvenient to carry the whole body when travelling longer term.</li>
            <li> Shaves like a champ if used everyday.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps this is the proper explanation for poor or no display.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard</li>
            <li> Everyday im amazed at how well it shaves me</li>
            <li> even If I have a few days growth.</li>
            <li> I shave everyday and I am somewhat of a perfectionist.</li>
            <li> I can shave everyday without getting the bumps or irritation that I used to get.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for a few months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She likes that it has the cleaning system as well to help sanitize the shaver head, because he does have a few spots/zits at times.</li>
            <li> I bought another head and the identical thing happened after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> The head also shows signs of rust after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> I imagine I will buy again in another few years.</li>
            <li> It cut me a few times and didn&#x27;t help with the razor rash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an expert, but I read from a few people who are, and I have to agree.</li>
            <li> We use this shaver everyday.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband and he now shaves everyday instead of a couple of times a week.  </li>
            <li> not smooth at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased both 7-series Braun (from Amazon) and 5-series (Costco) and been comparing them for a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I would have purchased the 790 even if I had read this, but I would have remembered the reviewer fondly and hated myself for not listening.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this razor for approximately 18 months and use is daily.</li>
            <li> and I do not have a heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered and received a Norelco 4500 and it shaves close in just a few passes and</li>
            <li> I just have a few problems with the Braun design.    </li>
            <li> Heavy duty construction.</li>
            <li> Not cheap</li>
            <li> Try something cheaper and simpler, don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> ; in a few swipes (like a blade razor does).</li>
            <li> and he hasn&#x27;t had to replace the gel thing yet and note that he has been using this everyday and cleans it when the indicator says it needs cleaning.</li>
            <li> the adapter won&#x27;t fit into the self-cleaning base unit.</li>
            <li> Well, I know I had it in the dock charging a few nights before,</li>
            <li> Braun was bought out by P&amp;G a few years ago, and since then, the quality of their replacement cartridges has dropped from 10 out of 10 stars to about 1 star.</li>
            <li> The shaver head lock broke after a few months.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> not a huge leap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> really I think a bottle of isopropyl alcohol next to the shaver could alleviate the need for the cleaning base.</li>
            <li> of the reviews, however, mention that this razor shaves &amp;#34;as close as a blade.&amp;#34; This is total malarky (false).</li>
            <li> It does seem to give me a shave that is close to, but possibly not closer to the much less expensive previously mentioned 320.  </li>
            <li> He shaves in half the time now!</li>
            <li> The status lights on the charger/cleaner base go out afterr a few minutes so to see if it is clean or needs to be cleaned, or</li>
            <li> I got brown 3 series for Christmas, however, I was not happy with the performance, there were flat spots on my face that braun 3 could not handle and had to finish it with the razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a month of using it, this shaver is no better, possibly even worse than the Panasonic for $72.99.</li>
            <li> The cleaning indicator always indicates it needs cleaning, and I think this is a little excessive.</li>
            <li> We tried two less expensive models over the last 2 years to no avail.</li>
            <li> first otherwise it is a painful yank-</li>
            <li> manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Expensive; loud; cleaning fluid is expensive; replacement heads are expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The whole experience is very uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> If you have a thick, dark beard, it doesn&#x27;t shave as well as a razor.</li>
            <li> I hated it for the past few years since I invested so much and should have sent it back when I had the chance.</li>
            <li> Not fatal, but not very handy, either.</li>
            <li> They leave my skin raw, even though the shave is close.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I find too bad is that it requires often to change the dock&#x27;s cartridges (especially for me who sometimes doesn&#x27;t shave for a week.</li>
            <li> He has a very course, tough beard and sensitive skin (bad combination!)</li>
            <li> Close shave with very little irritation.  </li>
            <li> This bad boy shaves plenty fast</li>
            <li> no need to use that small brush anymore.</li>
            <li> I also did try the small factory reset button to see if this would brighten the display, but that didn&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> Gives me a close and  comfy shave but misses small pockets on my neck.  </li>
            <li> I did not get the small cleaning brush with my order.</li>
            <li> Could not believe in a few days I got the brush!</li>
            <li> They designed this with all the bells and whistles and forgot one small detail...  </li>
            <li> and it left me with bumps on my neck and weird dirt streaks.</li>
            <li> Just replace the one I have been using for the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> some people complain about expensive cleaning sollution replacement, but its only aobut $5 per container</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my son who has sever Autism and shaving is not a favorite activity.  </li>
            <li> My husband uses this everyday, he loves it!</li>
            <li> There is no more need for a blade.</li>
            <li> No more nicks or ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> Never used Braun in the past</li>
            <li> I have noticed I always keep the speed at its highest setting, so that parts pointless to me but ymmv.</li>
            <li> but there still some stray hairs which I usually use  tweezers to pull out.</li>
            <li> Every shaver I have had in the past except for Braun, (Remington, Norelco, Panasonic, etc.) has irritated my skin in areas of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also the battery lasts forever, at least a month of everyday use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons of different style electric  shavers and brands to only be disappointed time and time again.</li>
            <li> No more razor burn or irritation  </li>
            <li> so I figured I would stick to what worked in the past.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything, if not more, than you would want in an electric shave.  </li>
            <li> I have owned Braun&#x27;s in the past, as well as Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I have used Gillette razors all my life and whenever I have tried to use an electric razors in the past, I always ended up returning them.</li>
            <li> Feeling guilty when it shows unhygienic (hygiene indicator always in red as I am not using the cleaning reservoir).</li>
            <li> but it was past the return policy period.  </li>
            <li> It even relubes the shaver which is something that in the past I have neglected with my shears and things like that.</li>
            <li> the past</li>
            <li> do you can&#x27;t see what you are trimming, absolutely the worst shaver ever had, a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> No more rashes or cuts.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how that would happen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too lazy to return it though for a fully functioning 5 star unit.</li>
            <li> I have been exclusively using Braun shavers for past 15 years.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the charging  unit or the shaver itself.</li>
            <li> I used electric shavers in the past (Norelco) but had swiched off to using blades for a decade or so.  </li>
            <li> This razor is no better than any $30 dollar shaver you can find..</li>
            <li> Unbelievable service from the suplier</li>
            <li> And razor burn is a thing of the past.  </li>
            <li> As I started to try and figure things out  I realized that the razor was not holding a charge and was completely dead!  </li>
            <li> (3) the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; are too small to be of practical trimming use.</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard and it is tough for a shave to last all day.  </li>
            <li> I have a very heavy beard</li>
            <li> I read all the positive reviews and took the bait, but am disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been working this shaver hard the past 10 days and to get a shave quite close to that of a razor it does take some time.</li>
            <li> Shave is good quality; the trimmer is poor quality and is rather useless: (1) pops out of the side of the unit rather awkwardly, as compared to previous Braun products where it pops up adjacent to shave head; (2) is too narrow, and</li>
            <li> Only down fall is that it doesn&#x27;t swivel from side to side making some neck hair almost impossible to reach.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally take the time to write reviews on amazon products, but this one is so bad that I felt obligated to.</li>
            <li> Sorry I waited so long to order it.</li>
            <li> I mean the cutting edge is facing directly away from your line of sight in the mirror and it totally hidden behind the razor.</li>
            <li> Overall, I was very disappointed and will simply live with the longer shave time on the norelco unit.</li>
            <li> hygiene meter is a little silly - it goes down rapidly based on shaving time.</li>
            <li> is the start button needs to be pressed extremely hard for it to start</li>
            <li> If  you press too hard</li>
            <li> The reason it did not make 5 starts is I have a lil hard time getting the hair by my Adams apple.</li>
            <li> The trick to using this razor is a combination of using the &amp;#34;intensity&amp;#34; level that works for you and pressing somewhat hard for a close shave.</li>
            <li> Con is the larger size of the base station for cleaning which is difficult to store under the sink or cabinet when not in use because the instructions state to not tip it over very far or</li>
            <li> I have to shave everyday as I have a tough beard.</li>
            <li> I do not tell you this is not a good razor, but be aware, that if you didn&#x27;t like it, or even if you received it broken, or with a bad battery, you CANNOT RETURN IT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the speed settings, locking the head, etc., and I can&#x27;t get rid of at least some visible stubble.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I expected from a Braun except that the trimmer is difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I would not own another shaver.</li>
            <li> Had I known, I would not have ordered, at least not at the price I paid.  </li>
            <li> let my negative paragraph steer you away from this razor</li>
            <li> The foil shaver also cuts closer (for me, at least) than rotary shavers did.</li>
            <li> Not one complaint during close contact with the wife and extended family</li>
            <li> and I had to at least give 1 *</li>
            <li> and I can do it in the car if I&#x27;m running late.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that I would not get a replacement that would meet the same standards.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that I, the user have no say in the length or duration of the cleaning cycle.</li>
            <li> I read some negative reviews and invariably they reveal one thing: ignorance of the shaving process so permit me to share a bit of what I&#x27;ve learned.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suppose I&#x27;ll never own an electric that can cut as close as a manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They dropped the price by almost 25% recently which was a disappointment....</li>
            <li> I found the smell terrible, but worse, it took all the finish off the furniture and marble top that it spilled onto.</li>
            <li> ove shaving at least 5 days a week</li>
            <li> Its been at least 5-6 months since he&#x27;s had</li>
            <li> (at least in the circles I run).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think I have had for at least 15 years</li>
            <li> I have a lot of thick hair on my face, so it does pull often.</li>
            <li> Consider yourself warned, if you have thick hair</li>
            <li> I did not like being forced to pay for the self cleaning unit.</li>
            <li> I have a thick bear</li>
            <li> . Slow.  </li>
            <li> The charging base works well and is very convenient.</li>
            <li> The cleaning base is very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do have a thick beard and use this every night</li>
            <li> I have thick beard on my neck and this razor struggles to shave it,  </li>
            <li> I do not have a thick beard.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed that none of the new shavers offered an improvement over my 12-year-old Braun 7505 in terms ofspeed or quality of the shave.</li>
            <li> I do mean ZERO.</li>
            <li> No, I still use razors from an online place that costs about a dollar, to shave, and is a club, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> As for the shaver it has worked flawlessly, no razor burn, no beard pull and it shows my tough grey hairs no mercy.</li>
            <li> One of the few shavers that pulls hair when they are bit long, painful and makes me nervous with every shave.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning system does to Braun hands down, the Panasonic&#x27;s system is bad, smelly and just not very convenient (there&#x27;s a tank where you have to watch water levels, the replaceable cleaning cartridge just doesn&#x27;t seem sanitary</li>
            <li> The cleaning base feels cheaper, seems to go through the fluid cartridge quicker, and doesn&#x27;t do as well at cleaning itself down in the shaver well.</li>
            <li> the cleaning machine/ charging base works well to leave the razor head feeling like new.  </li>
            <li> The base is nice and it varies the length of cleaning and charging based on the hygiene and battery meter at the base of the razor.</li>
            <li> The series 3 solved that problem but didn&#x27;t give as close a shave as my less expensive Remington.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;(Incidentally, it&#x27;s a bit less expensive from Walmart.)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> /&gt;battery is very poor compared to my previous Philips</li>
            <li> Blades were close but left painful nicks,  ingrown hair bumps, and were a hassle.</li>
            <li> This is painful and to be avoided if possible.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d found that Braun foil shavers were not good with longer hairs - so if I went a couple of days without shaving I&#x27;d have to use a blade.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t uncomfortable or too heavy to hold, but is quite long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I plug the power cord from the base directly into the shaver for charging.</li>
            <li> Big nasty ugly bumps which I was trying to avoid in the first place.</li>
            <li> cause I hated to waste the time... now, I can&#x27;t get enough of this razor....</li>
            <li> This thing is too weak too shave my head.  </li>
            <li> It seems to tick down based off of times used, rather than how dirty the system is.  </li>
            <li> Who ever is talking sh*t about this shaver is just a tough critic.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!!!  </li>
            <li> The trimmer comes out in a weird way that it is hard to shave with because it either makes you get al of you hair everywhere or on your hands.</li>
            <li> Although it dies give a close shave in some areas, the shaver has a tough time shaving my face above my jaw bone too, which is annoying.</li>
            <li> It is expensive and the maintenance is a bit annoying compared to the old non-fluid reservoir models.  </li>
            <li> This is absolutely the worst Braun shaver (out of 3)</li>
            <li> It is beyond my comprehension who the idiot was that desided to locate the trimmer in the middle of the razor, you can&#x27;t see what your trimming when used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*It never once came close to irritating my skin&lt;</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone tired of buying razor blades for $30</li>
            <li> Works as well as advertised and for the least expensive price I found anywhere.</li>
            <li> I becomes much worse if I skip a day of shaving.  </li>
            <li> It was crap, didn&#x27;t last a year...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric razors for 20+ years and upgrade every 2-3 years, reason being razors get tired</li>
            <li> (no question about the performance) but unnecessarily bulky and hygienic-focussed.</li>
            <li> Once you have put the cleaning fluid in the charger base, you can&#x27;t pack it in a suitcase.</li>
            <li> And it has a worse trimmer than the 5.&lt;br</li>
            <li> To make matter&#x27;s worse, the unit stopped powering up after just after my 4th use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It seems to count the on/off cycles to determine the depth of the cleaning cycle which is a poor way to determine in my book.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re going to end up irritating your face and neck.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to replace another Braun razor I had used for approximately five years.  </li>
            <li> the package is poor...</li>
            <li> and you do not have to get oil all over everything and do a poor job of lubricating everything.</li>
            <li> Provides an extremely poor shave, does not cut close at all</li>
            <li> It is uncomfortable due to often pulling rather than cutting.</li>
            <li> I have tried other electric razors in the past and with my very heavy beard they have failed miserably!</li>
            <li> The reason I would not give this 5 stars is that it is not a perfectly smooth shave and the battery meter is not lit, almost impossible to read unless you turn the shaver on off in a well lit room.</li>
            <li> I still have to stretch the skin and press very hard to get anything resembling a close shave! - against the grain, with the grain, perpendicular to the grain...</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and will be sending back to Braun for a refund.</li>
            <li> Bad for thick hair.</li>
            <li> Was a bit skeptical about electric shavers.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the item stopped charging after 6 weeks of usage.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately sometimes the taste.</li>
            <li> almost creates a blind spot.</li>
            <li> I am sorry that I did not buy this one sooner.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> no cutter plastic cover provided and overly complicated.</li>
            <li> The cutting block has been changed and does a poor job around any curves (your face).  </li>
            <li> Awful shaver especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Sorry I didn&#x27;t purchase years ago.</li>
            <li> That said, even if you compromise with the Series 5, you won&#x27;t go wrong there either.</li>
            <li> But the maintenance is a bit complicated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Can be difficult to shave the neck and some &#x27;tricky&#x27; spots.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, I admit it.  </li>
            <li> The Philips shaver is designed to be used in a rotary motion;  I find this difficult to do whilst holding my skin taut.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re expensive and irritated my face.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Some people argue that using the cleaning module is too expensive but here is my take on that.</li>
            <li> No matter what angle I shave with, I&#x27;m unable to shave all the whiskers in this area.</li>
            <li> electric shaver is expensive.</li>
            <li> I like this shaver, but is is somewhat expensive.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is expensive, but</li>
            <li> Not impressed with the packaging it came in.</li>
            <li> Gentlemen, this is not an expensive shaver.  </li>
            <li> I have provided two photo attachments of the fake to this e-mail.</li>
            <li> This was expensive and I&#x27;m upset.</li>
            <li> Skeptical of using an electric razor????????</li>
            <li> Sorry I didn&#x27;t buy another Philip Norelco.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical, even with all the reviews and recommendations.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Firstly, I must clarify that I have a very tough and fast-growing beard.</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a bad shaver, it just means it is way overpriced.</li>
            <li> The position of the trimmer is very poor ... cannot see the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Shaver was very irritating to my skin.</li>
            <li> The charger was broken badly, however the box was undamaged.</li>
            <li> I am a tough critic when it comes to shavers, but this one has not been a disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> Not a reason for me to be unhappy.</li>
            <li> Cutting edge features.</li>
            <li> It is just a awkward design.</li>
            <li> This tool just seemed to vibrate the beard off rather than cutting it off.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s awkward to use on my moustache that way.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a horrible experience with one of the philips&#x27; electric razors a few years ago</li>
            <li> shaves you&#x27;ve done and not how dirty it is.    </li>
            <li> docking station is a bit bulky and the power cord juts awkwardly out of the outlet when plugged in, but not intolerably</li>
            <li> one disappointing thing about this system is that the \\&quot;hygiene status indicator\\&quot; always shows that the razor needs cleaning, even immediately after a cleaning session.  </li>
            <li> and it is disappointing.</li>
            <li> I would say this isn&#x27;t a bad razor</li>
            <li> Product came to us with a bad battery.  </li>
            <li> Head lock button is the biggest risk, just get on the bad</li>
            <li> Not that bad, just a surprise.    </li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about this razor.</li>
            <li> It really is so bad that I thought that I had gotten a refurb or used razor.  </li>
            <li> I guess my Panasonics aren&#x27;t so bad after all.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is in a bad location on the shaver.</li>
            <li> So painful that I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> i was so frustrated with it</li>
            <li> It will pull on your beard hairs and be so painful that it literally cannot be used.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the pop up trimmer .Swings  up and out.</li>
            <li> After being disappointed by the (made in China)</li>
            <li> Still leaves hair in sink though. :-(</li>
            <li> you get it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have had electric razors before an been disappointed with the closeness of the shave...</li>
            <li> disappointed in the shave  </li>
            <li> My husband is so disappointed with the shaver.  </li>
            <li> Trust me and get it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> you have to use it in very awkward angles to see what you are doing.</li>
            <li> Very bad customer service added to the bad quality makes me extremely disappointed with Braun.</li>
            <li> This shaver is well made and the cleaning/charging base seemed to work well.</li>
            <li> razor also comes with a base that charges and cleans the foils.</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t even think about skimping by getting the version without the base -</li>
            <li> The cleaning base works well.  </li>
            <li> Put it on the base and let it do its thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt; - Cost to replace the cleaning</li>
            <li> If I could do it over again, I would pass on the cleaning base.</li>
            <li> Just pass on the fancy cleaning base, because thats all it is, fancy.</li>
            <li> :  Rinse the shaver before putting it in the cleaning/charging base -- otherwise, minced hairs can clog the opening where the cleaning solution enters the washing chamber.  </li>
            <li> The base station makes a world of difference.</li>
            <li> hate shaving with a blade.</li>
            <li> think my face will hate me if I ever downgrade.</li>
            <li> The charging base is well constructed and the cleaning solution doesn&#x27;t leak while its cleaning the shaver.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t hate me for dissing it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I like the way you can set it in the base and</li>
            <li> The cleaning base does take up a lot of room.</li>
            <li> It is all about 9\\&quot; tall, but if you put it in a cabinet, you will need about 10.5\\&quot; to get it in and out of the base.    </li>
            <li> I have stopped using the cleaning base.</li>
            <li> Of course the indicator always says it needs cleaning because the base is what resets it.</li>
            <li> The cleaning system measures when the shaver needs cleaning and the shaver recharges in the base while the system cleans the shaver heads.  </li>
            <li> and I hate shaving.</li>
            <li> , I used to hate having to shower/shave before going out after work or on a weekend.</li>
            <li> The shaver works, however, it came with a self-cleaning base unit but it doesn&#x27;t look like the picture in your e-mail and</li>
            <li> Baffling and hugely annoying.</li>
            <li> The cleaning base works well, and</li>
            <li> The shaver head does not lock well and now has an annoying vibration.</li>
            <li> In a very bad spot on shaver.</li>
            <li> If I let my beard grow for a couple of days the shaving head grabs and pinches whiskers making for a very painful shave.</li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>
            <li> I felt very disappointed.</li>
            <li> this is just stupid!</li>
            <li> The charging/cleaning cradle is rather noisy and annoying; however we expect to get used to it!</li>
            <li> I got were horrible.</li>
            <li> Then they changed the replacement blades which are terrible.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Inevitably this results in terrible shaving rash.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product was terribly damaged when i opened it.</li>
            <li> i have used braun razors for 30 years and this is the worst.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I expected the best and got it.</li>
            <li> Awesome, clean, charge and sanitize all in one step!</li>
            <li> Shaves like a champ if used everyday.  I have a lot of thick hair on my face, so it does pull often. Not what I expected from an electric razor. Consider yourself warned, if you have thick hair and you don&#x27;t shave daily, it will pull your hair.</li>
            <li> Does a great job for my son.</li>
            <li> This shaver is well made and the cleaning/charging base seemed to work well. However, it was rougher on my skin than my old Panasonic and did not give me a better shave.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the worst Braun shaver (out of 3) I have ever owned. If I let my beard grow for a couple of days the shaving head grabs and pinches whiskers making for a very painful shave. Additionally it is very difficultt to get a close shave with this system. It is beyond my comprehension who the idiot was that desided to locate the trimmer in the middle of the razor, you can&#x27;t see what your trimming when used. And it does not do a good job of trimming either.</li>
            <li> Shaving takes a longer time and the shaver leaves stubbles. However, I am overall satisfied eith this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product gives a nice close shave quickly. The base does a wonderful job cleaning &amp; maintaining the shaver.</li>
            <li> I have been using a cheaper but well rated Panasonic shaver for several years, but I decided to try an upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I went from a Toyota to BMW. Among other things, it cut my shaving time in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is great: it goes a week without a charge when I travel, no problem.</li>
            <li> The best portable electric saver on the market</li>
            <li> Husband says it shaves well but he sometimes has difficulty getting a close shave.  Note that this is the first electric shaver he has used in over 45 years - so there is a learning curve.  He does use it daily, tho, and enjoys the ease it provides when shaving. He certainly does like the ease of cleaning!</li>
            <li> This shaver works just great!  A closer and cut free shave  :-)</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the electric shaver because of its ease of use. It however does not provide as close a shave as a straight edge. Not a reason for me to be unhappy.</li>
            <li> Great shaver. Was nervous switching from rotary to foil, but this shaver has exceeded all expectations. No razor burn, even around my neck area. The self-cleaning and charging station is fantastic. I would definitely recommend this shaver to anyone looking for a great electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I have been a blade user for decades now as have always considered that the best way to get a close shave. Well the ever rising cost of blades pushed me to try an electric option. Have been using the Series -7900cc for the past couple of months now and am very satisfied. An additional plus is that it is easy on my skin and the former constant redness in neck caused by a blade has gone away too. Not all faces are the same, but for me this is a very good product.</li>
            <li> Really nice appliance - well balanced in the hand, shaves very close &amp; leaves face feeling as if a razor did the cutting.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the higher price for such a well-manufactured product.</li>
            <li> This is the nicest electric razor I have owned.Had it for 5 days and it feels really good and shaves my face with heavy whiskers wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Bought this for husband&#x27;s birthday and he loves it! It does takes a lot of swipes to get everything but it leaves his face so nice! He loves the way the blades are on this one versus the circular blade razors.</li>
            <li> Great shaver. Gives a nice shave.</li>
            <li> After one month the head swivel broke</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from Amazon about 2 weeks ago now. I have tried other electric razors in the past and with my very heavy beard they have failed miserably! I have researched electric razors for months and finally decided to buy the Braun 790 series. Well I have to admit that I 100% agree with most of the reviews here. It definitely exceeded my expectations as it is easy to use, easy to clean, and most importantly gives me a great shave. Of course is NOT as close as a razor, but it is darn close! The only way I know is not as close as a razor is when I feel my face with my hands, but to the naked eye it looks the same.&lt;br /&gt;The self cleaning system is great as I just place it back on the base and it cleans and recharges itself automatically. For all of those skeptics like me, if you don&#x27;t have unreasonable expectations (like close as a shave) you will be very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product. and it really came with strong engine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advantage:&lt;br /&gt;- a really strong and fast engine that speed up your shaving time. you will notice that the chance for your skin for irritating is so less comparing to old modules that needs a lot of time you move back and force the shaving machine over your skin.&lt;br /&gt;- Advanced foil and cutter that really try to catch every small tiny hair and cut it. you will be amazed how smooth your face it.&lt;br /&gt;- changeable speed. this feature i always like. it is good to shave the sensitive parts of your face.&lt;br /&gt;- washable head parts. no need to use that small brush anymore. you can simply wash those parts under the tap water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;br /&gt;- there was a digital countdown in previous modules that shows how many minutes it require for finish the cleaning process. this module miss this feature.&lt;br /&gt;- the digital screen on the shaver doesn&#x27;t include more than battery and hygiene meter, and i believe the hygiene meter is only depend on the operating time not really hygiene meter. so it is just a showoff screen that doesn&#x27;t include old features like when did you change the foil and cutter. or some nice features like how many minutes you spent for your last shave. i really miss those features and i wish that Braun to include it on the screen like old modules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in general this shaver can work perfectly as what is made to do: &amp;#34;Shaving&amp;#34; but it doesn&#x27;t have any smart features.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor because I was 1) hoping to make shaving easier in the morning, 2) hoping to save money on razor blades, and 3) because it was recommended to me by a friend. Overall, the razor is good but it just can&#x27;t compete with a traditional razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First let me say that I know a traditional blade is always better and I also know that I have thick, dark facial hair which definitely makes a difference. I had hoped this razor would be able to overcome this but if I shave at 7:00 in the morning I have stubble by about 3:30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself is comfortable to hold and to shave with, though. It comes with three settings designed to give either a gentle, normal, or close shave. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference between either of the settings and even on the close shave I can&#x27;t seem to get more than six hours out of a shave, compared to eight to ten with a traditional razor. The head also comes with a switch to lock it into a roughly 90 degree position to make shaving moustaches easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor also comes with a base that charges and cleans the foils. The base is nice and it varies the length of cleaning and charging based on the hygiene and battery meter at the base of the razor. The base used a cartridge filled with alcohol to clean the foils and it estimates that one cartridge could last between one and a half to two months if you clean the foils every day like the manual recommends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all said and done I would say this isn&#x27;t a bad razor but if you have darker or thicker facial hair and need or want a clean shave that will last all day then you should probably look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Yes, never in a million years did I think I would pay this much for a shaver.  But after too many years of trying too many &amp;#34;shavers&amp;#34; that simply wouldn&#x27;t do the whole job - beard, stray hairs, trimming - I broke down and used a gift card, cash back dollars and my credit card to buy this wonderful device.  It is only perfect.  Everywhere on my face is smooth, there are no more gray straggles that refuse to be cut, my sideburns are straight and with my bride&#x27;s help I keep a well trimmed look around my neck.  And don&#x27;t even think about skimping by getting the version without the base - that keeps it clean, sanitized and smelling nice while sitting on your nightstand.  We should all give our selves a treat every once in a while - gp ahead and do it.</li>
            <li> Great razor and amazing customer service from Amazon</li>
            <li> Works great. Haven&#x27;t had an electric for awhile.  Top of the line.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver I have used/owned after using blades for over 50 years. I like it!  I&#x27;ve experienced no pulling and it is fast and comfortable.  As long as you used it every 3-4 days it will work very well.  Longer than 4 days and you need to use a trimmer to get the hairs down to a manageable length. It works very well and holds a charge for a long time. That&#x27;s just what I wanted.  Easy to clean, too.  I highly recommend this shaver</li>
            <li> First, I bought this off walmart.com, because at the time, with rebates, it was about $40 cheaper. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case at the time of writing this review (about 2 months after I bought the shaver).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to buying this shaver, I had an older model Braun (similar foil system to 790) that I&#x27;ve had since the early 2000&#x27;s. I kept with this shaver for so long because my chest and neck are sensitive, so once I find a razor that doesn&#x27;t constantly give me razor bumps in those areas, I stick with it. I was hesitant about upgrading to a newer model, and had read lots of reviews about the 790cc model being good for people with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From day one, I&#x27;ve had no issues with this razor. To shave (as braun recommends) I always hold my skin taught, and with this shaver, I hardly have to put any pressure at all to shave (compared to my older model). I have been using this for almost 2 months now, with excellent results. It is able to get a close shave that lasts throughout the day.  Of the 2 months that I have been using this, I&#x27;ve only gotten razor burn on my chest maybe 3 or 4 times, and have not had any on my neck (compared to my old shaver of razor burn on chest &amp; neck at least 1-2 times per week). I couldn&#x27;t be happier with those results. I am someone who needs to shave every day, and on average I shave 6-7 days a week. The cleaner cartridge lasted me about 5 weeks before I had my first change (which was simple, and quick). As for actual cleaning, it is simple and automated, you just push a button to initiate the cleaning cycle (which seems to last around 30-40 minutes, although the actual cleaning part where the shaver turns on and off, and makes noise lasts maybe 5-10 minutes, and I suspect the rest of the time is drying the shaver, which is silent).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed a couple of flaws so far, with regards to the cleaning process, both of which are minor. First, the self cleaning process seems to do a good job at cleaning the razor blades, and foil, but does not clean the outer part of the foil (the plastic parts of either side of the foils). Not a big deal, occasionally, simply wetting a finger and wiping it across the plastic parts cleans it off easily. Second, I&#x27;ve noticed that within the &amp;#34;well&amp;#34; that the shaver hangs upside down in, after a cleaning process, there is some left over hair that does not get washed down. Doesn&#x27;t seem to affect anything, the shaver still seems clean, runs smoothly the next use, and the next cleaning cycle works just fine. It doesn&#x27;t seem to ever build up, so I&#x27;m guessing some of the hair doesn&#x27;t get washed down and gets stuck there, then the next cleaning cycle washes that down, but some of the newly shaved hair gets stuck in its place. Again, it doesn&#x27;t seem to affect anything, and never seems to increase in amount. I guess i was just surprised when I first discovered this (about 1 month into using the shaver). Thirdly, if you use the pop-up sideburns shaver part, that is not cleaned by the auto-self-cleaner, and has to be manually done. I rarely use this, so its not too much a concern to me.or blades, and foil, but does not clean the outer part of the foil (the plastic parts of either side of the foils).

            <li> Perfect electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever had. Truly recomendable item.</li>
            <li> My husband uses it regularly now.  He had to get used to it at first, but is pleased now and so am I!</li>
            <li> I accepted a long time ago that I would never get the same shave from an electric as a blade but this shaver is definitely the best I&#x27;ve ever owned. I gave only three stars because, even with all the bells and whistles of this thing, I still have stubble on my neck and a little on my jaw line. I&#x27;ve tried all the speed settings, locking the head, etc., and I can&#x27;t get rid of at least some visible stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I did not like being forced to pay for the self cleaning unit. I can clean it just fine on my own and all the self cleaning feature does is make extra noise and leave your bathroom smelling like rubbing alcohol. It can plug in and charge on it&#x27;s own so when the cleaning solution that came with the unit runs out I will likely put the self cleaning unit away and not used it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, the Braun gives a better shave from a smaller shaver head than those huge Panasonics and  unwieldy Norelcos. The size is great for traveling and it&#x27;s fairly quiet for a foil electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if I had it to do again, I&#x27;d probably purchase a 5 series rather than spending the extra money on this 7 series</li>
            <li> I love Bruan razors; they are gentle on my baby face. This is my second after my first had lost most of its &amp;#34;umph&amp;#34;  and the battery is weak. And I had that razor about 20 years where now my teenage son uses it. I will have to admit I had to replace the motor and cutter head after I dropped it on a granite counter top, but it still asted 9 years after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have to take a start away because the cleaning system does not use as much of the cleaner as my last before replacing the cartridge, the lock for the mustache mode is not as good, and the trimmer does not seem as rugged and durable. But this is a great razor.</li>
            <li> Good shaver but with some things to be aware of&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1: it will work great where hair are in one direction ( face, cheek bone, mandible area)&lt;br /&gt;2: you will struggle where hair are not in one direction ( neck )&lt;br /&gt;3: lock button is faulty and mostly gets non-functional&lt;br /&gt;4: cleaning system is great and u can refill it with Philips Norelco cleaning fluid which probably has same fluid and is much cheaper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Philips shavers ones may be better, especially the new ones</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an older Braun Series 7 shaver model for at least 6 years. These units are great. My new 7-790cc pleases me as a fine purchase selection. My reason for 4 stars instead of five is simply the light gauge display is not bright as my previous Braun shaver ... I cannot see readings on battery charge or hygiene status. I did notice in the manual that if the shaver is relatively clean and battery fully charged, the status display should be dim. Perhaps this is the proper explanation for poor or no display. I also did try the small factory reset button to see if this would brighten the display, but that didn&#x27;t do it. I&#x27;ve been using the 7-790cc for about a month now, and I actually like it enough even without the display seeming to work. At times I&#x27;ve noticed a dim blinking in the display, so perhaps with increased use it will brighten when the unit is not so clean and charged. IMHO ... for the price of these shavers, a consistent bright and easily seen display should be par. This is a really good shaver!</li>
            <li> The shaver was excellent. the only problem I had was buying the whole kit to get the shaver. Braun  makes great products. Quality is always&lt;br /&gt;excellent.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.......</li>
            <li> Quick delivery &amp; great product.</li>
            <li> This was a birthday gift for my husband .  He loves it.</li>
            <li> So far, it is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I am using electric shaver and I&#x27;m happy compare to manual methods.&lt;br /&gt;It does what I was looking for in an automatic electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Not quite as expected.  Packaging looks like this was a refurb.</li>
            <li> I have been always buying Braun products due to their nice design and the high quality of the product. This one is seemingly cheaply made. It lacks the elegance that is expected from Braun products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not been satisfied with this shaver.  I had been using a much older Braun and a Norelco.  This new Braun just doesn&#x27;t seem to do as good a job as either of my older ones.  In fact, I&#x27;ll shave with this 790 and then finish up with one of my older shavers.  I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard.  I had expected a new shaver at this price would provide a great shaving experience.  For me, it just doesn&#x27;t and this somewhat puzzles me.</li>
            <li> Fast arrival however doesn&#x27;t give a close shave!</li>
            <li> Great Razor shave much better than the cheaper electric razors that are there. I have a heavy beard but I am able to shave every other day with no problem</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband. Everything was excellent. What I expected from a Braun except that the trimmer is difficult to use. In a very bad spot on shaver. Also, no cover for the cleaner section.</li>
            <li> Great razor, my third Braun razor and they get better every time. I am very pleased with the Braun Series as they seem to improve with each series. Would recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
            <li> My husband still prefers his Gillette Fusion, but it is very good in a pinch or in a secondary shave later on in the day.</li>
            <li> Was a bit skeptical about electric shavers.This model delivers a very close shave with little effort.Good job Braun.Shaving is actually enjoyable now.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the item stopped charging after 6 weeks of usage.  FORTUNATELY, the manufacturer provider a replacement!</li>
            <li> I have used the Braun 5000 series. Expected a quality product and got one. Disappointed in the pop up trimmer .Swings  up and out. More cumbersome than the 5000 series which I liked better</li>
            <li> A Fantastic Shaver at a Great Price....  Really Love it....</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with regular blade razors exclusively for 22 years.  I have tried several electronic razors over the years and never liked them.  I decided to try another electric razor in hopes that I would like it and it will help me get out of my house earlier in the morning in an effort to beat traffic to work.  I recently saw this Braun and the high reviews and decided to try it.  It is the best electrical razor I have ever used!!! It cuts close like a razor.  I plan on using this razor on weekdays and use a traditional blade on week-ends.  Try it out!</li>
            <li> Excellent product...closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten with an electric razor!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. My third braun. Old one was six years old and still worked but new one is much closer.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the husband and he is beyond thrilled with it. Shaving used to be a chore and now he looks forward to it.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t get little hairs all over the sink because the &amp;#34;housing unit&amp;#34; cleans it all for him. Housing unit can be a little loud, but not too bothersome and most cycles are quite short. Don&#x27;t get the cleaning solution on your clothes as it will bleach whatever it touches. I wish we&#x27;d purchased this years ago... his life is better for having it.</li>
            <li> This is a Christmas gift for a grandson-in-law. Boy I feel old. Braun razors are the best around.</li>
            <li> This is my 4 Pulsonic. I would not own another shaver. Because it cleans itself after every shave, with alcohol your face does not break out. As with other electric shavers. It will take a little while to get used too as it shaves very close.</li>
            <li> Nice comfortable shave as compared to my last Braun electric. Just thought the beard trimmer (an often used item and why I like the Braun series in the past) is very small and cheaply made. It does not seem likely to last as long as the razor lptobably will. Otherwise a much quieter sand smoother shave.</li>
            <li> This is what i wanted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great shaver. I despise soap and manual razor shaving. This equipment took away that hatred. Not too loud; charge stays for more than a week. Like the travel pouch. I was very sure that I wasn&#x27;t going to use the auto-cleaner option but fell in love with it and had to order refills.</li>
            <li> I have had every type of electric&lt;br /&gt;shaver known.  The Braun series 7 is&lt;br /&gt;the best shaver known.</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard and I get an excellent and close shave with it.</li>
            <li> Very smooth save.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Very good, close shave.  Comfortable to hold, not too loud.  The cleaning base works well.  Really enjoying it.</li>
            <li> Gives me a close and  comfy shave but misses small pockets on my neck.  The  790 is a overall a good value .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loren Tomlin</li>
            <li> very good for sensitive skin, but you don&#x27;t get a very close shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Has it for over a year now, and it still works well.</li>
            <li> My husband says it shaves very good.  The charging/cleaning cradle is rather noisy and annoying; however we expect to get used to it!</li>
            <li> Everytime I use it, it pulls hairs. So painful that I had to stop using it. Braun is sending a new cutter. Will see if that is better.</li>
            <li> (I have only used the system for a couple of weeks so obviously this is a newbie review). This is my first electric shaver and I have to admit I am very impressed and happy with my purchase (I am sixty years old). I have always used a disposable razor and shaved using a fog free mirror as I showered. Well the mirror finally broke and I am too lazy to go through the whole routine of washing, lathering, shaving and cleaning up. I wanted something quick and fast. The shave is a lot closer and more comfortable than I was expecting. No razor burns or irritated skin and just what I wanted fast, quick, easy and no mess. After reading many reviews concerning the cleaning system I have opted to clean the razor once a week and placing the cap on the cleaning solution between razor cleaning which I used once a week. I have read about the homemade cleaning solutions but I think I am going to stick with the manufactures cleaning solution. One extra plus is the manufacturer&#x27;s response. I did not get the small cleaning brush with my order. When I called to request a brush they were very courteous but I still thought I was just another call to disappear in the void. Could not believe in a few days I got the brush! (Thank-you Braun). One point you might want to consider, I opted for the no hassle packing but when I call customer service they request a packing number. I could not find it on the no-hassle packing and as I stated, no cleaning brush with the order. Why four stars? I have not had the system long enough to warrant five stars and in my mind there is always room for improvement. I definitely recommend this system especially if it keeps performing as it has so far!</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a old Philips Arcitec.  Gives a much closer shave and love the cleaning system, always gives the shaver a nice fresh smell.</li>
            <li> a small price for a good article</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband after reading/researching the best electric shaver. This came out on top. He loves it, and I love that his skin is so smooth after shaving with it. My husband said it&#x27;s easy to use, and he loves the self-cleaning feature. It takes him less time to shave, and he doesn&#x27;t have to mess with shaving cream or clean-up, so it&#x27;s a win-win. I&#x27;m interested to see how it holds up over time (we&#x27;ve only had it a week or so) after seeing some of the other reviewers&#x27; issues, but so far, so good!</li>
            <li> Feels cheaper than previous models.  Had I known, I would not have ordered, at least not at the price I paid.  I still give it four stars because it works well, but it just doesn&#x27;t have the quality feel that I expected.  Battery life is great, even for me-  it&#x27;s definitely worth mentioning because I have a tough beard (I have to use 1 quality razor, or 2 cheap razors per shave), and I have to keep going over spots to get everything, but the battery still lasts.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mainly for travel.  I found it provides a very close shave.  The feature I don&#x27;t like is the cleaning unit.  The fluid drys up too quickly.  I wish Braun and other electric razor cleaners would develop a cleaning station where the fluid can be capped, or make it easier to empty the fluid into a storage container so it doesn&#x27;t evaporate so quickly.  Since that is one way for these companies to make their money, I doubt that will ever happen.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great Razor! This is my 3rd Braun over the last 20 years and the best one yet. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This razor gives my husband a really close shave. Only down fall is that it doesn&#x27;t swivel from side to side making some neck hair almost impossible to reach. Loved the quality besides that.</li>
            <li> Works great. Stays charged for weeks.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve bought a lot of electric razors over the years and this one is the best so far.  Shaves close and all the spots without much effort.</li>
            <li> I upgraded from a 5+ year old Braun 390 razor.  I kept that one in good working order by changing the foils and blades every year and cleaning it regularly.  So, I felt like this razor would be an upgrade, but not a huge leap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am writing this review to let everyone know that this razor is great.  I&#x27;m usually a pretty hard reviewer.  I&#x27;ll find Pros and Cons to just about every review to give everyone as honest of a review as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt; + Nice close shave.  Much closer than my Braun 390&lt;br /&gt; + Quicker shave.  This razor takes less time to shave.  It cuts more of the hairs on every pass.&lt;br /&gt; + Noise.  For an electric razor, it&#x27;s pretty quiet.&lt;br /&gt; + Self Cleaning.  Put it on the base and let it do its thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt; - Cost to replace the cleaning cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this razor is worth it&#x27;s price.  This unit is more expensive than other razors, but I feel like it&#x27;s worth the premium.  You will like this razor.</li>
            <li> Incredible razor.  I get ingrown hairs as a result of shaving, and this has eliminated them almost completely.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!!!  P.O.S. electric shaver.  They designed this with all the bells and whistles and forgot one small detail...  It still needs to provide a close shave. I had a nice, simple, Phillips Norelco XL Shaver that provided a nice close shave for years until it finally died.  I mistakenly replaced it with this POS - Braun Series 7 790cc Pulsonic Electric Shaver.  I guess I was sold on all the bells and whistles and the fact that is was really cheap during Black Friday ($129) so I splurged.  Big mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does eventually give you a close shave after about 5-10 minutes of slowly back and forth, up and down movements.  5-10 minutes!!!  I want to be in and out in about a minute, which I had no problem with my old Phillips Norelco XL Shaver.  Most days I just cut the long hairs and reduce everything down to a uniform stubble unless I really want to look nice, then I spend the extra 5-6 minutes to get a close shave.  What a huge waste of my time!!!</li>
            <li> Best Electric shaver I have ever had. Would recommend to everyone that needs one.</li>
            <li> So far so good. My husband is extremely happy with this shaver. He is Jamaican &amp; ever single shaver has bumped him up. He absolutely loves with one and hasn&#x27;t seen a  bump since! Worth the money!!</li>
            <li> Braun has always delivered a shave better than other brands for me. This one still delivers an excellent shave. I don&#x27;t use the cleaning cartridges as recommended. I typically use one and refill it with 100% isopropyl alcohol. It cleans and disinfects just as well as the original cartridge with the added cost savings. When the bottle of Alcohol runs out, that is when I replace the cartridge too. Much cheaper and works just as well with no downside.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews very often but I&#x27;ve been using electric razors for over 20 years and I&#x27;ve never used a razor that shaves this closely.  It&#x27;s also a very comfortable shave.  I&#x27;m only on day 2, so I can&#x27;t comment on reliability or durability, but so far I&#x27;m extremely impressed.</li>
            <li> My huaband loves it. It was a Chritmas present. But, he had researched a lot of them before deciding on this one. It has not disapoitned him. I would recomomend to a friend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good razor, but way too noisy and it really irritated my face. I bought this one after my norelco 1280x would consistently miss hairs and would take forever to get a good shave. The Braun is much faster, but still missed hairs and caused breakouts. Overall, I was very disappointed and will simply live with the longer shave time on the norelco unit.</li>
            <li> Five stars for very smooth shave, but only four for the cleaning module instructions. Cleaning light indicates the shaver requires cleaning after about 3 shaves, but the battery light indicates that it will go a long time before charging is required. I am wondering if this unit will drink cleaning fluid pretty fast. Instructions for use of the cleaning module are not very clear. I had to resort to the Spanish version to figure some things out!</li>
            <li> Works great.  Holds charge for long time.  Best shaver I ever had.</li>
            <li> When I got the item, it&#x27;s already opened box! I bought new one! Not used!</li>
            <li> did not shave close enough</li>
            <li> Easily the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve used.  I shave my head and beard with it and it&#x27;s almost as close as a blade without nicks.</li>
            <li> Lives up to its reputation. Some web site I visited said this electric razor was the best. I have used Norelco shavers for years but the repalacement heads were more expensive than this shaver. Comes with cleaning system at a reasonable price. Love it so far. Will see what my next move is after 18months of use.</li>
            <li> Performs very well. Close shave.</li>
            <li> One of the best razors I ever owned. I have used several of the major brands in the past and then purchased the Braun series 5. I hated it for the past few years since I invested so much and should have sent it back when I had the chance. I swore I would never buy another Braun product but am glad I gave them another chance. The Braun 7 is what I expected from German engineering with a solid design and close shave. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake trying to save a few dollars and upgrade to the Series 7.</li>
            <li> Great shaver for keeping my head shaved, I have tried to use it after the shower to shave my head it didn&#x27;t work well.  If you are going to use it to shave your head, use it before bed or when you wake up, not after you wash you head, you head will be to dry and it won&#x27;t give you a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Almost as close as a blade.</li>
            <li> I received this as a Christmas present and it works great. I&#x27;ve used it for several months and the blades still feel sharp with no pulling. The cleaning function is great and each solution pack lasts me about a month or so with regular use.</li>
            <li> the best razor out there!</li>
            <li> Good shaver.  The closest thing to a razer and it cleans up easy.  Its a little high but it works well.</li>
            <li> It is without a doubt the finest shaving system I have EVER used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a man who needs to shave every day gor work(military), I have been searching for the most comfortable shave. For years I have been a DE shaver due to trying to minimize irritation and because of all the fanatics who rave about it on Badger and Blade and similar sites. Although a DE shaved me well, it was time consuming, painful on occasion, a nd because of all the hot water and hot cream needed to shave it would make me sweat sometimes haha which would irritate me further and basically ruin my morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried straight razors as well. Did not like it at all. I tried 2 bladed cartridge razors. More simple than DE, same discomfort with the problems of a DE, and not as cool haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I was told I am deploying. There are no days off where I can recover from shaving lol. So a stepped into a bed, bath and beyond and bought this shaver for 300 dollars. I was overcharged, but whatever, it was worth it!  I have never had such an effortless shave. Everyday im amazed at how well it shaves me even If I have a few days growth. I have owned the top of the line arc 5 panasonic razor and found it extremely paniful and it left me with bumps on my neck and weird dirt streaks. This thing blows it away. One of the best purchases I have made in my life. I will never shave with anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cant reccomened it enough. I love this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do for my shave is I shower first. Instructions say dont do that but it doesnt matter for me because I just dry my face after, put on lectric shave which drys my now dry face and hair and provides a clean smooth shave. And leaves my face smooth and smelling good.</li>
            <li> Nice razor and it haves well. It pulls every once in a while which I don&#x27;t like. Cleans well and runs nice.</li>
            <li> Just replace the one I have been using for the past 5 years. Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Great product and haven&#x27;t had any issues with it.  Worth the price and the base is very impressive.</li>
            <li> Best Shaver ever owned!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:1e3f0f8092e4346f9a440404dabe6d46]] This review is for the BRAUN SERIES 7 799CC-6WD but this is the exact same shaver, except the other one is waterproof. I only use it for dry shaving anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased many electric shavers over the past years. I shave everyday and I am somewhat of a perfectionist. I ended up buying a Safety Razor because no electric razor came close to the shaving experience of old fashioned shaving. Until now of course. This comes 97% close to be exact. You can&#x27;t possibly get as closer shave as the safety razors, which takes much longer and requires some skills. I can gurantee that no other electric shavers can come close to this BRAUN shaver. I don&#x27;t mind spending money for the best product and i did do that over the years. I have tried the Philips Norelco 1290X, Panasonic ES-LV81-K. This BRAUN series 7 is by far the best. The Norelco came close, but it irritated my skin like many other people. The panasonic was pretty good, but not as good as this one. I love this so much, i haven&#x27;t used my safety razor since i bought this a month ago. I always do extensive research before buying my shavers, toothbrushes or other electronics. Trust me you won&#x27;t regret getting this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets get to the key points:&lt;br /&gt;*From my experience of trying out various high priced electric shavers, this shaver gives the closest shave&lt;br /&gt;*It never once came close to irritating my skin&lt;br /&gt;*THE BEST CLEANING SYSTEM EVER, it feels like im using a new shaver every time and the lemon smell is great. some people complain about expensive cleaning sollution replacement, but its only aobut $5 per container and it lasts two months. You can make it last 6 months if you open the head and let the hair fall out before cleaning and close the plastic lid of the container after using it, so it won&#x27;t evaporate.&lt;br /&gt;*Three modes for people who has sensative skin or sensative areas.&lt;br /&gt;*2 year warranty-great customer service&lt;br /&gt;*The replacement head is cheap - it is only $30 and you need to replace every 18 months&lt;br /&gt;*Battery life is good, i usually put it in the cleaning station after use, which charges as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seriously did not find one thing wrong with it, very satisfied with it and i will probably use this for the next 5 years, unless a new breakthrouh happens in electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: i purchased this from ebay because I was lucky to win a bid.only $30 and you need to replace every 18 months&lt;br /&gt;*Battery life is good, i usually put it in the cleaning station after use, which charges as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seriously did not find one thing wrong with it, very satisfied with it and i will probably use this for the next 5 years, unless a new breakthrouh happens in electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: i purchased this from ebay because I was lucky to win a bid.</li>
            <li> Works great, does a great job for an electric.</li>
            <li> Nice product and works well  Gives a pretty close shave and is easy to use.  I use it for my head and face, I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for about 4 months now, this is my first electric razor. I have a very sensitive face that is subject to in grown hairs. I shave every weekday with this razor. For my sensitive face, this was one of the best decisions I have made.There are plenty of reviews all over the internet, so I will throw in my specific description to my face, and then let the stars do the talking.&lt;br /&gt;I can shave my neck and face with this razor, as long as I had shaved the day before, within 3 minutes. It is plenty fast. at the rate I was going through razors, this thing should have itself paid off. Shaving the neck, particularly just below my jaw line, proves to be difficult. If you ensure you&#x27;re going directly against the grain, combined with a couple of passes, you will get those pesky hairs wiped out. squaring off the sideburns is easy with the trimmer (which works very well), but doesn&#x27;t shave close enough for me. more difficult with the main shaving head. My only real gripe is with the cleaning base, it is noisy and I am not too confident in the job it does. Im sure it sanitizes well, but doesn&#x27;t get all the hair off. The noise might not be an issue for you, but I shave before my wife is up, so I had to move my unit to the guest bathroom. really I think a bottle of isopropyl alcohol next to the shaver could alleviate the need for the cleaning base. I think a better job can be done quickly by popping off the head, rinsing it with hot water, spraying with alcohol, brushing off the motor output area with the provided brush, and popping the head back on. If I could do it over again, I would pass on the cleaning base. refill cartridges aren&#x27;t breaking the bank, but for what I think they are composed of (alcohol, scent, and maybe some anti corrosive lubricants), they are too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let my negative paragraph steer you away from this razor, I agree with the videos supporting this and its competition are on point, you can&#x27;t really go wrong. Just pass on the fancy cleaning base, because thats all it is, fancy.</li>
            <li> Amazing! straight up amazing!</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my son who has sever Autism and shaving is not a favorite activity.  This shaver is fast and very clean on the face and worth the money.  Cuts the shaving time in half from our first Braun shaver when we *first started shaving*.  this is the way to go for a full beard gentleman.  Now all 3 guys in our house have this model.</li>
            <li> Fantastic electric shaver. I have always wanted a clean look and a clean look is what this gives and then some. I have used many methods such as an old fashioned straight razor which left my skin beat up and irritated. I have used regular razors with multiple blades which left my skin feeling dried out and stiff. I have even used other electric razors that do not deliver what they promise. This is by far the best shave I have ever received.  In my opinion it all comes down to preference. No this electric shaver does not get as close as a straight razor, but you cannot tell unless you put my skin follicles under a microscope. It leaves my skin leaving refreshed with a lemony smell. You can tell the fragrance is alcohol based just from the smell and unfortunately sometimes the taste. I go right over my lips to not miss a hair and I will get something to drink right after shaving and I will receive a bitter taste. Other then that, that is the only negative. All in all this is by far the best electric shave I have ever had. Thank you Braun and Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am not getting the close shave I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Best electric shave ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of electric shavers over the past 25 years, including several Brauns, and this one is by far my favorite. I get a close, smooth shave without any nicks or tugging. It also handles a couple days of stubble with no trouble at all. Yes it&#x27;s pricey, but I think it&#x27;s well worth the money. I could not be happier with it.</li>
            <li> First electric razor I have ever used that did no require a blade to clean up my face with.  I have owned several Braun shavers, Remignton and others and never before gotten a full clean shave.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have much luck with electric shavers before. I&#x27;m 54 and this is the first one I&#x27;ve liked after having tried many. I read a lot of reviews and settled on this one and am well pleased with it thus far (about 3 months). The head is supposed to last about 18 months before suggested replacement. It has a self clean feature and the battery is strong.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my dad, and he was THRILLED!!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cool-looking product which has got the best functioning among all the series.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE it!!!</li>
            <li> My husband uses this everyday, he loves it!</li>
            <li> I got this to replace a Braun 8585 (model year 2004). The 8585 still works, but I got this to see if things have improved since 11 years ago. The quality of shave you get is not drastically different. The 790cc is maybe just a tad more powerful, but really, I can&#x27;t tell a big difference. The big improvement over the 8585 is the handle  design which makes the grip much better and improves the maneuverability of the shaver. The battery and cleaning indicator on the shaver itself are welcome features as well. Overall, I highly recommend this product. The price is steep, but Braun quality is worth the investment. And if this one lasts as much as my old one did, it pays off in the long run.</li>
            <li> Closest shave with an electric razor I&#x27;ve every had and the best one I&#x27;ve found for shaving you head. I use it every day and love it.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and comfortable shave, I think it shaves closer than a razor. I love it. The cleaning system is super.</li>
            <li> This shaver is great. It leaves your face feeling very soft and give a good cut. I used to have a Norelco that just died on me after 3 years. This should last longer. Although the norelco did cut a little smoother around the neck area. Also if the vibration and noise bother you do not buy this. It is very noisy and vibrates a lot!</li>
            <li> This thing is great, a lot better than my old series 5. Shaves faster, quiter  and much closer than any electric I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> This razor is exactly what my husband has been looking for. Amazon is great because of the add on suggestions, so also purchased the extra cleaning solution and extra blade so we are set for a while.</li>
            <li> Razor is useful, for a friend I liked it, the price is very favorable, can be used normally in China.</li>
            <li> The best electric I&#x27;ve ever owned and used.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!!&lt;br /&gt; Thanks!  All the men in family got these and they are the best!&lt;br /&gt;We would recommend this system for everyone.</li>
            <li> perfect razor. no complaints</li>
            <li> My last Braun shaver lasted me almost 10 years...this is an excellent shaver.  Close, quick shave.  Shaver is quiet, impressed with the Pulsonic.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a couple of weeks now. My skin is very sensitive and i break out on my neck region with regular razors. I have not had a breakout in the region on my face since using this. I also use aftershave. Would recommend to anyone tired of buying razor blades for $30</li>
            <li> The position of the trimmer is very poor ... cannot see the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Best electric shaver I have ever owned!!  It gives a great close shave and has 3 different settings for the shave you want and I love the hygiene indicator that tells you when to clean it.  All in all it&#x27;s the best shave you will ever get and the money spent to buy it is well worth it!!</li>
            <li> Good for an electric, but it didn&#x27;t shave close enough for me.  I have since taken the plunge and switched to a straight razor, much better level of shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had and used this for over 30 days.  I bought it and am not a rater who has received the product free.  I have a medium beard and somewhat sensitive neck.  I usually get a bit of a burn there from my old Norelco&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Close shave without using any pre-shave stuff, and without skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Self cleaning really works, and the fluid leaves a pleasant smell on the cutting head.&lt;br /&gt;Nicely styled.&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Price - but it is quality, and in this case, you get what you paid for.&lt;br /&gt;A little noisy, but not so that it bothers me.&lt;br /&gt;A little heavy, but the heft is what allows the cutters to remain steady in the cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very good shave after you&#x27;re skin gets used to an electric shaver BUT after three years, the battery&#x27;s in&lt;br /&gt;my Braun would no longer accept a charge. I couldn&#x27;t find replacement batteries anywhere, including the&lt;br /&gt;fifty thousand vendors on the web</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.</li>
            <li> Little pricey but much better/closer shave than my old Remington.</li>
            <li> Had an early version of this shaver that lasted for 12 years. When time to replace it, I thought of trying others, but reviews convinced me that the Braun Series 7-790cc was still the one for me. Unfortunately, the first one sent had a faulty cleaning function, which I didn&#x27;t realize for two months. (I kept wondering why the cleaning fluid container didn&#x27;t run out,)  I contacted PG/Braun and they wanted me to mail, at my cost, the unit to them for repair. Using Amazon and its suppliers, I&#x27;ve always had a UPS or other labels sent for the return at not cost to me. So, I contacted Amazon customer service and they immediately sent a replacement of the whole unit that arrived in two days. The replacement works perfectly and confirmed for me why Amazon Prime is where I go first no matter what I&#x27;m buying -- big or small item, big or small price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine but doesn&#x27;t really give you a close shave.</li>
            <li> shaves better than norelco</li>
            <li> minor complaint but would have preferred a straight edge rather than curved... shaver reasonably quiet... love the 3 speeds... easy to hold and solid</li>
            <li> This is my second Series 7.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I was a blade guy for 40 years and will never go back!</li>
            <li> I have a thick bear and I use to use blades but the bumps and ingrown hairs I got were horrible. A friend recommended to use electric shavers and that really did the trick, it reduce my ingrown hairs by a bunch and eventually they were gone. I first got one of the Phillips Norelco circular shavers but due to my thick hair it took me 20 minutes or more to shave. People said it would be a faster shave with the electric shavers but not with the Phillips Norelco, it was a painful 20 minutes or more shave and than I had to touch up with the blade. It probably works better with the people with thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I got this beast!!!! I shaved in less than 5 minutes now, so is definitely a quick smooth shave, no pain, it&#x27;s like it was meant for my skin and hair. Longer hairs and stubborn hairs are no problem anymore, they are gone in an instant. There is no more need for a blade. I recommend this shaver to anyone. Really tight shave, I never seen my beard so tight, not even with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning base is awesome but, it&#x27;s made out of cheap plastic. Never the less, the cleaning base really does a good job on cleaning the blade and saves me from wasting time cleaning. Best 190 buck I spent.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  It&#x27;s powerful and shaves fast and close.</li>
            <li> Bought as a present for my husband and  he loves it and so do I! Smooth shave!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I use it everyday and it does a great job. The cleaning cycle works really well and the cartridge of cleaner doesn&#x27;t run out as fast as I thought it would. It even worked well after nearly a month without shaving.</li>
            <li> Best ever and with the cleaning system always feels good on your face</li>
            <li> My son loved this item.  We got it at such a great price.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for an earlier model I had enjoyed using for 7 years but wanted a new one.</li>
            <li> I was a rotary shaver fan for decades and I still think they do a good job.  I had avoided &#x27;regular&#x27; electric razors because of the noise.  Then I read a review on Amazon of how quiet the Braun is.  I had also seen a TV show that showed how they are made.  That was enough for me to try the Braun 7 790cc and it is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. It is remarkably smooth.  It has enough adjustments to satisfy just about anyone&#x27;s face so give it a try!  Get the whole package including the cleaner, it works really well.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for about six months now.  It works great.  I have a very heavy beard (If I shave in the morning and go out at night I have to shave again) and sensitive skin.  I was looking for something that would work for my beard and not leave me feeling like I shaved with a piece of glass.  This work perfectly.  I can shave everyday without getting the bumps or irritation that I used to get.  The fact that it cleans itself too is a huge plus.  Great product and highly recommended.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> not worth the high dollar cost</li>
            <li> Arrived in just 4 days after ordering.  Razor works great</li>
            <li> Love this razor so far ... Use it to shave my bald head and it works great!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good as expected</li>
            <li> Great machine.  Close shave every time, and it is effortless.  Keep it in the stand and clean it once daily.  It will automatically charge as needed.  Very powerful, so not very quiet.  The cleaning cycle is loud for ~ 2 minutes, then the rest of it is silent.  Looks and feels great.  Always fresh, clean, and smelling nice because of the cleaning.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have not used again so expensive razor, it really is not the same value for money,Scratch is very clean, nothing left.</li>
            <li> I purchased for my husband.  It was more money than he considered spending, but I was the one who ordered it.  Therefore, I went with this more espensive model -- and he agreed it&#x27;s worth it because it works great.  He said it&#x27;s the best electric shaver he has ever had.</li>
            <li> this is his first braun and he love it</li>
            <li> My husband has sensitive skin and has tried many electric razors.  He says this is the best razor he has ever owned.  It gives him a close quick shave and does not irritate his face.</li>
            <li> Had gone back and forth between blades and electrics for years. Blades were close but left painful nicks,  ingrown hair bumps, and were a hassle. Electrics were noisy and didn&#x27;t do a good job. Last one I had was a Remington and before that a Norelco triple cut. Did a lot of research and the Series 7 kept coming up as the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is, hands down. What I love about it is the closeness of the shave coupled with a complete lack of irritation. The quiet operation, lithium ion battery, and cleaning system are frosting on the cake. Sure, buying the cleaning cartridges is spendy but there are simple ways to refill them yourself or make the factory ones last. That said even if you didn&#x27;t the cleaning system is still worth it because of how clean and new the shaver feels each time it&#x27;s used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ja, German engineering! Probably made by elves in the Black Forest. Seriously, this is one heck of a great shaver. Not cheap but worth every penny. I actually enjoy shaving and look forward to it. The technology is that good.</li>
            <li> Lives up to the hype.  I had a series 3 and almost didn&#x27;t make this investment.  I had long been a Remington man, but I always had trouble with stray long hairs that needed a blade to get.  The series 3 solved that problem but didn&#x27;t give as close a shave as my less expensive Remington.  For a while, I used both and got the perfect shave.  It was a hassle shaving twice, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Series 7 790cc is the permanent fix.  Close as my Remington, No stray hair, faster than anything I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
            <li> Works as well as advertised and for the least expensive price I found anywhere. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Had my series 5 shaver for years and thought it was time to &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34;.  Although the series 7 shaver feels better and more comfortable in my hand, it doesn&#x27;t shave any better.  In fact it &amp;#34;pinches&amp;#34; (actually pulls the whiskers) while using it .... something my series 5 never did.</li>
            <li> My second one; been using these for 10+ years -- and they are great.  No more nicks or ingrown hairs.  Just a nice close shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip 1:  Rinse the shaver before putting it in the cleaning/charging base -- otherwise, minced hairs can clog the opening where the cleaning solution enters the washing chamber.  If it does clog, once in a blue moon, you&#x27;ll see some of the cleaning solution has leaked (it didn&#x27;t have anywhere else to go).  A Q-tip will clear the clog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip 2:  The shaver by itself is really good, but consider using a pre-shave lotion or gel to even further enhance the speed of shaving.  Lectric Shave (or the store brand) is fine, although a little slippery/messy to apply.  Afta makes one that I like; it&#x27;s between a cream and a gel, so easy to smear on and it dries down to a powdery finish quickly.  Pre-shave talcs are good, too.  And all are extra good reasons to observe Tip 1:  Rinse!</li>
            <li> Got this shaver for my son for Christmas.  He used it once and the locking mechanism broke on the shaver head.  We contacted Braun who told us we would have to send it in for service, which we did - at our expense.  The shaver was returned promptly but was not fixed.  Once again I called the main customer service who said send it back to the service center.  No consideration given for the fact that the service center couldn&#x27;t/wouldn&#x27;t fix it the first time.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned Braun does not stand behind their products.</li>
            <li> I owned a previous model and it was amazing.  In fact it was still going strong 6 years later, but I bought this because my old one was looking beat up and I figured the new technology would be better.  Well it still shaves just as well, but this model occasionally grabs my hair in areas if I approach from a certain angle and it hurts.  The other model did not do this, so 4 stars for this minor irritant.</li>
            <li> The quality of shaving is below average. Heavy, noisy with strong vibration.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the fastest and best shave I&#x27;ve had in years.  Previously, I used a Panasonic but never got the shave I wanted.</li>
            <li> nice design. however, the device is very loud and the shaving isn&#x27;t as close as represented in all the reviews. it is not worth the price. a sharp knife from the cuttlery section at target might give you the same result.</li>
            <li> My first time in my life I choose to go with an electric shaver.  Love it, it&#x27;s great...closer shave and with a razor.</li>
            <li> fast, close , comfortable shave</li>
            <li> I have used blades for roughly 20 years and this is my first electric shaver.  I can&#x27;t compare it to any other electric shavers because I haven&#x27;t tried them, but for those interested in switching from blades this might be helpful.  I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for a few months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. I bought an electric shaver primarily because I can take it in my carry-on baggage, on this it indisputably wins.&lt;br /&gt;2. No razor burn. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect here but was pleasantly surprised.  The electric is much easier on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;3. Can shave dry (may or may not matter to you, but it can be convenient when traveling)&lt;br /&gt;4. The trimmer accessory works surprisingly well (I had low expectations just from looking at the photos). Much better for trimming sideburns than a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Slow.  If I want an equivalently close shave it takes me 4 times as long with the electric.  The electric only clips hair when it is passed against the grain.  If you have hair which grows from various directions on a patch of skin, you have to pass the razor over the same spot from many directions to get it all.  Even when you pass over it from the correct direction the razor might not get it on the first pass.  Also, if my beard is longer than 3-4mm I need to do a pass with the trimmer accessory first otherwise it is a painful yank-fest.&lt;br /&gt;2. Cleaning is a nuisance.  I tried cleaning it manually and the built-in display never indicates it is clean unless I run the stand&#x27;s cleaning cycle.  I assume the electronics are dumb and just count how long it has been used vs when it was last cleaned using the machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I was pleased at how close a shave I could get (with some practice), but disappointed in how many passes over my face I have to do.  It is much better than relying on disposable razors when I&#x27;m traveling so I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.  As an added bonus it is much easier on my face than a blade.</li>
            <li> Best electric shaver I have ever owned!!  No burn after shaving.  Easy to use and charge.  The cleaning kit is straight forward and easy to use too.</li>
            <li> Bought this shaver as a gift to my father, but the lock button stopped to work the second time I tested it, and since then the head has problem moving smoothly back and forth. I guess there are some mechanical defect there, contacted Amazon immediately and got a refund. Never used Braun in the past but I really had many hopes before purchasing...</li>
            <li> I like it because now I can shave every day without razor burn.</li>
            <li> it is awsome, i will recommend it to anyone who is considering to buy a shaver. but a little bit expensisive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried electric razors in the past (specifically, rotary Norelco razors) but they always left too much stubble on my face and were a pain to clean and charge. The Series 7 eliminates these problems with an all-in-one stand that cleans, charges and lubricates your razor for you after each use. The foil shaver also cuts closer (for me, at least) than rotary shavers did. It&#x27;s great for travel, too, and comes with a travel case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip that&#x27;s been helpful is to start with whichever part of your beard is the most difficult to shave (for me, it&#x27;s my neck). If you start with the easy stuff, the razor won&#x27;t cut as well by the end of your session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that the cleaning pods need to be replaced monthly (they can cost as little as $5) and the razor cartridge needs to be replaced every 18 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many electric razors, only to be disappointed.  Not this time.  This razor provides an exceptionally close shave.  I rarely use a straight razor any more.  5 stars for this product.</li>
            <li> I believe this is the best cordless shaver out there.</li>
            <li> I have only had it for a month. To date I am extremely happy shaving with this razor. I shave on the way to work as I do a lot of driving. It gets cleaned every three to five days.</li>
            <li> I finally got my husband to go to an electric shaver.  He loves it.  The cleaning feature is good, and it is very easy to disconnect the cord from the cleaning and charging box when traveling. It is important to change the cleaning solution and change the head, as it does get dull after about six months.  It just pops on and off.  I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> I got this about a month ago and finally decided to review it. I am very happy with the shaver - feels like a Braun and cuts well. I stopped short of 5 stars as the pop out trimmer is not as handy as the older units when it came to tidying up my beard - almost creates a blind spot. All in all, I am very happy with it and Braun products after 20 years of use.</li>
            <li> My husband loved his Christmas gift and has used it every day since he got it. He says it is easy and gives him a shave better than his wet shave which is amazing to him. Well worth the money</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my son, who picked this out because of recommendations from friends. He loves it!</li>
            <li> This shaver gives shaving results as advertised.  The shave is fast, smooth and very comfortable.  I have a Braun shaver that is 7 years old and I thought that it performed very good.  I was very surprised as to how much my shave was closer and still felt better than my older Braun shaver.  I am sorry that I did not buy this one sooner.</li>
            <li> This razor is probably the best electric razor I have ever used.  It is well worth it for the price in my opinion.  It cleans and generally maintains itself so you don&#x27;t have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is very clean for me and works great.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Does the job smoothly and comfortably. Cutting edge features.</li>
            <li> Great shaver. Because of time and ease of use, had to switch from blade shaving. Obviously, not as close as a blade, but does get pretty darn close. Plus, the stand with built-in cleaning is great. Makes it an ease to use.</li>
            <li> I have previously used a Norelco 3 head rotary for many years. Switching to this electric shaver has been amazing. I wish I had done it a long time ago. Battery life is excellent, shave quality is far better than Norelco&#x27;s, and the cleaning function is very civilized. I&#x27;m delighted with this product.</li>
            <li> After two years of use, painting around the shaver head began to peel off, probably by action of the cleaning fluid. Having to pay $15-20 for shipping + insurance may not be a good idea for a 2-year old shaver that soon will need to replace the head.</li>
            <li> Great shaver with only one downfall. The trimmer comes out in a weird way that it is hard to shave with because it either makes you get al of you hair everywhere or on your hands. It is just a awkward design. Otherwise everything else is great. Great swivel on the head with great battery life and charger stand. Easy to fill and replace refill. Fits in your hand and looks good.</li>
            <li> Series 7 is not as good a razor as the Series 5 I previously had. It does a good job but does not shave as good as the series 5. It is harder to get the head off of the 7 than the 5.</li>
            <li> The Best electric shaver available on the market. I purchased it to replace a Braun I had for 9-10 years.</li>
            <li> Been using the 7 Series for Many years. Only reason I needed to buy a new one is due to My dropping it to many times and breaking it otherwise it would last me more years!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using blade cartridges for over 40 years.  With the new electric razor I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t switch over much earlier.</li>
            <li> Best electric Shaver!!</li>
            <li> Gives good shave. Long lasting battery - 3-4 times and counting, good for travel too. great replacement for the razors .</li>
            <li> The best I have ever used. Ease of use and a shave as good as any blade. I now use it every day instead of my razor</li>
            <li> I initially was a bit put off by spending so much on a shaver, but do not regret the purchase at all. In fact, this is the best shaver I have ever owned. Period.</li>
            <li> Gives a close shave, convenient, and quick for a electric razor. Con is the larger size of the base station for cleaning which is difficult to store under the sink or cabinet when not in use because the instructions state to not tip it over very far or the cleaning liquid inside may spill.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver!  Had an old Braun shaver and thought it was still great until I happened to purchase this model.  The price is a little steep at around $180-$200, but I think the self-cleaning system and smooth cut is well worth the extra cash, besides, you only get one face so you&#x27;d better take care of it.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver and so far I have no complaints. When I hold this shaver in my hands it feels a durable high end product it comes with the cleaning kit it&#x27;s just perfect.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my husband as a gift - he loves it. Regular razor blade shaving irritates his skin but he hasn&#x27;t used an electric shaver in years because they would pull hair and irritate his skin. He has no problems at all with this shaver, no hair pulling, no irritation. He says he is going to switch from regular razor blade shaving to this because it&#x27;s so good.</li>
            <li> I tried so many electric razors nothing worked well. My skin was so irritated all the time. This is truly the best razor ever. Threw out my manual razor</li>
            <li> The jury is still out</li>
            <li> This was a gift--but no complaints from the recipient. It&#x27;s what he uses exclusively and praises it highly.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his new razor! It doesn&#x27;t irritate his sensitive skin like his old one had.</li>
            <li> very good thank amazon</li>
            <li> Owned the Braun 790 cc-4 for a month. Delighted with how easily, quickly and closely it shaves • Shaving dry is not a problem and requires no healing/soothing/smelly lotion afterwards. I don&#x27;t have to worry about dropping a wet shaver in the shower and breaking it. Shave first, shower, wait for my face to dry, and feel for small beard areas that could use an even quicker touch-up with the Braun. Seems better to shave daily, rather than shaving longer stubble • Cleaning has not been a problem. Use an inexpensive photographer&#x27;s bulb duster, if you have one, to blow stubble from the removed shaving head. Shave three or four times. Remove the plastic cap from the Braun Clean&amp;Renew™ cartridge and easily install in the plastic Station. Push the Station button and it cleans, lubricates and charges the shaver automatically. Remove the cartridge when finished and recap until the next time, so the alcohol doesn&#x27;t evaporate in the interim • Not one complaint during close contact with the wife and extended family • My life long blade shaver and can of shaving cream have been relegated to under-sink storage.</li>
            <li> Wife got this for my christmas present and its very nice! Cleaning action is very nice and works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Very good and long battery life.&lt;br /&gt;Side note:  You do not have to use the elaborate cleaning and charging system. You can just remove the cover and clean it the old fashioned way. Also you can plug the cord directly into the razor to recharge. Your choice.</li>
            <li> I like it ,so good and comfortable. I used it every day. and send another one to my friend ,he like it very much</li>
            <li> Best shaver my boyfriend has ever owned. He shaves his head so I bought this for him because he was nicking his head with razors.  This shaver gets as close a shave as his razor without the cuts.</li>
            <li> I used a Panasonic razor for years that was very similar to this one. Finally I found a replacement and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd Braun Shaver I have had in the last ten years. I keep upgrading and I have always had good results from their products. This is by far the best I&#x27;ve used. My previous version were both 3 series shavers and the diffference between them and the 7 series is worth the added cost. I now get more control, better, quicker charging and the ability to use wet which really improves the shave. recommended</li>
            <li> If you have to shave-----You should use this Shaver.  I have been using for several weeks and the adjustability control allows for the closest shave without irritation.</li>
            <li> This shaver does a great job, but it makes a lot of noise at times in the process.  I avoid the self-cleaning function.</li>
            <li> I dry shave all the time, this baby is PERFECT. skin feels baby smooth every time, I don&#x27;t have to re-hit spots. The cleaning process is so easy with the base, kits are perhaps expensive for lasting a month if you clean it everyday but its very easy to self clean if you want too.</li>
            <li> First off, let me say I really like this shaver in most respects. Fast, efficient, cleans itself, nice trimmer, and holds a charge forever. But I am knocking it because after having two of these now that had the trimmer break right at the 2 year mark (when the warranty is up), I cannot give it a good rating. The first time it happened, I contacted Braun and let them know it broke immediately after the warranty...no sympathy which I suppose is ok give that was the contract. This time, one broke right before the warranty is up so I&#x27;ll see how Braun deals with it. And Braun: PLEASE improve the trimmer parts!</li>
            <li> NOT ONLY THE BEST ELECTRIC RAZOR I HAVE EVER HAD BUT THE KINDEST ON MY SKIN.  I STARTED WITH ELECTRIC RAZORS IN 1953 AFTER 10 YEARS OF USING BLADE RAZORS (I AM NEARING 82).  AS I GOT OLDER, AND WITH THE NEEDED MEDICINE FOR AGING PROBLEMS, MY SKIN GOT VERY TENDER.  I NEVER PLANNED OR EXPECTED TO SPEND AS MUCH FOR AN ELECTRIC RAZOR.  AFTER MANY HOURS OF RESEARCH AND SEEING SEVERAL YOUTUBE DEMOS, I BIT THE BULLET AND GAVE MY FACE AND MYSELF A CHANCE FOR A BETTER SHAVE.  THIS HAS PROVEN TO BE ONE OF THE BEST DECISIONS IN PERSONAL CARE I HAVE EVER MADE.  IT IS FULLY WORTH THE PRICE.  WITHOUT ANY QUALIFICATION I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.  GENE WOLVER</li>
            <li> so good i like very clean</li>
            <li> soft long moustache cant shave very clear</li>
            <li> My husband thinks this is one of the best shavers he has ever used.  Clean, comfortable shave. A clear winner.</li>
            <li> Having purchased my first Braun shaver almost 30 years ago, I had gone through 4 models since that time and had been completely satisfied with the quality, until now.  I purchased the Braun Series 7 - 790cc shaver more than a year ago and have to say I am considering rebuilding my Series 5-8595 shaver, as it was the best thing that Braun ever made.  Not sure if the lack of quality now relates to the PG purchase of Braun, but it is obvious that the quality is not there anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes me almost 3 times as long to shave now over my previous razor and I still don&#x27;t get a good shave (my face burns before that happens!).  This razor is very noisy, rattleing like it is going to fall apart any second.  I becomes much worse if I skip a day of shaving.  Bear in mind that I have relatively fine hair, and I can&#x27;t imagine how anybody with a tough beard could use this shaver.  It would likely stop the shaver, which almost happens with my facial hair.  Besides, it also leaves hair often and I find I end up using the trimmer quite often to go over my face first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent this razor to the service center after the first few months and it came back just as bad, if not worse.  Recently I paid to replace the shaver head and it still is just as bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than rebuilding my older razor, I have to say this will be the last Braun that I will purchase, as the quality is not there anymore.  I would strongly encourage you to stay away from this piece of equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, does anyone have any other recommendations for a quality straight foil razor?</li>
            <li> Great product. It came on time and has been well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Gives a great shave. Much better than I expected!</li>
            <li> I have a very heavy beard and this is by far the best electric razor I have ever used.  My shave is every bit as good as a blade.</li>
            <li> This razor is fantastic.  I had a Braun for years but it was getting old and not providing the shave I was looking for. Braun has improved the shave experience significantly.  Highly recommend you try it, you will love it.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it!  My son has one as well and loves it!</li>
            <li> works very well.  I especially like the cleaning action that it performs on its own.</li>
            <li> shaves great , well satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a well made shaver, very robust heads and I got months out of the cleaner by doing it once a week. The problem is it just doesn&#x27;t shave that well!  I&#x27;ll have to go back to the Panasonic which is now NOT well made but shaves better  Too bad, this is a good machine.</li>
            <li> After being disappointed by the (made in China) 3 series, I purchased the 790.  It feels more substantial; but, after using it for several weeks now I believe my 20 year old braun achieved a closer shave (the older trimmer worked better also).  The 790 does an excellent job cutting through 3 and even 5 day growth however.  Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> My husband is very pleased with this product.  His face feels smoother, less bumpy. Great product, i would recommend it to family and friends. Thank you, Cynthia. :)</li>
            <li> Going from a cheap 50 dollar electric to this is a huge step up. Close shave with very little irritation.  I shave everyday and this thing is quick and convenient.  The base station makes a world of difference. Charges all the time and cleans when necessary.  It is pretty loud when it cleans but that&#x27;s to be expected. The cleaning replacement alcohol things  are only about 20 bucks a year if you buy the value pack from amazon .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the rare times I have longer facial hair, this thing still powers through. I have noticed I always keep the speed at its highest setting, so that parts pointless to me but ymmv.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a lot of electric razors but this razor has given me the closest shave so far. I absolutely love this razor you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> no cutter plastic cover provided and overly complicated. this is my fourth Braun and they were all not ads good as the fist one. I purchased years ago.</li>
            <li> Good to use. Nice gift for man. My uncle like it.</li>
            <li> Very weight, reflects the German manufacturing skills, but the noise is too big, shaving no PHILPS province strength</li>
            <li> Do not have any case for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to be a gift to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will  do not  want to buy it.</li>
            <li> Very nice great shaver.</li>
            <li> NOT ONLY THE BEST ELECTRIC RAZOR I HAVE EVER HAD BUT THE KINDEST ON MY SKIN. I STARTED WITH ELECTRIC RAZORS IN 1953 AFTER 10 YEARS OF USING BLADE RAZORS (I AM NEARING 82). AS I GOT OLDER, AND WITH THE NEEDED MEDICINE FOR AGING PROBLEMS, MY SKIN GOT VERY TENDER. I NEVER PLANNED OR EXPECTED TO SPEND AS MUCH FOR AN ELECTRIC RAZOR. AFTER MANY HOURS OF RESEARCH AND SEEING SEVERAL YOUTUBE DEMOS, I BIT THE BULLET AND GAVE MY FACE AND MYSELF A CHANCE FOR A BETTER SHAVE. THIS HAS PROVEN TO BE ONE OF THE BEST DECISIONS IN PERSONAL CARE I HAVE EVER MADE. IT IS FULLY WORTH THE PRICE. WITHOUT ANY QUALIFICATION I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. GENE WOLVER</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver. I got tired of the shaving cream razor method and this is just great. The cleaning system keeps it next to brand new.</li>
            <li> works great shaves great out of box no time period to get use to and cleaning station keeps shaver in top condition Have never owned an electric shaver that worked this well that is what kept me using razor blades for years.</li>
            <li> I use this razor for face and head.  I did a lot of research on the best razor for the head and this stands up to all of the positive reviews.  Great product.</li>
            <li> After 25 years of a love-hate relationship with electric shavers, spending way too much money on &amp;#34;the next best thing,&amp;#34; and hoping to get a quick, comfortable, smooth shave...I really like this razor. No, I don&#x27;t love it...it&#x27;s a razor and unless it miraculously wiped the stubble from my face with a single wave of my hand...I&#x27;m not going to love it. What I can tell you is compared to the best three headed monsters by Norelco and Remington --of which I own multiple versions of their best-- it provides the best overall shave. It still takes 6-7 minutes to shave. It still doesn&#x27;t shave a neck as well as a cheek. But it does shave well and doesn&#x27;t pummel one&#x27;s face.&lt;br /&gt;One thing, there is a break in period. I don&#x27;t know if the razor is breaking in or if my face/stubble/technique is being trained...but after 10 days the shave is a bit faster and a bit smoother. If you don&#x27;t like it immediately out of the box, give it a week before giving up. That said, if you are pouring through the reviews and just want to get a good shaver that is noticeably better that the best three head versions, give this a try.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different shavers that my wife thinks that I am a nut case. However, this one really caught my attention. The shave this provides is better than most others I have tried. I follow the instructions and shave prior to taking a shower. It does an excellent job over most of my face. I had to drop one star because it does not do the upper lip very well nor does it clip the hairs up near the nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all this is a good purchase and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love it, great close shave and quickly.  Cleaning system is very handy.  Trimmer is nice  the way it opens up.</li>
            <li> I have had four Braun razors in the last 20 plus years. In general they are good to great quality and as good as I have found for electric shavers (I shave both face and head). I typically upgrade to better features as opposed to having one die on me. I am now on my second &amp;#34;seven series&amp;#34; shaver. This 790 model is much quieter than past models (wife is quite happy about that). It is made well (my previous seven series shaver had the trimmer slide shut mechanism break, would not stay locked closed but still worked). The reason I would not give this 5 stars is that it is not a perfectly smooth shave and the battery meter is not lit, almost impossible to read unless you turn the shaver on off in a well lit room.</li>
            <li> This electric razor are outstanding. This is the third I&#x27;ve owned (I&#x27;ll get to that in a minute), and I wouldn&#x27;t buy any other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate shaving with a blade. They leave my skin raw, even though the shave is close. Electric razors, on the other hand, leave my face alone, but they don&#x27;t quite to the job a blade does. Enter the Pulsonic. The Pulsonic gives you a shave that&#x27;s as close to a blade as you can get. The cleaning system is fantastic. Just place the razor in the cleaning device, push a button, and you&#x27;re good to go. It leaves the razor clean and lubricated, a process I have to repeat every three days (at least that&#x27;s what the razor tells me, another great feature). The razor head lasts about six months, according to the razor&#x27;s indicator, but they actually last at least twice that long. (The instructions say 18 months, which is probably right.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like everything else you buy, they don&#x27;t last forever. My first one lasted about three years before the popup trimmer popped off altogether. Not fatal, but not very handy, either. The second one lasted about two years, although it&#x27;s still good to go. What happens over time is that razor gets louder and louder because the parts that vibrate the head begin to wear. Again, this isn&#x27;t fatal, but I have to tell you that this is the LOUDEST razor you will ever use when it&#x27;s brand new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Close shave; easy to clean; solid manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Expensive; loud; cleaning fluid is expensive; replacement heads are expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDATION: Buy it. It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, however I think I will go with the Norelco next time. The shave quality of the Braun is excellent, but it seems to take longer to get a close shave. The linear motion required to get an even shave is less natural than the circular motion of the Norelco and seems to require more attention to keep from missing a spot. I would never recommend that you shave while driving, but if you do, this one wouldn&#x27;t work as well for you in my opinion. I find myself needing the mirror more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system is great. Even if you don&#x27;t brush out the head before running the cleaning cycle, it comes out very clean and ready to go. The charging base works well and is very convenient. The cleaning solution is easily replaced and if you only clean when the indicator is at 2 or 3, the solution lasts quite a while. I have had this for 4 months and the indicator for cleaning cartridge replacement has just come on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to the battery life. I have had it off the charger for a few days, but never long enough to deplete the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line to me is, if you like Norelco, stick with it. If you like Remington foils or other similar styles, Braun is the way to go. Shave quality is excellent for both.</li>
            <li> Simple to use, great product. I wish I didn&#x27;t need to purchase replacement fluid for the cleaning system. I was looking to get away from replacement costs when I switched from my straight razor. The unit comes with very good directions and works very well.</li>
            <li> I been wanting one of these shavers for as long as I can remember. I finally got one as a Christmas present and let me be the first to say that this shaver is all it is cracked up to be. I have never used a better shaver than this one. Braun is King!</li>
            <li> Husband loves it and may have converted him from Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;Shaves extremely smooth! Would recommend it. Still leaves hair in sink though. :-(</li>
            <li> This machine does everything advertised.  And, it is quieter than my 10-year old Braun.  This was a great Christmas present.</li>
            <li> Great shaver, very close shave. I LOVE IT. I have had four other Braun shavers over the years, and this is the best yet.</li>
            <li> According to my husband, this is an excellent shaving system.  He claims it&#x27;s the best he&#x27;s ever had.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it came in a box directly from Braun and had we neded to return it for some reason,there was no invoice or packing slip or return instructions in the box at all.  Good thing it met our needs.</li>
            <li> Thus far it&#x27;s the best shaver I have ever owned. I love it. I know what I&#x27;m buying my two sons for Christmas.</li>
            <li> My husband says it does it does the job by giving him a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> I been using every day, great, feel like never has bar</li>
            <li> As I am 63 yrs. old now, I have never been a fan of any electric razor even though I have tried a couple over the years. However, due to the fact that I had to get a stem cell transplant and my immune system would be temporarily wiped out, I was told that I should seriously consider using an electric razor to ensure I would not cut or nick my skin and possibly get an infection.&lt;br /&gt;My initial impression was not terrific since I was used to the very close shave I always received from a two bladed Sensor XL, but as the owner&#x27;s manual suggested, I did use the Braun Series 7 790cc for another 5 shaves to enable some experimentation/practice, and once I got used to it and the different settings for the various parts of my face and neck, I became more and more impressed. I am now very happy with all aspects of this very fine product and the self cleaning/charging stand that comes with it is very nice as well.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> the battery can last very long. I shave once a day, it usually can last 1 month or more before recharging. good quality stuff.</li>
            <li> So far it works great! Smooth and comfortable shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ken</li>
            <li> Much better than previous Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing razor ever! Well worth the price. I bought this for my husband who was having trouble with skin irritation from his prior electric razor. In one shave there was a noticeable improvement in his skin. After just a couple of weeks of use his face looks great. The shave is close and smooth and he thanks me almost daily for this great gift! He absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I decided on buying this product. This shave is as close as using a razor. The automatic cleaning station is amazing. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Probably the best shave I have ever had with an electric razor and the cleaning is SUPER convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10 will shave again</li>
            <li> Works great, does a great job.  I have a tough beard and it is tough for a shave to last all day.  This shaver does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent electric razor.  My skin is very sensative to razors and in the past, others have caused razor bumps.  Not this one, its convenient, the self cleaning function is fantastic and battery life outstanding and the shave is close and leaves skin very smooth!  I would strongly recommend, particularly if you are African American dealing with stubborn in grown hairs.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver after my old 7000 series gave up the ghost.  The shaver is a step up from the old one but it still doesn&#x27;t give a close shave unless you want to spend the time going over and over your face.  It is quieter and the cleaning process seems to not use as much liquid as the old one.  One downside:  The trimmer is harder to use than the old one. All in all its still most likely the best electric out there.</li>
            <li> I like it &amp; get a close shave  I don&#x27;t understand how to use the solution, though. Let me know</li>
            <li> Very good. Clean and sharp. Better than Phlips except noise louder. The clean deck is seem not much useful, water cleanning is ok</li>
            <li> I have tried all the major brands of shavers and always went back to favor and shaving cream until my wife bought me my first Braun 700 series which was called then the pulsar or something like that. At the time I would have never of spent that kind of money on a shaver, but my wife had no problem and I am so grateful for her splurging. I am now on my second 7 series and my wife just ordered me my third one as a back up because the battery after many years is starting to show signs of losing its charge but still shaving well (..I just replace the shaver heads as needed, maybe every two years or so?? Using the cleaner really helps keep the blades clean and shaving close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my 30 years or so of shaving, I found not every shaver works for every beard. What is good for one guy isn&#x27;t for the over. For me the rotating shaver heads never worked well. But for our eldest (25) son, they work great. For my beard, maybe because it is a bit courser the Braun 7 series works the best. Close shave, holds up well, has a great cleaning system that stopped break outs (that was a few years back) by sanitizing it and just an all around comfortable good close shave and extremely reliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for our youngest son (17) his beard is more like mine and the rotary isn&#x27;t working with his beard. So the wife again did her research and I has ordered him the Braun 350cc. She likes that it has the cleaning system as well to help sanitize the shaver head, because he does have a few spots/zits at times.</li>
            <li> so far, new razor has been very good, easy to use, clean and maintain.. I&#x27;ll find out later, how expensive the constant need for refills  will be..  thanks..</li>
            <li> The shaver does a nice job on my tough beard.  The main complaint I have is about the quality of the metal in the shaving head.  After less than one month of use, the shaving head developed a small hole in one end of the foil.  I bought another head and the identical thing happened after a few weeks. The hole appeared in the same pace in the foil.  I am careful not to let the part of the head with the hole in it come into contact with my skin, otherwise it will pull and hurt.  I suspect that the metal is inferior, resulting in the hole occurring so quickly (without undue abuse by myself).  This is the very first time this has ever happened with any other electric shaver I have ever owned.  Sounds like this may be a typical &amp;#34;cost saving&amp;#34; move on the part of the manufacturer by using inferior metal in the construction of the shaving head. The head also shows signs of rust after a few uses.  It may be cheap white metal instead of good stainless steel.  For the money paid, I think we deserve better.  I have not complained to the vendors.  I just will not buy Braun again.  Next time I will try my luck with Panasonic.  I wonder, am I the only person who has ever had this experience with this shaver?</li>
            <li> This razor is awesome.  I had an early generation one and finally upgraded after 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;This thing is so smooth and easy, it feels like you&#x27;re wiping the whiskers off your face, regardless how long they are.&lt;br /&gt;Sounds cheesy, but I&#x27;m serious - its really that nice.&lt;br /&gt;I think my face will hate me if I ever downgrade.</li>
            <li> The Braun Pulsonic razor is the most comfortable, fast &amp; long lasting electric razor on the market.  Incredibly close shaves and it cleans up better than any other razor I&#x27;ve tried.  I bought one when they first came out years ago &amp; the one I just bought replaces it.  This razor&#x27;s very long life is shown by the fact I shave my whole head with it everyday.  Best of all it never causes bumps or irritations.  For me it is perfect!</li>
            <li> It makes my husband&#x27;s skin brake out. I do not want to keep it. I thought that I could return it. Can I return it?</li>
            <li> bought it as a gift for my father, and he&#x27;s very happy~ the cleaning system is especially useful together with charging battery.</li>
            <li> Product came to us with a bad battery.  The charge only lasts for a short duration and does a poor job of shaving.  Misses hairs.  Amazon refuses to return the item.  Buyer beware.  If it is defective you will not be able to return to Amazon, you will be stuck with a big piece of expensive junk.</li>
            <li> I bought a Braun clean and renew a decade ago and it was the best shaver ever.  I left it in a hotel on travel a few years ago or I would still be using it.  The new version is pure garbage.  The cutting block has been changed and does a poor job around any curves (your face).  My base system was also broken out of the box and does not pull fluid up to the razor to clean it, it just charges and vibrates dry.  I contacted Braun and now get to ship it to them at my cost for repair.  Amazon took care of me....because they know how to run a business.  Awful shaver especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I shopped around, and for the $ and quality, this braun was by far the best!  The replacement parts are much cheaper than the competitors.  My HUsband says its the best razor he has owned!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Braun shavers for more years than I can remember and have mostly been satisfied with them.  So, when it came time to replace my last one I gravitated to Braun again and decided to get one of the top models.  It is giving me the smoothest shaves ever and I&#x27;m fully satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li> Great experience, for the first time to use this razor of Braun, grasps the feeling is also very good, easy to operate,</li>
            <li> have been using it for almost a month. Its great at a close shave but there still some stray hairs which I usually use  tweezers to pull out. I also use the trimmer attachment to get rid of those hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way to use it for me was after a face wash. Let dry for 5 minutes and start shaving the neck first. in the beginning the results were not good but after 1 week the results are great as I got used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very convenient and now I tend to have shaved face all week long as it is not a hassle to get a shave like when I was using a razor.</li>
            <li> This razor is easy to use and gives a great shave.  It works even better than my old 5 series shaver.</li>
            <li> I had been using an older Braun shaver and it was time to move on. The 790 is the best shave I have ever had from an electric. The shave is as close to blade perfect without the inconvenience. I love this razor and just wish I had changed sooner.</li>
            <li> does not shave close. Told my husband he needed to shave &amp; he said he just did. Noisey when cleaning, scares my yorkie. Has to be plugged in all the time to clean.</li>
            <li> Great shaver, close shave.  no complaints except the charger/cleaner is big and loud.  I only charge the shaver when the batter runs down and at that time I get out the unit, plug it in, load the cartridge and clean it.  It takes about 3 weeks for the battery to nned recharging.  I brush out the shaver daily and once a week I clean the head with alcohol.  Alcohol is cheap, the cartridge is not.  By doing it this way, my counter top is not cluttered and I use one cartridge a year.  The cartridge comes with a cap that can reseal it after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I would say is that the trimmer is not that great.  I have a separate trimmer that I use for my sideburns.</li>
            <li> Wish to return this product.&lt;br /&gt;Bought it for s Christmas gift.&lt;br /&gt;I used it only once then it stopped working.</li>
            <li> The razor gives a close and comfortable shave.  The cleaning and charging system is quick and easy to use.  I would recommend this system.</li>
            <li> Close shave. Easily cleaned. Can use isopropyl alcohol to refill cartridge without purchasing Braun solution. Recommend this over Norelco or other shavers.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my son as he just started the need to shave. I wanted to purchase something high quality and easy to keep clean. He loves this. What can I say? Perfect!</li>
            <li> twice just several days after i bought them ,the prices were lowered.so I felt very disappointed.I thougt amazon maybe not trustworthy.</li>
            <li> I bought the Series 7 shaver because of the great shaves I have gotten from my Braun Series 5 360 Complete shaver and it&#x27;s Consumer Reports top rating. Every shaver I have had in the past except for Braun, (Remington, Norelco, Panasonic, etc.) has irritated my skin in areas of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;I have read complaints about the expense of the Braun cleaning cartridges. You can avoid the Automatic Cleaning system expense by following the Braun Manual Cleaning procedures. According to the owners manual you can clean the shaver with hot running water and put  a small drop of light machine oil on top of the Foil &amp; Cutter cassette each week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this shaver for several weeks I&#x27;m changing my rating from ***** to ***. I am finding too many missed hairs.</li>
            <li> This was my first series 7 from Braun. I have used some of their razors that sell at Wal-Mart, but I decided to spend the money on what I thought to be a superior razor. At first the Braun was great. But; like some have already noted, the silver came off after awile and about 6 or 8 months ago it just quit. They claim it as a 7 year razor, bot I got about 2 1/2. I was thinking about another one, but I cabn&#x27;t see spending $200 for a razor when one half it&#x27;s price or less will do the same job.</li>
            <li> Best razor I have ever owned</li>
            <li> I wanted to give a negative rating but there is no negative rating and I had to at least give 1 * to start writing a review .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The liquid that comes with this is not fit for most . So you will end up with some skin infections after you start using it . Please make sure of it before you start using it . I had to take medicines extensively both internal and on externally on skin to clear those spots due to the skin infection caused by it .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used multiple electric razors before and never had any issues  but for sure  this one is not fit for everyone .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please make a smart decision and avoid this as much as you can unless your skin is quite immune and you are ok with some black spots on your face</li>
            <li> Great shaver.  Best shave I have ever gotten from an electric shaver</li>
            <li> The best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned and used. I&#x27;m a senior citizen if one goes by the numbers. I&#x27;ve owned numerous name brand electric razors. Foils. 3-heads. You name it I&#x27;ve owned it and shaved with it.    This Braun Series 7-790cc is THEE best electric I&#x27;ve used. Closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric. And I used to years ago shave with a blade and shave cream, so I know what a close shave is and this Braun delivers one. Very sturdy construction. Feels good in my hand. Feels like quality. Operates like quality. Motor sounds good running --- not as if it is going to seize up at any moment as on other electrics. Operates very smoothly and quietly compared to most other electrics.     I also like the cleaning system. Very easy to use. There might be a better electric razor out there somewhere made by some company, but if so it couldn&#x27;t be much or any better than this Braun.</li>
            <li> Great electric razor! This is my second time buying this product, the first lasting about a good 4 - 4.5 years. I have not used many electric razors, but this one is excellent, as far as I&#x27;m concerned. I imagine I will buy again in another few years.</li>
            <li> Would recommend - husband loves it!</li>
            <li> This shaver doesn&#x27;t cut my whiskers well at all.</li>
            <li> When I used it to shave,I feel very comfortable, very clean, awesome experience! Maintenance is also very convenient!I like it very much!</li>
            <li> I had the 5 series and when was time to change, I made the mistake of going with a Phillips shaver. Suffered through the first month and was told it would get better and sure enough it didn&#x27;t. So I got myself one of these babies and wow, what a difference.&lt;br /&gt;Also the price here was great compared to a lot of other sellers on Amazon.</li>
            <li> i never ever used a electric razor till yesterday,,this clean s itself  and lubercates itself as well..it takes a lot to impress me but this is the first time in my 70 years of life and 50 years of  shaving always used a blade now old age has made me lazy but i earned it so be it now this lets me watch tv and shave and relax siting while shaving love it thank you great razor</li>
            <li> Good electric shaver. I have very thick facial hair and this does a decent job of trimming it down. It&#x27;s definitely not as close as when I use a safety razor - my preferred shaving method, but it&#x27;s faster and I can do it in the car if I&#x27;m running late. I get a little annoyed by the hygiene bar going down so quickly and I don&#x27;t use the cleaner that often, but I will rinse it out on my own after each use and only put it in the cleaner when it needs to be charged.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with Mach 3 fusion razors since they&#x27;ve been invented. I&#x27;ve tried multiple different shaving creams in order to eliminate or even reduce the razor rash on my neck with little luck. Finally I buckled down and decided to buy and electric shaver. My first purchase was actually a Phillips aqua touch that cost about half the price . It cut me a few times and didn&#x27;t help with the razor rash.( in their defense they have better razors with a bigger price tag, you get what you pay for)  I returned it and decided to spend a bit more money and do a bit of research. I&#x27;ve had it a week and I still cant believe how great this thing is. Its super comfortable. And it shaves just as close as using Mach 3&#x27;s. I was skeptical at first about not having the wet shave option but who needs it when it shaves like this! And its really clean. No hairs in the sink to clean up afterwards. ( maybe 5 microscopic ones if you want to get picky ) The cleaning system is great and leaves my face feeling smooth and great afterwards. I&#x27;m not an expert, but I read from a few people who are, and I have to agree. This thing is great!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase. My 3 previous electric shavers were the Philips Norelco 8000 Series, last Model: 1290X/42 almost $300 bucks. It was crap, didn&#x27;t last a year... Loud, made increasing noises, didn&#x27;t cut close starting @ around 6 months of use!! That was my LAST Norelco, PERIOD!  This Braun Series 7-790cc arrived very quickly, less than 48 hours and in 5.0 shape, I&#x27;m happy. When that 3rd failure Norelco crapped out, I did the research and came to the conclusion I needed to switch Brands, from Philips Norelco to Braun. I purchased their best, a habit of mine and when it arrived, charged it, read the owners manual,  and when charged up fully, shaved!! OMG, I did not know what I was missing, Close, comfortable and, yes, got extra kisses from my bride of 48 years... My face was as smooth as a babies bottom!! Need I say more? I will report back with a 12 month update or sooner if let down by a failure (not expected)!! I am very, very pleased with this product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get one and take it for a ride, could be exciting ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;V/R Kent M Whitney</li>
            <li> Recommended to choose the standard packaging, environmentally friendly packaging is very easily damaged.&lt;br /&gt;I feel good good work</li>
            <li> We use this shaver everyday.  It is easy to use, clean and charge.  We get a really close shave and the longer we use it the closer the shave.  It is also easy for travel.  We will no be going back to blades.</li>
            <li> In 2010 I bought a Panasonic,&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VKZMHK/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;This was at the time an excellent shaver. And it still is. At the time, it cost $72.99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here I am, 4 years later, and thinking I&#x27;m going to upgrade. So this shaver gets ravishing reviews, and it cost $199, so it must be excellent, right? Wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month of using it, this shaver is no better, possibly even worse than the Panasonic for $72.99. That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a bad shaver, it just means it is way overpriced. It is a decent shaver, and the battery life is excellent. But If you are in the market for an excellent shaver, don&#x27;t spend $200 on one, when you can get Panasonics&#x27; latest for $135&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-ES-LA63-S-Electric-Multi-Flex-Pivoting/dp/B002N5MHLU/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?s&#x3D;hpc&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1404600944&amp;sr&#x3D;1-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;panasonic+shaver&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, yes, I&#x27;m disappointed that I spent $200, and all I got was something equivalent to what I already had and that is now 4 years old for a third of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do your research, you don&#x27;t always get what you pay for. The one star rating is based on price alone. You can get the same or better product for much less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update August 13, 2014&lt;br /&gt;After a few months of using this shaver, I went back to my old Panasonic. This just doesn&#x27;t cut it. I spend a lot more time shaving with the Braun than I do with the Panasonic. On the front of your neck, you have to go over the same spot in different angles for the hair to completely come off. Very rarely do I really regret a purchase, this time I do. 1 star stays.</li>
            <li> With this system I have a nice clean shaver ready every morning. Does a very good job shaving, almost as close as a triple blade razor without the mess. Great for traveling. Totally happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Sorry I didn&#x27;t purchase years ago. Excellent  shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband and he now shaves everyday instead of a couple of times a week.  He loves using it and I enjoy the close shave</li>
            <li> This shaver does not remove hair adequately. It took 20 minutes for my husband to shave his face, and even with my help, there were patches of hair still unremovable. For that price, that is ridiculous, and I am sending it back. It also takes up too much counter space and just not worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> So far this razor has met all expectations i had for it.  It is exactly as described.  I looked at the 3 and 5 series as well, but decided on this one because of the 3 intensity settings.  I also looked in a local store and they wanted $200 just for the 5 series.  I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase and getting nice clean shaves.</li>
            <li> Husband said this is the best shave he has ever gotten!  Would recommend to a friend.  Easy to take care.</li>
            <li> this razor would easily get 5 stars if the pop up trimmer wasn&#x27;t a total joke. have a series 7 from many years ago that I have to still dig out just for the quality trimmer. but can get a really good shave.</li>
            <li> Best shaver that I have ever purchased. I love the cleaning base.</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;m not sure what the big fuss is over this shaver.  It does a fine job, but so did my old ancient norelco that just got handed down to a grandchild.  This is the primary reason for the 3 stars.  It doesn&#x27;t wow me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In setting it up, I was following the user manual.  Things labeled in the user manual in one location on the shaver were actually on another location.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s confusing to use the charger and washer if you read the manual.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic shaver and SOOOO much better than the Series 5 (with the possible exception of the flimsier trimmer). I like the charge gauge to really get a good feel for how power you have left.  The actual shaver head is much more contained than the Series 5 which subsequently requires using the cleaning station versus just simply brushing it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any event, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy if you want a really great device.  That said, even if you compromise with the Series 5, you won&#x27;t go wrong there either.</li>
            <li> It works Great for me. Very Smooth!</li>
            <li> The Clean &amp; Renew Refills are too expensive.</li>
            <li> My 5 star rating is relative to other electric shavers, as I would prefer to wet shave with a safety razor, but certain areas of face just refuse to tolerate it.&lt;br /&gt;  As a result of the bumps I developed (while still using an electric shaver), I engaged in extensive experimentation with both rotary, foil and blade razors, and I think the reader will find that, as diverse as our faces are, so will your results vary.&lt;br /&gt;  I tried the top end Norelco 3D shaver (as well as a few lower end Norelcos), and as much as I wanted to like them (better than foils on a few days growth, excellent customer service and good value, especially on the cheaper models), I found all models to be irritating.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve owned Panasonics (used them mostly wet, which is counter to how electrics operate...the lather causes the whiskers to lie flat), Wet, they caused excess irritation, and dry, they get hotter than a clothing iron; more irritation.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve electric shaved (for about 30 years) most of my adult life, and really liked the two (2) Braun 3550 single foil shavers (long since discontinued). About nine (9) years ago I tracked down a Grundig shaver (also long discontinued, but once considered the Mercedes of electric shavers).&lt;br /&gt;  It was nice for a few years, but I began experimenting with countless pre-shaves,(I tired of the dry itchy feeling) which may have been the catalyst for my bumps, (or the shaver was beginning to age?)&lt;br /&gt;  I decided to re-try the Braun 7-series (which I tried a number of years ago and returned; I didn&#x27;t then see it as an improvement over my Grundig.)&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve found my bumps have subsided, and I experience little or no irritation (though it takes more time than rotary or wet shaving).&lt;br /&gt;  I suggest the user follow Braun&#x27;s recommendations and not wash ones face any time soon before shaving (sounds a little grungy; wash after if necessary), and don&#x27;t use any pre-shave. (I don&#x27;t use after shave either; does your face really need chemicals splashed on it?)&lt;br /&gt;  The Braun 7-Series isn&#x27;t perfect, but it is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 22 year old son who has a thick beard and sensative skin.  He loves it!  It is easy to use and he really likes the cleaning feature.  I would definately buy one again.  Great gift!</li>
            <li> Bought for our son. He was very happy with this and still likes it today. Good product.</li>
            <li> Pricy, but I love Braun shavers and this is the best one ever.</li>
            <li> This razor performs better than any electric razor I have ever used. The shave is amazingly close. It&#x27;s a foil rather than a rotary razor and it outshines any rotary I&#x27;ve tried. So far, I&#x27;m pleased as I could be and it seems well worth the price paid. Amazon had a $40 discount that made the deal even sweeter.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver. Main use was to shave my head. I have to apply a lot of pressure to get a close shave using multiple passes in all directions. I expected a much closer shave with a lot less work. I would imaging the lower priced units would give the same results.</li>
            <li> I had an older version of this razor and bought this as a replacement once that one finally broke (after at least 7 years I&#x27;ll add). It as exactly as described and does a great job. Also the battery lasts forever, at least a month of everyday use.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with various non-electric razors most of my life.  Never really found one that did a perfect job.  I used to shave with a blade... then use a cheapo electric razor to clean up where I missed in the shower.  Once I shelled out for this top of the line razor and used it the very first time.... and every time since... did I realize I was missing out on the best shave ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to not shave every day cause I hated to waste the time... now, I can&#x27;t get enough of this razor.... I work at home, so don&#x27;t need to be presentable a lot of the time... but now, I just shave cause it feels good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Braun! Amazing razor.... I don&#x27;t need to try anything else after buying this.  (cost a lot, but worth it).</li>
            <li> My biyfriend love this shaver glad j got it for him. Very pleased. Best investment ever would buy it again</li>
            <li> The man is impressed.  Owned an older version and this was no disappointment.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> it&amp;#34;s very good~I love this one~</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product.  I have been using this product for more than 30 years.  It exceeds my expectations.</li>
            <li> Packaging is too crude, such a large company will give the box? Disappointed! Clean water is little, never enough to use, function is lacking</li>
            <li> It works very well. I had a Braun (forgot the model #) for years before this, and this one is better than the previous one.</li>
            <li> Cleaner than Phillips&#x27; rotary razor. But I don&#x27;t know how long to use.</li>
            <li> Clean up is expensive and if you have sensitive skin do NOT buy... I stopped using it because I break out every time I use it.. Especially in the neck area. It does give you a close shave everywhere except the neck... You have to really dig into your skin and thus get nicked by the blades. Would not buy for the price</li>
            <li> First foil shaver that I&#x27;ve tried and I think it&#x27;s great.  Was using rotary shavers previously and this out shines them.  The cleaning unit works great and the does a great job keeping the shaver like new.  Compared to the rotary shavers I found this one easier to shave with.</li>
            <li> Ok I have owned a Braun series 5 electric razor for a couple of years now.  I found the Braun 5 to be the better of the other 2 I tried (Norelco, and Remington).  I decided to treat myself to the Braun 7-790.  I did not shave at all while I awaited delivery of the 7.  6 days later it arrived.  fully charged.  Normally with the 5 series I would have to go over and over my face to get a close shave.  Longer whiskers took a few more swipes to get rid of.  My face would be a bit (only marginally irritated)  NOT with the 7.  Shaved off almost a weeks worth of growth (heavy duty whiskers not a young mans peach fuzz) in less time than it would have taken to shave a 1/4 of my face using the 5.  The 7 shaves a lot closer and  smoother than the 5.  Hands down beats the 5 in closeness, speed, and no irritation at all.  Smooth as a baby&#x27;s new borne butt.  Well worth the bit extra cost.  I suggest this 7 model as it is the same head and cutting performance as the higher price models.  A few notes  first off like my model five you DO NOT have to take the Cleaning station with you when you travel, the charging cord plugs directly into the razor itself and cleaning it by hand is easy.  There are adjustments for the head so that you can change it to fit the type of whiskers, and area that you are shaving.</li>
            <li> Should have bought one of these years ago.</li>
            <li> Bought for boyfriend. He had a 5 series and he was happy with it. I bought him the 7 series for him to keep at his house and bring the 5 series to my house as a spare. He just loves it. Says get such a close shave without pushing. It just glides. He also said big improvement from 5. But really happy with both......</li>
            <li> I had Panasonic ls93. it quit on me. so I bought this. not smooth at all. only dry shaving.&lt;br /&gt;battery life is very short</li>
            <li> Excellent design, clear instructions, gives a smooth shave, easy to maintain, packaged well, comfortable to hold, cleaning station works well, I like it!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent according to my Dad.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that it shaves any closer than the series 5? I like it though. The self cleaning feature is a nice addition. I hope it last longer before replacing the head.</li>
            <li> 1st razor I invested in normally get cheap ones. It is incredibly smooth shave. Girlfriend loves it and can&#x27;t stop feeling me.</li>
            <li> This razor gives a very close shave except under the chin, seems to leave behind a bit of stubble.  But overall is one of the better shavers that I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Amazon shipping is the best as I received it within the 3-5 day range early.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaved because it had been recommended by many sites for not causing razor bumps. After using the razor for several weeks, I realized that this is not the case, at least for me. I followed the instructions for the shaved (use trimmer to trim down longer hair, pull.skin when shaving, etc.) and got razor bumps after my first use. Although it dies give a close shave in some areas, the shaver has a tough time shaving my face above my jaw bone too, which is annoying. If i did not pay a lot for this thing and if my old trimmer didn&#x27;t die one me, I would return it.</li>
            <li> Great item. Gives a wonderful shave.</li>
            <li> My husband says it is perfect, and  he bought 10 for his friends!</li>
            <li> After my first use, I thought this was the best electric shaver I&#x27;d ever used, and that might still be true, but it is not as close or quick a shave as a Gillette Mach III.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt the best electric razor I have ever had. Period. I still have to touch up from time to time with a regular razor since I have facial hair, but for mowing the unpopulated areas it is fast and smooth. The cleaning system is solid too, my best advice is what I was told by my Grandfather 30 years ago... always use some pre-shave of some sort.</li>
            <li> I have not had an electric shaver in years but this one is simple and I like that it cleans and charges its self.</li>
            <li> Great Product for the value and a Quality Shave! Was using a 3 headed rotating shaver for the pass 15 years that was a gift. It took a longer time to shave, but with the Braun Series 7 it is taking at least more then 60% less time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with this item because I had high hopes for a great shave.  I was looking for something to replace my Braun 7526 shaver which I got as a gift 10 years ago, which is amazing.  Then they changed the replacement blades which are terrible.  The correct ones are the ones that list it for the 7000 Series [[ASIN:B008ZRF9TW Braun Syncro 7000 Series Fits Model# 7000 Series]] and not the 30B ones.  It&#x27;s harder to find replacement blades and now the shaver isn&#x27;t keeping the charge as long.  I thought with ten years of technological advances that this shaver would be even better, but it doesn&#x27;t shave nearly as close as my other shaver does. It leaves me with 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at 8am.  The locking button stopped working.  Also I find the cleaning station to be really loud and it leaves your shaver a little wet when it&#x27;s done. I&#x27;m hoping to find a way to replace the battery on my 7526.</li>
            <li> My husband asked me to write this as he is IN LOVE with this shaver. He had the original version of this from many years ago and never replaced it. It has lasted him years. Finally, I upgraded him to this newer model for Christmas 2013. It is now August 2014 and it is still working great with no hitches. It gives him the closest shave he&#x27;s ever had and he has never nicked himself with it.</li>
            <li> The best shaver!!!  I have had 3 electric shavers, and this is the best.  As I am bald, I am able to use this on my entire face and head and the comfort settings are great.  It quick charges and cleans so its ready to go as soon as I need it.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing these razors for years, they work well, but, eventually the pop up trimmer breaks and does not retract.  I wish that Braun would address this issue, and make the trimmer stronger.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband after our son took his other one. Now our son took this one! They both love it! Smooth operation. Quiet.</li>
            <li> very well made, and shaves close!!!</li>
            <li> Nice razor. Very quiet.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun 370cc for several years, the 7-790cc  provides a much better shave.</li>
            <li> YOU CANNOT RETURN THIS ITEM BE AWARE. There were no warning about the no return policy. I understand that this razor can work for a lot of people, but it didn&#x27;t work for me and I do not like, not at all. I prefer my old Philips. It gives my skin irritation. But when I wanted to make a return, Amazon didn&#x27;t accept it. I do not tell you this is not a good razor, but be aware, that if you didn&#x27;t like it, or even if you received it broken, or with a bad battery, you CANNOT RETURN IT.</li>
            <li> This the second Braun 7 that I have owned and I love it.</li>
            <li> even  better than my series 3</li>
            <li> So soft!I like it very much!</li>
            <li> best shaver ever I had!</li>
            <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> very good shave; charger/cleaner takes up a lot of space and is sort of noisy</li>
            <li> I thought this item will be more high tech but to me it just another shaving machine.</li>
            <li> it is beautiful tool, men must need one</li>
            <li> Great seller. highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best shaver hands down. I&#x27;ve tried tons of different style electric  shavers and brands to only be disappointed time and time again. I was tired of paying $30 plus dollars a month on razor blades and needed a better solution to this costly problem of having to shave everyday for work. Besides the constant irritation from the razor blades it was just to costly. I had given up on eletric razors since it was causing the same irritation as the blade. If I did find an electric razor that semi worked ok, the base would leak everywhere from the cleaning solution. So I did some more research and came across this promising shaver. I read the reviews like the many others I had done before and decided to look on line for this particular shaving system. I found an awesome deal on another popular bid and sell website and got the complete shaving system for $150 including free shipping. It arrived from bed bath and beyond, which wasn&#x27;t the person I bought it from, but the seller to me must have ordered it from them, anyways, it came and from day one I&#x27;ve been nothing but impressed with this shaver. My face took about 2 weeks or so to adjust to this micro screen style shaver, but man, does this thing give me a close shave now. No more razor burn or irritation  plenty of power to cut through the toughest facial hair, and it holds a charge for well over a full week worth of shaves at over 10 to 12 minutes per shave. The charging base is well constructed and the cleaning solution doesn&#x27;t leak while its cleaning the shaver. It offers different levels of cleaning based on the time and frequency used, but most of all it just works great from start to finish. I&#x27;ve owned this shaver now for 15 months and just now ordered a new replacement foil cartridge for it on amazon. It doesn&#x27;t really needed to be replaced yet, but I like to have it on hand when it does need replacement. The cleaning solution last me about 45 days or so, but I clean and charge mine after every use.I like a fresh, clean, fully charged shave every time. So for those out there looking, the looking stops here with this shaver. I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to tryout Brauns other shavers like the series 1, 3, or 5, but I do know the series 7 790cc model is the one for me and my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for 8-12 weeks now and it is awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have particularly dense stubble, but I would say my skin is quite sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;At first it gave me horrendous shaving burn, but I stuck with it. The burn died down considerably, HOWEVER!!- I still have to stretch the skin and press very hard to get anything resembling a close shave! - against the grain, with the grain, perpendicular to the grain... multiple passes!&lt;br /&gt;Inevitably this results in terrible shaving rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I give up. Back to wet-shaving for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*On the plus side, it is handy to use over moles that you don&#x27;t want to risk cutting with a razor blade... so there is that.*</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This thing will mow your lawn. Super powerful.&lt;br /&gt;- The vibrating action makes a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;- The cleaning base is very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The trimmer leaves what to be desired, feels a bit flimsy and doesn&#x27;t look like it belongs on such a nice shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of advice, get this on or around black friday, as it will go down about $30 in price.</li>
            <li> the power switch need a very big push!, but in a word, fantastic.</li>
            <li> Best electric shaver I have owned... Would recommend to anyone looking for a new shaver.</li>
            <li> I found the winner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a magic shave user since high school (30+ years) and it has worked well at keeping my face shaved and smooth.  The biggest complaint was how messy it was to use and of course the smell, which I got use to after so many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a few different types of razors for black men to help with razor bumps and skin irritation and after a while I ended up back with magic shave.  After reading various reviews and comments about the Braun Series 7-790cc, I decided to give this foil shaver a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing the Braun Series 7-7900cc to other models I would recommend it highly over both the Panasonic Arc3 and Arc4, with the Panasonic Arc3 the runner up.  The Panasonic Arc3 worked better for me with closer shave than the Arc4, but the Braun topped them both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for the smoothest shave with less irritation to the skin, I would recommend that you give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABM</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing electric razor especially for African American skin which most electric razors aren&#x27;t friendly too. Been shaving with it for two weeks and haven&#x27;t gotten a single ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much to say for the pros that aren&#x27;t already in the product description. The only con I have is that it&#x27;s not as close as a shave as I&#x27;d like to have for the money.  I have to go over the same area 4-5 times.</li>
            <li> Head lock button is the biggest risk, just get on the bad</li>
            <li> Totally worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I like the shave mostly, but i am surprised to not hear more complaints about this, but the trimmer is next to useless! i always use the pop up trimmer to shave my neck because it is very sensitive and electric razors just cant get the hairs, but this trimmer that pops up is just garbage. doesn&#x27;t shave anything. i was so frustrated with it i ripped it off and now the razor doesn&#x27;t work anymore. 40$ Remington razor has a better trimmer than this overpriced shiny silver paperweight</li>
            <li> I had a Braun 5 series for about 10 years!  Worked well for that entire time...so I figured I would stick to what worked in the past.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this shaver.  It&#x27;s no louder then any other shave I&#x27;ve heard.  The cleaning cycle is quick.  It&#x27;s also nice that it can just do a quick clean cycle that only takes minutes.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  It&#x27;s a close shave.  It&#x27;s everything, if not more, than you would want in an electric shave.  All it comes down to, is which type of shave head do you prefer.  If you like this type, then you&#x27;ll definitely be happy with this shaver.  No regrets here...and I&#x27;m very happy I bought this.  It also swayed my decision to get this when they have a money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> This is flat out One Great Shaver.. I&#x27;ve used electric razors for 20+ years and upgrade every 2-3 years, reason being razors get tired and so do I when it comes to shaving so keeping it fresh helps take the monotony out of the every morning chore.&lt;br /&gt;This Braun is replacing my Panasonic ES-LA93-K shaver and even though the Panasonic has and still has great ratings and I did like it for a while BUT it really had some issues I didn&#x27;t care for.&lt;br /&gt;1st: The cleaning system does to Braun hands down, the Panasonic&#x27;s system is bad, smelly and just not very convenient (there&#x27;s a tank where you have to watch water levels, the replaceable cleaning cartridge just doesn&#x27;t seem sanitary and I&#x27;ve have the drain block on the razor reservoir a couple times. The Braun&#x27;s replaceable cleaning resivour system works perfectly, just swap out cartridges and your good to go, the Braun also smells very clean and sanitary when its done unlike the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;2nd:When shaving the Panasonic seems MUCH bulkier the Braun. The Braun 790cc feels perfect and balanced in your hand (this is important since your hand position is changing constantly when shaving to get to different areas of your face &amp; neck), the Panasonic just doesn&#x27;t feel right after using the Braun,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had Remingtons, Norelcos and Brauns and honestly through the years I found Braun just makes the best foil razors, very close shave with no irritation or bit, user friendly and  I also always buy self cleaning models for their convenience and cleanliness and the Braun just buries the Panasonic in that respect.&lt;br /&gt;4th: Noise.. The Panasonic has gotten MUCH louder!!  I&#x27;ve changed the heads and always kept it clean and lubricated with no avail.. This was a issue with me since I get up for work much earlier then my wife and she always let me know how loud my shaver was when she was trying to sleep, yes the bathroom door was closed lol..  Braun on the other hand is quite quiet and shaving early morning is no longer a problem, honestly you can even hear when the heads hit whiskers vs a clean area, sounds funny I know but when you shave with it you&#x27;ll hear it..&lt;br /&gt;Lastly: The shave, both give very nice shaves but again the Braun gets a bit closer and the 5 O&#x27;Clock shadow comes a couple hours later when I use the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line Braun is still the best foil razor available bar none, for me the Braun stays and the Panasonic gets shelved..&lt;br /&gt;If you want the best self cleaning razor available and price isn&#x27;t a top factor the 790cc is the one you want, if price is a factor then the 760cc gives just as good a shave with less bells and whistle. Me? I love bells and whistles :)</li>
            <li> This shaver is the best. I have owned Braun&#x27;s in the past, as well as Panasonic. This one cuts the best and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> After 10 years I made the upgrade to Braun&#x27;s newest shaver, and I am impressed.  Just a great product at a reasonable price.  Close shave...much better than my old 8 series.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the Braun line but it is a bit pricey and although it shaves much better than any competitor, I have to work at the softer hairs down the neck</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband and he loves it!  He&#x27;s been using the Pulsonic Shaver and this replaced his old one!  So glad I updated it!  It shaves much closer than the old one!</li>
            <li> Everything as expected the best Braun shaver</li>
            <li> Braun Series 7-790cc is very nice! but a little noisy. frankly,it is a good shaver,and have a very low price.</li>
            <li> My husband had worn out the last Braun I bought him, so I tried to replace it. This one is even better.  The shave he gets is as close to a blade shave as is humanly possible.  He loves it and may never go back to a blade.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor if you want a quick shave that doesn&#x27;t irritate your face.  I had a Braun very similar to this that was going on 10 years  old.  I replaced it with this newer model and can&#x27;t be happier.  If you are looking for a new razor, this is the one for you.  You might pay a bit more but it&#x27;s well worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Best electric razor ever</li>
            <li> Great product. Best electric shaver for smooth shaving and durability, but also most expensive. I expect it will last for many years and continue to perform like new with proper maintenance.  I have had the Braun shaver for over two years now and replaced the shaving head after 18 months as instructed. For a heavy beard (after 2-3 days of not shaving), I use the Lab Series Lotion to lubricate before shaving which works well to set up my beard for a more comfortable shave.  Also, I set it on the medium shave setting which, with the lotion, makes for a smooth shave after a couple of day beard. I also brush out and clean the razor after every shave using the cleaning system which works great. A refill usually lasts me about a month and a half, so I order then in four packs from Amazon which last me six months.</li>
            <li> Wow, a bit pricey I thought but after getting it and using it, could not be happier.  Great performing unit.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> For such an expensive razor I wanted a little more. It shaves perfect on my cheeks but it doesn&#x27;t do a thing on my neck. I generally have to do a quick shave with the razor afterwards. I have had older Braun razors and they were very nice. This one feels cheap.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this shaver. It gives a very close shave and there is no skin irritation or razor burns even on sensitive skin. I have used Gillette razors all my life and whenever I have tried to use an electric razors in the past, I always ended up returning them. After using this razor I can finally ditch my old wet shaving kit. I also tried the Norelco 3D but didn&#x27;t like it. The rotary shaver seemed to pull on my skin a lot. The Braun series 7 gave a smooth and close shave that is very rare for any electric razor. If you are looking to make the switch to an electric razor then this is it. Do not go for a cheap kind as it does not work.</li>
            <li> My shaving time has been cut in half.  I have whiskers that lay down next to my skin and this razor gets them no problem. It is extremely noisy but I give five stars anyway. I am so impressed with this razor after switching from a Norelco triple head. I haven&#x27;t used the trimmer, I have a separate unit for that. As close as a blade? You better believe it.</li>
            <li> Quiet and close.  Extremely comfortable shave every time</li>
            <li> this is an excellent shaver, well worth the money and should give you years of greats shaves</li>
            <li> good shaver！eazy to use and low noise</li>
            <li> Consistent with the Consumer Reports review, this shaver performs as advertised. Only negative - inadequate trimmer for side burns or nose. My early 90’s Braun version was better equipped to handle this delicate but necessary chore.</li>
            <li> I am from customer of China. My husband and Dad like it. it&#x27;s so useful. But the maintenance is a bit complicated.</li>
            <li> it is great (no question about the performance) but unnecessarily bulky and hygienic-focussed. Inconvenient to carry the whole body when travelling longer term. Feeling guilty when it shows unhygienic (hygiene indicator always in red as I am not using the cleaning reservoir). Importantly, It does not have plastic type of guard to protect the foil part even though it has soft carrying case(bag). Overall it is great product.</li>
            <li> Clean and close shaves all over except for mustache and bottom of the neck for myself. I do have a thick beard and use this every night but it does not get that close to my lower neck.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my son and he loves it.  He says he gets the best shave of his life with no razor burns or bumps.  He looks so much better now.</li>
            <li> This product is very nice</li>
            <li> This is the most overpriced, over rated, underperforming pos that I have ever purchased. The ads misrepresent this product in my opinion.  I had a Norelco which I have had for 15 years and I decided to look for a new razor . I have always felt you get what you pay for and quality is important to me. I decided to buy and try it. Well, I wasn&#x27;t pleased from the beginning but I decided to believe what they told me that one had to use the razor for several months before your skin would adapt to it. What BS! I tried to return it but it was past the return policy period.  I  am back to using my old Norelco with a set of new heads and it does a much superior job compared to this piece of junk.  IN my opinion, save yourself some money and stay away from this thing.</li>
            <li> ery happy with product doed a great job</li>
            <li> like the product very much. because i do my head as well as my face does seem to take longer than i expected to get a smooth shave.  but at least i  don&#x27;t have to worry about bleeding as i did with my regular razor (especially the head which tends to bleed profusely when nicked).  also like not having to think about water source and shaving cream.</li>
            <li> does not give a close shave!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my hubby. He loves it. It does excellent job. The battery seems last forever.</li>
            <li> Very similar to its predecessor but gives you a closer shave. It also seems to be a little quieter.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had and used a Braun 36 Complete for 5 years and it was very good. I only replaced it because it would no longer hold a charge. I was afraid that I would not get a replacement that would meet the same standards. However I am happy to say that the Series 7-760  has met those same standards and I look forward to using it for the next 5 to 7 years.</li>
            <li> Best electric shaved I have ever used hands down. You get a really close shave without all the irritation and discomfort I experience with a regular razor. The cleaning and maintenance is amazing with the cleaning/charging station provided with the shaver.</li>
            <li> The cleaning system does not work as expected. There is always some residual hair left after cleaning process is over.</li>
            <li> This is a great electric razor. My husband thought he would never be able to get a close shave again since he is no longer allowed to use a regular razor after heart surgery. We tried two less expensive models over the last 2 years to no avail. Then I read the reports on this shaver and several others. The Braun ranked among the top razors for a close shave in Consumer Reports. I chose it over the one that ranked first for a close shave for two reasons. First, it had a more stable base to sit in and secondly it did not use rotary blades which can actually irritate some people&#x27;s skin. Once you have put the cleaning fluid in the charger base, you can&#x27;t pack it in a suitcase. If you travel by car, you can pack it in a box that will stay upright. That is probably the only drawback.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver for the police officer guy. I have to shave every single day. This makes it way faster.  I get a real close shave too. Not as close as the razor but pretty damn close.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased both 7-series Braun (from Amazon) and 5-series (Costco) and been comparing them for a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Both are fine shavers, and either is a good buy imo. The main difference I found between the two is the subjective &amp;#34;look and feel&amp;#34; - the sturdy, heavy and solid 7-series feels like a premium product compared the 5-series which feels &amp;#34;plasticy&amp;#34; in comparison (only in comparison - don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s a finely made product).&lt;br /&gt;7-series base is also an improvement over the 5-series - holds a shaver more positively, has better contact with the charging terminals on the shaver, less likely to loose contact due to the agitation during the cleaning cycles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of shaving quality, I found them indistinguishable. Although the 7-series has a more powerful, higher-frequency linear motor and what looks like a more advanced shaving block as compared to the &amp;#34;conventional&amp;#34; 5-series, this did not translate into a closer shave, a faster shave, or less skin irritation. My wife couldn&#x27;t tell a difference over multiple rounds of comparative shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real downside of the 7-series, however, is its pop-up trimmer. It is adequate for using on the sideburns, but really clumsy for the moustache (my case), as the shaving head obscures the view in the mirror. 5-series has a much more convenient slide-out trimmer that works well in all situations I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I very much like the look and feel of the 7-series, its gizmos like the extra indicator lights and a somewhat more advanced base, but in terms of &amp;#34;core&amp;#34; functionality it adds no value over the 5-series. And it has a worse trimmer than the 5.&lt;br /&gt;So I think that the 7 is a good choice if you&#x27;re buying it as a gift and want to make a great impression, but if you&#x27;re buying it for yourself, save some $$ and go for series 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I was disappointed that none of the new shavers offered an improvement over my 12-year-old Braun 7505 in terms ofspeed or quality of the shave. No point in upgrading whatsoever if your old &amp; trusted shaver is still working.</li>
            <li> This product is great and working good and using weekly once and my skin condition was good and I would prefer this product</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver here based on many positive feedback but the hygiene indicator was already bad on arrival. How could a famous manufacturer let such obvious malfunctioned product out is beyond my understanding.&lt;br /&gt;After I got the shaver I needed to fly to China for work and I have to stay there for a while. So instead of returning the product right away I just took it with me in the hope I will get some sort of replacement or services in Shanghai. When I could not find any useful information on Braun&#x27;s website, I emailed their customer service and it took about three days to hear back, without any real answers to my two simple questions:&lt;br /&gt;1. Am I eligible for any service/warrant in Shanghai, China?&lt;br /&gt;2. I have no fapiao (or whatever they call in China) because I purchased the stuff here. Will that impact how I get the service?&lt;br /&gt;So I emailed them again and asking for clarifications. It took seven days and still no reply. Very bad customer service added to the bad quality makes me extremely disappointed with Braun. If only I could give zero star..</li>
            <li> Exceeded expectations.  Gives a great shave and the self clean really works</li>
            <li> Phenomenal shaver, closer shave than with a steel bladed Atra Plus. I highly recommend it. I give it  5.</li>
            <li> This shavers exceeded my expectations.  Smooth, comfortable and fast.  It even powered through my stubborn three day beard like it was nothing.</li>
            <li> This is not the review I thought I&#x27;d be writing.  I&#x27;m a long term Braun user having purchased an 8995, which I loved, many years ago. The 8995 would have been near the top of the line at the time.  The 8995 began to fall apart unfortunately, so earlier this year I purchased a Bruan 320s-4 for  under 50 here at Amazon.  I knew I wanted the higher end 790 but didn&#x27;t want to pay the near 200 price tag at the time.  So when the price of the 790 got to 150 a couple of weeks ago I pulled the trigger.  I expected big things having read all the glowing reviews.  I surmised that if JC returned and needed a shaver, this is the model he would choose.  I thought I would be among the multitude of people singing it&#x27;s praises.  As it turns out I will not be in that choir.  It does seem to give me a shave that is close to, but possibly not closer to the much less expensive previously mentioned 320.  But I experienced whiskers being tugged at two or three times a shave.  This is painful and to be avoided if possible.  So I made sure that the shaver was clean, using the included system which I was familiar with from the older 8995.  I contorted my face and stretched out the skin and shaved in different directions to no avail.  So I went back to the 320 and found that it gave me a shave that was nearly as close, and possibly no worse than the 790 but without the pain.  The 320 had been sitting around and the head hadn&#x27;t been cleaned recently.  Keep in mind that the 320 head was several months old at this point.  Which means I&#x27;ll keep the 790 as a backup and go back to the 320s-4 as the primary.  I did not expect to dislike this shaver.  Please don&#x27;t hate me for dissing it.  It may just be me.  However, your genetics may be similar to mine causing you some discomfort just like me.  I write this review because I would want to read it myself.  I&#x27;m sure I would have purchased the 790 even if I had read this, but I would have remembered the reviewer fondly and hated myself for not listening.  This whole thing has me contemplating something I haven&#x27;t thought of doing for a couple of decades, which is to try a blade again.  You never know... it could happen.</li>
            <li> The finest electric yet that I have ever owned.  And such long battery life.</li>
            <li> The Braun Series 7-790cc gives a good shave in dry mode. It gives a great shave when using shaving cream. Although the Series 7 shouldn&#x27;t be used in the shower due to the cord plug-in area possibly getting water in it you certainly can use it over the sink. I first put Gillette Foamy shaving cream on my face and shave with the Braun. I then pull the Braun shaving head off and clean it under the faucet. I then put it back together and dry it off with a quick blast with my hair dryer. I follow up with more shaving cream on the face and quickly shave with a Gillette Fusion Power razor to hit some of the spots missed by the Braun mostly around the neck. The drag is so much less using the razor due to the Braun being used first. I then dry my face and quickly run the Braun in dry mode over my face again. Total time about 8 minutes. What you get is a shave that is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind. I can&#x27;t take credit for this method as someone in an earlier review spelled it out. I have to shave everyday as I have a tough beard. Although it is a little work the results are well worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not any better than the cheap razor I have!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Gives a close shave&lt;br /&gt;Head swivels to contour face&lt;br /&gt;Flip-up trimmer works well for sideburns&lt;br /&gt;Easy to Clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning fluid doesn&#x27;t last long and needs to be replaced every 1-2 months.&lt;br /&gt;Replacement cleaning fluid can be costly over life of razor.&lt;br /&gt;Can be difficult to shave the neck and some &#x27;tricky&#x27; spots.</li>
            <li> so good,It is very easy to shave the beard</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of electric shavers, I have a weird beard growing pattern on the neck area below the jawbone, so most of them do not work perfectly, this still is not perfect but with shaving in different angles! I manage to get a smooth shave. so far the best one I used, I am sure it works for most of men but I will definitely try new technologies in future</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if is the best out there because Im not going to buy and test all of them, other than that this is a great product I used it every day, I love it.</li>
            <li> I am African-American, does not give close shave</li>
            <li> I have found this to be the best electric razor and with adjustments for shaving closeness, it gives a close shave without irritation.</li>
            <li> BACKGROUND: I purchased the Braun Series 7 Model 797cc which is identical to the 790cc except for being specified in the manual as suitable for use in the shower which was a requirement for me. I bought this unit yesterday and used it just last night. It may be useful to point out that my beard is second to none in terms of being thick and wiry. I cannot even grow it out because it irritates my skin as though I have steel wool on my face anytime I touch it or lay my face on my pillow at night. Thus I must shave every couple of days (3 at the outside) or things quickly get uncomfortable. After days of research I found out that I needed the most powerful motor available for whatever model and brand I was going to buy to deal with my beard. I&#x27;ve had experience with lesser models of Braun in years past and they have performed OK but still would give me razor burn. Middle of the road Panasonics performed the same but the actual shave quality was not up to the level of a similar quality Braun model. I&#x27;ve been switching back and forth between my aging inexpensive Panasonic wet/dry and the Gillette Power Fusion blade (which is excellent) but decided to step up to a new electric and after much reading of reviews decided on the Braun Series 7 Model 797cc. As much based on my personal experience with their products over the years as the many available reviews.  REVIEW: The bottom line is that this shaver is hands down the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve used in the 62 years I&#x27;ve been shaving. Now understand that I&#x27;ve only used it once and that was last night when I shaved a 3 day growth. So this is not a longevity/ruggedness report. Amazingly, given the extra time it took to shave 3 days growth I experienced utterly zero trace of skin irritation. I do mean ZERO. This tool just seemed to vibrate the beard off rather than cutting it off. Because it was my first go with this razor and the fact that my beard had 3 days growth I expected that given my face was not used to this shaver i expected at least some problems in the irritation department. As I said I had no irritation whatsoever AND the best shave with an electric shaver ever. I would go so far as to say that it is easily 95% of what one would expect from a blade shave. I shaved last night, nearly 20 hours ago and my beard has only grown in as much as it does the day after a blade shave, if that. The lithium-ion battery level indicator was barely changed following the shave so if for some reason I didn&#x27;t have power available to charge the shaver I expect that I&#x27;d be able to get quite a few shaves out of it even with my heavy beard.  The cleaning mechanism looks to be decently designed. I tested it out ONCE and it appears to work as advertised. It comes with one cleaning cartridge which is a sturdy plastic container holding the liquid cleaner which is largely alcohol. These cartridges last about 8 weeks assuming one uses the cleaner every other day or so. They cost about $5 each so that&#x27;s about $2.50/month. I&#x27;m thinking even though the instructions say not to mix your own cleaning solution that I will do it anyway and see how it works. A guy on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;liMN23Xqcis) gives some great instructions on how to do this and where to get a reasonable cleaning mixture to add to some alcohol and thus cut the cost. The other obvious ongoing cost is the replacement of the cutter/comb head which doesn&#x27;t last forever and is recommended to be replaced every 18 months.  If things change further down the road with this shaver I will update my review but based on my personal experience with Braun products I would indeed be quite surprised to discover it to be a dud.  UPDATE 10-17-2014: I&#x27;ve been working this shaver hard the past 10 days and to get a shave quite close to that of a razor it does take some time. This used to be a major problem for me with electric shavers and in particular with the Norelco rotary types which would rub my skin raw trying to get a reasonably close shave. This shaver continues to allow me to spend as much time as I want to get the job done without the irritation. My heavy beard makes it necessary to work at it some after the bulk of the beard is shaved off. That is, trying to get as many of the &amp;#34;straggler hairs&amp;#34; as possible. I&#x27;ve discovered that doing the bulk of the shaving dry then hitting the shower with a dab of Gillette shave cream to clean up the stray hairs works best.  Obviously everybody&#x27;s beard is different and some shavers will work fine for one person and not so much for others. If your shaving experiences have been similar to mine then you have a much better than even chance of getting the same excellent performance as I from this shaver.  04-09-2015 UPDATE: The bottom line is that after 6 months of use this is STILL the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve had in 50+ years of shaving. I don&#x27;t miss the blade which is used for 15 years after giving up on electric shavers altogether. The cleaning system is also excellent and since it can be used in the shower I wash it in there and then run it through Braun&#x27;s cleanins system. That alone makes the solution last 6 months instead of just one month.</li>
            <li> Braun is still the best. I have strayed over the years and tried other brands only to always return to the King, just as Bud is the King of beers.</li>
            <li> Not Shaving well !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to move over and over, and even don&#x27;t shave well especially the neck&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;battery is very poor compared to my previous Philips</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers which while good for the money on the low end, leave me having to shave twice a day. I thought on seeing this razor that it might solve that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell you if exceeded my expectations. Mind you this is wet shaving using shaving gel, but by doing that, I get WAY closer than I was ever able to get with another electric razor. It&#x27;s so good that 24 hours later is like 8 hours later with the Norelco I was using (a cheap 30 dollar model when new so it&#x27;s not ther top of the line or anything).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry shaving the razor is good but not nearly as good. But wet shaving is outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned about the vibrate feature, but it must help because this thing does such a great job shaving. I was also concerned that I was wasting money on cleaning solution, but I love knowing the razor is clean and ready to go each morning. Honestly my only regret is not doing this sooner. Very happy with this razor.</li>
            <li> Used it twice now and get the best shave ever.</li>
            <li> this is my third braun shaver and this 7-790cc is by far the best so far. I love the cleaning system.fits very comfortlely in hand nice shape and design.best part about shaver is when your through shaving your skin is smooth.no problem with razor burn .a little bit over priced but well worth the money.battery last long enough for me to shave my face and head with lots left.</li>
            <li> I really like the feel and cut from this shaver.  I had a 7 series and went to the 3 series for a few years but am very glad I switched back.  The flex head allows the shaver to stay on the skin and the results are a smooth and clean shave.</li>
            <li> Little pricey but worth it.  read the reviews and saw it was top rated so took a chance...no regrets.  The cleaning is so easy and the shave is the best I have ever had from electric razor.</li>
            <li> This is the second one my husband has had. He loves it. He wouldn&#x27;t use any other razor. Will continue to use this type.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I read reviews about how it was great for African Americans. While I had reservations about the price, I pulled the trigger anyway in hopes of finally getting a bump free shaving experience, but it just didn&#x27;t work out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started out in the lowest setting and found it too weak to properly give anything even remotely close to a shave. I then waited a few days and experimented with the higher power settings, neither of which were impressive considering the price and the hype about this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to taking longer to shave AND leaving way too much hair on my face, I started seeing bumps. Big nasty ugly bumps which I was trying to avoid in the first place. To make matter&#x27;s worse, the unit stopped powering up after just after my 4th use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize this thing has been touted by many reviewers as great for Black men, and I&#x27;m sure it works for some of us, but I&#x27;d like to throw out a word of caution out there to anyone buying it just for that reason. I am thankful that Amazon was willing to take care of the refund very smoothly.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a trimmer.</li>
            <li> First electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  While not a blade close shave, it provides a very nice result.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product. Provides a very nice clean shave.</li>
            <li> Getting a close shave is possible but it takes me many repetitions over the same area to achieve it.</li>
            <li> Extraordinary shaver.  My husband has never had it so good.  Earlier reviews were thorough enough that I could shop intelligently for the product, and they were accurate.  He has a very tough beard, but this shaver gets rid of it beautifully.  We can kiss again without my feeling I&#x27;ve been too close to a porcupine.  And the smile on his face...priceless.</li>
            <li> Best razor available for the price. Period.</li>
            <li> As a Panasonic user, I was reluctant to change to Braun, but made the move because it rated so high on the &amp;#34;closest shave&amp;#34;.  It was a positive change, it has the closest shave and never harms the skin.  I love this shaver!</li>
            <li> First off, ive been shaving for about 16 yrs now, the first 13 with a reg. mach 3 style razor and it worked fine, but it got too expesive which led me on a search for a cheaper alternative. Ive used the cheaper &amp;#34;mobile&amp;#34; electric razors and the the more expensive Norelco ones that spit out shaving gel. I think it was the nivea one and it worked great but finally I found a good deal on this 790cc from braun and its by far the best razor ive ever used. It takes me about 3 mins to shave down my stubble and have a completely shaven face. If I have no stubble to knock down first it takes me a min and a half. The  locking mechanism works great for under my nose and I can adjust the power level down for a more concentrated less aggravated feel. This is the only shaver ive used that I don&#x27;t have to keep going back over my neck area. Just one pass of up and down , left and right and im done. Then I just put it in the self cleansing system it comes with and hit a button and it determines how much it needs to be cleaned, whether it needs to be charged or not and it dows all that with the touch of a button. The next time I reach for it I have a lemon fresh practically brand new shaver to work with. It even relubes the shaver which is something that in the past I have neglected with my shears and things like that. This is no nonsense work and it takes the guess work out of shaving. Plus you get a 7 yr warranty so you know you get your moneys worth. The only problem is, its likely to last about 20 yrs and once the new cooler shaver comes out you wont have a reason to buy it bc youll have this shaver for a long , long time to come . Ladies this is a great gift for Christmas coming up and braun just knocked 40 bucks off the price. Any man would LOVE to have this for a present so grab this up. Its a no-brainer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this razor for approximately 18 months and use is daily. For the money I spent I expected a unit that would last at least a few years. After one head change the finish on the pivoting head is flaking off, the locking function broke, then the locking button completely broke off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected far better craftsmanship from Braun. The razor still shaves as expected but again, when you spend the money to buy a top of the line razor you expect it to last more than 18 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave no irritation LOVE it.</li>
            <li> for a electric it does its job phenomenally well! I shave every day and used to use a blade and the only area that I have to do multiple passes on is my chin and it becomes smooth just like a blade</li>
            <li> I have had a beard for the past forty some years and as a result have only trimmed. For all intents and purposes this is my first electric razor. I now shave every day. I have nothing to compare it to but it gives a good clean shave in 3 or 4 minutes time with no snagging or pulling. The noise level is acceptable. I am not overly fond of the cleaning system since while sitting on the vanity countertop it makes quite a bit of noise during its cleaning cycle. My biggest complaint is that I, the user have no say in the length or duration of the cleaning cycle. It seems to count the on/off cycles to determine the depth of the cleaning cycle which is a poor way to determine in my book. Other than that minor complaint it appears to be an excellent shaver.</li>
            <li> Cuts close and fast. Very happy with how it shaves my neck. Not as quiet as a rotary but quieter than Panasonic and older Bruan models.</li>
            <li> Husband says it is the beat razor he has ever had!</li>
            <li> Good price for the product,lot less noisy than my last one .</li>
            <li> I like very much for its good quality.</li>
            <li> Got it for a good price. Works as well as my old standby 8987 model which is not available any more and the replacement parts are either poorly made or way too expensive. SO FAR SO GOOD.</li>
            <li> nice gift foe father.</li>
            <li> Shave is not noticeably different from 3-blade razor.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is what i really want amzing i love it</li>
            <li> I like it. It&#x27;s doing what I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li> Good shaver, little noisy, hard to just recharge without the cleaning process.</li>
            <li> Tried Panasonic but came back to Braun. Like it.</li>
            <li> Outstanding service with a great price. Thanks</li>
            <li> This shaver by far is the greatest thing since sliced bread!!!!</li>
            <li> While no electric razor I&#x27;ve tried is as smooth as shaving with cream and a blade, this shaver does a pretty good job.  My beard is fairly thick, so if I let it go for more than 2-3 days there&#x27;s some tugging as I shave, but this razor does it faster and better than previous razors I&#x27;ve tried.  Been using it for 2 months and am happy with its performance.  I have noticed in the last week that the head doesn&#x27;t pivot as easily as it did before but that&#x27;s pretty minor.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric shaver that I have ever owned. I even bought one for my father to try and he loves it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for husband in last month. He loves it and enjoy any time he uses it</li>
            <li> Closest shave in 60 years with an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been shaving with electric razors for 60 years.  All were with rotary razors except for 4 years with a screen razor about 25 years ago.  I then went back to rotary razors.  This razor seems to be kinder to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging station has a replaceable tank of cleaning liquid that cleans and lubricates the razor.  I find this a convenient feature that does a better job than a brush or hot water with less mess.  The tank costs about $4 and needed to be replaced after about 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this razor for three months and am completely satisfied</li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of electric razors. I think I could get a better shave with a disposable razor.</li>
            <li> Got this for my boyfriend and he is extremely impressed with the results. He thought that He would have to shave after but that was not the case. The shaver leaves your face super smooth and when he is done it&#x27;s holder is self cleaning. And then Boom your done!!</li>
            <li> Great shave.  This always gives a nice close clean shave.  It is also surprisingly quiet.  This is very easy to clean and take care of.</li>
            <li> i like how this product preforms it takes away the discomfort of shaving the only thing is the start button needs to be pressed extremely hard for it to start i don&#x27;t know if its like that from factory or its a defect but i don&#x27;t like it, i was thinking about returning it and i still might. i had a previous series braun and i liked that one to but it didn&#x27;t offer a completely clean shave so i got the 7 series braun it does the job but the button needs improvement.</li>
            <li> Great razor. replaced my old braun razor. Shaves almost like a blade razor .Hope it last as long as my old one.</li>
            <li> Enormous improvement over prior year&#x27;s models.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband to replace his 5-yr old version that was broken.  However, it still shaves so he is still using the old one.  I will say I love the carrying case that came with this one because we use it for travel and it&#x27;s really cool.  Way better than the plastic version we got 5 years ago.</li>
            <li> Shaver was very irritating to my skin. I returned the shaver to Braun for a refund..</li>
            <li> does not give close shave.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, I admit it.  My previous 360/5-series has lasted me a long time, been repaired once and kept right on truckin&#x27;.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better or more reliable razor.  Looked around, sampled the other big brand with rotating heads, then found this one with a promotion.  Wow, have to say it&#x27;s worth the price - would have paid the full price without the promotion.  Shave is so perfect and close, easy to clean, great ergonomics....my old one retired, and I&#x27;m not looking back.&lt;br /&gt;If you get it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Philips rotary shavers for over 25 years and needed to buy a new head - the RQ-12 head is practically unavailable so I impulsively bought the BRAUN 7-series.  Good move.  Expensive but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past I&#x27;d found that Braun foil shavers were not good with longer hairs - so if I went a couple of days without shaving I&#x27;d have to use a blade.  Not any more - the Ser. 7 gives a really close shave, almost as good as a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PHILIPS v. BRAUN.  The Philips shaver is designed to be used in a rotary motion;  I find this difficult to do whilst holding my skin taut.  It is also hard to shave in hot weather when my skin is not entirely dry.  Almost every day I&#x27;d have to finish off using a blade razor in the shower because the Philips just wasn&#x27;t close enough, especially along the jawbone.&lt;br /&gt;Like many guys over 50, I take blood thinners and it&#x27;s just not worth the risk using a blade razor.  Once I bleed, it doesn&#x27;t stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BRAUN is different than the PHILIPS, because:&lt;br /&gt;(1)  it&#x27;s bigger and noisier - not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2)  it doesn&#x27;t have the sculptured handle that the Philips has - again, not a problem&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3)  it shaves in a straight line (unlike the rotary motion that Philips specifies) - much easier to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(4)  the new head design (well, newer than 25 years ago) actually cuts slightly longer hairs at least as well as the Philips.  That means if I don&#x27;t shave every day I can still use the Braun without resorting to a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(5)  BRAUN has an intensity control - a really nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(6)  the cleaning machine/ charging base works well to leave the razor head feeling like new.  The base is bulky and takes up precious bathroom space, but it&#x27;s worth it knowing that the razor is clean and lubricated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(7)  A note about the \\&quot;hygiene display\\&quot; -  this suggests that the shaver needs a full cleaning almost every day, which is what BRAUN state in the instruction booklet. They also state that the cleaning cartridge is good for about 30 cleanings, and that it should be replaced at least every 8 weeks because the lubricant will settle to the bottom of the solution.&lt;br /&gt;I have a light beard, and have settled on cleaning once or twice per week at most.</li>
            <li> Love it . best shaver I have ever had. Great battery life. Goes at least 2 wks shaving daily</li>
            <li> Wish I would have read the other 1 star reviews before I bought this razor. I love the cleaning station, razor looks &amp; feels great in hand. One problem, my old Remington MS 290 that I bought for $50 at Wal-Mart shaves MUCH closer than this 7-790cc. I am very disappointed and will be sending back to Braun for a refund. 9/21/2014.</li>
            <li> This is a Christmas present so do not know if they will like.</li>
            <li> Definitely a step back for Braun. I think they were trying to save some production costs with this model. Have used prior versions of this shaver/cleaner-base from Braun and was very pleased; the only reason I bought this one was because my previous model finally died after five years. This one... not as good. The cleaner-base leaves residue on the shaver that must be wiped off. The blade foil cover pops off too easily when shaving if your face is damp from the shower and thus a little sticky. The cleaning base feels cheaper, seems to go through the fluid cartridge quicker, and doesn&#x27;t do as well at cleaning itself down in the shaver well. And doesn&#x27;t give me that &amp;#34;as close to a razor&amp;#34; feel that my last model did. And again, all these comments are comparing it to the Series 5.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot! This is the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned that actually can cut my beard and leave a pretty close feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I got it!</li>
            <li> Great Item! Highly recommand!!</li>
            <li> After going through numerous Philips Norelco shavers, I finally decided to cough up the money for a Braun. My biggest problem with Norelco is they kept pulling, allllll the time, even though they were never suppose to. Anyway, I got this and it has been a dream. Never pulls, cleans it well, it works, different sensitivity settings. It&#x27;s great, can&#x27;t complain at all and if you&#x27;re looking for an electric razor, this is it.</li>
            <li> Just got and it mowed down a 6 day beard! Very impressed. Fastest and smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Really quietest Braune yet. Still have my Braun 8595 that has served me well for many years but was never this good even when new. (retiring it to my country house where it will still be called upon now and again.) The 8595 works best with the 30b foil/cutter BTW. Have tried many razors and blades in my lifetime of 50+ years of shaving. Only the Braun&#x27;s could deal with my face. First one I had was a &amp;#34;Sixtant&amp;#34; that I had some one bring over from Europe long before they went on sale here. It was the only one that did not leave my face raw if I got a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;So! Yes! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Works great.  Arrived sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> Nice price with frustration-free package. Great touch, and material. Unluckily, cleaning liquid cannot board on air</li>
            <li> it cannot clean my beard at all.</li>
            <li> Bad for thick hair. keep yanking my hair, I will return it as soon as possible.</li>
            <li> Bought this razor for my Dad &amp; he loves it, especially the cleaning station!</li>
            <li> 3rd Braun I&#x27;ve owned, they just keep getting better &amp; better.</li>
            <li> It takes longer to shave, but very satisfied with this shaver</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Braun, my last one finally went out and I bought a Remington. It worked ok, but never liked it like my previous Braun, it still worked but, had to switch back to Braun. This one works really well and the cleaning feature seems to work better than my last Braun, needless to say I&#x27;m quiet Satisfied :-)</li>
            <li> Good gift for my 32nd  birthday. however some suggestions for Amazon online. Please wrote more detail informations of goods as possible as you can, that like be origin, what kind of material, technical. In that case the buyer will realize and judge the goods been meet the requirements of buyer on Amazon online.</li>
            <li> So far I have 0 complaints I love this thing.  I know its a little pricey but you get what you paid for!</li>
            <li> Purchased it for a friend &amp; he is very satisfied with the shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  Worth every penny!  Sorry I waited so long to order it.</li>
            <li> Great quality, poor flip up trimmer.  Love the shave!</li>
            <li> The razor is everything i expected. It was great and no problems to report. I would recommend this product and in my opinion the price was worth it, I am very happy with this razor.</li>
            <li> I am giving this shaver 4 stars out of 5 because although I love the way it shaves and it is well made I dislike its ergonomics compared with my 10 year-old Braun which this one replaced (the old one broke after many years of use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I dislike the pop up trimmer&#x27;s angle straight out of the body of the shaver...it&#x27;s awkward to use on my moustache that way.&lt;br /&gt;2) The old Braun had a more useful display than the one on the bottom of this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;3) The status lights on the charger/cleaner base go out afterr a few minutes so to see if it is clean or needs to be cleaned, or how full the reservoir is you have to remove the shaver for a few seconds and re-insert it&lt;br /&gt;4) The old shaver came with a hard travel case...the new one is soft and cheapened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as I said, the shaver itself works well and for me Braun shavers give the closest shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jay</li>
            <li> Oh dear does this razor work well.  It fits well in my hand, the adjusting features work well and it gets the hair off my face.  It does not matter if I skip a day, it is fine.  This is my third Braun over some twenty years and I freely admit this is better than the last, which was better than the first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW - I got a super price from Amazon, especially with the $30.00 coupon.</li>
            <li> So unexpected!Shaving more than Gillette clean!</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s not bad but as usual it is not that clean as a regular razor</li>
            <li> My favorite electric razor!  Very comfortable.  The cleaning is nice too.  If you take the screen off and tap the dust out before cleaning, the solution stays even cleaner.  If you get the three pack of solution it should last a year +.  Good quality and shave is just as close as a blade. I have acne prone skin and this helps a lot.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and would recommend it. I upgraded from an old Panasonic and thought I would give Braun a try. Never looked back. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Not worth the cost for me.  I have thick beard on my neck and this razor struggles to shave it,  works great on my cheeks and lip area tho</li>
            <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve had in the last 10 years .... Since my old Braun bit the dust and I went to another brand. Big mistake. I&#x27;d recommend this shaver to everyone.</li>
            <li> Cannot get a close shave with this razor.  The cleaning station does not do a very good job, I have to remove the head and rinse it under a faucet.  The head swivel lock broke before long.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great shaver works well on thick beards.</li>
            <li> The shaver gave me a very close shave.  I like the fact that I don&#x27;t have to manually clearn the shaver.  I&#x27;m going to be spoiled.</li>
            <li> I love it---it does a very good job.</li>
            <li> Update 8/10/2015;  As stated below this razor was a 5 star rating when I bought it 10 months ago.  If the replacement foil had been designed like the original, it would still be a 5 star.  However, I now can only get a couple of months out of the shaver head.  The holes in the foil are only of one kind and do not let hair into it well.  After shaving over the same area 10 times, I still have a beard and I do not have a heavy beard.  The original had multiple configuration holes.  There is not a replacement head configured like the original on the market.  WHAT WAS BRAUN THINKING.    I give up.  A new head every 2 months is out of the question at $33 a head. I have ordered and received a Norelco 4500 and it shaves close in just a few passes and the replacement heads are about $20 each.  Oct 2015; I had the Series 5 and the Series 7 gives a much, much closer shave, plus the additional adjustments for a closer shave is great.  Besides the overpricing, the only down side so far is I wish there was a way to disassemble the shave head for easier cleaning under a water faucet.  I do use my Water Pic sometimes to clean the head between the times I use the system cleaning.  In the Series 5 I had to replace the shave head every 3 or 4 months.  The Series 7 states it should last 18 months.  I am only into month 2, so we&#x27;ll see.   Update: May 8, 2015.  It has been 6 months since my razor arrived.  I have been completely satisfied with it except for one thing.  As expected there is no way the shaver head will last 18 months before needing to be changed, unless you do not want a quick close shave.  For the last month I have had to go over my face many times to get a decent shave.  Today I changed shaver heads and it was back to a quick close shave again.  I do not have a thick beard.  I think part of the problem is the shaver head is a one piece unit and you cannot remove the blades for cleaning.  A head that lasts 6 months is fine with me.  The new shaver head I bought is made in Germany and seems to be a quality product.</li>
            <li> Works better than I expected</li>
            <li> It takes longer to go over and over my face.  My old Philips was faster and skipped less.</li>
            <li> Shaves as close as a blade except under my neck which I need to finish it off with a blade. Otherwise, it&#x27;s an excellent electric shaver and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Excellent shave quality.&lt;br /&gt;Have only had for a few weeks so will update as required.</li>
            <li> I got this thing a month ago. I grow a thick beard and even after not shaving for a few days this thing cuts it off quickly and without pulling. The clean and renew system is a winner too. My razor comes out clean and shiny. A great investment for guys that grow a lot of facial hair and hate wasting time in the mornings.</li>
            <li> Love it, took about 3 weeks to get to me but love the razor.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. It is indeed superior to other Braun models. I got brown 3 series for Christmas, however, I was not happy with the performance, there were flat spots on my face that braun 3 could not handle and had to finish it with the razor. I shaved with braun 790 as soon as I got it out of the package, the whole shaving experince was smooth, took less time to shave with no leftover hair residue or skin irritation. Other cool features are digital screen, variable shaving sensitivity but not necessity. Also it&#x27;s not necessary to use the cleaning solution after each use, there are other ways to clean it. My friend owned his braun 790 for 2 years and cleaned with brush and water each time, works like champ. However, you still need to lubricate the shaver head with oil once in a while if cleaning with water</li>
            <li> A great product from braun</li>
            <li> My husband very much likes his Braun.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why anybody would ever consider shaving with any other device.</li>
            <li> Not as clean of a shave as with a razor but good enough to appear shelved and professional at work. Much less skin irritation compared to the razor if used every day.</li>
            <li> Close shave feels almost as clean as a shave with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;A little harder to clean manually than I would have expected (as when you are on a trip), but very satisfied with the automatic cleaning done by the re-charging base.</li>
            <li> Returned. Husband did not like.</li>
            <li> What took 45 minutes now only takes 10.  Sharp and fast.  Love it.  Should have invested in this 790cc model much sooner.  Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It performs adequately for an electric shaver.  None of them will ever be as close and as smooth s a good blade shave.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very good shaver and I&#x27;m very happy for this purchase.</li>
            <li> Quiet, smooth and easy to use.  Cleans easily with the touch of a finger.  Replaced my 10-year old Braun and the technical advancement is apparent.  No faults to report.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re expensive and irritated my face. Not recommended. I use the Philips Norelco BG2040 for face and down there. Two for one.</li>
            <li> Love this thing gives the close shave I want without user a razer</li>
            <li> Great razor. Gives a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> The razor gives a good shave, thought no better than the 39.95 ones for sale. It has a lot of extras like a self cleaning kit with a stand  that I will never use. I do like the fact that it holds a charge forever and when it does need recharged it only takes one hour to fully recharge.</li>
            <li> Have used for only a short time, but so far has worked as advertised  I especially like the cleaning feature and the design that allows cleaning and charging in the same stand. The adjustable head from easy to close works well and i get a good shave. I have had a beard fro 30 years and except from trimming I have not shaved, but the Braun makes it easy and convenient..</li>
            <li> Works very well.  I have had electric razors before an been disappointed with the closeness of the shave...not this time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I like the way you can set it in the base and it cleans itself.  No monkeying around with it to clean it.  Just press the button and off you go.  Its all ready to go the next time you need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great gift for dad!</li>
            <li> For years, I have used Braun electric shavers and by far, this is the best one i&#x27;ve had.  It works quite nicely, the only downside is that the cleaning mode is loud.  However, there is an easy remedy: push the clean button on it then leave the bathroom and go to work so you don&#x27;t have to hear it clean :-)</li>
            <li> I looked at all of the major brands of electric razors and choose from the customer recommendations. The razor cleans itself after every shave and maintains hygienic perfection. The razor shaves close without irritation and then will analyze the amount of cleaning and charging that is necessary to return the razor to it&#x27;s adequate performance levels.</li>
            <li> very nice ,just the cleaning cartridge is quite expensive</li>
            <li> This unit works very efficiently.  It is expensive and the maintenance is a bit annoying compared to the old non-fluid reservoir models.  The cost of these fluid reservoirs is a pain.  Good shave though.</li>
            <li> Sort of OK shave when it catches the beard just right..&lt;br /&gt;Having used a triple head Norelco for years, it may take some time to adjust.&lt;br /&gt;Also where do the trimming go between cleanings??? Mystery?</li>
            <li> Excellent product, it sure comes to its cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use, no injuries in the face anymore. Wonderful cleaning system, which cleans automatically in about 20 minutos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;60 minutes battery life, which takes a lot of using days until it&#x27;s over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product, I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I replaced my Norelco rotary.  This provides a close shave and the cleaning system works well.  Charge lasts for about one week.</li>
            <li> Not impressed. I prefer my Norellco. Shave is not close enough and the cleaning is more cumbersome than the Norellco. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my husband - He didn&#x27;t make it easy - But mission accomplished because he loved this one!</li>
            <li> Works great for my husband whose hair is really thick. The self cleaning function is cool</li>
            <li> I realize now that I prefer the shave from a blade.  This thing is too weak too shave my head.  I feel mislead by the good reviews.  If I don&#x27;t get a refund, this thing will only be used to shave my pubes.  I would sell mine that I used twice so far, and not to shave my pubes yet for 150$.  Message me herbiegforever@yahoo.com.  .</li>
            <li> Quick, close, comfortable shaves. Makes life so much easier.</li>
            <li> Best shaver worth the money</li>
            <li> I expected more, to be honest.  Maybe I&#x27;ve just been using a razor too long...</li>
            <li> Fantastic razor! Been using it for 2yrs and its still going strong.</li>
            <li> Excellent machine, i have had Braun shavers for the past 10 years and this is the best i have seen, solid - powerful, good technology and an easy clean shave, i am very happy with this product</li>
            <li> Meets just about every expectation.</li>
            <li> Great shaver, the plug-in adapter makes a surprising high pitch noise when your shaver is charging, which worried me when I first plugged in my shaver, but all my research on the internet suggests its normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself some money too, don&#x27;t run a clean cycle after every shave.  I clean one or two times a week and don&#x27;t notice a difference in operation compared to daily cleaning.</li>
            <li> Overall: Wonderful purchase. Would buy again and would recommend to others. Bought as a replacement for my previous 5 series I owed for many years. I tried many other brands and even a few rotary style. I am very glad I tried this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Efficient and clean. It shaves closely with minimal passes. The cleaner works well and last much longer than the previous models. The shave as a whole is much better than competitors and will not go back to a rotary style shaver. I like that you can use the heat function to clean and then use the shaver soon after. Comfortable to hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The cleaner is a little louder than I would like so I often wait to run the cleaner to later in the day so I don&#x27;t wake up my wife in the adjacent room. The pulsonic feature of the shaver doesn&#x27;t seem to make a huge difference on occasional use but I do notice a difference from using this feature when I use the shaver as a daily shave. (I shave Mon-Saturday, often twice a day but skip Sunday and don&#x27;t notice a difference on Monday.) The shaver does get warm if you use it for too long.</li>
            <li> One of the few shavers that pulls hair when they are bit long, painful and makes me nervous with every shave.  Trimmer blocks the view do you can&#x27;t see what you are trimming, absolutely the worst shaver ever had, a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Have used electric shavers for a long time. Shifted over to razors to get that smooth face feeling but the cost and waste was too much so was looking to try a shaver again. This one is the best I&#x27;ve ever had. Not brand new razor smooth but close. I plan on replacing the head every two months to keep it at it&#x27;s best</li>
            <li> this item is great. This is the best shave i have ever had by a portable shaver..</li>
            <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve ever had every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I owned an older Braun series 7,but this new series by Braun is even better. This is the only shaver I have found over the years that does not cause irritation and still gives me a good shave.    Excellent shaver for travel, the battery last a long time. The daily cleaning module is very good in cleaning the shaver. This shaver is another excellent product by Braun.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for a couple of months. I find it does not give a quick shave nor does it give a close shave. With this razor I have stubble by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have actually gone back to my $30 rotary razor and it gives a much better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So disappointed in the shave  this $200 razor gives.</li>
            <li> This is about as good as it gets when shaving with an electric shaver and I&#x27;ve had them all (Panasonic 8243A, Norelco Sensotouch 3D 1280, Norelco AT895, Braun Series 7 760). Why so many shavers? I have a passion for electric shavers and when a new shaver comes out, I generally have to try it. I&#x27;ve been shaving now for 50 years so this is not something I come to without experience. I read some negative reviews and invariably they reveal one thing: ignorance of the shaving process so permit me to share a bit of what I&#x27;ve learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, all modern electric shavers are going to deliver the goods, albeit some may be more irritating to the face/neck than others. In general you will find that it takes at least three weeks for your face to adjust to the new shaver so persevere and do not go back and forth with your older razor/shaver. Shave against the grain and using a foil like this Braun, shave in straight motions and at 90 degrees to the face. There is no need for any pre-shave but it is important to shave in relatively dry conditions in order to achieve good glide with the shaver. I find that shaving a half hour after my shower provides the best overall shave, however if that is not an option, shave before showering. With a Braun you press the shaver moderately against the face unlike a Norelco which requires a very light touch. If  you press too hard you&#x27;re going to end up irritating your face and neck. Finally, shave until your face &amp;#34;looks&amp;#34; clean rather than &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; smooth. The problem with the latter is that you&#x27;ll continue to shave too long in order to achieve that baby butt smoothness and this will result in irritation. Eventually as your face adjusts to the new shaver you can lengthen the shave and shave to that smooth feel, about ten minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun is a superb example of German craftsmanship. It has the right heft to the shaver and there is no plasticky feel to it as there is with a Panasonic. The noise level is moderate (i.e. not as quiet as the Norelco and not as noisy as the Panasonic). It will take either the Smart or the Opti foil cartridges but I think you will find the Opti foil to deliver a better shave. Because the shaver&#x27;s blades cannot be accessed due to the cartridge nature, the cleaning module is a must. Yes, it can be rinsed under the tap but that really doesn&#x27;t provide the best cleaning NOR does it lubricate the shaver&#x27;s cutters. You can, of course, use the oil that Braun provides (a drop rubbed onto the foil once a week) but the cleaning module is a much more elegant solution.  Some people argue that using the cleaning module is too expensive but here is my take on that. Three cleaning cartridges run about $20 so a single will run about $7 and last you one month &amp;#34;if&amp;#34; you use the cleaning module on a daily basis. Isn&#x27;t your face worth a couple of coffees a month? When I pick up my shaver each morning, it is like a brand new shaver... clean, smelling fresh, properly sanitized. You can, of course, use the cleaning module once or twice a week and recap the cartridge to prevent evaporation thereby extending the life of the cartridge. That is for you to decide what is best for you and your budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I could not be happier with my new Braun 790 cc.</li>
            <li> I waited far too long to make this purchase.  It is superior to my eleven year old Braun.  This is an excellent device.  It works well on my seventy-two year old face.</li>
            <li> My son is very self conscious about his razor burn on his neck. He&#x27;s tried all different razors creams lotion etc. this has made a drastic change in the appearance of his skin!</li>
            <li> I bought two of these for my sons as Christmas gifts this year.  They were so happy to receive them.  I did a ton of research: online merchants, consumer product rating agencies and in stores too.  I finally decided on this Braun.  My sons have told me this shaver is such an upgrade from the Braun shavers that I bought for them a few years ago.  They said the shaver provides a clean, close, no-nicks shave.  So, looks like I made a good decision.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it that much yet, but all in all it&#x27;s what we expected.  Prompt shipping was a plus...will know more about it after using it for a longer period of time.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Getting good use from it. Cleaning is a little pain in the butt even with the cleaning kit. Other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Very nice but complicated.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve used an electric shaver and a regular razor because the electrics just don&#x27;t quite get there. My old cheap, terrible, electric razor died and I decided to look for a high-end electric razor. Naturally, I read the reviews here and elsewhere before purchasing this product. I was favorably impressed with the reviews, some of which were about reliability and ease of use. All of these (so far) have held true. I was especially impressed with how comfortable the razor feels in my hand, even when cranked up to the highest setting. Similarly I was impressed with how smooth it can be on the low settings. I only got a few red marks my first time out, and I am confident that was user error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the reviews, however, mention that this razor shaves &amp;#34;as close as a blade.&amp;#34; This is total malarky (false). I seriously doubt any electric shaver will get to be as close as a regular shave, but this one certainly does not. I am pretty proficient at using electric razors, and this one is seriously faster than anything I have used before, but it is nowhere close to a blade. Still, it&#x27;s a decent shave all around, and the only ones who will likely notice the difference (besides me) will be my 10 month old and my wife. For now, I&#x27;ll call it a good choice, but not a great choice.</li>
            <li> Great razor!  I purchased this item to replace another Braun razor I had used for approximately five years.  It is far better than the last razor and cuts very close.  I highly recommend this product to anyone choosing an electric razor.</li>
            <li> Awesome shaver.  Got this to replace my old Series 3 shaver which died on me.  This one does a MUCH better job of getting all those curly gray hairs.  I like the new Cleaning system too - just drop the Shaver in.  This model is noisier than my old Shaver, but no big deal.</li>
            <li> Excellent in all respects. Last Braun razor was bought in 2004.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the price though. Earlier models cut closer. If I had used it enough early on I would have returned it.&lt;br /&gt;Not the expected Braun quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this on sale to replace my 8 year old series 6.  It was time for a new foil and blade on the old one which amounts to 1/3 of the cost of this new.  So instead of replacing the parts I decided it was time for a new model, thinking the series 7 would be an upgrade.  I ready other reviews which mentioned Braun being bought by another company and the quality going down and I&#x27;d have to agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old series 6 shaved closer, and didn&#x27;t require as many passes to get it all (or the face contortion).  The bells and whistles of this top of the line model are moot if it doesn&#x27;t shave close.  I&#x27;m keeping the shaver as it does the job, but I can guarantee you the series 7 will not be with me half as long as the last series 6.  Next time around I&#x27;ll give the Panasonic a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several prior electric shavers, including prior models from Braun. My last shaver was a Braun that finally wore out after about 6 years of daily use (and several droppings!).  I like the feel of this shaver.  Love the one-piece foil/cutting block.  This is a big improvement from my last Braun shaver that had a two piece foil/cutting block.  Shave is more comfortable with less skin irritation and closer shave.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;m writing a review for any product on Amazon but I think this one really warrants 5 stars from me. I have a super sensitive skin (it was sensitive to the best of the razors) to an extent that even if I shaved on consecutive days, I would have rashes on neck area. I tried the best of razors and foams/gels but in the end gave up. I&#x27;ve had a horrible experience with one of the philips&#x27; electric razors a few years ago and I had pretty much given up on electric razors. I bought this one on a whim and just to replace my razor when I&#x27;m travelling and boy am I glad. I haven&#x27;t touched razor since this arrived. I follow the instructions and get a really close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I bought this. No more rashes or cuts. I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is on the Model 7-790cc which I&#x27;ve had for over 2 years now. -SEE MY LAST UPDATE AT THE BOTTOM.-    My previous shaver was a high end Norelco and after many years I thought I&#x27;d try something different. They both shave great so I wont go into that. There are lots of reviews on how it shaves. I just have a few problems with the Braun design.    The first thing is the vibration. That was a shock after using the absolutely smooth Norelco with the rotating cutters. Not that bad, just a surprise.    The only way to clean it is in it&#x27;s cleaning stand. There is no way to clean it thoroughly when traveling. Running it under hot water does the job I guess because you can&#x27;t take the shaving head apart. I could open the Norelco cutters up and clean them.    The cleaning indicator on the shaver seems to just count the number of shaves you&#x27;ve done and not how dirty it is.    Always using the stand, never lets the shaver discharge. The indicator never shows less than a full charge. I have no idea how long it would last if I took it on a long trip. It&#x27;s also debatable if keeping a NiCad battery fully charged is good for it.    The cleaning base does take up a lot of room. It is all about 9\\&quot; tall, but if you put it in a cabinet, you will need about 10.5\\&quot; to get it in and out of the base.    The cleaning cycle is loud. I keep it in a cabinet in the bathroom but my wife still says \\&quot;what&#x27;s that?\\&quot; from the living room when I clean it and the shaver cycles on &amp; off several times.    To cut down on the expense of the Braun cleaning cartridges, I tried a larger refill but the liquid doesn&#x27;t seem to clean or lubricate it as well as the Braun cartridges. I found I get the best cleaning from an ultrasonic cleaner and then use some electric shaver lubricant I had.    UPDATE 10/2014: I have stopped using the cleaning base. I plug the power cord from the base directly into the shaver for charging. The charge on the batteries seems to last forever. I don&#x27;t even bother with the ultrasonic cleaner anymore. I just remove the head, blast it with hot water in the kitchen sink, let it dry and put electric shaver lubricant on it before I use it. Of course the indicator always says it needs cleaning because the base is what resets it. I just make sure to clean it once a week.</li>
            <li> After shaving with a multi blade scraper the last 10 years I finally made the move back to electric and this one didnt disappoint. Nice close shave and no irritation even though I have sensitive skin. I would have given it 5 stars but I feel the cleaning system is somewhat of a scam. I give the razor a quick brush clean after every shave and then do the electric clean every third or fourth shave to hopefully prolong the cleaning cartridge refills. I&#x27;ll try to come back and update after a few more months, but all in all I am please with how it has performed.</li>
            <li> The product was terribly damaged when i opened it. The charger was broken badly, however the box was undamaged. I am not sure how that would happen.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of electric razors out there. And in my opinion, Braun beats them all. They are great on all types of skin - and give a pretty darn close shave.&lt;br /&gt;The 7 series is high quality and has some features that separate it from lower numbered series. I like the clean and renew - makes cleaning it much more easier and hygenic (if you remember the old loosen the top and let it run to clean hair out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun is gentle on your skin and great for close shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: It may not get used to your skin and stubble on the first try - even though it will still give a good shave. Give it a few tries and then it becomes easier and easier.</li>
            <li> IT IS SUCH AN AMAZING TOOL for my husband. He uses it 2 times per day. Just buy it, you shouldn&#x27;t miss it.</li>
            <li> This shaver is fun to use.  It gives a fairly close shave.  Very powerful to use.</li>
            <li> I had used two Norelco rotary (tri-head) shavers in the past, but took several years off and used only disposable razors (Mach III - XV, and counting).  I left electric shavers because they irritated my neck to no end.  I reluctantly decided to give the Braun a try and have enjoyed the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives a surprisingly smooth shave and I have had zero neck irritation. This is my first experience with a foil razor, but, so far, I really like it.  Very nice looking machine; feels good in the hand (a heavy, expensive feel), and glides well across the face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The docking station is a bit bulky and the power cord juts awkwardly out of the outlet when plugged in, but not intolerably so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor isn&#x27;t exactly quiet, but the steady hum of the Braun foil is far more acceptable than the chunky buzzing of the Norelco rotary.  The docking station is a bit loud when cleaning the razor, but the audible part of the cleaning lasts for only a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one disappointing thing about this system is that the \\&quot;hygiene status indicator\\&quot; always shows that the razor needs cleaning, even immediately after a cleaning session.  I have removed the head and visually inspected the razor and it looks perfectly clean, but the indicator, apparently, doesn&#x27;t quite agree.  Oh well -- a minor annoyance for an otherwise outstanding shaving system.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shaver. I do not find it too noisy, as some stated. It shaves very close and cleans itself very well!</li>
            <li> This is my third Braun razor with self cleaning docking station and I haven&#x27;t had any issues.  The first one lasted about 10 years, which just died recently, causing me to purchase this one and handing down my four year old (same basic model, only in white) system to my teenage son.  Even with the addition of the sensitivity options, the cut is the same as the older model, which was a bit disappointing after reading the marketing hype.  I suppose I&#x27;ll never own an electric that can cut as close as a manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m convinced that the hygiene meter means absolutely nothing.  It seems to tick down based off of times used, rather than how dirty the system is.  You can take it apart and manually clean it and it still will show that it needs cleaning.  I now only clean the thing with the docking station once every month or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s very well built and does the job!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve come a long way baby.  The shaver is great.  I particularly like to use it to thin out my beard and then shave it off entirely after I haven&#x27;t shaved for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> The product is good, is not the original box, if the enclosed shipping / packing list is better</li>
            <li> the product is ok. But the packing is really a mess. Looks like some used one...</li>
            <li> Have had this razor 6 months. It does an excellent job. No issues.  Just plugged it in right out of the box. The self cleaning feature is very cool and keeps it suprisingly free of debris. No cons at this point in time.</li>
            <li> Not as pleased with the razor as I thought I would be. My series 5 shaved closer without as many passes. It never gets my neck clean. I feel the cost is high for what the performance is.</li>
            <li> By far the easiest and most effective electric shaver I have ever owned it is worth every cent.  I am a tough critic when it comes to shavers, but this one has not been a disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> excellent razor except for shaving the neck area real close.</li>
            <li> Very nice price to buy it,Very easy to use, very clean shaven.</li>
            <li> The 790 cc I very like, very good use, much better than I used to use panasonic</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband. He likes it very much.</li>
            <li> Love this shaver. The first place I use it is to shave my head, which it does so effortlessly. The second place I use it is to shave my facial hair which has the consistency of steel wool. Again, no problem for this shaver. I am Sasquatch, but have not yet explored further areas for this device, but have no doubt that it would destroy any haired area it is applied to. Has it totally replaced my use of straight razors? No, I still use razors from an online place that costs about a dollar, to shave, and is a club, if you know what I mean. Even though this does a great job on my hairy ass neck, I still like to finish it with a straight razor.  This shaver, couple with those razors have cut my monthly manscaping bills from probably over 40 bucks a month to 10 bucks. I would give this beast 5 stars, but the included trimmers don&#x27;t seem to function on this unit. I&#x27;m too lazy to return it though for a fully functioning 5 star unit.</li>
            <li> A very good product, all that I expected. I have used Braun shavers for several years .</li>
            <li> It is uncomfortable due to often pulling rather than cutting.</li>
            <li> This razor is so perfect, that&#x27;s all I can say!</li>
            <li> The shave is decent but you still need to spend some time getting a close shave. It is convenient, cleans easily. Does not give a clean shave in nooks and hollows that easily -- you have to try different angles. Overall, decent. They dropped the price by almost 25% recently which was a disappointment....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had just about every brand name you can name for an electric shaver. Never thought in my lifetime I would spend this much money on a shaver, finally bit the bullet based on reviews and purchased the Braun Series 7...Let me make a long review short, LOVE IT! It shaves close, although I really don&#x27;t care if not as close as a blade, if I wanted that close, I would still be using a blade. As far an electric, the Braun Series 7 is the best I&#x27;ve had. The only draw back is the noise of the cleaning cycle, but then again I start the cleaner and walk out of the room. The cleaning liquid last several months and keeps my blades in top order. I use the most aggressive cut and have never had any irritation from this razor like I have from the rotary razors. I&#x27;ve now had this razor for about 1 year and it still works as if new!</li>
            <li> Best electric in my decades of shaving.</li>
            <li> No electric shaver is as good as a razor. But this one is VERY comfortable (and for me a razor is really rough). It&#x27;e expensive, but I really like what it does.</li>
            <li> got it at a very good price</li>
            <li> These are great electric shavers.  I owned one before with the cleaning charging station and it finally wore out the batteries.  The cleaning indicator always indicates it needs cleaning, and I think this is a little excessive.Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shaver. Very quiet.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this shaver to anyone who uses an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Bought for my teenage son. He loves it. Comes with a great travel case and tells you how clean it is and when it needs to be cleaned.</li>
            <li> Gave it only 4.5 because I miss the trimmer being near the end of the shaver instead of the middle.  Although the trimmer works well, it&#x27;s a bit more awkward located there.</li>
            <li> This shaver shaves you really close without the nicks and cuts that sometime accompany a close shaver.  The automatic cleaning system base is simply superb.  The cleaning system measures when the shaver needs cleaning and the shaver recharges in the base while the system cleans the shaver heads.  No need to brush the shaver heads and risk damaging them.  It is easy to use.  The shaver head pivots to conform to the surface, or you can lock the heads in place for a closer shave.  I would highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Clean,quickly,easy to use and not too much noise.&lt;br /&gt;This Braun 790cc shaving system gave me an excellent shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;I think I won&#x27;t choose a Norelco shavers any more because I began to like Braun&#x27;s shaving products.</li>
            <li> I have been exclusively using Braun shavers for past 15 years. In my opinion, this razor model is not an improvement over the previous version. The razor Head is way to complex, it does not clean well, harder to put it back on, i dont notice an imrovement in shaving ability, and it pulls hair. The hair pulling has never been a problem with previous models, but with this model it is a problem. I prefer the previous model. I was dissapointed with this design.&lt;br /&gt;BTW, the previous chargers do not fit this model. My guess, they are trying to improve revenue from cord sales. Shame on Braun!!!</li>
            <li> I have own 3 different tier Braun shavers, this is definitely a Good shaver but when I got my unit the dock charging function was not working, I had to send for service n change the circuit board according to the repairman. Still an excellent shaver.</li>
            <li> This Shaving System is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;I never thought that a shaving system could be that good and jentle.&lt;br /&gt;I had an older broun system and tryed a philips new one, and both are not even close to this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiance, and it leaves his face feeling as smooth as if he had just shaved with a normal razor blade. We both love it!</li>
            <li> I have two major complaints with this razor.  Either or both of them may not effect you, so please consider your own situation before taking my review into account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1: I shave by head and this razor does a very poor job consistently shaving the finer hairs of my head.  I don&#x27;t expect the closest shave with an electric razor, but I would like it if I didn&#x27;t end up with patches of hair that are longer than the rest no matter how many times I go over it.  If you don&#x27;t shave your head, and aren&#x27;t shaving peach fuzz, I suspect that this complaint isn&#x27;t relevant to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2: I have a bit of a cow-lick on my neck and some of the whiskers lay very flat against my skin.  No matter what angle I shave with, I&#x27;m unable to shave all the whiskers in this area. Again, if your facial hair grows outward in a uniform direction, then you should be okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary: if your facial hair grows in a normal pattern and have a full head of hair, consider yourself lucky and buy this razor.  Otherwise, keep searching and let me know if you find an electric razor that works better.</li>
            <li> My friend please me bought it for his father, $165, received after the shaver, he and his father very satisfied!</li>
            <li> I had the original braun electric razor with self cleaning/recharger and it never did a bad job, in fact the only reason I bought this one, the 7-790cc, was because I couldn&#x27;t find replacement blades for my old one anymore. What an amazing upgrade this was. It does make a higher pitched noise when using it but it isn&#x27;t an issue. It performs perfectly, shaves close and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I read a lot of reviews about this shaver before deciding to buy it and I recommend everyone interested read the more detailed reviews because there is a lot of great information in them. One thing I did notice was that a number of people complained about it irritating skin or it not shaving fast enough. I understand the irritation issues but with any new electric razor it takes a week or two before your skin will adapt to it but issues with shaving fast enough?......I had to laugh because it was just silly to me. This bad boy shaves plenty fast but if you&#x27;re the type that uses a stop watch when shaving then.......I guess it matters........but for the rest of us, this 790cc will do the job and do it very well.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC SHAVER..EVERYTHING THAT REVIEWERS SAID ABOUT IT AND MORE!!!! VERY PLEASED!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this Shaver!! Best one ever made</li>
            <li> an outstanding Razor, not my first one, my old Braun wore out and I had to get another Braun.</li>
            <li> Great shaver.  Replaced a Braun that I had for years.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver........</li>
            <li> The shaver is great. Gives a good, close shave with no discomfort. It is also quiet. The cleaning fluid is something else. I was so impressed with it at first that I ordered extra cleaning units. I have since thrown them all away along with the whole cleaning unit. I have kept only the shaver. What led to that was my turning the cleaning unit over, forgetting that it had an open container of cleaning fluid in it. Of course the fluid spilled out. I found the smell terrible, but worse, it took all the finish off the furniture and marble top that it spilled onto. Read the warning about this fluid carefully. It is also flammable.</li>
            <li> Always good as expected, have used Braun shaver 24 years.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas and he shaved with it this morning and said&lt;br /&gt;it gave him a close shave.  He previously used Norelco but they just didn&#x27;t last long and he messed up when he tried to clean the blades.  This razor is self-cleaning which he will like.  I would recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> I have used a Braun shaver for several years. The  Series 7-790 is much superior to my old Braun...It affords a clean comfortable shave.  If you haven&#x27;t tried this electric shaver, I suggest you give it a try. I am completely pleased with mine.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old Series 7 with this updated model and am quite pleased thus far.</li>
            <li> Swivel head is less active. The clipper seems to work better. The whole unit is heavy and clunsey compaired the the previous model. Given the oppurtunity I would buy the old modle.</li>
            <li> I chose this to replace an older, cheaper  Norelco. What a mistake!Yes, it&#x27;s high tech compared to Gillette blade shaving and the Norelco. There&#x27;s this recharger/cleaning unit (about twice the size of the shaver itself). And the shaver bottom indicates status of shaver battery charge and degree of need to clean. So how does it shave?    If shaving with a new Gillette blade is considered the closest shave- 5 stars, and the old Norelco a strong 3 stars ( electric is never as close as blade), this Braun just doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;cut it\\&quot; ! Oh, I forgot to mention the need to buy the replacement  cleaning cartridges.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it that long so I can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s durability, but already a vast improvement over the Panasonic I had for years. Much quieter, close shave and seems easier to clean too. Feels great in my hand too.</li>
            <li> First time buyer of a Braun shaved. I own a Braun coffee maker for several years now, still working well. This shaver works well, but not as close a shave as I prefer. Cleaning unit seems to function well so far. I own a Panosonic shaver ,but it no longer holds a charge for longer than 30 seconds. Not sure if it&#x27;s the charging  unit or the shaver itself. I am hoping this new Braun will function for several years as well as my other shaver has.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Plows through a 4 day growth, clean shave.</li>
            <li> THis shaver is the best I&#x27;ve ever had in 50 yrs!</li>
            <li> great shave &amp; easy maintenance thanks to cleaner.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Great razor - great charging and cleaning system.  Much better than the Norelco I used for many years.</li>
            <li> GREAT RAZOR crappy &amp; INPOSSIBLE TO TALK WITH COMPANY concerning purchase</li>
            <li> Does not shave close enough - had to return and get the Panasonic ES-LA93-K which was excellent.</li>
            <li> I have both the 790cc and Norelco SensoTouch 3D. I have had the 790cc for two years and the SensoTouch 3D for one year. I used each one exclusively for a year.  After such an extensive test, I prefer the 790cc with caveats.  The 790cc gave me a closer shave. Also the 3D would leave small nicks from time to time making my neck very red.  I the 790cc was a closer shave overall. I do like the wet use of the 3D though - that was useful. I also found the 3D worked better when using a shaving gel and not dry.  I have debated which one to use, but considering the closer shave of the 790cc I am going back to that one.</li>
            <li> I have facial hair that routinely kills normal shaver about every nine months, plus they never gave me a really smooth shave -- for special events I&#x27;d have to use a shaver then use a razor blade and shaving cream for a truly clean shave. I never wanted to spend the money for a Braun, but after blowing out another shaver in record time I bit the bullet (and had a coupon for a good discount). I couldn&#x27;t be happier -- so far -- with this. A close, clean, easy shave every morning that cuts minutes off of my prep time. I just hope that in 9 months it doesn&#x27;t give up the ghost like all the other brands do. And if it does -- I still think I&#x27;d re-buy it. Love this shaver.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to get a super good shave with this.  I find myself going back to my inexpensive Norelco or using a blade razor.  In fact, when I use it on a trip I take my Norelco also and use that to get whata the Braun misses.  I would not recommend this.  Especially at this price. I noticed that Norleco has just come out with a self cleaning model that pretty much copies the Braun, but I have found the Norelco series, 7,8, and 9 Aquamatic models give me a better shave.</li>
            <li> I really prefer the clean feeling of a traditional shave but that&#x27;s not always practical for me. This does a fine job of knocking down a day&#x27;s growth or less. Two days growth it may hang or pull if you&#x27;re not careful with it. Three days, good luck. The charge lasts a long time. It takes longer for it to clean itself than suggested. The self-cleaning module isn&#x27;t travel friendly. It isn&#x27;t perfect but it does what I need fairly well and seems well built and feels solid in the hand. I didn&#x27;t want one but needed one. In happy worth my choice.</li>
            <li> Great to use when I&#x27;m in a hurry and I also use it when traveling</li>
            <li> This is my second Braun re-chargeable, self-cleaning shaver.  My wife gave my first one at least ten years ago, but the switch started giving me problems. I figure 10 years + is pretty good service so I went on line to find a replacement and this model popped up. I&#x27;ve had this one for about three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It provides a much closer shave than my original model. In fact, it&#x27;s almost as close as a safety razor, and over my 70 years I have always preferred a safety razor when I really wanted to have a close shave.  This one provides such a close shave that I plan to use my safety razor only occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are lots of bells and whistles, but the bottom line is that it provides a close shave, regardless of the settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the cleaning cartridges last closer to six weeks than the promised month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This electric shaver is expensive. But if you want top-of-the-line and a very clean shave, I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Incidentally, it&#x27;s a bit less expensive from Walmart.)</li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner and good product.</li>
            <li> Seemed like it got clogged when shaving.</li>
            <li> very good, I love it.</li>
            <li> Had another self cleaning Braun for seven years but this one delivers the closes shave that I have experienced</li>
            <li> I was a Norelco man for 50 years. Not anymore. This Braun shaving system is, by far, the finest piece of machinery I&#x27;ve ever handled in my life. It&#x27;so much better than the Norelco it&#x27;s ridiculous. I would recommend this shaver to any and all men who have the wherewithal and it&#x27;s well worth the hih price. 5 stars is not enough.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son, he says it works very well and is very happy !</li>
            <li> Feb 2016 - I&#x27;ve had this for a while. What I like the most about this razor is that it does not irritate my skin or burn. This can not be overstated, healthy skin is good. As I&#x27;ve said before, it&#x27;s not the closest shave but it&#x27;s acceptable. For special occasions (once a month or so) I shave with a regular razor after shaving with the electical razor. Finally, after factoring the cost of the unit, it has not yet paid for itself (razors vs. foils &amp; cleaning fluid). But all things considered I would buy this again.  Oct 2014 - I&#x27;m new to electric razors but I&#x27;ve had mine for a month and thought I&#x27;d write a review anyway. The razor looks and feels great, it&#x27;s easy to use and it has actually reduced overall irritation (I was warned this might increase?).  The one down side is that it&#x27;s not a very close shave. The left behind hairs are mostly tiny or hard to get neckline hairs but they are visible and a regular razor could get them.  My main motivation for getting this was reduced costs of ownership. I can&#x27;t comment on this because I have yet to replace the cleaning solution or razor head. I guess I&#x27;ll have to wait but so far I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had an electric shaver since I was a kid.  I did a lot of research to find the right one.  I have a very thick beard and very sensitive skin.  Based upon reviews and websites this is the right razor.  Unfortunately, this just does not do a good job.  The shave doesn&#x27;t feel close unless I go back and forth 15-20 times.  This creates an issue with ingrown hairs and irritated skin.  A quick shave makes me have end up with a 5 oclock shadow at the end of it. I knew it wouldn&#x27;t be a razor like shave but this wasn&#x27;t even close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I bought it thinking I could return it if I didn&#x27;t like it. . . for some reason I cannot.  Bummer.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly everytime. It leaves a close shave almost as good as my old Mach3, but in the end I don&#x27;t have to keep buying hundreds of dollars worth of blades.</li>
            <li> No burns or irritation from electric razor, which is a first in my experience. It&#x27;s smooth, quieter then any others that I have tried, and gives a razor close shave every time. The cleaning stand is a nice bonus as well. I have nothing bad to say about this razor. Worth every penny! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Best I have ever had..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gift to my friend and looks so cool when I opened the box. I&#x27;m considering to buy more for my father an in law.</li>
            <li> My husband can&#x27;t believe the differance in this razor verses the one he replace it for. He shaves in half the time now!</li>
            <li> As someone with very sensitive skin (so sensitive that it gets red from one pass of other electric shavers I&#x27;ve tried), this is a god send.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3 different settings work very well. I use the highest setting for my chin line, cheeks, and upper neck, then finish off my mustache and lower neck with the middle/lowest settings. Smooth as an against the grain manual shave, without any of the redness or irritation. I could probably avoid balms as well after shaves with this thing (but I don&#x27;t)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the cleaning solution every other shave, and I close the little pull-tab each time and store the fluid until next time. After about a month and a few weeks, I can see a few hairs in the paper filter underneath but it seems to be functioning very well still, and the lemony smell is fantastic in the morning.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll made. Heavy duty construction. Excellent cleaning system. Excellent shave each time. Fits your hand perfectly. A beautifully designed shaver that is built to last.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best shaver in all of I used. The amazon price is much cheaper than you buy at China. The shaver can clean my face faster and very clean. The shorter coming that the shake and noise are bit higher. The power can insist 25 days using.</li>
            <li> SHOUD EXCHANGE FOR SERIES 5 5030s closer shave</li>
            <li> This item is over priced. The same shaver is being sold at BJ&#x27;s for $149.99 plus you an extra head for the shaver. I paid Amazon $200.00 for the shaver.  I just saw where it went down to $145.00. I am requesting the shave at the current price and a credit for the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Perfect! Bought for my dad on black friday and he says that this one is definitely a super premium one! Strongly recommended~</li>
            <li> Great razor!  Gives a good shave every time.  My first Braun electric razor is now eight years old and still works!</li>
            <li> I have used electric shavers off an on for years. This is the first one that actually replaced my Mach 3.</li>
            <li> I used norelcos for years and they never shaved me closely albeit I have a light beard.  I tried this 790 series and it does a very good job but a little hard on the skin.  I like the cleaning system.</li>
            <li> This is my second top of the line Braun. My first still works after eight years with just shaver head replacements. This new one is just amazing. It makes me look forward to shaving and I hate shaving. Quiet and smooth beyond belief with enough gee wiz gizmo&#x27;s to satisfy the techy. Shaves are much closer with no burn. Believe it or not it is closer than a razor shave. Not cheap but nothing good ever is. Thanks to Amazon the price was lower than Walmart and free shipping took just two days.</li>
            <li> This shaving system is great for a man with a heavy beard.  It gives a very close shave and has very useful and functional features.</li>
            <li> It can clean the shave very fast.It be do not stimulate the skin almost by use it.It is a good choice for me.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver I have ever used.  I had a 5 Series immediately prior to this purchase and several models (over many years) of Norelco Rotary Shavers but none shaved as closely as this 7 Series.  It is quick and gentle--no more red cheeks!</li>
            <li> This is the third Braun Series 7-790cc I bought. This time the box is different from the other two, it was not the original box from the factory. I wonder why?</li>
            <li> Very close shave! My husband said, &amp;#34;makes a mess though&amp;#34;. His last shaver collected the hair..this one drops it! He also said doesn&#x27;t care for the cleaning solution that will need to be replaced! Other than that a great razor!</li>
            <li> I like this shaver, but is is somewhat expensive. You have to continue to purchase the cleaning cartridges and the razor heads for optimal performance.</li>
            <li> This is my second Braun shaver, best ever! I used first one for 10 years. Very quiet, very smooth, supper long battery.</li>
            <li> Thought I would try an electric razor for the first time.  Did some research and chose this razor. shipping was fast and the price was even better than I thought...and so was the shave thanks</li>
            <li> My husband has very sensitive skin.  His care givers have been concerned because he becomes so agitated with the shaving process.  Now he doesn&#x27;t.  Any time you can relieve the suffering of a loved one...it is a good thing!</li>
            <li> Excellent shaves and the charging/cleaning system.  Works as advertised with a good close shave.  The trimmer takes some getting used to however.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Braun and it is the best of them all. As with all of them, I get a close shave with no irritation.  The pulsonic action of this model provides a quicker and easier shave.  i could not be happier.</li>
            <li> I used electric shavers in the past (Norelco) but had swiched off to using blades for a decade or so.  I received this as a Christmas gigt and it works very well.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had about 4 electric razors over the course of my shaving career.  I&#x27;ve had Phillips Norelco, Panasonic, Wahl, etc.  They&#x27;ve sometimes varied in design but regardless of the design, I would ALWAYS get razor burn regardless of how light I pressed, how little I repeated the area or use of a lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until now...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a pricey shaver but when a guy like me with sensitive skin can go over areas multiple times, not feel ANY burning after and get a close shave that rivals some of the best shaves I&#x27;ve had to date, it&#x27;s well worth the money.  I don&#x27;t yet know about consumables since this has a cleaning/lubricating element that auto-cleans the shaver each time you use it.  But I&#x27;d say this is 100% worth it for a day to day shaver.  Have yet to use the trimmer element or switch to an intensity higher than the sensitive one but trust me, it&#x27;s a close shave with zero irritation.  Something that I&#x27;ve never felt before with an electric razor.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable on my face. I recommend running self clean every 4 or so shaves because the alcohol based and it dries my face</li>
            <li> Shaving is very clean</li>
            <li> the package is poor...I already have the Philips 1260,I think the Philips works better than braun...for me</li>
            <li> little on expesive side but its best razor on market</li>
            <li> I now own two of these shaving systems, one in each of two different residences. I am completely pleased with both. I have used electric shavers for over 40 years, Schick, Remington, Braun, etc. and have learned to much prefer the Braun product in its various incarnations. The best of these is the 790cc in my opinion, particularly because it does no sharp, stinging pinches when shaving. Every electric shaver I have ever used, except this one, always occasionally stung and pinched, particularly when shaving the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Any downside? Yes, it is expensive, but well worth the extra bucks over the cost of lessor shavers in the Braun product line.</li>
            <li> still getting use to it, but so far I love it</li>
            <li> After doing some research, I finally decided on this shaver.  I&#x27;m glad I did!  Perfect shave in half the time when compared to my Philips Norelco shavers.  I love the ability to charge the razor and clean it all at the same time.  Feels sturdy and looks great on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> Have not figured out how to use the cleaning system yet but I will! The shave is close and comfortable. Good value.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and excellent cleaning/charging operation. Great traveling case supplied with it.  I only wish it had a beard trimmer on it.</li>
            <li> The best razor I have owned.</li>
            <li> My husband loved the shaver. NO RAZOR BUMP!</li>
            <li> awesome product! cuts extremely close!</li>
            <li> Fantastic, excellent shave for electric especially on my coarse greying beard.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is easy, the trimmer works well and it makes shaving fast for work.</li>
            <li> Best shaver I have it and thanks Amazon for your customer service they get me new one cuz when i received old one the clean and renew part is broken I recommend this shaver for every one it&#x27;s also v110 &amp;v220</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband as a replacement for another electric shaver. He has a very course, tough beard and sensitive skin (bad combination!) but he tells me this shaving system has been working great for him so far!!  The cleaning system works awesome too!</li>
            <li> My husband is so disappointed with the shaver.  He waited too long to try it out and now I can&#x27;t return it.  The bottom line is that it just doesn&#x27;t shave well, no matter what the setting.  A big waste of money for all the features too.  It is very complicated trying to figure out how to clean it.  And it got great reviews.  Try something cheaper and simpler, don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> Great shaver, smooth would recommend it to all my friends. Use it on a daily basis, clean up is very easy and I know all my friends would love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally disappointed with the way its been complicated to use…i knew many people might have given good review but its not user friendly….i wish braun company makes it more user friendly and make charging method easy than using complicated channels.</li>
            <li> Great shaver. Not impressed with the packaging it came in. I thought at least is would have been in a retail store box, instead it was just in a brown shipping box, makes me feel like I got a 2nd hand or re-furbished one.</li>
            <li> It costs more but doesn&#x27;t shave better molder Norelco. It takes a long time to shave but there is still come stubble. I have a light beard and multiple passes are needed to shave any area. The self cleaning feature is nice but expensive. I&#x27;m sorry I bought it and really cant recommend the razor but I do recommend Amazon.</li>
            <li> Tried the Braun Series 7 shaver (and another Norelco model) after ordering both of them off amazon and deciding to compare the difference between electric and manual shaving.  Wanted to see if the technology had changed or improved since last using one many years ago.  This Braun model left stubble over various parts of my face, it snagged, there was mild irritation and even some redness under the neck area.  But the biggest problem I had with this unit was that I had to keep going over the same areas more than once in order to get a clean shave.  And that&#x27;s always been my experience with electric or foil shaving.  The Norelco&#x27;s, the Panasonic&#x27;s, the Braun&#x27;s of the world get close to the skin and often get all the way down but it &amp;#34;just can&#x27;t get it all&amp;#34; in a few swipes (like a blade razor does). Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t pay too much attention to the front page reviews with like 1000 plus people wow&#x27;ing and fawning over this product.  It&#x27;s over-hyped and overrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to get any better than a blade shave and it&#x27;s just as fast as any electric model on the market.</li>
            <li> very sharp and cleaned clearly.but noisy,a little bit too aloud</li>
            <li> I never had a shaver before, but I checked out most of them.  All the Norelco 2 and 3 head, Panasonic etc... pulled hairs and I shaved where I didn&#x27;t want to.  They have to be brushed out daily.  Clippings and skin oils keep all those others from ever getting close as new.  The Braun 700 series CLEANS ITS SELF!  Like new everyday.  The charging stand pumps a cleaning fluid across the foil while the unit is activated to clean. VOILA!  Good close shave with NO ingrown hairs.  Perfect for sensitive skin. Center foil gets hairs laying down. This unit has a flip-up trimmer that is quite effective for trimming the Burns and &#x27;stash.  Cleaner comes in cartridges for throw away conveince. Foil can be replaced &amp;#60; $40 at Walmart if you drop it.  Just like new again.</li>
            <li> I have been using Panasonic shavers for years.  They last a long time but when one wears out and I get a new one the newer ones are better.</li>
            <li> best rechargable shaver i ever used in 50 years.</li>
            <li> The best electric razor in the world, period!. This is the top pick from Consumer&#x27;s reports and almost every barber in America. After reviewing and researching every electric razor on the market I bought the 790 because it had all the bells and whistles and the cleaning station is the best on the market. It sterilizes the blades and lubricates them properly so you do not need to use oil or manually clean it every time you shave. Yes it costs $80 more ea year, but it makes the razor last 15 years and you do not have to get oil all over everything and do a poor job of lubricating everything. Do not let anyone tell you that any electric razor will ever come as close as a Gillette Sensor blade, it cannot as it shaves over the skin, not under it. A blade takes off a layer of skin and can cause ingrown hairs.It will never feel as close as you will feel stubble, especially under the nose, on the chin, and on the neck. You have to shave against the grain with a blade to get those parts smooth to the touch. It is not recommended to use both so you have to choose. It takes three weeks to have your skin adjust to an electric razor and after that you  will get a bit close shave. Using Aramis lotion or Lectric Shave helps and you must not wash your face before you shave or shave when you first get up. Who cares if this is $220 since it will last 15 years and save you a lot in blades which have to be replaced after 5 shaves. Neither method is perfect, but I really like my electric after using a blade for 59 years and I will never go back to a blade.</li>
            <li> Got this as a replacement to a mid-level Philips (Norelco) rotary shaver that fell in the bathroom and broke on the floor. The shave is a lot better and closer - cheeks and particularly under the chin and on the neck feel smooth, and the hairs that grow in different directions on the neck were all trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;Great shave.&lt;br /&gt;No pulling on hairs.&lt;br /&gt;While some say it is noisy, I don&#x27;t think it is substantially different to other shavers that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty quick to shave.&lt;br /&gt;No need for a plastic cover with the nice transport case.&lt;br /&gt;Head is nicely flexible.&lt;br /&gt;Simplified packaging was much appreciated (no clam-shell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;The hygiene meter is a little silly - it goes down rapidly based on shaving time. After reading other reviews, I plan to use the cleaning cycle once a week and shake out the head/rinse with water other days.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is also larger than I expected. It isn&#x27;t uncomfortable or too heavy to hold, but is quite long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unknown yet:&lt;br /&gt;One week in, I haven&#x27;t actually tried the cleaning cycle yet...</li>
            <li> Best electric razor I have ever used.  I had a Braun Series 5 (8995) for 4 years which  I really liked but, this razor beats it hands down.  I have all kinds of crazy whorls in my beard on my neck and this razor is able to closely shave these areas without having to move the razor in 8 different directions.  What a find!</li>
            <li> The one problem I had is that the button that locks the head brjoke after 3 uses.  Thhis made shaving above your upper lip easier.&lt;br /&gt;E xcept for that, its was very good.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast, love this shaver my last Braun shaver lasted over 10&lt;br /&gt;Years ove shaving at least 5 days a week and it still works great. I just wanted a newer version.</li>
            <li> This is my second Braun Series 7-790cc Shaving System, I buy it for myself to shave my legs it works great.</li>
            <li> Not the quality I was expecting.  I read all the positive reviews and took the bait, but am disappointed.  If you take ten minutes and worry . (assault your face) your beard over and over, and over, you can get a pretty good shave, but I have never equaled a blade.  The whole experience is very uncomfortable.  The razor gets hot, and it vibrates very noisily.  If you have any hairs that lay flat or if any get a little long, this razor will not pick them up and shave&#x27;em. Period! .  It really is so bad that I thought that I had gotten a refurb or used razor.  I once had a little triple foil Remington that would blow this thing away, and at one fifth the cost.  This razor is no better than any $30 dollar shaver you can find..</li>
            <li> The shaver works as good as all of the good reviews. easy and smooth. Cleaning system works well. the Braun system does all of the work</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my step son. I figure it&#x27;s all he expected. I was a little set aside due to a shipping error. Otherwise I guess all is ok.</li>
            <li> Compared to my old Braun model #5414 this shaver is a delight.  It&#x27;s much quieter and shaves much closer and faster.  Also, I don&#x27;t have to take it apart and brush clean the blades every time.  My only complaint is the cleaner/renewer is a bit noisy.</li>
            <li> Gentlemen, this is not an expensive shaver.  This is an investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with sales or a rebate, you are going to spend over a hundred dollars, perhaps even as much as a hundred and fifty for this razor.  What you will not spend is a moment regretting your purchase.  Forget the fancy gadgets and addons.  They&#x27;re nice, but they aren&#x27;t what has sealed this for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will shave your face and it will leave it smooth.  Not speckled.  Not razor burned.  Not with the occasional whisker or stray fleck that just refuses every other razor and shaver.  Smooth.  For that reason alone, it receives five stars and this review.  It works.</li>
            <li> I choose this razor based upon the performance of my previous Braun. The new Braun Series 7 performs fantastically. I get smooth shaves without the wear and tear of manual razors. The shaver produces a close shave. I recommend this shaver to anyone considering an electric shaver. The charger is great. The battery unit charger also keeps track of the shaver&#x27;s cleanliness and cleans it with cleaning solution in a lower filled tray, when required.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed it for the first shave but it seemed after that.. even when i&#x27;d have hardly any stubble it would snag my hair repeatedly to the point it felt like it was pulling my facial out.</li>
            <li> My first Braun and I really like it. Gives a great smooth shave. The Braun has a great feel and it is easy to use. Better shave than other electric shavres that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Ferrari in the shavers</li>
            <li> The Braun 7-799cc meet my expectations as one of the top electric shavers for African American men with hair that curls back or lay flat. It has lift technology that can closely shave those stubborn hairs. In additional,  I really enjoy the trim setting that allows you to get a normal shave or a really close shave. It has a great self cleaning system that&#x27;s a little noisy but very efficient in keeping the shaver in top condition. I recommend this shaver to anyone with razor  bump issues.</li>
            <li> Quality is good, battery lasts long time, cleang and comfort.</li>
            <li> I bought it for VALENTINES for my husband and he LOVED IT !!!....He has sensitive skin and thick hair.</li>
            <li> My husband lost his old Braun shaver he got more than 8 yrs ago. Yes, these thing used to last. The new one shaves ok but looks very cheap and plasticy. Doubt it will last long.</li>
            <li> Send a friend,very nice</li>
            <li> should be 2 1/2 stars. This is my 5th braun shaver. It is the highest series Ive purchased to date and it is disappointing. The biggest and only complaint I have is that it doesnt give a close shave like my past Brauns did. I&#x27;ll be going with a different manufacturer once im fed up enough with this product to justify the expense.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best Shaver I have ever owned.  Very smooth shaves.</li>
            <li> I tried to look everywhere for this but with better price.  Everyone had a good deal going on because it was around Black Friday and I remember my husband telling me how much we wanted this because for work he has to shave everyday and his old one just wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore.  He was pretty excited to use his and the fact that it has a self cleaning holder is pretty great. Its been at least 5-6 months since he&#x27;s had his and he hasn&#x27;t had to replace the gel thing yet and note that he has been using this everyday and cleans it when the indicator says it needs cleaning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun shavers for years, and I have to say, this shaver so far, is their best effort to date.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Adjustable shaving system for sensitive to not sensitive skin conditions.  Larger shaving head that swivels, and a smoother quicker shave all the way around.  Very comfortable to hold in your hand, and well balanced weight-wise.  Indicators on the bottom of the shaver for Battery Life, and Hygiene (shaver cleanliness).  Comes with an electric cleaner/charging dock.  Cons:  Came with no plastic cover for shaver head. The case for the shaver that came with it, has no room for the charger cord. I will use my old case from my last Braun Shaver for traveling with the new 7 series shaver.  All in all, I only gave it 4 stars because you would think for the cost of this shaver, the cons mentioned above would have been thought of and taken care of.  If a good shave is important to you, this is the shaver for you.</li>
            <li> I have used Philips nerolco 3D and been using Gillette Mach3 since high school. Never had close shave like Braun 790. I highly recommend cleaning cartridge depend how much you shave.  I shave twice a week.  Make sure you cover your cleaning solution after use so it won&#x27;t evaporate.  Best shaver and smooth shave without any cut. I would highly recommend to any body rather you just start shaving or been shaving for long time. World best shaver hands down.</li>
            <li> Great product will buy again!</li>
            <li> Unbelievable service from the suplier</li>
            <li> Hands down the best electric shaver out there!  Relatively quiet, very smooth, and a nice close shave with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> Replaced my 10 year old Braun with this newer model; love the close shave.</li>
            <li> Best shave in 20 years! And the cleaning part is amazing</li>
            <li> Watch had a debit card comprised after a recent purchase.</li>
            <li> Nice shaver... I have had it for about 3 months now and it works great. The self-cleaning feature is a plus...</li>
            <li> Best shave I have had with an electric. Well pleased with all aspects of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone interesting in changing from a blade.</li>
            <li> This Braun Series 7-790cc is a good razor, however, I was not satisfied. It did not perform as well as my 5 year old Panasonic ES8249 (never changed the foil head or cutters) that still works great and the performance I mentioned has to do with the comfort level. The Panasonics are louder, but have a faster cutter and I think that is what caused the sensation of a smoother shave with less irritation. I could not tell I just shaved with the Panasonic, but I could with the Braun. I don&#x27;t believe that would change after a period of time, it&#x27;s just physics. I like the alcohol cleaning system on the Braun much better than the Panasonic soap base cleaning solution (fresher smell). So, I never use the Panasonic ES8249 cleaner anymore... I just pop off the head, pump some foamed Dr. Bonner&#x27;s soap in it, run and rinse. I bought the Panasonic ES-25ST KS and it&#x27;s a breeze to clean with the cleaning ports and it has a charging stand. Best shaver I have ever used. The higher RPM for cleaning of the ES8249 is not missed on the ES-25ST; it works just fine with the normal speed. The ES-25ST will go into a higher RPM when it senses areas that are needing more shaving power.... you can hear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun&#x27;s return form is here http://tinyurl.com/oornrdw.&lt;br /&gt;Braun&#x27;s number for instructions for the return is 800-211-6661&lt;br /&gt;The return address is:&lt;br /&gt;  Return Processing Center&lt;br /&gt;  4608 Appliance Drive, Suite 2&lt;br /&gt;  Attn: Braun 60 Day Money Back Guarantee&lt;br /&gt;  Belcamp, MD 21017&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update when the Braun applies the refund... I will read Amazon refund policy in the future. Amazon could have just had the cleaning solution removed from the packaging as Braun is instructing when returning.</li>
            <li> I did plenty of reviews on shavers.  This one always topped the lists with positive reviews an after using I can see why.  Shavers come in all qualities and prices.  I decided to on a quality unit and this product has earned its reputation. Its easy to use, understand, self cleaning, long lasting and most importantly doesn&#x27;t just do the job, it does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li> I just spent 2 weeks in the hospital and it took off all the growth easily! Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to try electric over razor blade. The Braun satisfies all of my needs and the cleaning is a snap.</li>
            <li> Very good shaver. No more cuts and the shave is close enough.</li>
            <li> Very smooth!  Little to NO beard hair pulling.  I even use it to shave my head and it works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Best shaver ever!  I&#x27;ve had other Braun electric shavers and this is the best by far.  Shaves great and cleans up easily.</li>
            <li> This would be the fifth or sixth electric razor I&#x27;ve tried over the years, this is the best of them. It takes a little while to finish a shave and the usual areas are problematic but the result is very good for an electric razor. The cleaning solution is just a way to persuade the purchaser to spend money on consumables.</li>
            <li> Good razor but a little pricy.</li>
            <li> My husband just loves this.  It shaves clean and is easy to keep clean.  Would buy, again.</li>
            <li> the best shaver on the market,love it,no complaints at all ,highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Best electric shaver I have ever had!</li>
            <li> This Braun replaced the Braun I had for 12 years previously. I really like it, Smooth and  close with not as many passes as my old one. I do think it uses more fluid than my old one did, but only because it has a gauge and I wouldn&#x27;t clean my old one until I had run the battery out. Really like the gauge though and I guess it probably is best to know when it needs cleaned as it also lubricates the razor at the same time. So I guess that is best practice. I have been using it for a month now. I put my old one at my cabin and have found that I truly can&#x27;t wait to get home to use the new one because it feels so much better. This coming from the guy that liked the old one so much he went with the same brand.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant before buying this product. I have used a schick 3 for most of my shaving life along with other similar razors. Being in the military I didnt want to purchase a shaver that couldnt get a smooth enough shave and be out $200. So i took the leap and bought it at Best Buy (buy there because of 2 week return policy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shaved half my face with the Braun and the other with my normal razor; hands down the razor was closer. However, it wasnt enough of a difference that you could see. It could only be felt when rubbing my face. I decided to give it 2 weeks to see how it could play into my lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a pilot I dont have a normal work schedule and the flexibility is great with the Braun. I can get a quick shave 5 mins before walking out the door and flying for hours knowing I have atleast 12 hours before I need to shave again (hell I can take it with me if I need too). I used to shave at night and hope it went 24 hours. There is NO irritation at all; to be honest thats the reason I am keeping the Braun. I never had a problem with irritation or anything but not having that &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; after shaving is great and my skin feels healthier. Overall, if you have the extra cash go big with the Braun Series 7 System. It will find a way to play into your schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a non-professional level, I used to hate having to shower/shave before going out after work or on a weekend. With the Braun I can get ready and get a quick shave in before a saturday night! The Braun is a worthwhile purchase for me due to its adaptability/flexibility, easiness of maintenance, and high quality. I only wish that I didnt have to clean it every 3-4 days (with system) but that can be negotiated around. Give it a try and I hope you see similar results.</li>
            <li> Shaved with Norelco rotary for a long time.  Thought I&#x27;d try this Braun razor.  Not disappointed.  Does just as good a job as the Norelco only a bit slower but much easier to clean. For head shavers.....Do the head first and then the face.  Less shaving fall out on shoulders.</li>
            <li> Love it gives me a great shave :)</li>
            <li> I like Braun products and I like this razor.I don&#x27;t believe it deserves a five star rating.</li>
            <li> Hello Amazon,&lt;br /&gt;I received my Braun Series 7-790cc Pulsonic Men&#x27;s Shaving System 1 about a week ago. It had no paperwork in the box. The shaver works, however, it came with a self-cleaning base unit but it doesn&#x27;t look like the picture in your e-mail and the adapter won&#x27;t fit into the self-cleaning base unit. In fact, it appears the connection ends are backwards. Today Saturday, I tried to use the self-cleaning for the first time. I have provided two photo attachments of the fake to this e-mail. I hope you can see the unit is suspect. I expect Amazon will investigate this matter and provide me a correct self-cleaning base unit to replace the &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; cheap imitation thud. Please reply to my e-mail and send me the corrected unit. I don&#x27;t think you want the &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; unit back. It is obviously a cheap fake version. As you can see it doesn&#x27;t look like the right one. If you have any questions, please e-mail me or call me at 617-242-8525.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Best shaver ever!! Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I am using this shaving system for only a couple of weeks but I am starting to love it. It takes some time to get used to it, but I was already expecting that, since this was noted on some reviews I saw prior to buying this shaving system. The latest shaves were very easy and my skin is much better now, than it was using a manual razor.     Edit on Feb 16th 2015:    I am using the product for some months now and I still think it is a very good product. It only takes more time to shave than a manual razor.</li>
            <li> I previously had a Braun 8 series that was over 10 years old and still doing well until the power cord went missing. On my first shave with this, I think I was a little disappointed, but for the price, I was probably expecting it to be perfect with a flawless shave on the first pass. It&#x27;s not that, but it is still a comfortable shaver and can give a pretty smooth shave when done right. It&#x27;s quieter than my previous shaver but the power button is less convenient. The stand also feels cheaper than the previous one and doesn&#x27;t let you just drop the shaver in -- you have to twist the shaver a bit to get it in just the right spot for it to charge.</li>
            <li> Let me start this off with something positive.... This razor gives me the best in come shave that I have ever had.  It comes in second, closely behind a straight razor shave.  And razor burn is a thing of the past.  I didn&#x27;t have one tiny red bump or irritation the few times I used the razor.  Really would have been a 5 star product if I hadn&#x27;t have run into some trouble....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I received it in the mail I was more than excited to use it.  However, I didn&#x27;t realize those uses were only going to be limited to 4 times.  The first three times I used this razor were beyond phenomenal, and more than I could ever ask from any self-shaving product.  Sadly, the fourth time that I used it, all of a sudden, it stopped working.  Well, I know I had it in the dock charging a few nights before, and I know I had cleaned it 2 times before that, between my first (I was anxious to see how this thing could clean itself!) and second shave.  As I started to try and figure things out  I realized that the razor was not holding a charge and was completely dead!  I am pretty sure the dock/cleaner is still working because the light are on and whatnot.  I plugged the charger directly into the razor; still nothing.  After many feeble attempts at getting this $200 (which is A LOT of money for a college kid) razor to work again, I headed to the computer to see if I could find some answers.  Apparently, there have been issues with this razor holding a charge, and issues with the dock.  Granted, I didn&#x27;t have any issues with the dock, but I wish that were the case.  I took extremely good care of this razor and followed the instruction booklet to ensure the best performance and longevity out of this product.  As I said before, a $200 investment out of the pocket of a college kid is a good amount (at least in the circles I run).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That last part felt long winded but I am getting out my anger and frustration in this post while trying to remain calm and collected....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I looked on Amazon to see if I could return the item. It is still within 30 days of the original purchase, and 3 weeks since my first use, but due to policies regarding shipping and flammable chemicals I am not allowed to return the item.  I am absolutely sure that I could return it as safely as it got here, but the law/ shipping policies are rules that cannot be broken by a college kid.  I am pretty bummed I received a product that seems defective, and due to shipping policies, I cannot return the item for a refund.  I&#x27;ve looked into replacement batteries, but they are pretty expensive for this model, and I know that if I do any fiddling around with the razor&#x27;s battery compartments it will definitely void any warranty I might have.  I&#x27;m pretty stuck here, back to regular shaving is okay and I don&#x27;t mind it, but nothing compares to this razor.  I would buy it again in a heartbeat if I had the money, but sadly I do not.  I&#x27;ve looked into all my options for the time being and really don&#x27;t know what to do with a dead razor on my hands. I feel as though throwing it away is literally throwing away a couple hundred bucks, and no one wants to do that without exercising every single option beforehand.  I am going to contact Braun and see if I can do anything from there.  I will update this post if I figure anything out. Hopefully Amazon contacts me, or the original seller, and is able to work something out.  I am sure all the razors aren&#x27;t defective, especially when looking at this products rockstar ratings!  Guess I just got the unlucky one out of the batch.  Still would recommend the razor, and if I have to, I will most likely be buying another one sometime down the road.</li>
            <li> good shave but the unit need a head cover for protection during travel.</li>
            <li> Love the shaver but you really need to run it over your face several times in different ways to catch 95% of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Like all electric razors it is not as close as a regular shave but it is convenient and will save me money in the long run&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning port works very well</li>
            <li> NMR (not my razor), but by all accounts the recipient likes it a lot.</li>
            <li> Best shave I have had with an electric razor. I have had several (too many to remember) rotary razors and they are not even close to the shave that I am getting with the Braun.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best electric shaver I have ever used. I get a close, comfortable, more blade like shave than I expected and have ever experienced. Braun hit a home run with this shaver.</li>
            <li> Wow...I got my 790cc today.  I did not shave today waiting on the shaver to arrive. well it did, I shaved with it.  very happy.  I had a heart attack..so I don&#x27;t won&#x27;t to shave with a blade.  so I ordered this shaver to use.  I&#x27;m so for happy.</li>
            <li> I honestly did not expect this to shave as good as it did. It&#x27;s honestly amazing nothing bad to say about it. I highly reccamend it. Who ever is talking sh*t about this shaver is just a tough critic. Trust me and get it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Gift and he raves about it</li>
            <li> Shave is good quality; the trimmer is poor quality and is rather useless: (1) pops out of the side of the unit rather awkwardly, as compared to previous Braun products where it pops up adjacent to shave head; (2) is too narrow, and (3) the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; are too small to be of practical trimming use. I&#x27;m keeping my 10+ year old other Braun just because its trimmer is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, locking mechanism for shaving head broke after a couple of weeks (quality German engineering, anyone?) Amazon refuses return/replacement because this item is &amp;#34;hazmat.&amp;#34; (thanks for the short end of the stick, Amazon.) Attempting RMA to Braun now.</li>
            <li> This shaver is great.  I have always been a fan of Braun products and they have one of the best products that last many, many years</li>
            <li> Have had it about a month. It&#x27;s the first electric shaver I have ever owned that did as good a job as a razor. Lot6s of wonderful features.</li>
            <li> Provides an extremely poor shave, does not cut close at all</li>
            <li> After using this razor for several months I have to say it sucks! i have used braun razors for 30 years and this is the worst. the battery often won&#x27;t last through 2 full shaves. The razor PULLS HAIRS a lot on every shave. After just a short time owning it, I no longer get a very close shave. This was expensive and I&#x27;m upset. another big problem is the trimmer. It toggles up to stand straight out from the OTHER SIDE of the razor. I mean the cutting edge is facing directly away from your line of sight in the mirror and it totally hidden behind the razor. you have to use it in very awkward angles to see what you are doing. How could such seemingly good engineers place the trimmer where it is so hard to see? Baffling and hugely annoying. Been a braun fan a long time...this is just stupid!</li>
            <li> For my Asian beard (larger diameter hairs), it does not work any better than a Norelco with rotary blades.  And the Norelco was cheaper.</li>
            <li> Great shaver from day one</li>
            <li> too noisey and feel good</li>
            <li> very good shave. Still not as good as a razor but close</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an old pro with electric razors, and this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Close comfortable shave that floats easily over the skin with no irritation.  The cleaning base works well, and since it&#x27;s alcohol based it disinfects as well as cleans.  If you&#x27;re new to electric razors, and are unsure of their merits, do yourself a favor and give this one a try.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves his new razor and uses it all the time.</li>
            <li> Awesome shaver!&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing bad I can say about this shaver, it&#x27;s on the expensive side but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Although the braun 790cc has a high price tag it is worth it if you suffer from sensitive skin like I do. Cartridge shaving and rotary electric razors would leave my skin red and beaten by the time it was all done. I now use this razor on the extra sensitive mode and it is FAR superior to any electric razor I&#x27;ve owned before(Remington/ Panasonic rotary shavers). It shaves my face and neck very efficiently with no irritation. But keep in mind a good prep and post shave is key if you have sensitive skin. Some tips I have learned are: shave 1+ hours after waking up in the morning, use a small amount of baby powder 10 minutes before you start the shave to get skin bone dry, during this 10 minute intermission massage the facial hair against the grain with your hands to lift hairs off the surface of the skin, shave your trouble area first (mine is the neck) and be as light and gentle as you can while pressing the razor to the skin. I shave against the grain in slow long strokes then I go at a very slight angle with the same pressure to get bbs skin with this razor. Some users have suggested that shaving every day will give you the best shave but I disagree. For me, allowing the hair to grow for 2-3 days is best and I believe it&#x27;s because the hair is now long enough to be efficiently guided into the foil.(when I shave every day a lot of hairs are just passed over by the blade) also, a good post shave is KEY for sensitive skin. I use Nivea mens sensitive post shave balm that I got at Walmart for 6$ IT IS THE BEST I have tried far too many post shave balms and this one is light years ahead of them all. It ensures no irritation, smells fantastic but not over powering, and it actually slows the growth rate of my facial hair. I know that sounds crazy but it really does, I can now go 3 days with no shaving and my facial hair will be the same as if I didn&#x27;t shave for 1 day. Trust me, get it. The razor takes a little getting used to so give it 1 month before you decide to return it. For me, the only reason I bought this razor was for the shave quality so that is all that I will review today. I have had no problems with other aspects of the razor and cleaning system so far.</li>
            <li> I returned the product based on Braun&#x27;s money back guarantee; shipped it insured as specified. Returned item was received by Braun as shown by USPS tracking information and I waited 8 - 10 weeks for the refund which I never got. Called their &amp;#34;refund center&amp;#34; and they had no record of my return so I provided the tracking number and they said to call back in two weeks so they could do some research. Called back in two weeks and they had a record of my previous call, but no research had been done; told to call back again in two weeks. Purchase was in January, returned in February, it is now the end of June and Braun still has the razor and the money.</li>
            <li> Title say all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it for over 6 months. this is my 2nd purchase for friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very clean shave but it take some time and shaver need to be clean for clean shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price too. my country selling this for USD370 lol</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers exclusive for many years. My skin has thinned and my 2-D Norelco caused razor burn, so I needed a change. Did some research and decided to purchase the Braun 7-790cc. Best razor I have ever used, no more nicks.</li>
            <li> Great close shave.  2nd Braun Great.....</li>
            <li> This thing kicks some ass! Changed my opinion of electric razors. I rarely wet shave anymore.</li>
            <li> Not a bad replacement for the Panasonic ES-LA63. The shave quality seemed to drop off rapidly after a month, but is decent. It is much quieter than the Panasonic and holds a charge pretty long.</li>
            <li> Best shaver ever! No other shaver would work on my neck. Most blades gave me razor bumps. This has solved both. Pricey, but well worth every penny. I use this every day.and would never use anything else.</li>
            <li> good electric razor. does not shave neck real close. still have to use regular razor for close neck shaves</li>
            <li> a good gift for my friend</li>
            <li> Awesome Electric Shaver. The best I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> Braun was bought out by P&amp;G a few years ago, and since then, the quality of their replacement cartridges has dropped from 10 out of 10 stars to about 1 star. I almost purchased this shaver, but luckily I read the reviews for the replacement cartridges first. Apparently with any Braun shaver, you will only get an excellent shave until the original cartridge wears out. Replacement cartridges are inferior quality, pull and tug at the hair, and have to be replaced every 3 months. I decided to go with a Panisonic model electric shaver instead, as the reviews for their replacement cartridges are stellar.</li>
            <li> Just got my shaver and love it. Have used it for 2 days now and it blows away my previous shavers. Close and quick shaves.</li>
            <li> My husband picked this out. He had a braun for many years and loved it. The battery broke and was not able to be replaced, so we searched for a new one. He is very happy with it. Braun is an excellent product. We also received it a lot sooner than we expected. Very good service.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think shaving could get much better than with my (ten years old) Braun 500 series shaver.  Now using this 790 its smoother and faster than before.  Real close shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a traditional disposable razor for 20 years and this was my first electric.  I bought it based on the reviews online and not wanting to spend $400 on the top rated model.  I like it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> So far, the shaver is doing a very good job.  I am happy with the new design of the head with the movement.  If it lasts 5 years, it will be a great buy.</li>
            <li> Powerful, efficient, and nice looking shaver that does its job perfectly.  The only drawback is its lack of power storage that can last more that an hour or so.  It is not for travelers, but it is great for in-home use.  So far the best shaver I ever own.</li>
            <li> If you have a thick, dark beard, it doesn&#x27;t shave as well as a razor.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this shaver. This shaver gives a good shave but there were other problems. The shaver head lock broke after a few months. The whisker trimmings are not contained well and just fall out. The shaver head does not lock well and now has an annoying vibration.</li>
            <li> This shaver was not as advertised. I took my old razor and did  one side of my face (Rotary) and did the other half with my new Braun. My old razor out preformed it and did not have to use any cleaner just plain old water.Lost money on the return.</li>
            <li> I have owned this Braun shaver for around 3 years and have been able to compare it with Panasonic´s Arc5 Wet and Dry shaver, which I have used for about 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, I must clarify that I have a very tough and fast-growing beard. It takes me between 10 and 12 minutes to shave. Both shavers cut my beard close enough for around 6 hours. After that, I need to retouch my beard if I have an event that requires it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main differences between the Panasonic and the Braun shavers are: Braun is slightly faster and a full battery charge is enough for about 6 to 7 shaves whereas, Panasonic lasts only for about 3 to 4 shaves. Also, the Braun shaver is easier to clean using only liquid soap and water. If a were to buy again one of these two, I would buy Braun´s Series 7-790 shaver.</li>
            <li> I have a light beard and this is the best electric shaver I have used, shaves really close and takes little time, great shaver!!</li>
            <li> Mostly good razor. Fluid cartridges wear out quickly. They have no incentive to change this, as they make money off the cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;Also the flip up trimmer is underpowered, is why I give it a 3. Its better then most on the market, I&#x27;d give it a 5 if it were around 35$, however I hold it to a higher standard because of the price.</li>
            <li> nice product works extremely well</li>
            <li> not worth the money so save it</li>
            <li> Just got this yesterday. I charged it up and shaved.  Wow! Probably one of the best shavers I&#x27;ve ever used.  Clean and close shave without the cuts or abrasion burns.  Easy to care for.  I love the panel that tells you the battery status and hygiene status as well as when to replace shaver head.  I also like that I can use it corded if I need to.  Definitely worth the price of 159.00.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my braum 7 it really nice</li>
            <li> Either a manufacturing or design flaw causes the razor to pluck hairs.  There is a gap between the side of the head and the foil.  Beard hair gets caught and plucked.  It is not a great way to start the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun has been less than helpful, simply saying the foil is not covered by the warranty.  Brand new razor.  Not covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lovely.  It gives a great shave otherwise and I really wish I could like the razor but right now it is an expensive decoration on my bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Braun sent me a new foil cartridge as a &amp;#34;goodwill gesture&amp;#34; and the razor no longer pulls hair.  The first head must be defective.  I can see a gap on the side where it is grabbing the hair.  gap is much smaller on the new foil. so I would upgrade this to a 4 star.  It does give an excellent shave and now that it doesn&#x27;t cause pain....  I would recommend but Braun needs to step up and stop acting like it is a favor to replace a defective part.</li>
            <li> It cuts well. I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> I never used one of these before. However, the first time I tried it, I was amazed ...  It shaves very well, it&#x27;s quiet and it does shave close especially with all the various settings.  I would recommend this for anyone ..</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using it and I don&#x27;t get cuts anymore on my neck since I made the switch. The reason it did not make 5 starts is I have a lil hard time getting the hair by my Adams apple. I do recommend this my friend changed to this and has no problems what so ever. I like it and will probably stay with it.</li>
            <li> Would NOT start or Shut off. Braun told me to return it to You. Amazon took care of returning my credit and gift account.</li>
            <li> The razor gives me a very good shave.  And the battery life seems better than my previous Brauns.</li>
            <li> works great ,best electric shaver i have had. the price is better than any of the stores around my area. great close shave without the burn. would recomend to anyone in the market for a new electric shaver</li>
            <li> Does not cut beard as advertised. I am 82 and beard is light. Tried to return it but could not as package contained cleaning fluid for razor.A waste of money. Not returnable should be on ordering page. On a limited income cannot afford scam advertising on an inferior product.</li>
            <li> I have owned this for a couple of months now after trying a cheaper Braun to get into the electric razor scene as using cartridge razors was tearing up my face. The trick to using this razor is a combination of using the &amp;#34;intensity&amp;#34; level that works for you and pressing somewhat hard for a close shave. This will get just as close as a normal razor when used correctly and will not destroy your face if you take your time with it.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m quite happy about it. It does share really well and it&#x27;s powerful. The skin is healthy, it doesn&#x27;t irritate as much as my older ones. The only thing that I find too bad is that it requires often to change the dock&#x27;s cartridges (especially for me who sometimes doesn&#x27;t shave for a week. I believe the alcohol disappears even if you&#x27;re not really using it)</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it!  I&#x27;ve been using various electric shavers over the last 50 years.  This is the best.  So far, it&#x27;s given me the closest shaves of any of the other shavers that I&#x27;ve used.  The only negative is the cleaning station&#x27;s ongoing cost.  I think that I might have been better off getting one of the lesser expensive Braun shavers without a cleaning station.</li>
            <li> best electric razor I have ever used! Shave is as close as a blade. I even use it to shave my bald head. Great value for the money.</li>
            <li> It is a good electric shaver, the. Best of the shavers,is  a GOOLAZO(soccer)</li>
            <li> Had to go through 2 iterations of returns for faulty cleaner and/or cord. shaver works great though!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very upset with this razor!  I had been waiting close to a year to justify spending this much for it.  I finally broke in and bought it and was wondering where the heck is all the hype!  rue the cleaning feature is nice but it pulls my hairs on my face when it&#x27;s hardly grown out.  I thought I would give it time thinking maybe it&#x27;s because my face is not used to a new razor but nope still pulls hairs after a 2 months now.  I guess my Panasonics aren&#x27;t so bad after all.</li>
            <li> I finally bought a replacement for my old Braun shaver.  I think I have had for at least 15 years and it still works.  It just does not hold a charge as long and I wanted to try something new.  I love this 790cc so far!</li>
            <li> Biggest surprise about this razor: it&#x27;s much quieter than Braun&#x27;s 760. Bought the 760 about 3 years ago and was pretty happy with it. I tend to buy a new razor every few years because the replacement heads just don&#x27;t seem to be up to par with the ones that come with the razor itself. Little did I know that the 790, besides the 3 shaving modes, had another surprise for me. My wife tends to complain that I make too much noise shaving. That was with the 760. With the 790, she doesn&#x27;t even notice I&#x27;m shaving, that&#x27;s how quiet it is. I am also very pleasantly surprised by the way it shaves. Much better than the 760. Highly recommended,</li>
            <li> been using buarn for years best one yet</li>
            <li> It has nice shave but throws a lot of trimmings out onto your chest.</li>
            <li> My husband, who the razor was purchased for, is extremely happy with the razor. It works well, is quiet, and gives a very close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Phyllis</li>
            <li> Shaves great. Slight annoyance that after 4-5 shaves it says it is super dirty and wants a full cleaning. The cleaning is easy just put it its stand and push the button but it is LOUD! and takes quite a while to go through a cycle.</li>
            <li> cutting is quick and clean. No razor burn. Previously had a Braun that was about 10+ years old. this thing is light years ahead of it.&lt;br /&gt;I recently began shaving my head, and went to a barber to get a straight razor shave. I shaved with my braun 2 days later.&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I both the Braun left the smoothest results of the two shaves.</li>
            <li> Best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. It even gets the little hairs that typically get away with my previous model.</li>
            <li> good but details can also be strengthened</li>
            <li> As a lifelong Remington micro-screen user I decided a change was needed. After a week or so I look forward to shaving. Smooth, non-irritating, fast and every time a clean conditioned/clean shaver. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 MONTH UPDATE: I just replaced my first container of cleaner conditioner. I have used it 6 days a week for two months. As for the shaver it has worked flawlessly, no razor burn, no beard pull and it shows my tough grey hairs no mercy.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best razor I have ever owned.  With others, i have to go back and forth several times to get a good shave.  With this one, about two passes is all it takes.</li>
            <li> A close shave. But I can&#x27;t shave around my stash! That takes a razor.</li>
            <li> My hubby LOVES this shaver!! We did our research and found this to be the best shaver out there so I bought it for him for his birthday at a great price on Amazon! Gives a nice close shave and has indicator lights that show battery charging and what stage of cleaning - love the self cleaning feature!! You will love it too!!</li>
            <li> very powerful and good!!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my hubby for Christmas. To date, using every day, he thinks it is A-OK. He has since beginning to shave, some 55 years ago, always used a straight razor, so this is a very new expirience, which he is enjoying. Thanks Braun</li>
            <li> This will feel great for you IF you never tried a Panasonic &amp;#60;made in Japan&amp;#62; ever checked where Braun are made lately?</li>
            <li> Great product - - - everything I expected!</li>
            <li> This is the best electric shaver that I have ever owned. I even bought one for my father to try and he loves it!</li>
            <li> Quiet, runs for a long time on one charge and provides a very good shave.</li>
            <li> Excellent shave and great system - worth the money and good value on Amazon</li>
            <li> Skeptical of using an electric razor???????? Get this !!!  I have a sensitive face and straight razors ALWAYS cause me to break out and water burn everytime...I use this now 3 times a week...no burning face....smooth skin for about 2 days before it feels a little stubbly......the cleaning station is AWESOME however dont clean it and then go back and reshave your face if you missed a spot that s*** BURNS haha but its nice and quiet with different settings you can use...been using for about a month and havent had to replace the head or the gel.</li>
            <li> AMAZING SHAVE;  AS GOOD AS 5 BLADE GILLETTE / SCHICK RAZORS.  I&#x27;VE USED THEM ALL!</li>
            <li> This is most comfortable, closest shave I have ever experienced.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Sorry I didn&#x27;t buy another Philip Norelco.  The trimmer is in a bad location on the shaver. Can&#x27;t see what you are trimming.</li>
            <li> Nice product, as advertised, delivered as promised</li>
            <li> Really like this razor.  Quiet and it&#x27;s not ripping the hairs out like cheap electrics.  It&#x27;s my second 7 series from Braun since my bag was stolen out of my unlocked car while my wife shopped.&lt;br /&gt;Glad it&#x27;s made in Germany.&lt;br /&gt;Design issues:&lt;br /&gt;When you close the trimmer portion, hair always bunches up under it and it has to be brushed out all the time so it will close.&lt;br /&gt;The charging base is heating up the alcohol it uses to clean itself which seems like it makes the unit use it up quickly.  It says it&#x27;s just SD alcohol, but I haven&#x27;t been brave enough to top it off with a $0.45 worth of product.  Rather, I suck it up and pay way too much for the cartridge.  That&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars.  I feel like they made a product that will last 10-15 years and decided they needed something to sell us until we wear the razor out.&lt;br /&gt;My old 7 series was 2 or 3 years old and still on the original blades.  It was still clearing my thick, Irish-German beard off my face daily without dulling.</li>
            <li> Best shaver I have had ,  close, smooth !</li>
            <li> This razor is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned are you still on the Norrell go and it was good but this is a little better very pleased with the results smooth shave</li>
            <li> excellent electric shaver smooth and clean shave all the time. Find that it needs to be electronically cleaned after each shave however. As good as anything I&#x27;ve ever used. I think better than norelco.  pretty darn good product. the sounds of the electric motor sounds substantial and powerful. can&#x27;t think of anything else better to use other than a Harry&#x27;s blade. use it well.</li>
            <li> I have quit your surveys!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look back and you&#x27;ll see you asked that I RE-DO one!!</li>
            <li> I have used blade razors for years on my head.  This thing did the job in less time, with less mess, with almost a blade razor closeness.  I must say this is the best purchase since a Headblade I have made for shaving my head.  I was skeptical, even with all the reviews and recommendations.  I should have bought this long ago, would have saved a lot of time and money.  It is very likely I will never use a blade razor again, as close and clean as this shaver gets.  Extremely pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> As others have said, they seem to have changed the foil design on this unit, and it&#x27;s now a $160 paper weight. It will pull on your beard hairs and be so painful that it literally cannot be used. The only way it can be used without pain is if you have already very short beard hair. If you&#x27;re like me and let it grow for over a day, or have fast growing hair, it will be agonizing to use. I don&#x27;t normally take the time to write reviews on amazon products, but this one is so bad that I felt obligated to. My old shaver was a Braun, and I loved that one, but sadly I won&#x27;t be making any Braun purchases again after wasting so much money on this product.</li>
            <li> This really is the closest electric shaver shave I have had.  I previously owned a Norelco, a Remington, and a Braun.  I loved my Braun the best and would still be using it (7 years), but my wife dropped it on the tile floor one too many times while cleaning the bathroom counters.  I was looking for a replacement and had it narrowed down to a Panasonic or this Braun and decided that the Braun would be best choice fro me since it can still be operated when the Batteries die with a cord supplied.  The Panasonic needs a charge to operate apparently.  As good as my last Braun was, this is night and day better than my old one Braun shaver.  It gives a closer shave with no face burning and the battery lasts for a really long time.  It was expensive, but if it lasts as long as my last Braun, it will definitely be worth the money spent.</li>
