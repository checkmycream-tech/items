            <li>I love this body wash!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even create a nice lather.    </li>
            <li>I use body wash more than bar soap.</li>
            <li>but like the Caress scarlet blossom better.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this wash.</li>
            <li>The scent is great and it makes the whole bathroom smell like &#x27;you&#x27; when you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li>My mom loves the smell and she siad it makes her feel so sexy after she washes up with it ...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Makes for a wonderful bathing experience, leaves your skin silky soft and lightly scented.</li>
            <li>this is my favorite Caress.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stress how much I love this shower gel.</li>
            <li>I am always on the hunt for good smelling shower items and this one has been the best I hope theyre not planning on discontinuing it since its getting hard to find.</li>
            <li>Leaves it soft and smelling great hours after I&#x27;ve taken a shower/bath.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good reasonably priced body wash</li>
            <li>Many thanks to those who developed this wonderful elixir.</li>
            <li>but you would be strongly scented.</li>
            <li>So whenever it is available</li>
            <li>When they say your skin will be lightly scented all day, they are not kidding.</li>
            <li>New favorite scent!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a big bottle for a good price.</li>
            <li>To be truthful, Scarlet Blossom runs a very close second, but this is just a tad above that excellent fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought both the red and purple one because I was giving them one more chance to redeem themselves after discontinuing my Exotic Oil Infusions.    </li>
            <li>This body wash smells great, is nice and thick, and it lathers very well.</li>
            <li>My favorite soap scent by far.</li>
            <li>I really never want to get out of the shower, the smell is that good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always out in my local store whenever I go to purchase more..</li>
            <li>I love gritty scrubs and that is the one!    </li>
            <li>I actually checked the backseat to be sure no one wearing too much perfume had snuck in!     </li>
            <li>The scent of Sheer Twilight is simply fabulous.  </li>
            <li>thanks again.</li>
            <li>I love how long the scent last and</li>
            <li>I brought a double pack and the first one is on its way to being gone.</li>
            <li>It lathers well, feels indulgent and is more than half the price of one smaller container of Bath &amp; Body Works shower gel.</li>
            <li>It is hard to describe the lovely and indulgent scent.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and this soap doesn&#x27;t bother my skin at all.</li>
            <li>Also, it does not break my sensitive skin out.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of soft musk, jasmin, lavender.....</li>
            <li>DRYS out skin like no other!!    </li>
            <li>I DEFINITELY DO NOT recommend this for sensitive, dry, or normal skin.</li>

            <li> This smells amazing!!!...It&#x27;s always out in my local store whenever I go to purchase more..So whenever it is available I purchase 3 or 4 at a time!...I love how long the scent last and how well it lathers and cleans...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 100% no longer a Caress fan after buying these.. I bought both the red and purple one because I was giving them one more chance to redeem themselves after discontinuing my Exotic Oil Infusions.    This to me smells like a really strong fake fruit smell with random whiffs of Hypnose.    I&#x27;ve been itchy all weekend and this is definitely the reason. It doesn&#x27;t even create a nice lather.    I DEFINITELY DO NOT recommend this for sensitive, dry, or normal skin. DRYS out skin like no other!!    If you are looking for a good reasonably priced body wash I recommend St. Ives Mineral Therapy.. Splurge and get the apricot scrub!!! I love gritty scrubs and that is the one!    Don&#x27;t be fooled by the beautiful image on the front, OR the advertisement on their website!!!</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and this soap doesn&#x27;t bother my skin at all. Leaves it soft and smelling great hours after I&#x27;ve taken a shower/bath.I even pour a little bit under the running water while taking a bath and relaxes me instantly. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant. It lathers well, feels indulgent and is more than half the price of one smaller container of Bath &amp; Body Works shower gel. Also, it does not break my sensitive skin out. I use body wash more than bar soap. I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> When they say your skin will be lightly scented all day, they are not kidding. I could not figure out what the flowery smell was in my car today - I actually checked the backseat to be sure no one wearing too much perfume had snuck in!     I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;m a fan of the smell left behind - I usually don&#x27;t wear perfume, and you definitely can&#x27;t wear perfume with this - well, you could but you would be strongly scented. Make sure you want to smell like this all day before you buy it!</li>
            <li> I tried both Sheer Twilight and Scarlet Blossom and Scarlet Blossom is the winner by a long shot.  This scent doesn&#x27;t mesh. It has conflicting overtones.  If you weren&#x27;t sold on this scent, consider the Scarlet Blossom body wash by Caress.  It is hard to describe the lovely and indulgent scent.  Neither body wash is considered to be moisturizing or exfoliating.  They are both scented with a perfume-type fragrance.  Sheer Twilight just doesn&#x27;t appeal to me. Scarlet Blossom beguiles and enchants me!  I also don&#x27;t like the name - Sheer Twilight - what does that mean?</li>
            <li> Good product but like the Caress scarlet blossom better.</li>
            <li> The local store I used to buy this from stopped selling this. I LOVE this wash. I am always on the hunt for good smelling shower items and this one has been the best I hope theyre not planning on discontinuing it since its getting hard to find. The scent is great and it makes the whole bathroom smell like &#x27;you&#x27; when you&#x27;re using it. I wish they made a lotion.</li>
            <li> The scent of Sheer Twilight is simply fabulous.  It has to be the best scented body wash, regardless of brand, on the market.  To be truthful, Scarlet Blossom runs a very close second, but this is just a tad above that excellent fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin smells marvelous for hours afterward, and I find myself sniffing my lower arms just to enjoy the scent.  It would be wonderful to have this produced in lotion and/or cream form, and perhaps a spray as well.  I truly hope the manufacturer considers expanding the line into these additional products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another bonus-the scent lingers in the bathroom for hours afterward as well.  Simply heavenly and one of life&#x27;s little pleasures.  Many thanks to those who developed this wonderful elixir.</li>
            <li> My mom loves the smell and she siad it makes her feel so sexy after she washes up with it ...she dont even have to wear perfume</li>
            <li> Heavenly! New favorite scent! Wish I could find it in a lotion as well!</li>
            <li> i guess i did not rinse it off well enough, and the problem it made sores on me.I always purchase this product, and I don&#x27;t know this one was so different.</li>
            <li> This body wash smells wonderful and it leaves the bathroom smelling wonderful.  I love it.</li>
            <li> If you have never experienced this scent, you are missing out! Makes for a wonderful bathing experience, leaves your skin silky soft and lightly scented. Reminds me of soft musk, jasmin, lavender.....this is my favorite Caress. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> The scent is amazing! Long lasting, too. Tons of lather. Works great as a bubble bath, too. It&#x27;s a big bottle for a good price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using caress with this scent  for over a year and I&#x27;ll never stop. I keep lathering up over and over again, it takes a while for me to get out of the shower. I brought a double pack and the first one is on its way to being gone. thanks again.</li>
            <li> This body wash smells great, is nice and thick, and it lathers very well. I have it on auto ship.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. My favorite soap scent by far. I put it in a hand wash pump for the bathroom. It makes your hands smell heavenly!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stress how much I love this shower gel. The fragrance is AMAZING! The lather is great. I really never want to get out of the shower, the smell is that good.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item at grocery store once.  Since then I am unable to find it  at grocery store or pharmacys.  I did find Caress Sheer Twilight at Amason.  I love this body wash!</li>
