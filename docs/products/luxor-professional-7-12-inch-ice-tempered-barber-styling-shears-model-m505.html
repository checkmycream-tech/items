            <li>Very nice scissors.  </li>
            <li>The Luxor 7 1/2 inch Barber Shears are great and a great price I ordered two pairs and love them</li>
            <li>but I wish I knew a good way to sharpen them.</li>
            <li>it came in a nice plastic case and it cuts great.  </li>
            <li>the price is good for the product.  </li>
            <li>I purchased these to cut my own hair and they work great.</li>
            <li>but they are good shears.</li>
            <li>It needed a touch up honing to get it to cut without pulling, otherwise a good deal.</li>
            <li>thought the product looked good and was excite to use it.</li>
            <li>Good scissors</li>
            <li>They look so good in this ad, and even when I received them.</li>
            <li>To get good scissors, you have to spend money.  </li>
            <li>Good for paper but not for hair.  </li>
            <li>When i received them i was very satisfied because they cut very nicely and the gold handles are nicely done also.</li>
            <li>These are awesome shears really sharp, best ones I have purchased.</li>
            <li>Better of investing on something good.</li>
            <li>Nicely weighted.</li>
            <li>The name on the scissor is NICE, if that matters.</li>
            <li>Unprofessionally, family, my own, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so i didnt need anything spectacular.  </li>
            <li>I also cut my own hair, and have since I was 18.  </li>
            <li>If you are any kind of person who knows how to cut hair, do not purchase these.</li>
            <li>These will work for your own hair or your kids hair.</li>
            <li>Great price and fast shipping too!!!</li>
            <li>I suggest spending more and hopefully you will get more!</li>
            <li>The shears are clearly a cheap attempt at good shears.</li>
            <li>Very happy with these so far.</li>
            <li>Good clean scissors, work well , seem well made.</li>
            <li>These are good quality cutters that are very precise and leave a clean cut.</li>
            <li>This item arrived quickly and in good shape.</li>
            <li>I am so satisfied with Amazon</li>
            <li>I bought more than 40 years ago</li>
            <li>still work much better than these, even though they have never been sharpened.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li>I can get better results from round-end children&#x27;s scissors.</li>
            <li>This one is ok in all respects.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t make that satisfying whispered</li>
            <li>And, while they cut hair okay, they cut it just okay.</li>
            <li>This is a great choice for reasonable shears.</li>
            <li>, I guess it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>They work better than a pair of shears I purchased for about 3x the price.</li>
            <li>Buy a better product.</li>
            <li>Good for elementary arts and crafts.</li>
            <li>I love using this to cut friend&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>AND SHE LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I have been a licensed stylist for many years.</li>
            <li>My sewing scissors cut hair much better than these.</li>
            <li>OK FOR PRICE.  </li>
            <li>HOME HAIRCUTTING USE WILL BE OK.</li>
            <li>love the finger grip, it helps.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be able to use them even on my dogs</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>The finish on these shears looked promising, they fit fairly well in my hand, but they don&#x27;t cut hair!</li>
            <li>Pretty good value also.  </li>
            <li>Nice and sharp, comfortable to grip and a good weight for good control.</li>
            <li>These are very good quality, low cost, shears.</li>
            <li>Have not had a chance to use scissors yet but am happy so far with purchase.</li>
            <li>I bought these because I figured they&#x27;d be great cutters labled as professional but from the box</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK for the price, not as smooth operating as the pricey store shears.</li>
            <li>I have been happy with these thus far.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps you will get a great pair, but with variability this large, I&#x27;d look elsewhere for a more consistent product.</li>
            <li>Some of the scissors we had did not  cut easily.  </li>
            <li>They cut easily.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it just me, but I notice that the scizzors doesn&#x27;t seem to be easy on the fingers.  </li>
            <li>easy to hold ample thumb room and great for large fingers.&lt;br /&gt;super quality as much higher priced.</li>
            <li>Excellent very sharp and sturdy just what I was looking for</li>
            <li>metallic \\&quot;swish\\&quot; sound that perfectly honed blades make when they pass each other precisely.</li>
            <li>so these were fine for what I needed.</li>
            <li>So they will be fine.</li>
            <li>I purchased these specifically for occassional home use, and I&#x27;m fine with them for what I paid.  </li>
            <li>They have a good heft in the hand and and the blades are nice and long, which I prefer.</li>
            <li>I did like was the length, and the grips are perfect for my fingers (female, size large gloves).</li>
            <li>She was using non-hair scissors before and these were a huge improvement.</li>
            <li>Cheap product.  </li>
            <li>Do not waist time and money on this cheap product.</li>
            <li>I bought these just to do some household hair trimming and they work fantastic.  </li>
            <li>please with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They fit well in you fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are also comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the product at all, I thought even though it was cheap</li>
            <li>Fantastic price</li>
            <li>They fit my hand comfortably and are well sharpened.  </li>
            <li>I was excited because I figured that they were made there</li>
            <li>Perfect for the amateur hair stylist.</li>
            <li>It works pretty ok</li>
            <li>Fine scissorsâ€‹, could be sharper, but good overall</li>
            <li>Not that I was expecting much, but these are very cheap scissors.</li>
            <li>But I really can&#x27;t call them any better than \\&quot;meh.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Instead there is a sweet spot that accounts for 60 percent.  </li>
            <li>Sharp, great scissors.</li>
            <li>They were shipped quickly and arrived packaged well.</li>
            <li>but perhaps a little more money on another pair of scizzors would be better on the fingers to make it cut easier without any more effort to cut using your fingers.  </li>
            <li>If they last I&#x27;ll be very pleased</li>
            <li>These scissors are very sharp and cut great.</li>
            <li>Good sturdy scissors, sharp, cuts clean.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and it came with a case too!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re nice and sharp and easy to cut with.</li>
            <li>Mine were very sharp (tested it on wet tissue paper)They give a clean cut, not as light as some I have bought before, but they definitely do an excellent job for the price!</li>
            <li>I eventually resorted to using my cheap kitchen shears which were much sharper and smoother than these \\&quot;professional\\&quot; shears.</li>
            <li>They were all better than what we had been using, but the Luxor professional</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair and these have held up for several years.  </li>
            <li>Pay 16 bucks, and you&#x27;ll get 16 bucks worth of scissors.</li>
            <li>My wife uses them to cut the hair of my son and I. One of the most important features scissors such as these should have is the ability to adjust the tension.</li>
            <li>Sharper blades for a more professional look.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable fit and very sharp tip - allowing for precise cutting/trimming.  </li>
            <li>If they are held the right way they cut well.</li>
            <li>The right scissors DO make all the difference.</li>
            <li>I guess they are all right ... seem so cut well, but the shears I received state that they are 6 /1/2 inch and not 7 12.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;to replace them with the right pair, please send return label.</li>
            <li>They work great for the amateur barber that I am.</li>
            <li>These seemed like pretty good scissors that were sharp and well-made, and reviewed well</li>
            <li>Reduces hair cut  from 8 minutes to less than 2 minutes; hair cut is just as good in shorter time.  </li>
            <li>Not to accurate or precise, but short money.</li>
            <li>Nice comfortable handle and sharp enough to touch up bangs and layers very quickly.</li>
            <li>The hair was soft and fine.</li>
            <li>I would most definitely not order this product again.</li>
            <li>I would pay more next time</li>
            <li>I used these for the first time today to give a haircut.</li>
            <li>If I were to order again I would order a smaller pair to have more control.</li>
            <li>First attempt the hair foldered between the blades and did not cut.</li>
            <li>, snip the first time every time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used better scissors in middle school art class.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have read the most recent reviews on these shears.  </li>
            <li>These scissors were exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Ive had facial hair most of my life, and at age 63</li>
            <li>I have bought many low priced shears over those years to keep at home or to use when my higher quality shears needed to be sharpened.</li>
            <li>If these were to be used more regularly, I would suggest something lighter with a coated handle.</li>
            <li>All went good with the transaction but when the item arrived I realized that he blade wasn&#x27;t sharp enough to make a smooth cut, so, I&#x27;ve never used it again.</li>
            <li>Makes nice, sharp cuts.</li>
            <li>Nice sharp shears for the NON-professional.</li>
            <li>not sharp and it pulls hair so cheap is not always the way to go.  </li>
            <li>Really good,I tried this for my first haircut and it was a breeze.</li>
            <li>but I got over it pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I have had this product before, and the new one has been just as good as previous ones.  </li>
            <li>I suspect that if those of us who rate the scissors poorly were to use the highly rated scissors, we&#x27;d also like them, and I&#x27;m equally sure that the scissors we received would not suddenly perform beautifully in the hands of the five-star folk.</li>
            <li>however they don&#x27;t cut well if not held a certain way.</li>
            <li>They certainly beat using the children&#x27;s scissors</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to anyone who loves to run with a nice sharp pair.</li>
            <li>Be careful, these things are huge!</li>
            <li>They were absolute rubbish.  </li>
            <li>My wife cuts my hair and does it very well.</li>
            <li>Very shape, and in a protective case.</li>
            <li>and I can easily fit my big fingers inside the loops.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it much otherwise I&#x27;d buy another.</li>
            <li>They work very well - wouldn&#x27;t be without them.</li>
            <li>They seem very sturdy and can be disassembled for cleaning.</li>
            <li>Much nicer than the haircutting scissors it replaced.</li>
            <li>Excellent hair cutting scissors.  </li>
            <li>Works very well on my hair and my fiance uses it to keep his beard trimmed would purchase again if I have to.  </li>
            <li>too much flex in the blade itself.</li>
            <li>I use these once a month to trim my daughter&#x27;s bangs since they grow insanely fast compared to the rest of her</li>
            <li>It works very well and also it cuts well without any distraction.</li>
            <li>I think zero stars should also be a rating because 1 star is too much.</li>
            <li>but it was going to cost almost as much as I paid for them.</li>
            <li>absolutely perfect for cutting hair.&lt;br /&gt;sharp</li>
            <li>These are excellent scissors for cutting hair.</li>
            <li>Tried others, these really work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a professional, I just cut my own hair and normally use house scissors but thought I should get professional ones as to not create split ends.</li>
            <li>My Mom cuts hair with these all the time and they work better than any other pair we&#x27;ve had that I can remember.</li>
            <li>They do not cost much but they are decent for what they are.</li>
            <li>If I try to trim a larger area with the full length of the blade, it doesn&#x27;t work either.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to have to pay to sharpen new scissors!</li>
            <li>From the midpoint of the blade to the tip, it did NOT cut the hairs, The MAIN purpose of BARBER Styling Shears is to cut at the tips for ear and nose areas.</li>
            <li>I use this pair as my main cutters.</li>
            <li>I just assumed that bigger more powerful shears were a better thing (grunt), until my clumsy fiancee got close to my eye with theses giant things.</li>
            <li>the reviews seemed decent.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Browse Amazon or the web, and you&#x27;ll see that really high quality barber shears go for hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend highly</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for more than 10 times and it&#x27;s still sharp so far.</li>
            <li>These are very good hair cutting scissors.  </li>
            <li>Sharp and easy to use</li>
            <li>Sharp and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy, sharp and pointy.  </li>
            <li>The shears cut reasonably well near the tip.  </li>
            <li>Pay a few bucks for a better scissors.</li>
            <li>These are inexpensive and work ok, but they are stiff with an inability to adjust them.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable, multi-purpose, and sharp.</li>
            <li>I purchased these scissors for trimming hair and they are very sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Nice shears, only problem for me is my thumbs are a little snug in them and tend to get sore after making multiple cuts, I wear an XL in gloves, but never thought I had large hands by any means...</li>
            <li>So far no issues!</li>
            <li>scissors were cheap, which is why I bought them, figuring I had little to lose.</li>
            <li>Sharp and smooth at cutting hair and the finger rest on the handle is a nice addition!</li>
            <li>I would suggest just getting so high quality general household scissors.  </li>
            <li>Since they vary so widely/wildly, I think it quite likely, as one reviewer hinted, that the manufacturer turns out many scissors of this model, with little to no concern for quality control.</li>
            <li>Professional at this price??</li>
            <li>I used these two times so far.</li>
            <li>they were duller than ones I&#x27;ve bought much cheaper locally.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d use these for a professional application, but for my purposes they are just what I needed.</li>
            <li>old pair of Shears were just that. . .</li>
            <li>/&gt;Picked these up for about what it costs to sharpen the old ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>THEY ARE VEEEERY PROFESSIONAL.</li>
            <li>Do not waste one penny on these.</li>
            <li>I cut my hair and my husbands and needed to replace my old scissors.  </li>
            <li>hope they last, really cut my hair well.</li>
            <li>Well made, cut like professional scissors.</li>
            <li>They simply would not cut hair on the feet of a freshly washed English Springer Spaniel&#x27;s that was not even dense coat.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also small, so they&#x27;re easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>They showed up dull, plus when I had a professional check out this item, he mentioned so many inconsistencies in it that he hoped that I didn&#x27;t pay too much for it.</li>
            <li>Not sharp well to cut pets hair!</li>
            <li>Since they were cheap, I don&#x27;t feel badly cheated, because I shouldn&#x27;t have expected good quality</li>
            <li>These are excellent scissors for cutting hair, even in  tight places.</li>
            <li>I purchased these shears because I needed to have a pair at the office for quick little cuts when I need them.</li>
            <li>they are light and feel a little fragile.  </li>
            <li>We would definitely recommend them as great hair cutting scissors.</li>
            <li>The shears are not made in China which is a plus if you feel like supporting other developing economies.</li>
            <li>the styling shears not sharp</li>
            <li>In other words, when you bend the scizzors to cut the hair, it seems like you have to put a little more effort into it to clip together the shears.  </li>
            <li>I do not expect this to last very long, and at the price, it should last significantly longer, do yourself a favor and go to lowes and buy some clauss scissors instead for the same price.</li>
            <li>It did the job and maybe if I were a professional it would be different</li>
            <li>bought it to cut my bangs and so far i had only use it once</li>
            <li>Way too big and loud while using them.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t think it would be worth the trouble to return.</li>
            <li>This pair is good for cutting bulk as well as intricate trimming.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just say nicely, it is made poorly!</li>
            <li>The fingerholes are appropriate, they are sharp enough and tight enough to snip hair even at a professional level.      </li>
            <li>They require tightening frequently, and they went dull fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>Now my original shears are too dull to use,</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t cut very well, don&#x27;t even seem sharp, so I would recommend against buying them.</li>
            <li>These shears are terribly dull and do not open and close smoothly which actually hurt my hand when I was trying to cut my nephew&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not sure if this is normal or defective on this particular model.  </li>
            <li>My other old pair is easy on movement, but this one seems a little too tight in movement.  </li>

            <li> Hair looks great</li>
            <li> Very nice scissors.  </li>
            <li> The Luxor 7 1/2 inch Barber Shears are great and a great price I ordered two pairs and love them</li>
            <li> but I wish I knew a good way to sharpen them.</li>
            <li> it came in a nice plastic case and it cuts great.  </li>
            <li> the price is good for the product.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these to cut my own hair and they work great.</li>
            <li> but they are good shears.</li>
            <li> It needed a touch up honing to get it to cut without pulling, otherwise a good deal.</li>
            <li> thought the product looked good and was excite to use it.</li>
            <li> Good scissors</li>
            <li> They look so good in this ad, and even when I received them.</li>
            <li> To get good scissors, you have to spend money.  </li>
            <li> Good for paper but not for hair.  </li>
            <li> When i received them i was very satisfied because they cut very nicely and the gold handles are nicely done also.</li>
            <li> These are awesome shears really sharp, best ones I have purchased.</li>
            <li> Better of investing on something good.</li>
            <li> Nicely weighted.</li>
            <li> The name on the scissor is NICE, if that matters.</li>
            <li> Unprofessionally, family, my own, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so i didnt need anything spectacular.  </li>
            <li> I also cut my own hair, and have since I was 18.  </li>
            <li> If you are any kind of person who knows how to cut hair, do not purchase these.</li>
            <li> These will work for your own hair or your kids hair.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping too!!!</li>
            <li> I suggest spending more and hopefully you will get more!</li>
            <li> The shears are clearly a cheap attempt at good shears.</li>
            <li> Very happy with these so far.</li>
            <li> Good clean scissors, work well , seem well made.</li>
            <li> These are good quality cutters that are very precise and leave a clean cut.</li>
            <li> This item arrived quickly and in good shape.</li>
            <li> I am so satisfied with Amazon</li>
            <li> I bought more than 40 years ago</li>
            <li> still work much better than these, even though they have never been sharpened.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li> I can get better results from round-end children&#x27;s scissors.</li>
            <li> This one is ok in all respects.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t make that satisfying whispered</li>
            <li> And, while they cut hair okay, they cut it just okay.</li>
            <li> This is a great choice for reasonable shears.</li>
            <li> , I guess it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> They work better than a pair of shears I purchased for about 3x the price.</li>
            <li> Buy a better product.</li>
            <li> Good for elementary arts and crafts.</li>
            <li> I love using this to cut friend&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> AND SHE LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I have been a licensed stylist for many years.</li>
            <li> My sewing scissors cut hair much better than these.</li>
            <li> OK FOR PRICE.  </li>
            <li> HOME HAIRCUTTING USE WILL BE OK.</li>
            <li> love the finger grip, it helps.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be able to use them even on my dogs</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> The finish on these shears looked promising, they fit fairly well in my hand, but they don&#x27;t cut hair!</li>
            <li> Pretty good value also.  </li>
            <li> Nice and sharp, comfortable to grip and a good weight for good control.</li>
            <li> These are very good quality, low cost, shears.</li>
            <li> Have not had a chance to use scissors yet but am happy so far with purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I figured they&#x27;d be great cutters labled as professional but from the box</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK for the price, not as smooth operating as the pricey store shears.</li>
            <li> I have been happy with these thus far.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps you will get a great pair, but with variability this large, I&#x27;d look elsewhere for a more consistent product.</li>
            <li> Some of the scissors we had did not  cut easily.  </li>
            <li> They cut easily.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it just me, but I notice that the scizzors doesn&#x27;t seem to be easy on the fingers.  </li>
            <li> easy to hold ample thumb room and great for large fingers.&lt;br /&gt;super quality as much higher priced.</li>
            <li> Excellent very sharp and sturdy just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> metallic \\&quot;swish\\&quot; sound that perfectly honed blades make when they pass each other precisely.</li>
            <li> so these were fine for what I needed.</li>
            <li> So they will be fine.</li>
            <li> I purchased these specifically for occassional home use, and I&#x27;m fine with them for what I paid.  </li>
            <li> They have a good heft in the hand and and the blades are nice and long, which I prefer.</li>
            <li> I did like was the length, and the grips are perfect for my fingers (female, size large gloves).</li>
            <li> She was using non-hair scissors before and these were a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> Cheap product.  </li>
            <li> Do not waist time and money on this cheap product.</li>
            <li> I bought these just to do some household hair trimming and they work fantastic.  </li>
            <li> please with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They fit well in you fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are also comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the product at all, I thought even though it was cheap</li>
            <li> Fantastic price</li>
            <li> They fit my hand comfortably and are well sharpened.  </li>
            <li> I was excited because I figured that they were made there</li>
            <li> Perfect for the amateur hair stylist.</li>
            <li> It works pretty ok</li>
            <li> Fine scissorsâ€‹, could be sharper, but good overall</li>
            <li> Not that I was expecting much, but these are very cheap scissors.</li>
            <li> But I really can&#x27;t call them any better than \\&quot;meh.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Instead there is a sweet spot that accounts for 60 percent.  </li>
            <li> Sharp, great scissors.</li>
            <li> They were shipped quickly and arrived packaged well.</li>
            <li> but perhaps a little more money on another pair of scizzors would be better on the fingers to make it cut easier without any more effort to cut using your fingers.  </li>
            <li> If they last I&#x27;ll be very pleased</li>
            <li> These scissors are very sharp and cut great.</li>
            <li> Good sturdy scissors, sharp, cuts clean.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and it came with a case too!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re nice and sharp and easy to cut with.</li>
            <li> Mine were very sharp (tested it on wet tissue paper)They give a clean cut, not as light as some I have bought before, but they definitely do an excellent job for the price!</li>
            <li> I eventually resorted to using my cheap kitchen shears which were much sharper and smoother than these \\&quot;professional\\&quot; shears.</li>
            <li> They were all better than what we had been using, but the Luxor professional</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and these have held up for several years.  </li>
            <li> Pay 16 bucks, and you&#x27;ll get 16 bucks worth of scissors.</li>
            <li> My wife uses them to cut the hair of my son and I. One of the most important features scissors such as these should have is the ability to adjust the tension.</li>
            <li> Sharper blades for a more professional look.  </li>
            <li> Very comfortable fit and very sharp tip - allowing for precise cutting/trimming.  </li>
            <li> If they are held the right way they cut well.</li>
            <li> The right scissors DO make all the difference.</li>
            <li> I guess they are all right ... seem so cut well, but the shears I received state that they are 6 /1/2 inch and not 7 12.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;to replace them with the right pair, please send return label.</li>
            <li> They work great for the amateur barber that I am.</li>
            <li> These seemed like pretty good scissors that were sharp and well-made, and reviewed well</li>
            <li> Reduces hair cut  from 8 minutes to less than 2 minutes; hair cut is just as good in shorter time.  </li>
            <li> Not to accurate or precise, but short money.</li>
            <li> Nice comfortable handle and sharp enough to touch up bangs and layers very quickly.</li>
            <li> The hair was soft and fine.</li>
            <li> I would most definitely not order this product again.</li>
            <li> I would pay more next time</li>
            <li> I used these for the first time today to give a haircut.</li>
            <li> If I were to order again I would order a smaller pair to have more control.</li>
            <li> First attempt the hair foldered between the blades and did not cut.</li>
            <li> , snip the first time every time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better scissors in middle school art class.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have read the most recent reviews on these shears.  </li>
            <li> These scissors were exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Ive had facial hair most of my life, and at age 63</li>
            <li> I have bought many low priced shears over those years to keep at home or to use when my higher quality shears needed to be sharpened.</li>
            <li> If these were to be used more regularly, I would suggest something lighter with a coated handle.</li>
            <li> All went good with the transaction but when the item arrived I realized that he blade wasn&#x27;t sharp enough to make a smooth cut, so, I&#x27;ve never used it again.</li>
            <li> Makes nice, sharp cuts.</li>
            <li> Nice sharp shears for the NON-professional.</li>
            <li> not sharp and it pulls hair so cheap is not always the way to go.  </li>
            <li> Really good,I tried this for my first haircut and it was a breeze.</li>
            <li> but I got over it pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I have had this product before, and the new one has been just as good as previous ones.  </li>
            <li> I suspect that if those of us who rate the scissors poorly were to use the highly rated scissors, we&#x27;d also like them, and I&#x27;m equally sure that the scissors we received would not suddenly perform beautifully in the hands of the five-star folk.</li>
            <li> however they don&#x27;t cut well if not held a certain way.</li>
            <li> They certainly beat using the children&#x27;s scissors</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to anyone who loves to run with a nice sharp pair.</li>
            <li> Be careful, these things are huge!</li>
            <li> They were absolute rubbish.  </li>
            <li> My wife cuts my hair and does it very well.</li>
            <li> Very shape, and in a protective case.</li>
            <li> and I can easily fit my big fingers inside the loops.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it much otherwise I&#x27;d buy another.</li>
            <li> They work very well - wouldn&#x27;t be without them.</li>
            <li> They seem very sturdy and can be disassembled for cleaning.</li>
            <li> Much nicer than the haircutting scissors it replaced.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair cutting scissors.  </li>
            <li> Works very well on my hair and my fiance uses it to keep his beard trimmed would purchase again if I have to.  </li>
            <li> too much flex in the blade itself.</li>
            <li> I use these once a month to trim my daughter&#x27;s bangs since they grow insanely fast compared to the rest of her</li>
            <li> It works very well and also it cuts well without any distraction.</li>
            <li> I think zero stars should also be a rating because 1 star is too much.</li>
            <li> but it was going to cost almost as much as I paid for them.</li>
            <li> absolutely perfect for cutting hair.&lt;br /&gt;sharp</li>
            <li> These are excellent scissors for cutting hair.</li>
            <li> Tried others, these really work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional, I just cut my own hair and normally use house scissors but thought I should get professional ones as to not create split ends.</li>
            <li> My Mom cuts hair with these all the time and they work better than any other pair we&#x27;ve had that I can remember.</li>
            <li> They do not cost much but they are decent for what they are.</li>
            <li> If I try to trim a larger area with the full length of the blade, it doesn&#x27;t work either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to have to pay to sharpen new scissors!</li>
            <li> From the midpoint of the blade to the tip, it did NOT cut the hairs, The MAIN purpose of BARBER Styling Shears is to cut at the tips for ear and nose areas.</li>
            <li> I use this pair as my main cutters.</li>
            <li> I just assumed that bigger more powerful shears were a better thing (grunt), until my clumsy fiancee got close to my eye with theses giant things.</li>
            <li> the reviews seemed decent.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Browse Amazon or the web, and you&#x27;ll see that really high quality barber shears go for hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend highly</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for more than 10 times and it&#x27;s still sharp so far.</li>
            <li> These are very good hair cutting scissors.  </li>
            <li> Sharp and easy to use</li>
            <li> Sharp and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy, sharp and pointy.  </li>
            <li> The shears cut reasonably well near the tip.  </li>
            <li> Pay a few bucks for a better scissors.</li>
            <li> These are inexpensive and work ok, but they are stiff with an inability to adjust them.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable, multi-purpose, and sharp.</li>
            <li> I purchased these scissors for trimming hair and they are very sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Nice shears, only problem for me is my thumbs are a little snug in them and tend to get sore after making multiple cuts, I wear an XL in gloves, but never thought I had large hands by any means...</li>
            <li> So far no issues!</li>
            <li> scissors were cheap, which is why I bought them, figuring I had little to lose.</li>
            <li> Sharp and smooth at cutting hair and the finger rest on the handle is a nice addition!</li>
            <li> I would suggest just getting so high quality general household scissors.  </li>
            <li> Since they vary so widely/wildly, I think it quite likely, as one reviewer hinted, that the manufacturer turns out many scissors of this model, with little to no concern for quality control.</li>
            <li> Professional at this price??</li>
            <li> I used these two times so far.</li>
            <li> they were duller than ones I&#x27;ve bought much cheaper locally.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d use these for a professional application, but for my purposes they are just what I needed.</li>
            <li> old pair of Shears were just that. . .</li>
            <li> /&gt;Picked these up for about what it costs to sharpen the old ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> THEY ARE VEEEERY PROFESSIONAL.</li>
            <li> Do not waste one penny on these.</li>
            <li> I cut my hair and my husbands and needed to replace my old scissors.  </li>
            <li> hope they last, really cut my hair well.</li>
            <li> Well made, cut like professional scissors.</li>
            <li> They simply would not cut hair on the feet of a freshly washed English Springer Spaniel&#x27;s that was not even dense coat.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also small, so they&#x27;re easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> They showed up dull, plus when I had a professional check out this item, he mentioned so many inconsistencies in it that he hoped that I didn&#x27;t pay too much for it.</li>
            <li> Not sharp well to cut pets hair!</li>
            <li> Since they were cheap, I don&#x27;t feel badly cheated, because I shouldn&#x27;t have expected good quality</li>
            <li> These are excellent scissors for cutting hair, even in  tight places.</li>
            <li> I purchased these shears because I needed to have a pair at the office for quick little cuts when I need them.</li>
            <li> they are light and feel a little fragile.  </li>
            <li> We would definitely recommend them as great hair cutting scissors.</li>
            <li> The shears are not made in China which is a plus if you feel like supporting other developing economies.</li>
            <li> the styling shears not sharp</li>
            <li> In other words, when you bend the scizzors to cut the hair, it seems like you have to put a little more effort into it to clip together the shears.  </li>
            <li> I do not expect this to last very long, and at the price, it should last significantly longer, do yourself a favor and go to lowes and buy some clauss scissors instead for the same price.</li>
            <li> It did the job and maybe if I were a professional it would be different</li>
            <li> bought it to cut my bangs and so far i had only use it once</li>
            <li> Way too big and loud while using them.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t think it would be worth the trouble to return.</li>
            <li> This pair is good for cutting bulk as well as intricate trimming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just say nicely, it is made poorly!</li>
            <li> The fingerholes are appropriate, they are sharp enough and tight enough to snip hair even at a professional level.      </li>
            <li> They require tightening frequently, and they went dull fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> Now my original shears are too dull to use,</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t cut very well, don&#x27;t even seem sharp, so I would recommend against buying them.</li>
            <li> These shears are terribly dull and do not open and close smoothly which actually hurt my hand when I was trying to cut my nephew&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if this is normal or defective on this particular model.  </li>
            <li> My other old pair is easy on movement, but this one seems a little too tight in movement.  </li>
            <li> Smooth cutting, crazy sharp, and comfortable to hold, I love them</li>
            <li> /&gt;---------------&lt;br /&gt;After writing the above, I&#x27;ve read nearly all the other reviews of these scissors.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace my old ones which were dulling, but these aren&#x27;t sharp at all.</li>
            <li> They are not sharp at all, and the hinge action is way too stiff.</li>
            <li> The action -- the actual feel of cutting -- just isn&#x27;t that smooth.</li>
            <li> My only really complaint is that they are pretty long</li>
            <li> I can see them lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> I hope these last a long time!  </li>
            <li> does not have a smooth cutting action</li>
            <li> even the few bucks I spent on these was too much.</li>
            <li> Next time I will get something smaller, I have used them for a few months and they are still sharp so it will be a while before I buy new ones.</li>
            <li> However, recently I lost my standard scissors and used these for paper and other stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned really high quality barber shears in the past, and this isn&#x27;t what they feel like.</li>
            <li> I am not a professional</li>
            <li> the shearing action is uneven through its range.  </li>
            <li> A little hard to use, but it worth that price</li>
            <li> so far, just hoping they last a while its hard to find long scissors atm</li>
            <li> I have been a dog groomer for 40 years, and bought this pair to supplement several other 44/20 shears I use.</li>
            <li> I want shears that were sharp enough so as not to damage my hair when the purpose is to cut off the damage.  </li>
            <li> They have lasted me a year and a half so far and still sharp.</li>
            <li> I bought them for my husband&#x27;s hair, but they were only sharp for less than an inch of the entire blade.  </li>
            <li> sharp, easy to use  for keeping my beard trime with out the ever present danger of me cutting myself, which is how it ususally happens</li>
            <li> They are sharp now, I don&#x27;t know how long they will be, it will take time to find out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was a bad experience for me, usually, I am pleased with my purchases.</li>
            <li> these were a huge disappointment, considering the reviews.  </li>
            <li> Only the last 1\\&quot; of these sheers were capable of cutting hair.  </li>
            <li> I expect it to last a long time, as have the ones I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Received item that I expected to get based on description.</li>
            <li> Besides, if your hand is big, this does not fit your fingers</li>
            <li> Mine were so stiff it took some effort to open &amp; close them.  </li>
            <li> There is also a very slight looseness in the pivot itself, as if it had been dropped several times.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the shears are sharp but the tip is bent on one blade so the shears &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; into place when closed.</li>
            <li> It has stayed sharp and has not needed to be sharpened.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp, too.</li>
            <li> Still these are plenty sharp and I would recommend these to a friend.</li>
            <li> Sharp, but could see the need to sharpen them after using them for a while.</li>
            <li> sharp and sleek</li>
            <li> Solely a restricted portion of their edges was sharp.</li>
            <li> wasnâ€™t sharp.</li>
            <li> so I was a little worried about the quality, but after a few uses they&#x27;re still working properly.  </li>
            <li> Seems difficult to open and close and the blades seem to far away from eachother.</li>
            <li> I became so sick of these shears not cutting, I went back to the to shears</li>
            <li> A little hard to get used to the long blade and handle style when you&#x27;re not a professional</li>
            <li> I hardly go to the regular store anymore.</li>
            <li> When I used this product it barely could even cut my hair, it snagged and left uncut hairs.</li>
            <li> Not worth return hassel</li>
            <li> blades were sharp and the screw was tight.</li>
            <li> I found it odd that the package said something to the effect of \\&quot;United Kingdom\\&quot; or \\&quot;England\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Slightly rusty after 12 months in the bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sorely displeased, and felt compelled to write this review, which I&#x27;ve seldom done previously.  </li>
            <li> My previous review gave this  product 4 stars, but I&#x27;m downgrading that to 1.</li>
            <li> The first test of scissors is cutting.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and these make trimming a breeze.</li>
            <li> Have used these to trim my little girls hair.  </li>
            <li> The hair resists a little, but surrenders.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little weary about the price</li>
            <li> but they came a little chipped on the blade.</li>
            <li> Maybe a little oil will solve this.</li>
            <li> They are a little on the heavy side.</li>
            <li> I used these for my son, daughter and husband and found them to be heavy and irritated my thumb a little.  </li>
            <li> These are heavy and really hurt my fingers while cutting.</li>
            <li> It cuts the hair without missing a hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;m being too harsh.</li>
            <li> Like they were broken and glued back together.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your $...</li>
            <li> i feel like i wasted my money, now they just sit in my case</li>
            <li> These scissors are not smooth cutting.there is a catch in the tip end.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on it.  </li>
            <li> I do not want to waste my time in pursuing a refund but want others to be beware of what they might receive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I may have received a pair of scissors that were less than the usual quality.  </li>
            <li> I was previously using to trim my husbands hair!  </li>
            <li> Not only did these not cut but they were very poorly finished, the handle looked like it was hand ground by a kid learning to use a grinding wheel; very rough and unevenly angled.  </li>
            <li> The blades had a small gap, and the adjustment screw was as tight as it would go.  </li>
            <li> finger holes too small for an adult, unable to use.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to angle and move back and forth.</li>
            <li> No, I&#x27;m not a hair cutting professional</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t waste your time buying this scissors!</li>
            <li> This is from the tip to just past midway.  </li>
            <li> It is small amount</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very sharp and will cut through thick hair too!  </li>
            <li> I was hopeful but not a very good shears</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical on purchasing this shears due to the price.  </li>
            <li> These scissors had a screw keeping the two blades together but no amount of tightening of the screw would increase the tension which makes them almost useless since my wife has to apply the tension with her hands instead, leaving them cramped by the end of a long cut.</li>
            <li> blades were loose and unable to be tightened.</li>
            <li> They arrived bent and were really dull.</li>
            <li> butthe scissors are hard to grip.</li>
            <li> Dull as a butter knife, won&#x27;t improve even with a diamond sharpening stone.</li>
            <li> Stars for Amazon: They accepted the return on these without any hangup or complaint.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I was a sucker, but the reviews looked favorable.</li>
            <li> If I was a professional, and needed these for my clients, I would have been really angry and requested a refund, but like I said, I needed them for times while I&#x27;m bored at work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is extremely disappointing to receive such garbage.</li>
            <li> I bought these so I can sit at work and snip my split ends off during slow time.</li>
            <li> And they are not very great use.</li>
            <li> Quality is so bad , it grinds doesn&#x27;t sheer</li>
            <li> No good.</li>
            <li> terrible too long to handle,  i like having long objects but not a scissor&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m going back to my house scissors :(</li>
            <li> I only got to use these scissors months after I received them, and they were so disappointing!</li>
            <li> The finger/thumb size is way too small, they feel awkward and are not a precision pair of shears.</li>
            <li> The closer it gets to the pivot point, the worst the shearing action, to the point that it becomes difficult to cut.  </li>
            <li> In short, it is impossible to use for cutting my beard!</li>
            <li> Hands down the worst shears that I&#x27;ve ever used in my life they are not sharp at all and instead of cutting hair they just fold the hair i never wrote reviews but after using this i was so disappointed that i just had to.</li>
            <li> I am updating my score after receiving the Tweezerman 2000 scissors, I realize that these LUXOR&#x27;s were possibly the worst pair of scissors I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Was not impressed with the smoothness or comfort for the user.  </li>
            <li> These shears were unable to make an incision along the majority of their cutting edges.</li>
            <li> They grab and pull hairs like tweezers, or push hair along between the blades without cutting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had issues cutting my hair with these scissors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting hair for 40 years.  </li>
            <li> gave to my child for cutting paper.&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li> pushed the hair instead of cutting.</li>
            <li> The stick when closing and look like they have been dug up out of some dirty garage, sprayed off, then sent to me.</li>
            <li> , it sounds like you are cutting the scissors themselves.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this pair!</li>
            <li> I must have just got a bad pair.  </li>
            <li> they are so bad.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with these shears.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with these scissors.</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I was a bit disappointed because I saw that it started to rust.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed!</li>
            <li> you will be disappointed!</li>
            <li> These scissors were terrible.</li>
            <li> Horrible quality something that you would find in the dollar store.</li>
            <li> They are terrible.  </li>
            <li> I had a terrible time trying to cut my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of scissors over that time and these are the worst.  </li>
            <li> These are the worst scissors I have ever attempted to used.</li>
            <li> They are terrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> They arrived bent and were really dull.</li>
            <li> The shears are clearly a cheap attempt at good shears. The finger/thumb size is way too small, they feel awkward and are not a precision pair of shears. They work, but not well.</li>
            <li> Got this Item as a gift for a lady which got it for a gift. She hat a shop and cut hair for a liveing</li>
            <li> Wonderful! I use this product for all of my Do It Yourself beauty and hair care needs and it works like a charm! So far no issues!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional, I just cut my own hair and normally use house scissors but thought I should get professional ones as to not create split ends. These are heavy and really hurt my fingers while cutting. It was difficult to angle and move back and forth. It did the job and maybe if I were a professional it would be different but I&#x27;m going back to my house scissors :(</li>
            <li> These are awesome shears really sharp, best ones I have purchased. And the price was great. Would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> No good. Cheap product.  You get what you pay for. Better of investing on something good. Do not waist time and money on this cheap product. Do not buy!</li>
            <li> I found it odd that the package said something to the effect of \\&quot;United Kingdom\\&quot; or \\&quot;England\\&quot;  I was excited because I figured that they were made there then I looked at the actual scissors and they said pakistan. I called and inquired if I had received the correct product and was told yes.  I waited until I needed another hair cut and then tried these out about a month later.  They were absolute rubbish.  They would not cut hair with out holding the hair taut and even then it was laborious to actually get them to cut through the hair.  If the hair was not pulled taut the hair would just hold between the two blades.  I would suggest just getting so high quality general household scissors.  Not only did these not cut but they were very poorly finished, the handle looked like it was hand ground by a kid learning to use a grinding wheel; very rough and unevenly angled.  Save yourself the time and headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five Stars for Amazon: They accepted the return on these without any hangup or complaint.  I am so satisfied with Amazon I hardly go to the regular store anymore.</li>
            <li> My wife cuts my hair and does it very well. Some of the scissors we had did not  cut easily.  I looked at reviews and bought three scissors. They were all better than what we had been using, but the Luxor professional 7 1/2 inch Ice Tempered  Barber Styling Shear (Model: M505) was the best. It has stayed sharp and has not needed to be sharpened. It cuts the hair without missing a hair. Reduces hair cut  from 8 minutes to less than 2 minutes; hair cut is just as good in shorter time.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This item arrived quickly and in good shape. These are excellent scissors for cutting hair, even in  tight places. Very shape, and in a protective case. I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> Received item that I expected to get based on description. Have not had a chance to use scissors yet but am happy so far with purchase.</li>
            <li> Really excellent scissors. pgs</li>
            <li> I bought the scissors to trim my mustache, for use at a second home.&lt;br /&gt;A pair of barber scissors I bought more than 40 years ago still work much better than these, even though they have never been sharpened.&lt;br /&gt;These scissors were cheap, which is why I bought them, figuring I had little to lose. They don&#x27;t cut very well, don&#x27;t even seem sharp, so I would recommend against buying them. Since they were cheap, I don&#x27;t feel badly cheated, because I shouldn&#x27;t have expected good quality scissors.&lt;br /&gt;---------------&lt;br /&gt;After writing the above, I&#x27;ve read nearly all the other reviews of these scissors. Since they vary so widely/wildly, I think it quite likely, as one reviewer hinted, that the manufacturer turns out many scissors of this model, with little to no concern for quality control. I suspect that if those of us who rate the scissors poorly were to use the highly rated scissors, we&#x27;d also like them, and I&#x27;m equally sure that the scissors we received would not suddenly perform beautifully in the hands of the five-star folk.</li>
            <li> They are great scissors for trimming your hair in between haircuts. They\\&quot;re sturdy and I can easily fit my big fingers inside the loops.</li>
            <li> I may have received a pair of scissors that were less than the usual quality.  Mine were so stiff it took some effort to open &amp; close them.  I have had barber-quality shears before- these were a huge disappointment, considering the reviews.  I would most definitely not order this product again.</li>
            <li> Have used these to trim my little girls hair.  Nice and sharp, comfortable to grip and a good weight for good control. Would recommend for the do-it-yourselfer.</li>
            <li> Only the last 1\\&quot; of these sheers were capable of cutting hair.  The blades had a small gap, and the adjustment screw was as tight as it would go.  I must have just got a bad pair.  I returned them and will probably go with a different brand.  2/4/12 - I am updating my score after receiving the Tweezerman 2000 scissors, I realize that these LUXOR&#x27;s were possibly the worst pair of scissors I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;d give zero stars if possible.</li>
            <li> The finish on these shears looked promising, they fit fairly well in my hand, but they don&#x27;t cut hair! They grab and pull hairs like tweezers, or push hair along between the blades without cutting. I can get better results from round-end children&#x27;s scissors. Professional at this price??? Yes, I was a sucker, but the reviews looked favorable. I am so disappointed!</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace my old ones which were dulling, but these aren&#x27;t sharp at all. I don&#x27;t want to have to pay to sharpen new scissors!</li>
            <li> Slightly rusty after 12 months in the bathroom cabinet. I don&#x27;t use it much otherwise I&#x27;d buy another.</li>
            <li> Great product! My Mom cuts hair with these all the time and they work better than any other pair we&#x27;ve had that I can remember. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I used these two times so far. They are sharp now, I don&#x27;t know how long they will be, it will take time to find out.</li>
            <li> Really good,I tried this for my first haircut and it was a breeze. Will use it again and again for my daughters haircuts</li>
            <li> Got two pairs one for the office and one for the kitchen. They work very well - wouldn&#x27;t be without them.</li>
            <li> These are very good hair cutting scissors.  I cut my own hair and these have held up for several years.  However, recently I lost my standard scissors and used these for paper and other stuff and they&#x27;ve dulled out.  I can still cut my hair with them but I wish I knew a good way to sharpen them.</li>
            <li> This scissors works just as intended.  I had made the mistake of buying one with ridiculously tiny fingerholes and returned it.  This one is ok in all respects.  The fingerholes are appropriate, they are sharp enough and tight enough to snip hair even at a professional level.      Given the value, I recommend these scissors without hesitation.</li>
            <li> These replaced the shears that came with a Wahl electric trimmer set that I use to cut my husband&#x27;s hair. They have a good heft in the hand and and the blades are nice and long, which I prefer. They&#x27;re sharp, too. But I really can&#x27;t call them any better than \\&quot;meh.\\&quot; The action -- the actual feel of cutting -- just isn&#x27;t that smooth. I&#x27;ve owned really high quality barber shears in the past, and this isn&#x27;t what they feel like. The blades don&#x27;t meet perfectly enough. They don&#x27;t make that satisfying whispered metallic \\&quot;swish\\&quot; sound that perfectly honed blades make when they pass each other precisely. And, while they cut hair okay, they cut it just okay. The hair resists a little, but surrenders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;m being too harsh. Browse Amazon or the web, and you&#x27;ll see that really high quality barber shears go for hundreds of dollars. Pay 16 bucks, and you&#x27;ll get 16 bucks worth of scissors. Which these are.</li>
            <li> Nice shears, only problem for me is my thumbs are a little snug in them and tend to get sore after making multiple cuts, I wear an XL in gloves, but never thought I had large hands by any means... Bought for a mustache trimmer so they get the job done!</li>
            <li> I bought these because I figured they&#x27;d be great cutters labled as professional but from the box they were duller than ones I&#x27;ve bought much cheaper locally.</li>
            <li> I bought these scissors to cut my bangs with. They&#x27;re nice and sharp and easy to cut with. They&#x27;re also small, so they&#x27;re easy to travel with. I&#x27;ve never had issues cutting my hair with these scissors. They have lasted me a year and a half so far and still sharp.</li>
            <li> Shears had tiny chips. But what can you ask for with the price.  I would pay more next time lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I bought these just to do some household hair trimming and they work fantastic.  The price was great so I was a little worried about the quality, but after a few uses they&#x27;re still working properly.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d use these for a professional application, but for my purposes they are just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Great product....the loops on the handle are big enough for fingers (unlike some shears)...it came in a nice plastic case and it cuts great.  Great product for the price</li>
            <li> Easier to layer my hair and trim my ends. Perfect for when I don&#x27;t want to deal with the salon</li>
            <li> I used these for the first time today to give a haircut. The hair was soft and fine. These scissors were terrible. They are not sharp at all, and the hinge action is way too stiff. My hands were aching after 10 min of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems the reviews for this product swing to both extremes: either they&#x27;re awesome, or they&#x27;re terrible. Perhaps you will get a great pair, but with variability this large, I&#x27;d look elsewhere for a more consistent product.</li>
            <li> the price is good for the product.  they are light and feel a little fragile.  i actually received the 5 1/2 inch shears. i didn&#x27;t think it would be worth the trouble to return.</li>
            <li> From the midpoint of the blade to the tip, it did NOT cut the hairs, The MAIN purpose of BARBER Styling Shears is to cut at the tips for ear and nose areas. Into my junk drawer they went !!</li>
            <li> These are great trimming scissors! Sharp and smooth at cutting hair and the finger rest on the handle is a nice addition!</li>
            <li> Great product and seller.</li>
            <li> The product came as described, It works well. The shears are not made in China which is a plus if you feel like supporting other developing economies.They seem very sturdy and can be disassembled for cleaning. I like them!</li>
            <li> I cut my husbands hair regularly as well as my daughter&#x27;s bangs and my mothers hair. These are good quality cutters that are very precise and leave a clean cut.</li>
            <li> These are very good quality, low cost, shears. Perfect for the amateur hair stylist. I purchased these to cut my own hair and they work great. My only really complaint is that they are pretty long and I wish that I ordered a smaller size. If I were to order again I would order a smaller pair to have more control. Still these are plenty sharp and I would recommend these to a friend.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this pair! Comfortable, multi-purpose, and sharp. I use this pair as my main cutters.This pair is good for cutting bulk as well as intricate trimming.</li>
            <li> the shears are sharp but the tip is bent on one blade so the shears &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; into place when closed. still cuts but damaged.</li>
            <li> Excellent for our purposes.</li>
            <li> I bought these so I can sit at work and snip my split ends off during slow time. No, I&#x27;m not a hair cutting professional so these were fine for what I needed. Although when they arrived at my home, there is a crack in the shears. Like they were broken and glued back together. If I was a professional, and needed these for my clients, I would have been really angry and requested a refund, but like I said, I needed them for times while I&#x27;m bored at work. So they will be fine. But may I suggest that you take a look at the product for defects before you send them to your purchaser ?</li>
            <li> I was a little weary about the price but they are good shears. Not the sharpest but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Not that I was expecting much, but these are very cheap scissors. Not to accurate or precise, but short money.</li>
            <li> Excellent scissors. Nicely weighted.Makes nice, sharp cuts. Much nicer than the haircutting scissors it replaced.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with these shears. Purchased for close trimming of hair around the ears. Shears do not cut at the ends of the blades.</li>
            <li> It needed a touch up honing to get it to cut without pulling, otherwise a good deal.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with these scissors. I would have returned them.  I bought them for my husband&#x27;s hair, but they were only sharp for less than an inch of the entire blade.  I think the shears weren&#x27;t hitting properly or something.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I use them for paper now, and went to a beauty supply store and paid $20 for the pair I&#x27;m using now.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair cutting scissors.  butthe scissors are hard to grip. the point also can poke whe you try to.cut.closely cropped hair</li>
            <li> Sturdy scissors however they don&#x27;t cut well if not held a certain way. If they are held the right way they cut well.</li>
            <li> This is a great choice for reasonable shears. Cuts hair well and seems to have a solid build. I can see them lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable fit and very sharp tip - allowing for precise cutting/trimming.  Excellent price as well.  I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Excellent very sharp and sturdy just what I was looking for I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for more than 10 times and it&#x27;s still sharp so far. Note that the shears have pointed heads. Besides, if your hand is big, this does not fit your fingers</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t waste your time buying this scissors! They showed up dull, plus when I had a professional check out this item, he mentioned so many inconsistencies in it that he hoped that I didn&#x27;t pay too much for it. Just don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Smooth cutting, crazy sharp, and comfortable to hold, I love them</li>
            <li> These work well. Sharp, but could see the need to sharpen them after using them for a while. I like the shape.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Horrible quality something that you would find in the dollar store. Not at all what I was expecting!!!!</li>
            <li> Works very well on my hair and my fiance uses it to keep his beard trimmed would purchase again if I have to.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Not sharp well to cut pets hair!</li>
            <li> bought it to cut my bangs and so far i had only use it once and it was working perfectly. sharp and sleek</li>
            <li> Does the job. The name on the scissor is NICE, if that matters.</li>
            <li> thought the product looked good and was excite to use it. First attempt the hair foldered between the blades and did not cut. blades were sharp and the screw was tight. too much flex in the blade itself.</li>
            <li> My wife got these to cut our daughter&#x27;s hair.  She says they work great.  They cut easily.  They&#x27;re easy to hold.  She was using non-hair scissors before and these were a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t like what I called this product. I&#x27;ll just say nicely, it is made poorly!</li>
            <li> Quality is so bad , it grinds doesn&#x27;t sheer</li>
            <li> The Luxor 7 1/2 inch Barber Shears are great and a great price I ordered two pairs and love them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting hair for 40 years.  Unprofessionally, family, my own, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old pair of Shears were just that. . . old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picked these up for about what it costs to sharpen the old ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very please with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They fit well in you fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend highly</li>
            <li> Sharp and easy to use</li>
            <li> Sharp, great scissors. I use these once a month to trim my daughter&#x27;s bangs since they grow insanely fast compared to the rest of her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work well, snip the first time every time. A little hard to get used to the long blade and handle style when you&#x27;re not a professional but I got over it pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I purchased these scissors for trimming hair and they are very sharp and easy to use. They are also comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li> finger holes too small for an adult, unable to use. gave to my child for cutting paper.&lt;br /&gt;will specify larger holes next time.</li>
            <li> These shears are awesome.  I needed some shears to keep my ends clipped.  I am not a professional so i didnt need anything spectacular.  When i received them i was very satisfied because they cut very nicely and the gold handles are nicely done also.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK for the price, not as smooth operating as the pricey store shears.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace another.  Similar styling but the shearing action is uneven through its range.  Instead there is a sweet spot that accounts for 60 percent.  This is from the tip to just past midway.  The closer it gets to the pivot point, the worst the shearing action, to the point that it becomes difficult to cut.  There is also a very slight looseness in the pivot itself, as if it had been dropped several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I guess it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Excellent pair of scizzors!!! Great price and fast shipping too!!! Will shop here again!!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical on purchasing this shears due to the price.  However, these are some well made, sturdy shears. You wont be disappointed. They work better than a pair of shears I purchased for about 3x the price.</li>
            <li> Do not buy these scissors, they are junk. The first test of scissors is cutting. These scissors do not cut they bend, pull, mangle, and hurt. Buy a better product.</li>
            <li> These scissors do what they are supposed to do. They are a little on the heavy side. I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> does not have a smooth cutting action</li>
            <li> These shears were unable to make an incision along the majority of their cutting edges. Solely a restricted portion of their edges was sharp.</li>
            <li> not sharp and it pulls hair so cheap is not always the way to go.  I was hopeful but not a very good shears</li>
            <li> sharp, easy to use  for keeping my beard trime with out the ever present danger of me cutting myself, which is how it ususally happens</li>
            <li> I would never purchase these again, I have thrown them away.  Thank you&lt;br /&gt;This was a bad experience for me, usually, I am pleased with my purchases.</li>
            <li> This is not for pro!!! Good for elementary arts and crafts. Dont waste your $...you will be disappointed! You want to throw this</li>
            <li> I have had this product before, and the new one has been just as good as previous ones.  Sharp and easy to use.  I expect it to last a long time, as have the ones I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Good clean scissors, work well , seem well made. Im happy so far, just hoping they last a while its hard to find long scissors atm</li>
            <li> It works very well and also it cuts well without any distraction. I love using this to cut friend&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> These Sissors don&#x27;t cut hair.  Tips do not cut because they do not meet.  Want to return but can&#x27;t print return label...printer not working.</li>
            <li> Y BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY WIFE AND SHE LOVE IT. SHE FEELS VERY HAPPY WHIT THIS SISSER THEY ARE VEEEERY PROFESSIONAL. I RECOMEND THIS ITEM IT CAME TO MY HOUSE ON TIME.</li>
            <li> Good scissors but they came a little chipped on the blade. You should expect a possible defective product. They do their job of cuttting well.</li>
            <li> Be careful, these things are huge! I just assumed that bigger more powerful shears were a better thing (grunt), until my clumsy fiancee got close to my eye with theses giant things. Next time I will get something smaller, I have used them for a few months and they are still sharp so it will be a while before I buy new ones.</li>
            <li> These shears are terribly dull and do not open and close smoothly which actually hurt my hand when I was trying to cut my nephew&#x27;s hair. I&#x27;ve used better scissors in middle school art class. I eventually resorted to using my cheap kitchen shears which were much sharper and smoother than these \\&quot;professional\\&quot; shears. I will not be buying from this company again.</li>
            <li> These scissors cut great!! They&#x27;re very sharp and will cut through thick hair too!  We would definitely recommend them as great hair cutting scissors.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have read the most recent reviews on these shears.  They are terrible.  The tip is bent causing them to grind when you open and close them.  I had a terrible time trying to cut my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> It works pretty ok but I was a bit disappointed because I saw that it started to rust.</li>
            <li> I have been a dog groomer for 40 years, and bought this pair to supplement several other 44/20 shears I use. There is no comparison. They simply would not cut hair on the feet of a freshly washed English Springer Spaniel&#x27;s that was not even dense coat. Thus, I can&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> Perfect! These scissors were exactly what I was looking for. Nice comfortable handle and sharp enough to touch up bangs and layers very quickly. The right scissors DO make all the difference. Very happy with these.</li>
            <li> Fine scissorsâ€‹, could be sharper, but good overall</li>
            <li> Easy, sharp and pointy.  I can run with these without any problems at all.  Would highly recommend to anyone who loves to run with a nice sharp pair.</li>
            <li> These scissors are no good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received them yesterday and promptly went in to do some trimming.  Ive had facial hair most of my life, and at age 63 I now have a Van Dyke style of beard that needs constant trimming.  I also cut my own hair, and have since I was 18.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of scissors over that time and these are the worst.  They don&#x27;t cut along the length of the blade, nor to they cut at the tip.  When I try to cut an individual hair, the scissors don&#x27;t cut, they put at it.  If I try to trim a larger area with the full length of the blade, it doesn&#x27;t work either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sorely displeased, and felt compelled to write this review, which I&#x27;ve seldom done previously.  Don&#x27;t buy these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bruce.</li>
            <li> My previous review gave this  product 4 stars, but I&#x27;m downgrading that to 1. I became so sick of these shears not cutting, I went back to the to shears they were supposed to replace, which I&#x27;ve been using ever since. Now my original shears are too dull to use, *but they&#x27;re still sharper than the Luxor shears*. DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> Finally, I have found styling shears that are what they say they are.  Good sturdy scissors, sharp, cuts clean.  Best I&#x27;ve had for household hair trims.  Pretty good value also.  I didn&#x27;t have to spend an arm and a leg.  Very happy with these so far.</li>
            <li> I guess they are all right ... seem so cut well, but the shears I received state that they are 6 /1/2 inch and not 7 12.  If you would like&lt;br /&gt;to replace them with the right pair, please send return label.</li>
            <li> These shears are just what the barber ordered. Now I can cut one hair or a dozen to make a tonsorial extravaganza.&lt;br /&gt;Stan</li>
            <li> wasnâ€™t sharp. pushed the hair instead of cutting. blades were loose and unable to be tightened. i feel like i wasted my money, now they just sit in my case</li>
            <li> These seemed like pretty good scissors that were sharp and well-made, and reviewed well so we bought them. My wife uses them to cut the hair of my son and I. One of the most important features scissors such as these should have is the ability to adjust the tension. These scissors had a screw keeping the two blades together but no amount of tightening of the screw would increase the tension which makes them almost useless since my wife has to apply the tension with her hands instead, leaving them cramped by the end of a long cut.</li>
            <li> These scissors are not smooth cutting.there is a catch in the tip end.In short, it is impossible to use for cutting my beard!</li>
            <li> Was not impressed with the smoothness or comfort for the user.  Seems difficult to open and close and the blades seem to far away from eachother. Have purchased a different pair now.</li>
            <li> These scissors are very sharp and cut great. I have long thick hair and these make trimming a breeze. Just like the profesionals use.</li>
            <li> On time as described.</li>
            <li> the styling shears not sharp</li>
            <li> I think zero stars should also be a rating because 1 star is too much. I have been a licensed stylist for many years. I have bought many low priced shears over those years to keep at home or to use when my higher quality shears needed to be sharpened. These are the worst scissors I have ever attempted to used. The blades are warped and bent and do not cut throughout the length of the blade. The stick when closing and look like they have been dug up out of some dirty garage, sprayed off, then sent to me. It&#x27;s is extremely disappointing to receive such garbage. I understand you get what you pay for but even the few bucks I spent on these was too much.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the product at all, I thought even though it was cheap the reviews seemed decent. When I used this product it barely could even cut my hair, it snagged and left uncut hairs.</li>
            <li> I only got to use these scissors months after I received them, and they were so disappointing! They look so good in this ad, and even when I received them. But they simply do not work! They do not cut hair properly. My sewing scissors cut hair much better than these.</li>
            <li> OK FOR PRICE.  WHICH IS VERY LOW COMPARED TO DEPT STORES. REMEMBER TO ONLY CUT HAIR WITH THEM. HOME HAIRCUTTING USE WILL BE OK.</li>
            <li> I used these for my son, daughter and husband and found them to be heavy and irritated my thumb a little.  I purchased these specifically for occassional home use, and I&#x27;m fine with them for what I paid.  If these were to be used more regularly, I would suggest something lighter with a coated handle.</li>
            <li> The shears cut reasonably well near the tip.  They do not cut well away from the tip, as the blades aren&#x27;t closely aligned.</li>
            <li> Way too big and loud while using them. They do not glide at all. And they are not very great use.</li>
            <li> Hands down the worst shears that I&#x27;ve ever used in my life they are not sharp at all and instead of cutting hair they just fold the hair i never wrote reviews but after using this i was so disappointed that i just had to.</li>
            <li> I bought these shears to cut my dog&#x27;s hair.  They require tightening frequently, and they went dull fairly quickly.  Now, I understand that this may be because I&#x27;m using them to cut dog hair, but I only used them for a couple of months (so three trims) before the dull/tightening was necessary.  This is why I&#x27;m rating it with three stars, as Amazon suggests that means &amp;#34;its okay&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did like was the length, and the grips are perfect for my fingers (female, size large gloves).</li>
            <li> Great product as promised. Fantastic price and they  replaced a pair the TSA confiscated. love the finger grip, it helps.</li>
            <li> Great.  They cut hair, I think.  I never received them.</li>
            <li> I purchased these so that I could trim off my split ends between trimmings.  I want shears that were sharp enough so as not to damage my hair when the purpose is to cut off the damage.  I have been happy with these thus far.  They fit my hand comfortably and are well sharpened.  I would not hesitate to purchase again but figure these will last me a while considering they are not used often.</li>
            <li> These are great for the price. Mine were very sharp (tested it on wet tissue paper)They give a clean cut, not as light as some I have bought before, but they definitely do an excellent job for the price!</li>
            <li> Sharper blades for a more professional look.  I hope these last a long time!  They certainly beat using the children&#x27;s scissors I was previously using to trim my husbands hair!  He is a real good sport!</li>
            <li> Dull as a butter knife, won&#x27;t improve even with a diamond sharpening stone. Pay a few bucks for a better scissors.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and it came with a case too!</li>
            <li> They work great for the amateur barber that I am. Great price and cut well. Now if only the finger holes were bigger, to accommodate my giant sausage fingers....</li>
            <li> A little hard to use, but it worth that price I think.</li>
            <li> These are inexpensive and work ok, but they are stiff with an inability to adjust them.  I would not recommend them for every day use.</li>
            <li> terrible too long to handle,  i like having long objects but not a scissor&lt;br /&gt;hard to use</li>
            <li> Most useless shears. Does not even catch hair let alone cut.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on it.  I asked for a refund. The seller never responded. It is small amount so it does not matter.  I do not want to waste my time in pursuing a refund but want others to be beware of what they might receive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horrible quality.</li>
            <li> If you are any kind of person who knows how to cut hair, do not purchase these. They are terrible.  I won&#x27;t be able to use them even on my dogs they are so bad. They do not grab hair and stick when closing. I would have sent them back but it was going to cost almost as much as I paid for them. To get good scissors, you have to spend money.  I suggest spending more and hopefully you will get more! Do not waste one penny on these.</li>
            <li> All went good with the transaction but when the item arrived I realized that he blade wasn&#x27;t sharp enough to make a smooth cut, so, I&#x27;ve never used it again.</li>
            <li> Maybe it just me, but I notice that the scizzors doesn&#x27;t seem to be easy on the fingers.  In other words, when you bend the scizzors to cut the hair, it seems like you have to put a little more effort into it to clip together the shears.  Its as if it wasn&#x27;t oiled enough or something.  My other old pair is easy on movement, but this one seems a little too tight in movement.  Not a big deal but I did notice this and I&#x27;m not sure if this is normal or defective on this particular model.  Its okay but perhaps a little more money on another pair of scizzors would be better on the fingers to make it cut easier without any more effort to cut using your fingers.  Thats my only problem with it.  Maybe a little oil will solve this.</li>
            <li> I purchased these shears because I needed to have a pair at the office for quick little cuts when I need them.</li>
            <li> absolutely perfect for cutting hair.&lt;br /&gt;sharp easy to hold ample thumb room and great for large fingers.&lt;br /&gt;super quality as much higher priced. bargain!&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended!</li>
            <li> These are excellent scissors for cutting hair. I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I cut my hair and my husbands and needed to replace my old scissors.  This pair is made well and cuts great.</li>
            <li> Good for paper but not for hair.  Low quality.</li>
            <li> Each Cut you make you will hear from a mile away, it sounds like you are cutting the scissors themselves. I do not expect this to last very long, and at the price, it should last significantly longer, do yourself a favor and go to lowes and buy some clauss scissors instead for the same price.</li>
            <li> Disapointed. IF I could have held it in my hand I would not have purchased it. Have to keep tightening the blade screw. Not worth return hassel</li>
            <li> hope they last, really cut my hair well. Tried others, these really work. If they last I&#x27;ll be very pleased</li>
            <li> Very nice scissors.  Well made, cut like professional scissors.</li>
            <li> Nice sharp shears for the NON-professional. I would not tell anyone that cuts hair for a living to buy these, but if you are using these at home I would. These will work for your own hair or your kids hair. They do not cost much but they are decent for what they are. They were shipped quickly and arrived packaged well. If you need a pair for the house go ahead and get these.</li>
            <li> I have used these shears along with an electric clipper and razor comb.  My wife trims the back of my head.  Hair looks great and I have no need for my barber now.</li>
