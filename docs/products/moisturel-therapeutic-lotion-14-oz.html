            <li>Good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>so I was delighted to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just that good.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing better for revitalizing skin!</li>
            <li>and I felt that warm almost burning sensation again.</li>
            <li>Men, too,  need some kind of skin protectant.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best lotion my family has ever used.  </li>
            <li>and this is the best product by far.</li>
            <li>Have found that Moisturel is the most effective moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried,.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best moisturizing cream I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Refissa is an alternative, but my insurance plan doesn&#x27;t cover it and it costs more than a hundred dollars a tube.       </li>
            <li>/&gt;Pretty sure I&#x27;m having an allergic reaction to one of the ingredients in this lotion, I thought to myself.</li>
            <li>More than twenty years ago a friend gave me a half-empty bottle of Moisturel.</li>
            <li>Seems satisfied</li>
            <li>yet it keeps your skin looking dewy and healthy.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love Moisturel.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s probably why the pain was alleviated</li>
            <li>My skin is aging a lot better than many of my peers, and Moisturel has undoubtedly played a role in that.</li>
            <li>I would gladly pay five times the price for this stuff.</li>
            <li>Moisturel Lotion was recommend to me by a dermatologist many years ago.  </li>
            <li>I wish more stores would carry it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find it in drug stores any more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fragrance free too!</li>
            <li>I have used Moisturel lotion for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>Yes, I love moisturel lotion and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else.  </li>
            <li>and I have been using it ever since and introduced many friends to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Moisturel for years (my family has always used it) and I haven&#x27;t found a better moisturizer yet.  </li>
            <li>After using it for awhile it is ok if you miss a day because your skin stays hydrated.</li>
            <li>As always this lotion is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>and I love both.  </li>
            <li>Like so many reviews I&#x27;ve read my dermatologist recommended it.  </li>
            <li>He said Mosturel was better than the &amp;#34;expensive stuff&amp;#34; and a lot, lot cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Same wonderful lotion, though.  </li>
            <li>it works well glad</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the quick delivery, too.  </li>
            <li>The container says that it is fragrance-free but I can detect a light, pleasant aroma that disappears quickly after application.  </li>
            <li>It particularly does a great job of getting rid of winter dryness.  </li>
            <li>I am a LONG time user of Moisturel and will forever claim how wonderful this lotion is.</li>
            <li>Since I have many skin allergies and sensitivities, finding a moisturizing lotion has not been easy.  </li>
            <li>If you have dry itching skin, from any condition, including liver disease, this can provide excellent temporary relief.</li>
            <li>And that it isn&#x27;t uncommon for people to be allergic to it, even though it&#x27;s being used in more and more products because it&#x27;s \\&quot;generally regarded as safe.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time</li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer for sensitive skin as it is hypo-allergenic.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff; it&#x27;s smooth and creamy, and stays on well.</li>
            <li>Delighted that I could find it on line and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, super effective, and does not have an intrusive smell.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to apply and does not stain my shirts when applied to my arms.</li>
            <li>Another morning, I used the Benzoyl Peroxide with my Skin79 BB Cream, and it was fine.</li>
            <li>it was $11 for 14 oz-a huge difference compared to the $50 an ounce department store moisturizer which doesn&#x27;t work as well, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Fantastic for Acne Prone Skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light</li>
            <li>No longer available in stores in my area.  </li>
            <li>well yet fragrance free</li>
            <li>It is non greasy and you can use it anywhere as a fabulous moisturizer.</li>
            <li>A good product for people with ultra sensitive eyes to lotions and creams.  </li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time today and ordered two more bottles.</li>
            <li>Light weight, non-greasy, quick to absorb lotion that does NOT cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>I hope that Moisturel continues to be available because I have never been able to find a lotion that I like this much.</li>
            <li>My husbands says I have the softest skin, when in reality I have very dry scaly skin without this great product.</li>
            <li>Hard to tell, but it seems like the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>That should be a good enough recommendation for just about everyone.</li>
            <li>The price hasn&#x27;t really gone up in all these years and the product is always consistently pure and effective.</li>
            <li>first night I used it, I put it on top of Benzoyl Peroxide, and I assumed the warm feeling on my face was simply the acne medication doing its thing, and didn&#x27;t look at my face again before going to bed.</li>
            <li>I learned that Dimethicone is a silicon oil that coats the face smoothly, interfering with the skin&#x27;s natural regulation processes, trapping moisture and bacteria in your pores, causing people with acne to break out even more than they were before they were using it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but there are better products out there such as Amlactin and CeraVe.</li>
            <li>I searched online for a cream that I can use during the day that would give my skin enough moisture, won&#x27;t make me super shiny and wouldn&#x27;t break me out!!!</li>
            <li>No smell, absorbed quickly, and has no allergic effects for anyone I know of.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good for sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, most people are unaware of my issues, but it didn&#x27;t come easy.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, it turned bright red within five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>well worth the money for me.  </li>
            <li>Still worth it.</li>
            <li>I have used this moisturizer for more than 25 years and believe it has been instrumental in keeping my face so young looking.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>I love it because I live in a hot climate</li>
            <li>It soaks in pretty quickly and does not leave you feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>Applying the cream to his forearms and hands stopped the burning right away and the redness disappeared.</li>
            <li>Yes, you read that right.</li>
            <li>He was right.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think much of it, what with all of the \\&quot;specially formulated not to irritate skin\\&quot; labels on this stuff, but I purchased it to use as part of The Regimen from acne.org.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No other product has been as effective on my sensitive skin than this one.  </li>
            <li>It can be hard to find in stores, so I was happy to purchase off of Amazon.</li>
            <li>It absorbs in keeping skin smooth and soft without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>It is fragrance free, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t have it&#x27;s own smell.</li>
            <li>The lotion is well absorbed and leaves my skin feeling soft and moist but not greasy.  </li>
            <li>It absolutely will NOT cause pimples.</li>
            <li>so I appreciated my dermatologist recommendation.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing without being greasy or oily.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s really nothing else to use after you try this non perfume, non sticky moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li>Delivered as advertised - received very rapidly.</li>
            <li>Thanks AMAZON.</li>
            <li>I just wish that it still came with the pump; it was much easier to use that way.</li>
            <li>This is a fine &amp;#34;hand lotion.&amp;#34;  But that is unfortunately the only alternative now that the company has apparently discontinued a heavier salve, which was excellent for people suffering from very try skin.</li>
            <li>I have allergies to most other lotions and crèmes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Moisturel for many years due to exzema.  </li>
            <li>I was born with eczema; I&#x27;ve struggled with breakouts for 30+ years; and I developed atopic dermatitis during my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin in the slightest, absorbs quickly, leaves very little residue, keeps my skin smooth for the whole day, and it&#x27;s unscented</li>
            <li>Fragrance free lotion for sensitive skin works well for me and is the only type my skin tolerates without having reactions.</li>
            <li>so next time I&#x27;ll be sure to select a different one of Amazon&#x27;s providers.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li>THIS WAS HIGHLY LY RECOMMENDED BY MY DERMATOLOGIST</li>
            <li>Daily use helps to keep my skin calm.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much the size if a bodylotion but using it for my face, this amount will last forever.</li>
            <li>The product is not easy to find, but I&#x27;m glad I found it here.</li>
            <li>- this is a great product for your skin, I use it all the time - tough to find in local stores -</li>
            <li>Item arrived brand new and on time.</li>
            <li>i where i live</li>
            <li>it has very  little fragrance and doesn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; feeling that most lotions  have.</li>
            <li>and everyone thinks he married a younger woman.</li>
            <li>For the first 18 years of my life, various dermatologists gave me every lotion known to mankind, including prescription ones costing small fortunes, and all of them caused more problems than they solved.</li>
            <li>An old friend visited me from California.</li>
            <li>My face is always soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>or no pain, I like my feet soft, though, so I still put Moisturel on them after my bath.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;ve been scratching or my skin is especially sensitive, there is an initial sting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Moisturel for nearly 40 years.</li>
            <li>I forced myself to cry every day for a couple months and for the most part, they stopped hurting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use a pretty low concentration (0.025) tretinoin cream (generic Retin A.)  </li>
            <li>They were less expensive and contained more of their product, but they both felt somewhat greasy, and  each contained a huge list of ingredients that made me wonder about their therapeutic value - while using a lot of filler substances.</li>
            <li>This is good in the winter cold weather and in the summer after being in the sun.  </li>
            <li>It is not greasy, lasts through the day, does not have added perfumes, and has made such a positive difference for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the only lotions  that really helps dry skin.</li>
            <li>Even this mild concentration causes me to wake up with peeling skin the morning after I use just a small amount of the prescription.</li>
            <li>After developing adult eczema and not finding any OTC remedies that helped, I remembered that my dermatologist recommended this a long time ago.</li>
            <li>I use this for my young son&#x27;s dry facial skin.  </li>
            <li>A third morning, I put on Benzoyl Peroxide with the lotion again, and was shocked to discover that my entire face had turned bright red almost immediately</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but there are better products out there such as Amlactin and CeraVe.</li>
            <li> I searched online for a cream that I can use during the day that would give my skin enough moisture, won&#x27;t make me super shiny and wouldn&#x27;t break me out!!!</li>
            <li> No smell, absorbed quickly, and has no allergic effects for anyone I know of.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good for sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, most people are unaware of my issues, but it didn&#x27;t come easy.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, it turned bright red within five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> well worth the money for me.  </li>
            <li> Still worth it.</li>
            <li> I have used this moisturizer for more than 25 years and believe it has been instrumental in keeping my face so young looking.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love it because I live in a hot climate</li>
            <li> It soaks in pretty quickly and does not leave you feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Applying the cream to his forearms and hands stopped the burning right away and the redness disappeared.</li>
            <li> Yes, you read that right.</li>
            <li> He was right.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think much of it, what with all of the \\&quot;specially formulated not to irritate skin\\&quot; labels on this stuff, but I purchased it to use as part of The Regimen from acne.org.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No other product has been as effective on my sensitive skin than this one.  </li>
            <li> It can be hard to find in stores, so I was happy to purchase off of Amazon.</li>
            <li> It absorbs in keeping skin smooth and soft without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> It is fragrance free, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t have it&#x27;s own smell.</li>
            <li> The lotion is well absorbed and leaves my skin feeling soft and moist but not greasy.  </li>
            <li> It absolutely will NOT cause pimples.</li>
            <li> so I appreciated my dermatologist recommendation.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing without being greasy or oily.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s really nothing else to use after you try this non perfume, non sticky moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li> Delivered as advertised - received very rapidly.</li>
            <li> Thanks AMAZON.</li>
            <li> I just wish that it still came with the pump; it was much easier to use that way.</li>
            <li> This is a fine &amp;#34;hand lotion.&amp;#34;  But that is unfortunately the only alternative now that the company has apparently discontinued a heavier salve, which was excellent for people suffering from very try skin.</li>
            <li> I have allergies to most other lotions and crèmes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Moisturel for many years due to exzema.  </li>
            <li> I was born with eczema; I&#x27;ve struggled with breakouts for 30+ years; and I developed atopic dermatitis during my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin in the slightest, absorbs quickly, leaves very little residue, keeps my skin smooth for the whole day, and it&#x27;s unscented</li>
            <li> Fragrance free lotion for sensitive skin works well for me and is the only type my skin tolerates without having reactions.</li>
            <li> so next time I&#x27;ll be sure to select a different one of Amazon&#x27;s providers.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS HIGHLY LY RECOMMENDED BY MY DERMATOLOGIST</li>
            <li> Daily use helps to keep my skin calm.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much the size if a bodylotion but using it for my face, this amount will last forever.</li>
            <li> The product is not easy to find, but I&#x27;m glad I found it here.</li>
            <li> - this is a great product for your skin, I use it all the time - tough to find in local stores -</li>
            <li> Item arrived brand new and on time.</li>
            <li> i where i live</li>
            <li> it has very  little fragrance and doesn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; feeling that most lotions  have.</li>
            <li> and everyone thinks he married a younger woman.</li>
            <li> For the first 18 years of my life, various dermatologists gave me every lotion known to mankind, including prescription ones costing small fortunes, and all of them caused more problems than they solved.</li>
            <li> An old friend visited me from California.</li>
            <li> My face is always soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> or no pain, I like my feet soft, though, so I still put Moisturel on them after my bath.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;ve been scratching or my skin is especially sensitive, there is an initial sting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Moisturel for nearly 40 years.</li>
            <li> I forced myself to cry every day for a couple months and for the most part, they stopped hurting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a pretty low concentration (0.025) tretinoin cream (generic Retin A.)  </li>
            <li> They were less expensive and contained more of their product, but they both felt somewhat greasy, and  each contained a huge list of ingredients that made me wonder about their therapeutic value - while using a lot of filler substances.</li>
            <li> This is good in the winter cold weather and in the summer after being in the sun.  </li>
            <li> It is not greasy, lasts through the day, does not have added perfumes, and has made such a positive difference for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the only lotions  that really helps dry skin.</li>
            <li> Even this mild concentration causes me to wake up with peeling skin the morning after I use just a small amount of the prescription.</li>
            <li> After developing adult eczema and not finding any OTC remedies that helped, I remembered that my dermatologist recommended this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I use this for my young son&#x27;s dry facial skin.  </li>
            <li> A third morning, I put on Benzoyl Peroxide with the lotion again, and was shocked to discover that my entire face had turned bright red almost immediately</li>
            <li> The pain decreased significantly.</li>
            <li> It actually heals extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> A house painter preparing my house told me his arms were burning from bleach water having gotten into his long gloves protecting his arms.</li>
            <li> One bottle of lotion lasts a really long time, too.  </li>
            <li> Wonder if they would set it up on a \\&quot;subscription\\&quot; basis (like they do other medicines that you need on a regular basis) and offer the \\&quot;subscription\\&quot; discount.</li>
            <li> This helps my dry skin.</li>
            <li> In a scientific attempt to narrow down the cause further, on the fourth morning I skipped the Benzoyl Peroxide and just gently washed my face, then put the lotion on a small area.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> My derm recommended it to me years ago and it is getting harder to find in stores.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no irritation with this product.</li>
            <li> A dermatologist told me that failure to use a good skin lotion on the face and neck after showering is a bad mistake anytime, but especially in dry weather.</li>
            <li> Only a small amount is needed.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I tried two other lotions made by well-known companies.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly, leaving no feeling of &amp;#34;there&#x27;s a film on my face.&amp;#34; I have a very tough beard, and without using something after shaving, there&#x27;s redness and itch bad enough to cause an alarming  appearance and real discomfort.</li>
            <li> Beware of this product, for it contains Dimethicone as its active ingredient.</li>
            <li> So I went to go look up the active ingredient to see what else I could learn.</li>
            <li> It absorbs completely, moisturizes all day long, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts or rashes, and doesn&#x27;t look weird under my makeup.</li>
            <li> Moisturel lists few ingredients, and there is absolutely no odor, which I like.</li>
            <li> It cleared up dry skin on my chest area that I have had for the past year.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was just my batch, but it has a slight chemical smell that I&#x27;m not fond of.</li>
            <li> He asked me what secret lotion I was using because, he said, it was common for the women in his area to spend big bucks on face lotions to try to look younger.</li>
            <li> maybe we don&#x27;t want to mess with perfection.....</li>
            <li> It seems a little pricey but</li>
            <li> I did a little research and discovered there&#x27;s magnesium in the lotion.</li>
            <li> Have trouble finding this in stores.</li>
            <li> and it is not heavy or uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> few years ago, my feet started burning something fierce.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s expensive with the shipping, but I had trouble finding it locally.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it&#x27;s become increasingly difficult to find, so in an attempt to develop a back-up plan, I always try every new fragrance-free, oil-free face lotion that comes on the market, and I always regret it.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it is hard to find</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores around here</li>
            <li> No doctor could diagnose it so I suffered in silence, except when I complained all the time to my husband.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be frank: my skin sucks.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THE CREAM AND LOTION FOR AT LEAST 37 YEARS.  </li>
            <li> People tell me that I look to be in my late 40s when I am over 75.  </li>
            <li> But it is too thick.</li>
            <li> It has become impossible to find in stores locally, so I resorted to ordering it online.</li>
            <li> for my the status of my poor feet, I noticed one day that when I cried, all the pain went away.</li>
            <li> A dermatologist recommended I use this after I had a severe reaction to an expensive moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Just expensive to ship.  </li>
            <li> The pain was so bad, it would wake me up.</li>
            <li> I was shocked.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good moisturizer. Have trouble finding this in stores. Received as promised.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  It absorbs in keeping skin smooth and soft without feeling greasy.  Use all over and especially on my face as the MD ordered.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Wife uses this all the time</li>
            <li> Have used Moisturel for 25 years!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Moisturel Therapeutic lotion is salicylate-free and, therefore, one of the recommended lotions for people with fibromyalgia. I tried it for the first time today and ordered two more bottles. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s expensive with the shipping, but I had trouble finding it locally. Wonder if they would set it up on a \\&quot;subscription\\&quot; basis (like they do other medicines that you need on a regular basis) and offer the \\&quot;subscription\\&quot; discount.</li>
            <li> 5 stars does not require a comment!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the only product my wife can use on her face without it breaking out.   Would have given it five stars but is is too pricey.</li>
            <li> Fragrance free lotion for sensitive skin works well for me and is the only type my skin tolerates without having reactions.</li>
            <li> A dermatologist recommended I use this after I had a severe reaction to an expensive moisturizer. It is now 20 years since I&#x27;ve been using Moisturel. Nobody can guess my age. My husband is 4 years younger than me and everyone thinks he married a younger woman. An old friend visited me from California. He asked me what secret lotion I was using because, he said, it was common for the women in his area to spend big bucks on face lotions to try to look younger. This product hydrates your face. Even though the bottle does not specify it as a facial product, it works! I apply in the morning and when I go to bed. It never causes an irritation. When I started using Moisturel it was $11 for 14 oz-a huge difference compared to the $50 an ounce department store moisturizer which doesn&#x27;t work as well, in my opinion. The price hasn&#x27;t really gone up in all these years and the product is always consistently pure and effective. My face is always soft and hydrated. This is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This helps my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for Acne Prone Skin. Light weight, non-greasy, quick to absorb lotion that does NOT cause breakouts. It doesn&#x27;t have any sunscreen or wrinkle \\&quot;magic\\&quot; but I don&#x27;t want that stuff anyway.</li>
            <li> Since I have many skin allergies and sensitivities, finding a moisturizing lotion has not been easy.  Moisturel was recommended to my son by a dermatologist some years ago.  I started using it then and continued to use it through the years.  Sometimes it is hard to find so I was delighted to find it on Amazon.  It seems a little pricey but well worth the money for me.  The lotion is well absorbed and leaves my skin feeling soft and moist but not greasy.  The container says that it is fragrance-free but I can detect a light, pleasant aroma that disappears quickly after application.  I hope that Moisturel continues to be available because I have never been able to find a lotion that I like this much.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Hard to tell, but it seems like the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. It is fragrance free, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t have it&#x27;s own smell. I don&#x27;t know if it was just my batch, but it has a slight chemical smell that I&#x27;m not fond of.</li>
            <li> Moisturel is a lotion that I have used for the last 14 years....it has very  little fragrance and doesn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; feeling that most lotions  have.</li>
            <li> I use a pretty low concentration (0.025) tretinoin cream (generic Retin A.)  Even this mild concentration causes me to wake up with peeling skin the morning after I use just a small amount of the prescription. Refissa is an alternative, but my insurance plan doesn&#x27;t cover it and it costs more than a hundred dollars a tube.       Yesterday my dermatologist suggested that I put the pea-sized amount of tretinoin cream on the back of my hand, then an equal amount of Moisturel, then blend them before applying them to my face.    This morning I woke up and had NO peeling skin. Problem solved.</li>
            <li> The product is getting more difficult to find.  I have been using it since the &#x27;80&#x27;s.  I love it because I live in a hot climate and it is not heavy or uncomfortable.  When I travel I even use it on my face because I don&#x27;t break out when I use it.</li>
            <li> Beware of this product, for it contains Dimethicone as its active ingredient. I didn&#x27;t think much of it, what with all of the \\&quot;specially formulated not to irritate skin\\&quot; labels on this stuff, but I purchased it to use as part of The Regimen from acne.org.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first night I used it, I put it on top of Benzoyl Peroxide, and I assumed the warm feeling on my face was simply the acne medication doing its thing, and didn&#x27;t look at my face again before going to bed. Another morning, I used the Benzoyl Peroxide with my Skin79 BB Cream, and it was fine. A third morning, I put on Benzoyl Peroxide with the lotion again, and was shocked to discover that my entire face had turned bright red almost immediately and I felt that warm almost burning sensation again. It stayed that way for about an hour. In a scientific attempt to narrow down the cause further, on the fourth morning I skipped the Benzoyl Peroxide and just gently washed my face, then put the lotion on a small area. Sure enough, it turned bright red within five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty sure I&#x27;m having an allergic reaction to one of the ingredients in this lotion, I thought to myself. So I went to go look up the active ingredient to see what else I could learn. I learned that Dimethicone is a silicon oil that coats the face smoothly, interfering with the skin&#x27;s natural regulation processes, trapping moisture and bacteria in your pores, causing people with acne to break out even more than they were before they were using it. And that it isn&#x27;t uncommon for people to be allergic to it, even though it&#x27;s being used in more and more products because it&#x27;s \\&quot;generally regarded as safe.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to start searching for some non-Dimethicone face lotion, and give this stuff out to one of my friends in hopes they can make use of it.</li>
            <li> The product is not easy to find, but I&#x27;m glad I found it here. Men, too,  need some kind of skin protectant. It dries quickly, leaving no feeling of &amp;#34;there&#x27;s a film on my face.&amp;#34; I have a very tough beard, and without using something after shaving, there&#x27;s redness and itch bad enough to cause an alarming  appearance and real discomfort. More than twenty years ago a friend gave me a half-empty bottle of Moisturel. Application gave me immediate relief of both the redness and itch.&lt;br /&gt;  A house painter preparing my house told me his arms were burning from bleach water having gotten into his long gloves protecting his arms. I got out my jar of the cream version, told him to dig in. Applying the cream to his forearms and hands stopped the burning right away and the redness disappeared. Only a small amount is needed.&lt;br /&gt;  A dermatologist told me that failure to use a good skin lotion on the face and neck after showering is a bad mistake anytime, but especially in dry weather. I tried two other lotions made by well-known companies. They were less expensive and contained more of their product, but they both felt somewhat greasy, and  each contained a huge list of ingredients that made me wonder about their therapeutic value - while using a lot of filler substances. Moisturel lists few ingredients, and there is absolutely no odor, which I like.</li>
            <li> bought it for friend.  Seems satisfied</li>
            <li> Great product not greasy.  Hard to find in stores around here but Amazon has it and as always the Amazon service is tops.</li>
            <li> Graet buy.Thank you Amazon !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product since a dermatologist recommended it to me 27 years ago. Yes, you read that right. I am a LONG time user of Moisturel and will forever claim how wonderful this lotion is. It absolutely will NOT cause pimples. It&#x27;s light so your skin doesn&#x27;t even notice it&#x27;s there yet it keeps your skin looking dewy and healthy. People comment on my skin all the time and I swear it&#x27;s from this product. My husband was VERY prone to break outs as a teen, and I&#x27;ve put it on his skin a few times and it didn&#x27;t bother him either. It&#x27;s very good for sensitive and dry skin. My only wish is that it would come with sunscreen, but maybe we don&#x27;t want to mess with perfection.....</li>
            <li> I LOVE this cream. I have acne prone combination skin. I searched online for a cream that I can use during the day that would give my skin enough moisture, won&#x27;t make me super shiny and wouldn&#x27;t break me out!!! Well this is a winner. I read reviews on acne.org and purchased it based on those reviews. I&#x27;m glad I did. you get a big bottle. It&#x27;s pretty much the size if a bodylotion but using it for my face, this amount will last forever. I highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> I love Moisturel. I used it on my face for years. They stopped selling it at Walgreens, so I ordered it from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago, my feet started burning something fierce. The pain was so bad, it would wake me up. No doctor could diagnose it so I suffered in silence, except when I complained all the time to my husband. One day I put Moisturel on my feet after my bath. The pain decreased significantly. I was shocked. I did a little research and discovered there&#x27;s magnesium in the lotion. That&#x27;s probably why the pain was alleviated&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my the status of my poor feet, I noticed one day that when I cried, all the pain went away. I forced myself to cry every day for a couple months and for the most part, they stopped hurting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain or no pain, I like my feet soft, though, so I still put Moisturel on them after my bath.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be frank: my skin sucks. I was born with eczema; I&#x27;ve struggled with breakouts for 30+ years; and I developed atopic dermatitis during my first pregnancy. Thankfully, most people are unaware of my issues, but it didn&#x27;t come easy. For the first 18 years of my life, various dermatologists gave me every lotion known to mankind, including prescription ones costing small fortunes, and all of them caused more problems than they solved. Then a pharmacist recommended Moisturel. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 20 years now, and I have yet to find a fragrance-free, oil-free lotion that works as well. It absorbs completely, moisturizes all day long, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts or rashes, and doesn&#x27;t look weird under my makeup. My skin is aging a lot better than many of my peers, and Moisturel has undoubtedly played a role in that. Sadly, it&#x27;s become increasingly difficult to find, so in an attempt to develop a back-up plan, I always try every new fragrance-free, oil-free face lotion that comes on the market, and I always regret it. I would gladly pay five times the price for this stuff. It&#x27;s just that good.</li>
            <li> Moisturel Lotion was recommend to me by a dermatologist many years ago.  No other product has been as effective on my sensitive skin than this one.  I wish more stores would carry it.</li>
            <li> This is a fine &amp;#34;hand lotion.&amp;#34;  But that is unfortunately the only alternative now that the company has apparently discontinued a heavier salve, which was excellent for people suffering from very try skin.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommends this lotion. I can&#x27;t find it in drug stores any more. It&#x27;s one of the only lotions  that really helps dry skin. It can be used on the face without clogging pores. It&#x27;s fragrance free too! Item arrived brand new and on time. I will purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I have used Moisturel lotion for years and love it.  It was recommended to me by my dermatologist.  I have allergies to most other lotions and crèmes.  This is good in the winter cold weather and in the summer after being in the sun.  I recommend it to everyone.  I have used it on my grandchildren as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Moisturel lotion for quite some time, used to purchase it retail at Bi-Mart. What I did NOT like was the packaging, so next time I&#x27;ll be sure to select a different one of Amazon&#x27;s providers.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THE CREAM AND LOTION FOR AT LEAST 37 YEARS.  THIS WAS HIGHLY LY RECOMMENDED BY MY DERMATOLOGIST YEARS AGO AND I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THRU EVER SINCE.  LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I have been using Moisturel since my dermatologist rcecommned it several months ago. As a a guy, Ihave no idea about the variety of moisterizers on the market so I appreciated my dermatologist recommendation. It cleared up dry skin on my chest area that I have had for the past year.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer for sensitive skin as it is hypo-allergenic. My derm recommended it to me years ago and it is getting harder to find in stores. It is very moisturizing without being greasy or oily.</li>
            <li> Perfect for after-shave. I had used NIVEA. But it is too thick. This product is easy to apply and does not stain my shirts when applied to my arms.</li>
            <li> Yes, I love moisturel lotion and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Same product  that  have  been  using  for  years</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer. Could not find it in my local drug store.</li>
            <li> Years ago I went to dermatologist &amp; they recommended Moisturel - this is a great product for your skin, I use it all the time - tough to find in local stores -</li>
            <li> This is the best. It soaks in pretty quickly and does not leave you feeling greasy. My husbands says I have the softest skin, when in reality I have very dry scaly skin without this great product. It has become impossible to find in stores locally, so I resorted to ordering it online. Still worth it.</li>
            <li> Great price, great product!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this to me 10 yrs. ago and I have been using it ever since and introduced many friends to it. I have very dry skin and this is the best product by far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Moisturel for years (my family has always used it) and I haven&#x27;t found a better moisturizer yet.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin in the slightest, absorbs quickly, leaves very little residue, keeps my skin smooth for the whole day, and it&#x27;s unscented so I don&#x27;t have to worry about offending anyone or the scent clashing with perfume or something else I put on.  One bottle of lotion lasts a really long time, too.  Thank you Moisturel!</li>
            <li> Have found that Moisturel is the most effective moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried,.  It particularly does a great job of getting rid of winter dryness.  It&#x27;s light, super effective, and does not have an intrusive smell.</li>
            <li> Used this stuff for years. No grease, no stink.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing better for revitalizing skin!</li>
            <li> Only moisturizer I can use on my face. I&#x27;ve been using it forever!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> Best lotion ever. It actually heals extremely dry skin. After using it for awhile it is ok if you miss a day because your skin stays hydrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Moisturel for many years due to exzema.  It&#x27;s the only lotion I can use on my skin that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  It&#x27;s a great product and I save money buying through Amazon.</li>
            <li> After developing adult eczema and not finding any OTC remedies that helped, I remembered that my dermatologist recommended this a long time ago. It can be hard to find in stores, so I was happy to purchase off of Amazon. It is a great lotion, but it does contain alcohol. If I&#x27;ve been scratching or my skin is especially sensitive, there is an initial sting. Daily use helps to keep my skin calm.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use this cream daily, I begin to see signs of my Rosacea flaring up.  It is keeping things under control and I can&#x27;t recommended it highly enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but there are better products out there such as Amlactin and CeraVe.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product which I have used before.  No longer available in stores in my area.  Delighted that I could find it on line and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have used this moisturizer for more than 25 years and believe it has been instrumental in keeping my face so young looking.  People tell me that I look to be in my late 40s when I am over 75.  It is a shame that I can no longer make this purchase in the drugstores but am thankful that Amazon carries it.  Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> Great stuff I have used for years. My dermatologist recommended it for a reason I guess.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion ever.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s really nothing else to use after you try this non perfume, non sticky moisturizing cream.  It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> As always this lotion is fantastic!  works well yet fragrance free so does not conflict with my perfume and because there is no scent my husband likes to use it also.  Delivered as advertised - received very rapidly.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me to use this five years ago. It is non greasy and you can use it anywhere as a fabulous moisturizer. Now that the drugstores have stopped carrying it, Amazon is the only place I can still purchase it. Thanks AMAZON.</li>
            <li> I have never used the lotion just cream and I love both.  Will continue to use.  Just expensive to ship.  Great service.</li>
            <li> Our dermatologist recommends this. Great product.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best lotion my family has ever used.  It is not greasy, lasts through the day, does not have added perfumes, and has made such a positive difference for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I use this for my young son&#x27;s dry facial skin.  The product works well for him.</li>
            <li> Works great for my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Moisturel for nearly 40 years. Like so many reviews I&#x27;ve read my dermatologist recommended it.  He said Mosturel was better than the &amp;#34;expensive stuff&amp;#34; and a lot, lot cheaper.  He was right. That should be a good enough recommendation for just about everyone.</li>
            <li> A good product for people with ultra sensitive eyes to lotions and creams.  There is absolutely no irritation with this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff; it&#x27;s smooth and creamy, and stays on well. Very pleased with the quick delivery, too.  I just wish that it still came with the pump; it was much easier to use that way. Same wonderful lotion, though.  I use it morning and night.</li>
            <li> it works well glad i got it have troube finding i where i live</li>
            <li> This is by far the best moisturizing cream I have ever used.  No smell, absorbed quickly, and has no allergic effects for anyone I know of.  If you have dry itching skin, from any condition, including liver disease, this can provide excellent temporary relief.</li>
