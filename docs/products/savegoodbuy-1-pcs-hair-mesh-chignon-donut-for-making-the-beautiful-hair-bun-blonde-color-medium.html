            <li>I LOVE LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li>This thing is like the wonderbra for my hair, I love it!</li>
            <li>but I absolutely LOVE it!</li>
            <li>Took a while to receive this bun holder but it is nice.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get tangled in my hair and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Looks really cute when finished.</li>
            <li>Works a lot better than the sock.</li>
            <li>It works so much better than with a sock.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even better than what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>This donut bun works so much better than the &amp;#34;as seen on tv&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend this product to people looking for the perfect bun!</li>
            <li>So easy to use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product itself works great, especially for the updo klutz, like myself.</li>
            <li>This product took over a month to receive and when I did it was so cheap I immediately threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li>It took me a few practice runs and a youtube video or two to really perfect how to use this</li>
            <li>Wrapping her hair up and around this hair donut, however, was not difficult.  </li>
            <li>This was exactly what they used and wanted.  </li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was expecting and what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I purchased this and wish I hadn&#x27;t the product fell apart on my first try</li>
            <li>After debating before ordering, I was happy with purchasing the medium size (I have medium to long straight blonde hair).</li>
            <li>I have red hair, and had originally been using a brown sock, this makes my bun look so much fuller and blends in nicely with the sunkissed blonde parts of my ginger locks!</li>
            <li>I have a feeling any larger size would create a super big, unnatural looking bun for most heads.</li>
            <li>This thing is amazing for making sock buns, and it stays in place with a few pins and hairspray.</li>
            <li>Looks like a butt hole, a real spitting image of a butt hole.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She was off and running within a few minutes in creating her own bun.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not thick, but she has plenty of it.  </li>
            <li>Gift for my 11 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve wanted to be able to do a sock bun for so long, but I always tried to use donuts that were too dark (and visible through the gaps in my blonde hair) or too soft</li>
            <li>I see the old fashioned &amp;#34;bun&amp;#34; must be back in style - all the female aides at the Netherland&#x27;s recent crowning were sporting the chignon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s generally straight with a slight wave.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s hard to use and the instructions don&#x27;t identify what to do with one of the pieces</li>
            <li> I complained about the fact and he refund the money</li>
            <li> horrible fell apart first use.  </li>
            <li> they were unable to find another.</li>
            <li> so it was even difficult to string through my thick ponytail. :(</li>

            <li> When I made the purchase of the product description it should came with other items along of the bun maker, but to my surprise when the item arrived there was only the bun maker. I complained about the fact and he refund the money and I did not need to return the product. I didn&#x27;t like the experience with him.</li>
            <li> Gift for my 11 year old daughter.  She was off and running within a few minutes in creating her own bun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her hair falls about 8&amp;#34; below her shoulders.  It&#x27;s generally straight with a slight wave.  Not thick, but she has plenty of it.  Wrapping her hair up and around this hair donut, however, was not difficult.  Looks really cute when finished.</li>
            <li> Took a while to receive this bun holder but it is nice.</li>
            <li> I could only seem to find the one size?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product itself works great, especially for the updo klutz, like myself. Works a lot better than the sock. That damn sock.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for a relative. They used to use this mesh chignon donut but the one they had broke and they were unable to find another. This was exactly what they used and wanted.  Would purchase from this merchant again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE this product!! So easy to use and when I or my daughter uses it we always get complements.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was expecting and what I wanted. I just googled &amp;#34;How to do a sock bun&amp;#34;, but used this instead of a sock. It works so much better than with a sock. It&#x27;s even better than what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to be able to do a sock bun for so long, but I always tried to use donuts that were too dark (and visible through the gaps in my blonde hair) or too soft (I need something firm to wrap my hair around). This thing is like the wonderbra for my hair, I love it!</li>
            <li> My hair was too long and too thick for this to work. It was also not very malleable so it was even difficult to string through my thick ponytail. :(</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this! Helps her get her looking hair into bun form for Ballet</li>
            <li> horrible fell apart first use.  I purchased this and wish I hadn&#x27;t the product fell apart on my first try, I had to sew it back up and still the insides fell out.  Go to the 99 cent store or Walmart.  Don&#x27;t spend extra for this.</li>

            <li> This thing is amazing for making sock buns, and it stays in place with a few pins and hairspray. Awesome.</li>
