            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>On time, worked great!</li>
            <li>did not do this, but it might be wise to handle the acid with rubber gloves as well, just in case!</li>
            <li>Otherwise product works great.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any problems with spilling, but it might be a good safeguard.</li>
            <li>it is awesome and it absolutely works!!</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product,</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Great deal for an absolute great solution.</li>
            <li>Had Vaseline handy in case of running.</li>
            <li>baking soda and water) handy.</li>
            <li>This stuff is STRONG!  </li>
            <li>This works better than anything I have ever used for removing warts.  </li>
            <li>and I have bought soooooo many things on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Does not stay on top of the wart.</li>
            <li>It scabbed over and hurt more than laser treatments.  </li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t want it to affect any healthy skin.</li>
            <li>Size is more than you&#x27;ll probably ever need unless you&#x27;re trying to melt someone&#x27;s face off.</li>
            <li>This stuff is no joke and can get out of hand very quickly.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying this is strong ACID</li>
            <li>always medical grade and a great company</li>
            <li>Have fun!</li>
            <li>U def have to be careful and know what you&#x27;re doing, but it is amazing and works like magic!</li>
            <li>As long as you follow the directions and dilute the acid it works great.</li>
            <li>I originally started doing chemical peels for my enlarged pores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that the lower concentrations are good for facial peels but after seeing how powerful this stuff is, I wouldn&#x27;t risk it.  </li>
            <li>This is an update: after 3 treatments on a sunspot on my face it has lightened significantly.</li>
            <li>Original post:  </li>
            <li>Applied with clean cuetip.</li>
            <li>but I would strongly urge most people to go to a professional.</li>
            <li>Be very mindful when applying the chemical, as it will burn surrounding skin quite easily.</li>
            <li>It works very very well, but before you buy, make sure you are very very aware of the highly corrosive power of this concentration.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you close bottle tight and put in a safe.</li>
            <li>That said, if you are going to use a TCA product then this line of products is consistently reliable.</li>
            <li>I buy the higher strength and dilute it as needed.</li>
            <li>I had whole bunch of moles and skin tags and they&#x27;re all gone!</li>
            <li>in fact, this is my first</li>
            <li>I had a larger one and it took many application</li>
            <li>Make sure to test first and start at a low strength.</li>
            <li>Got much better results with over the counter products, simply because they stay where they need to be.</li>
            <li>Since I have been consistently doing these chemical peels</li>
            <li>Used rubbing alcohol to prep the areas first.</li>
            <li>Great for wards, get the job done in a week and a half more less..</li>
            <li>it scabbed up and was VERY</li>
            <li>Be SURE you are extremely careful with this product.</li>
            <li>oh and they ship it out very promptly too.</li>
            <li>This stuff will burn through any organic material, so be VERY cautious.  </li>
            <li>This product WILL BURN YOU, so be extra careful using it, and if you happen to get it anywhere else other than the intended application site, it is best to have a bowl of baking soda &amp; water nearby to neutralize the acid</li>
            <li>Do not let it touch other parts of your skin as it will burn for sure.</li>
            <li>First use near a sink, wear glasses to protect your eyes.</li>
            <li>Even taking necessary precautions, I did suffer mild scarring.  </li>
            <li>I ended up having to use scar gel on it to get it to look decent again.  </li>
            <li>You need patients and steady hand.</li>
            <li>--I had high hopes.</li>
            <li>I was able to twist it off without any trouble.</li>
            <li>So far it worked good in a small mole,the big one is still in the process</li>
            <li>They shipped me a new vial after mine was lost in the mail.</li>
            <li>Some simple math will get it down to 10 - 20 percent which I think takes care of most uses for this product.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m fine if there is a little discoloration.</li>
            <li>My areas darkened considerably after this process.</li>
            <li>Barely make a splash on your face and it will feel as if you put a lighter to your face.  </li>
            <li>you want professional strength, this is it, but take all necessary safety precautions if you do decide to use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting off with 3 stars because it did peel, I did not burn, and its too early to see if tca will work for my problems.  </li>
            <li>and it took only a few hours and the large mole was gone.</li>

            <li> and it took only a few hours and the large mole was gone.</li>
            <li> I bought it to treat a wart on my finger, and was skeptical at first, especially after having seen not much change in the first week despite applying it twice a day.</li>
            <li> It did nothing for the flat mole</li>
            <li> The key though is to only apply in small amounts, directly on the blemish you want removed and nowhere else.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the use of a toothpick for controlled application on small areas.   </li>
            <li> think of it like holding a match, being as careful as possible not to get it on any unwanted areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> #34;I think TCA probably works...just don&#x27;t buy from this company because obviously either there is a dilution of the TCA or some other abnormality.&amp;#34; Maybe I just received a defective bottle?</li>
            <li> Be careful and apply conservatively.</li>
            <li> and it will burn your skin if not used carefully.  </li>
            <li> I used this a couple of times on that wart and it fell off completely a few days later.</li>
            <li> This did take a few repeat uses, but overall it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worked well, but be careful.  </li>
            <li> I mixed half purified water to half 80% tca.  </li>
            <li> and I have applied it according to the instructions and have noticed absolutely NO CHANGE!</li>
            <li> If they are small, it will take only one or two applications and the thing will come off.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is extremely acidic, and depending on your sensitivity and the application site, you may experience some level of stinging pain when you apply it.</li>
            <li> Be extremely cautious, though, since the burn hurts a lot</li>
            <li> It did a great job removing the ugly mass, by &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; off the layers of the troubled area.  </li>
            <li> For the common wart, it takes two weeks of daily treatments to get rid of them.</li>
            <li> It leaves a white acid burn that you can treat and reduce down in size, and after a few treatments get rid of the mole, leaving just a small scar instead.</li>
            <li> Well, it has been a week and a half</li>
            <li> my pores are half the size they were to begin with.</li>
            <li> Works well on warts without a mess</li>
            <li> I cut off as much dead skin as I could, took a q tip, and broke in half.</li>
            <li> For me, it stung a little bit for a couple minutes when I put it on, but after that, there wasn&#x27;t any pain.</li>
            <li> It took a little under a week, but after the acid dried the skin tag</li>
            <li> I used this for a small skin tag removal, and after applying it as directed, with a Q-tip, the unwanted material died off within about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> Apply a thin coating, on the wart let dry and repeat 2-3 times, remember you are using less than a drop.</li>
            <li> The eyebrow tattoos appear to be lightening though Im not sure since the tattoo itself was uneven.</li>
            <li> Please be very careful using this product, I would recommend watering it down and using it very very very slowly.</li>
            <li> I tried to use this to lighten a small tattoo I have on my finger.</li>
            <li> Mine, that I have had for the past 20 years, was in my underarm</li>
            <li> It was also painfully slow.  </li>
            <li> It removed the skin tags but did some serious damage to surrounding ski.  </li>
            <li> This is a serious chemical, it works but you need to know how to apply.  </li>
            <li> Do not use the cotton side, just use the thin side and dip into solution.  </li>
            <li> Either way its hard to express my disappointment with this product</li>
            <li> Even with a surrounding ring of vaseline, it was difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Not for the careless or the timid.</li>
            <li> Very thin liquid, difficult to use.</li>
            <li> This is extremely disappointing and I wanted to write a review not just to say &amp;#34;hey guys dont</li>
            <li> Do not use this unless you know what your doing, could be very dangerous, but it works.</li>
            <li> It works, but I had to stop using it, it was very painful.  </li>
            <li> I look horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So far it worked good in a small mole,the big one is still in the process</li>
            <li> It works for me but I would strongly urge most people to go to a professional. This stuff is no joke and can get out of hand very quickly. That said, if you are going to use a TCA product then this line of products is consistently reliable. I buy the higher strength and dilute it as needed. Some simple math will get it down to 10 - 20 percent which I think takes care of most uses for this product.</li>
            <li> Tried it.  Burned like hell.  It removed the skin tags but did some serious damage to surrounding ski.  Google the side effects of this stuff before you order!</li>
            <li> Same item my doctor used to remove genital warts. Same results. Applied with clean cuetip. Be careful and apply conservatively. Burns when applying. Turn spots to white. Scabbed. Wart gone in 7-14 days. Length of scabbing duration varies by amount applied.</li>
            <li> Works well on warts without a mess</li>
            <li> does indeed cause skin to peel, still unsuccessful at curing my condition, but it seems to help</li>
            <li> It works, but I had to stop using it, it was very painful.  Please be very careful using this product, I would recommend watering it down and using it very very very slowly.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying this is strong ACID and it will burn your skin if not used carefully.  I&#x27;m not kidding.  Barely make a splash on your face and it will feel as if you put a lighter to your face.  That said...this product was awesome:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was highly impressed with this product.  I bought it to remove an ingrown hair growth underneath by chin.  It did a great job removing the ugly mass, by &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; off the layers of the troubled area.  Just again be weary that it feels like fire burning id your skin</li>
            <li> This stuff is STRONG!  Immediate skin burn if you touch it without diluting. Have fun!</li>
            <li> This works better than anything I have ever used for removing warts.  Freezing and didn&#x27;t do anything for the wart that I had on my thumb.  I used this a couple of times on that wart and it fell off completely a few days later.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! U def have to be careful and know what you&#x27;re doing, but it is amazing and works like magic! I had whole bunch of moles and skin tags and they&#x27;re all gone!</li>
            <li> I applied this to a tattoo i had wished to remove 2 times a day for a week. it scabbed up and was VERY painful.&lt;br /&gt;it didn&#x27;t do A THING.&lt;br /&gt;I have no clue why??</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an esthetician and I use this at home to remove skin tags and lighten my freckles. I did not dilute this. I used a cotton swab to apply to the area and left on for about 5-10 minutes.  It stings but nothing unbearable.  I tried to use this to lighten a small tattoo I have on my finger. It did not change the tattoo at all.</li>
            <li> I NEVER EVER EVER write reviews....in fact, this is my first I think and I have bought soooooo many things on Amazon. I&#x27;m going into medical school and I wanted my warts gone. Well, it has been a week and a half and I have applied it according to the instructions and have noticed absolutely NO CHANGE! This is extremely disappointing and I wanted to write a review not just to say &amp;#34;hey guys dont but TCA,&amp;#34; but rather: &amp;#34;I think TCA probably works...just don&#x27;t buy from this company because obviously either there is a dilution of the TCA or some other abnormality.&amp;#34; Maybe I just received a defective bottle? Either way its hard to express my disappointment with this product--I had high hopes.</li>
            <li> The product works! Here are some things you might want to know if you&#x27;re thinking about purchasing this. Be SURE you are extremely careful with this product. You are dealing with acid, so when you dip the Q tip (that&#x27;s what I used) into the acid think of it like holding a match, being as careful as possible not to get it on any unwanted areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend you use this product to remove skin tags in places where you would not mind getting some skin discoloration (For example, anywhere on your face). Mine, that I have had for the past 20 years, was in my underarm so I&#x27;m fine if there is a little discoloration. It took a little under a week, but after the acid dried the skin tag I was able to twist it off without any trouble. I recommend using Nexcare waterproof bandages to cover the tag in between treatments for convenience in showers, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many reviews said the acid burned for a couple of minutes. In my situation, I had a lot of pain for about an hour. Putting an ice pack on the wound after you have dressed it with a band aid will help with the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not do this, but it might be wise to handle the acid with rubber gloves as well, just in case! I didn&#x27;t have any problems with spilling, but it might be a good safeguard.</li>
            <li> Used it on skin tags and moles.  If they are small, it will take only one or two applications and the thing will come off.  I had a larger one and it took many application but it finally did the trick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been fighting with a skin tag on my neck for years....with this stuff, two applications and it fell off today!!!&lt;br /&gt;Finally! Go ahead and grab some - it is awesome and it absolutely works!!</li>
            <li> Make sure to test first and start at a low strength. Otherwise product works great.</li>
            <li> Very thin liquid, difficult to use. Does not stay on top of the wart. Lacks the viscosity to &amp;#34;stay put&amp;#34;. Even with a surrounding ring of vaseline, it was difficult to use. Got much better results with over the counter products, simply because they stay where they need to be. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> As long as you follow the directions and dilute the acid it works great. I originally started doing chemical peels for my enlarged pores. Since I have been consistently doing these chemical peels my pores are half the size they were to begin with. I rely on this stuff.</li>
            <li> Great deal for an absolute great solution. Works great!</li>
            <li> It works very very well, but before you buy, make sure you are very very aware of the highly corrosive power of this concentration.  I used this for a small skin tag removal, and after applying it as directed, with a Q-tip, the unwanted material died off within about a week and a half. This did take a few repeat uses, but overall it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for a word of caution. This stuff is extremely acidic, and depending on your sensitivity and the application site, you may experience some level of stinging pain when you apply it. For me, it stung a little bit for a couple minutes when I put it on, but after that, there wasn&#x27;t any pain. The key though is to only apply in small amounts, directly on the blemish you want removed and nowhere else. During one application I accidentally brushed another area of skin with the Q-tip I had just applied the acid with and it caused a burn that took about a week to heal. This product WILL BURN YOU, so be extra careful using it, and if you happen to get it anywhere else other than the intended application site, it is best to have a bowl of baking soda &amp; water nearby to neutralize the acid quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want professional strength, this is it, but take all necessary safety precautions if you do decide to use it.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on this product and how to use it correctly.  Even taking necessary precautions, I did suffer mild scarring.  I used it to try to remove two moles.  It did nothing for the flat mole but it did get rid of the raised mole.  I ended up having to use scar gel on it to get it to look decent again.  I also tried it for tattoo removal.  It scabbed over and hurt more than laser treatments.  It was also painfully slow.  I did several treatments and the tattoo DID fade but not dramatically.  I&#x27;m sure that the lower concentrations are good for facial peels but after seeing how powerful this stuff is, I wouldn&#x27;t risk it.  Kudos to the seller, though.  They shipped me a new vial after mine was lost in the mail.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS! I bought it to treat a wart on my finger, and was skeptical at first, especially after having seen not much change in the first week despite applying it twice a day. However, the wart began to darken and a rim of white skin began to form around the wart in the second week, and by the end of the second week, the wart came off! Be extremely cautious, though, since the burn hurts a lot and you don&#x27;t want it to affect any healthy skin. But I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product, oh and they ship it out very promptly too.</li>
            <li> Great for wards, get the job done in a week and a half more less..</li>
            <li> It works for me but you need to do it twice a month to have results.</li>
            <li> always medical grade and a great company</li>
            <li> This is a serious chemical, it works but you need to know how to apply.  First use near a sink, wear glasses to protect your eyes. My son had a severe hand wart that the doctors could not resolve. I cut off as much dead skin as I could, took a q tip, and broke in half. Do not use the cotton side, just use the thin side and dip into solution.  Apply a thin coating, on the wart let dry and repeat 2-3 times, remember you are using less than a drop. Make sure you close bottle tight and put in a safe. I repeated this weekly, for about 4 weeks, wart is 95% gone. You need patients and steady hand. Do not use this unless you know what your doing, could be very dangerous, but it works.</li>
            <li> Worked well, but be careful.  This stuff will burn through any organic material, so be VERY cautious.  I used a Q-tip to apply it to some moles that I wanted to get rid of. It leaves a white acid burn that you can treat and reduce down in size, and after a few treatments get rid of the mole, leaving just a small scar instead. Size is more than you&#x27;ll probably ever need unless you&#x27;re trying to melt someone&#x27;s face off.</li>
            <li> Got rid of my mole, but...now I have never used this sort of substance, but I was in a hurry. Do not let it touch other parts of your skin as it will burn for sure. I know my burn will disappear, so protect your areas that you do not want touched.&lt;br /&gt;Oh and it took only a few hours and the large mole was gone. So 5 stars for does the job.</li>
            <li> On time, worked great!</li>
            <li> For skin tags, one application does the job. For the common wart, it takes two weeks of daily treatments to get rid of them. Be very mindful when applying the chemical, as it will burn surrounding skin quite easily.</li>
            <li> My initial post is below. This is an update: after 3 treatments on a sunspot on my face it has lightened significantly. The eyebrow tattoos appear to be lightening though Im not sure since the tattoo itself was uneven. I have not burned or scarred using this. After each treatment the area darkens, and peels about 5 days later. I am planning on going a bit stronger on the tattoos. This hasnt helped my pore size at all.  I highly recommend the use of a toothpick for controlled application on small areas.   Original post:  I bought this for: sunspots, cosmetic tattoo removal, and to reduce pore size.  I&#x27;m starting off with 3 stars because it did peel, I did not burn, and its too early to see if tca will work for my problems.  Here was the process:  I mixed half purified water to half 80% tca.  Used rubbing alcohol to prep the areas first. Had Vaseline handy in case of running. Had neutralizing solution (baking soda and water) handy. Applied tca with a toothpick (several coats).  I only did one area at a time. I waited until frosting started to occur then neutralized immediately.  My areas darkened considerably after this process. I look horrible. But that is temporary until the peel takes place.  1 week later i am starting to peel.</li>
            <li> Not for the careless or the timid. It works.</li>
