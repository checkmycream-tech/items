            <li>I highly suggest getting this 3pk instead of at the store - you save way more!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I bought a 3-pack because I&#x27;ll be using this product for a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does a great job cleansing and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dried out.</li>
            <li>He said &#x27;save your money - this one will do just as well&#x27; and he was right.  </li>
            <li>This cleanser removes dirt and make-up easily, but hasn&#x27;t caused any issues with my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Only if I knew about this product earlier, could have saved money/time looking for that perfect facial wash.</li>
            <li>Arrived exactly on time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for fighting acne, and I&#x27;ve started using on my older combination skin instead of the more expensive department store cleansers I used to use.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin, and love the fact that this doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, and yet doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li>Thanks .</li>
            <li>When they actually use this stuff, it clears up their acne and their skin is nice and clear and soft.  </li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s dermatologist recommended this (without prompting), even though it&#x27;s an upscale office that sells high end products out front.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling clean without feeling dry.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist highly recommended it to me for someone who has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have ever used for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Their other cleanser labeled &amp;#34;hydrating&amp;#34; is a little bit better but still no miracle product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use it for my hand-washing liquid.  I keep it in all our bathrooms and kitchens.</li>
            <li> Removes makeup, even eye makeup so well. I have combination skin and this is great for it.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for people with sensitive/combination skins.  I&#x27;ve tried numerous name brands and found this great product!  Only if I knew about this product earlier, could have saved money/time looking for that perfect facial wash.</li>
            <li> Best face wash I have ever used for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Love this product! Then add the fact you are basically getting a buy two get one free deal, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist for use on my face, along with a prescription retinoid cream. The combo dries out my skin, so I need to use a moisturizer as well, but has worked well. Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s dermatologist recommended this (without prompting), even though it&#x27;s an upscale office that sells high end products out front.  He said &#x27;save your money - this one will do just as well&#x27; and he was right.  It&#x27;s great for fighting acne, and I&#x27;ve started using on my older combination skin instead of the more expensive department store cleansers I used to use.  It was a great find!  Don&#x27;t let the low price of this product make you think you&#x27;re getting something of lower quality than you can get at Sephora or a counter at Nordstrom.  Trust me, spend your money on something else!</li>
            <li> Top product! Once you buy it you&#x27;ll never change for anything else</li>
            <li> Way better than cetaphil to me....</li>
            <li> Arrived exactly on time. No damage to the product and I love it! My dermatologist highly recommended it to me for someone who has very sensitive skin.I highly suggest getting this 3pk instead of at the store - you save way more!</li>
            <li> Great facial cleanser.  I have two teenage boys.  When they actually use this stuff, it clears up their acne and their skin is nice and clear and soft.  It does a great job cleansing and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dried out.</li>
            <li> I was advise to use this product by my dermatologist and I love it. Fast delivery too. Thanks .</li>
            <li> loved it just what I needed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Cerave ever since my dermatologist recommended it.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!  This cleanser removes dirt and make-up easily, but hasn&#x27;t caused any issues with my sensitive skin.  I&#x27;m happy I bought a 3-pack because I&#x27;ll be using this product for a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This company also does not test on animals.</li>
            <li> I tried this cleanser because everyone seems to be raving about this brand like it&#x27;s some holy grail that cures all skincare problems. It completely dried out my combination skin and make it feel so rough like sandpaper. Their other cleanser labeled &amp;#34;hydrating&amp;#34; is a little bit better but still no miracle product. Since my bad experience with Cerave I&#x27;ve completely switched over to all-natural skincare products and my skin is finally happy.</li>
            <li> Bought this based on Paula&#x27;s Choice recommendation. A lot cheaper than her line of facial wash. I have combination skin, and love the fact that this doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, and yet doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry. This is now my go-to facial wash.</li>
            <li> FAVE FACE WASH EVER. AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Great product!  hard to find in stores near me so ordering online was easy and it arrived 2 days later!  Use this bc my Dermatologist recommended it!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. My skin is very sensitive as I&#x27;ve gotten older and this cleans without drying or irritating.</li>
            <li> Ordered two bottles, Which were delivered on December 2.  The soap did not foam when dispensed from either of them.  I contacted Amazon, and they said they would issue a refund.  I  ordered the soap a second time, and the second order was delivered yesterday, December 15.  This time it came as a 3-pak, and the soap does not foam when dispensed from any of them.  I need to use a cleanser that foams, and I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product.  Are the bottles mislabeled, or is there some other problem?</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite cleanser. It is gentle and effective. I got a great deal on it too. When I can I find it out in stores, it is usually around 12.00. I bought it from the comfort of my home for a great bargain and free shipping!</li>
            <li> Best facewash ever.  It cleans without drying out your skin.  It&#x27;s effective at removing any residual makeup or lotions.  And this is a cheap price!</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling clean without feeling dry.</li>
            <li> Cleans my face well and doesn&#x27;t dry it out. Great for my eczema</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It takes off all your makeup, but doesn&#x27;t aggravate your skin. It also doesn&#x27;t leave a weird film behind like the non-foaming version does. It is pricey, though.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this and my husband loves it because it is foaming as opposed to a more lotion-y feel. Cleans well!</li>
            <li> best recommendation from a dermatologist ever.</li>
            <li> Great deal on a great cleanser.</li>
            <li> Good product. Little pricey.</li>
