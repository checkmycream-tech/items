            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with these.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m light browned skin and the colors look beautiful on my skin tone.</li>
            <li>and i wasnt expecting it for a couple more weeks!</li>
            <li>Depending on the kind of looking you&#x27;re going for, this could be a problem.</li>
            <li>Even the brushes are fairly nice.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>but I still find that I have to really cake the eye shadow on to get good coverage.</li>
            <li>I honestly can say def worth every penny</li>
            <li>and it was fine.</li>
            <li>; Palette and it was fine.</li>
            <li>Palette and that one was fine.</li>
            <li>Im super excited about this product!</li>
            <li>I have a real smash box pallette that works amazing, was hoping for a cheaper deal.</li>
            <li>Fabulous colors.</li>
            <li>The cases look cheap quality ...</li>
            <li>When I ordered this I was excited since I tried ordering 3 knock-off versions like this on another site and they never came.</li>
            <li>I must say they are very cheaply made never they easily pop off but still decent.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just a mirror tape to keep it clean</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, I honestly love these so much already, haven&#x27;t tried them yet</li>
            <li>I will say the colors are true to the picture</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars because the main one I wanted the most was the &amp;#34;Naked 3&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I own all the naked pallets</li>
            <li>I tested again on my hand and wipes right off.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping</li>
            <li>First, this was supposed to come May 22nd</li>
            <li>Buy this if you&#x27;re willing to take the risk.</li>
            <li>but they look so much like the real deal.</li>
            <li>I knew this was a knock off, I didn&#x27;t expect this to be the real pallets.</li>
            <li>I say save your money for the real thing ladies.</li>
            <li>it looks like the real deal</li>
            <li>Not the real deal.  </li>
            <li>So far I have tried the naked 1 and 2 pallets so far and an absolutely loving the colors.</li>
            <li>I have another naked dupe (different brand/company) and the colors go on pretty easy.</li>
            <li>The colors are soo similar to the real ones!</li>
            <li>; Palette and it was completely wrecked, then I opened the &amp;#34;Naked 3&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Oh did I mention they were delivered three weeks early.</li>
            <li>Came to me with a couple of the colors cracked and dirty but other than that they are perfect</li>
            <li>However I am extremely disappointed in the quality of the actual eye shadows, (the brushes are nice,) but after many attempts to apply any color it did not stay.</li>
            <li>No the naked pattlet 1 was damaged.. and the other naked 2 was not like the original...</li>
            <li>One star because the second one was completely shattered.</li>
            <li>Two of the tins also have a weird smell very common in cheap make-up or old make-up which kind of concerns me.</li>

            <li> First, this was supposed to come May 22nd and today is only May 18!! So that&#x27;s a star&lt;br /&gt;Second, I honestly love these so much already, haven&#x27;t tried them yet but they look so much like the real deal. One problem is the first pallet&#x27;s mirror came broken but that&#x27;s okay because I won&#x27;t use that mirror anyways! Here are some pictures of each one ! Also don&#x27;t mind the other two dirty mirrors , it&#x27;s just a mirror tape to keep it clean</li>
            <li> I knew this was a knock off, I didn&#x27;t expect this to be the real pallets. However I am extremely disappointed in the quality of the actual eye shadows, (the brushes are nice,) but after many attempts to apply any color it did not stay. I tested again on my hand and wipes right off. I have a real smash box pallette that works amazing, was hoping for a cheaper deal. I actually threw these away and kept the brushes. The shadows are not even the quality that you would find at a drug store in a small pallette by Maybelline or covergirl. I say save your money for the real thing ladies.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering again. This product came in perfect condition it looks like the real deal even the pigmentation is great. It took about 3 weeks to come in all I can say is I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this before purchasing and they were fairly good. I will say the colors are true to the picture but they go on fainter than I expected. I have another naked dupe (different brand/company) and the colors go on pretty easy. I use an eye shadow primer but I still find that I have to really cake the eye shadow on to get good coverage. Depending on the kind of looking you&#x27;re going for, this could be a problem. Two of the tins also have a weird smell very common in cheap make-up or old make-up which kind of concerns me.</li>
            <li> No the naked pattlet 1 was damaged.. and the other naked 2 was not like the original...</li>
            <li> When I ordered this I was excited since I tried ordering 3 knock-off versions like this on another site and they never came. When they arrived i opened the &amp;#34;Naked 1&amp;#34; Palette 1st and it was fine. Then I proceeded to open the &amp;#34;Naked 2&amp;#34; Palette and it was completely wrecked, then I opened the &amp;#34;Naked 3&amp;#34; Palette and it was fine. I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars because the main one I wanted the most was the &amp;#34;Naked 3&amp;#34; Palette and that one was fine. For the price I&#x27;m willing to deal with throwing out the shattered one, even though I know how to fix broken eyeshadows it is to o messed up for me to fix. Buy this if you&#x27;re willing to take the risk.</li>
            <li> Fabulous colors. Beautiful price.</li>
            <li> One star because the second one was completely shattered. Everything! And the third ones mirror is cracked!</li>
            <li> Came to me with a couple of the colors cracked and dirty but other than that they are perfect</li>
            <li> The colors are soo similar to the real ones! It&#x27;s a steal!</li>
            <li> Ok.  Not the real deal.  But, 36 colors for 40 bucks great.</li>
            <li> they are not original .. The cases look cheap quality ... They are fake ! But the colors are nice !</li>
            <li> Love it! Use it almost every day!</li>
            <li> So far I have tried the naked 1 and 2 pallets so far and an absolutely loving the colors. I&#x27;m light browned skin and the colors look beautiful on my skin tone. For these to be knock off the colors are pigmented enough for me. Will definitely buy again. Even the brushes are fairly nice. I must say they are very cheaply made never they easily pop off but still decent. Oh did I mention they were delivered three weeks early. I honestly can say def worth every penny</li>
            <li> I initially bought these in a rush think it was urban decay the real naked but I shortly figure out I was wrong.they were the worst in the world at all pretty colors and pretty pigmented. Def. Going to buy the real kind.</li>
            <li> Came before expected, only took 2 weeks maybe. Only one shadow was a little roughed up. But all 3 for that price? Couldn&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> last all day use with primer</li>
            <li> Im super excited about this product! Great price and they are amazing! Super fast shipping i got it in less than a week and i wasnt expecting it for a couple more weeks! I recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my pallet. Minimal fallout. I own all the naked pallets and I&#x27;m very pleased with these. They work equally as well if not better. My only issue is the brush broke and I was issued a 30% refund on my purchase to compensate for my broken brush</li>
