            <li>It works great!</li>

            <li>This product worked great for relieving my son&#x27;s cradle cap.</li>
            <li>though it is great.</li>
            <li>Amazing !</li>
            <li>but the difference is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so impressed and glad that I made the investment.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good reviews.</li>
            <li>it is good for baby massages.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy that I did my own research and decided to buy this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I just felt the need to share how pleased I am already with the results!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any flakes and the irritated areas seem either gone or dramatically better!</li>
            <li>My son&#x27;s cradle cap looked better immediately and was gone for good within a week.</li>
            <li>The product is very strong in smell and leaves the hair greasy.</li>
            <li>Worked great first time!</li>
            <li>Works ok, but the fragrance is very strong</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love about this product?</li>
            <li>son&#x27;s cradle cap has gotten better but it could just be a coincidence.  </li>
            <li>Smells better than most items for cradle cap.</li>
            <li>Very impressed with the amount of dry skin/cradle cap came off after one application!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This works wonders and is really easy to use.  </li>
            <li>She loves it and her daughters little bald-ish head looks beautiful!</li>
            <li>I also bought the Bean B Clean Baby Scalp Massaging brush.</li>
            <li>The oil smells great and is nice and thick so it doesn&#x27;t drip everywhere.</li>
            <li>I think we washed his head in it once a day for about 4-5 days before we saw a real improvement, but once it was mostly gone, it stayed gone</li>
            <li>At first it smells fine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gentle product that easily washes out with baby shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Finally I decided to do some research of my own and I came across this product and</li>
            <li>The only down side I can say is it doesn&#x27;t smell wonderful.</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a gift for a friend of mine who had her first baby 8 months ago.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I have used that treats his cradle cap and moisturized his head.</li>
            <li>So I was doing that and also gently massaging his head with a bristle brush.</li>
            <li>She still thanks me for this all of the time.</li>
            <li>This did not do much to help my son&#x27;s cradle cap.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>I was really upset that the pediatrician didn&#x27;t mention any shampoo to get rid of it.</li>
            <li>After 2 treatments no more flakes, just a smooth and sweet baby head!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve used it enough to write a full review, but also this isn&#x27;t the type of product anyone would use all the time.  </li>
            <li>However, I highly recommend this produce even though the price is a bit steep.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural, and it works!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li>I ordered it after I noticed my daughter&#x27;s head began getting early signs of cradle cap.</li>
            <li>it seems all natural....</li>
            <li>Only way to fix is wash it completely out!</li>
            <li>My baby has had a moderate case of cradle cap since he was 2 months old.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve only completed on application so far</li>
            <li>My son has had cradle cap and an excessively dry scalp since he was about 2 months old.</li>

            <li> My son has had cradle cap and an excessively dry scalp since he was about 2 months old.</li>
            <li> Cradle cap used to be very serious with our little one, but this product cleared it up nicely.</li>
            <li> Will used every few days until completely clear.</li>
            <li> his scalp is dry and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Rub it in, leave it on for a while, brush the baby&#x27;s head with a soft brush, then wash as usual.  </li>
            <li> His cradle cap was completely gone in less than a week!!</li>
            <li> My poor baby&#x27;s scalp had become so dry and irritated that I just slopped lotion on it to calm her scalp down one morning.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, you are just left with an oily mess.</li>
            <li> The other products seemed to help some flakes come off, but not treat the root of it, a dry scalp.</li>
            <li> The product is oil-based, so the only complaint is that after washing our baby&#x27;s hair with it, it left a slightly greasy residue on his hair.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend to anyone whose little one it suffering from cradle cap!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way nicer than any other product I&#x27;ve seen</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Got rid of my baby&#x27;s cradle cap in less than a week.</li>
            <li> A little would come off</li>
            <li> I would massage a little into his scalp while he was in the bath tub, let it sit for a few minutes and then shampoo over it.  </li>
            <li> Used Hip Peas Cradle Cap Care just twice and my baby, who has a very thick head of hair, had no signs of cradle cap after the second application.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put a few drops on his head before bed bc</li>
            <li> It gets the cradle crap right out after a few washes.</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work ok, but smells quite terribly after it being on the baby&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> No more itchies for my baby boy !</li>
            <li> but after a while it soaks in (even after washing it off), the remaining oils must create a nasty odor that I would have to warn people about while holding my sweet baby :(</li>

            <li> What&#x27;s not to love about this product? It&#x27;s natural, and it works! It cleared up our baby&#x27;s cradle cap within a week or two of use. The product is oil-based, so the only complaint is that after washing our baby&#x27;s hair with it, it left a slightly greasy residue on his hair. This is a trivial concern because the product works! Cradle cap used to be very serious with our little one, but this product cleared it up nicely. I would definitely recommend to anyone whose little one it suffering from cradle cap!</li>
            <li> Very impressed with the amount of dry skin/cradle cap came off after one application!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend doing before bath time. The product is very strong in smell and leaves the hair greasy. Only way to fix is wash it completely out!</li>
            <li> Great stuff! My baby has had a moderate case of cradle cap since he was 2 months old. His pediatrician recommended that I try rubbing in olive oil to get rid of it. So I was doing that and also gently massaging his head with a bristle brush. A little would come off but I could never get rid of it. Finally I decided to do some research of my own and I came across this product and it&#x27;s good reviews. I also bought the Bean B Clean Baby Scalp Massaging brush. Those two products combined did the trick! His cradle cap was completely gone in less than a week!! Very happy mama.</li>
            <li> Works Great! It got rid of my daughters cradle cap after just a couple uses!</li>
            <li> I only used this a handful of times. I would massage a little into his scalp while he was in the bath tub, let it sit for a few minutes and then shampoo over it.  I like that it&#x27;s not overly greasy and it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son&#x27;s cradle cap has gotten better but it could just be a coincidence.  I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve used it enough to write a full review, but also this isn&#x27;t the type of product anyone would use all the time.  Overall I do recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> I did what the directions said and it was gone in a week. I put a few drops on his head before bed bc his scalp is dry and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Great product! Got rid of my baby&#x27;s cradle cap in less than a week. Follow the directions and it works like a charm. Very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for a friend of mine who had her first baby 8 months ago. She still thanks me for this all of the time. She loves it and her daughters little bald-ish head looks beautiful!</li>
            <li> Works ok, but the fragrance is very strong</li>
            <li> This did not do much to help my son&#x27;s cradle cap.  I was pretty disappointed.  I would not recommend this to friends.</li>
            <li> Smells great, works great, and once the cradle cap is gone it is good for baby massages.</li>
            <li> This works wonders and is really easy to use.  Rub it in, leave it on for a while, brush the baby&#x27;s head with a soft brush, then wash as usual.  My son&#x27;s cradle cap looked better immediately and was gone for good within a week.</li>
            <li> The oil smells great and is nice and thick so it doesn&#x27;t drip everywhere.</li>
            <li> My son has had cradle cap and an excessively dry scalp since he was about 2 months old. He is 13 months now and we have tried everything. The other products seemed to help some flakes come off, but not treat the root of it, a dry scalp. This is the first product I have used that treats his cradle cap and moisturized his head. Amazing ! No more itchies for my baby boy ! Thank you so much</li>
            <li> I purchased this locally after trying baby oil daily and making a baking soda paste. My poor baby&#x27;s scalp had become so dry and irritated that I just slopped lotion on it to calm her scalp down one morning. After that, I found out about this product and I&#x27;ve only completed on application so far but the difference is AMAZING! I just felt the need to share how pleased I am already with the results! I don&#x27;t see any flakes and the irritated areas seem either gone or dramatically better! I&#x27;m so impressed and glad that I made the investment.</li>
            <li> This product worked great for relieving my son&#x27;s cradle cap. I think we washed his head in it once a day for about 4-5 days before we saw a real improvement, but once it was mostly gone, it stayed gone and I still have a ton of the oil left should it come back. A side note to consider: follow the directions on the bottle. You will need to scrub his head, then apply the oil and rub that in, then wash it out with your regular baby shampoo. Otherwise, you are just left with an oily mess. However, I highly recommend this produce even though the price is a bit steep. It&#x27;s way nicer than any other product I&#x27;ve seen and it&#x27;s all natural so that&#x27;s another plus!</li>
            <li> I ordered it after I noticed my daughter&#x27;s head began getting early signs of cradle cap. After 2 treatments no more flakes, just a smooth and sweet baby head!</li>
            <li> Seems to work ok, but smells quite terribly after it being on the baby&#x27;s head. At first it smells fine but after a while it soaks in (even after washing it off), the remaining oils must create a nasty odor that I would have to warn people about while holding my sweet baby :(</li>
            <li> I like the product bc it seems all natural.... But it does leave the hair oily even with washing it a couple of times.. I suggest for babies with no hair</li>
            <li> Worked perfect. I used this on my daughter three times and it has been a month since I used it and her cradle cap has yet to return. The only down side I can say is it doesn&#x27;t smell wonderful. Other than that though it is great.</li>
            <li> It gets the cradle crap right out after a few washes. I was really upset that the pediatrician didn&#x27;t mention any shampoo to get rid of it. I&#x27;m happy that I did my own research and decided to buy this shampoo. It works great! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Worked great first time! Smells better than most items for cradle cap. Will used every few days until completely clear.</li>
