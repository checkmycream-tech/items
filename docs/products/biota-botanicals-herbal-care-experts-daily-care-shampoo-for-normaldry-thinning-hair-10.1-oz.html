    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I order like 3 in advance because this shampoo is amazing!!!</li>
            <li>VERY happy with this purchase</li>
            <li>Great stuff!</li>
            <li>I was ecstatically impressed!!!!!</li>
            <li>My wife really is impressed with its results</li>
            <li>HAPPY HAPPY!!</li>
            <li>great shampoo.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell that great while using it, but no lingering smell.  </li>
            <li>Iam so happy.</li>
            <li>Works great for all hair types.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Biota is a great hair product period</li>
            <li>What a joy this shampoo is.  </li>
            <li>I just haven&#x27;t been all that happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>Biota Botanicals Bioxsine Series Shampoo for Thinning Hair is amazing - I&#x27;m so happy I tried it!!!!</li>
            <li>I am cursed with no so great genes, both in the hair department and health department.  </li>
            <li>Just amazing!</li>
            <li>The nurse commented how nice it smells!</li>
            <li>Thoroughly wetting my hair for a minute or two loosened and rinsed away styling product residue  prepared my hair and scalp for the pleasant herbal scented shampoo.</li>
            <li>I plan to continue to use both Biota products along with a very good conditioner, as I believe more hair will continue to fill in.  </li>
            <li>That aside, using it has been a good experience for me.</li>
            <li>My hair looks really good since I have been using it.</li>
            <li>Rumors still exist that I was the originator of &#x27;morning hair&#x27; and for good reason.  </li>
            <li>It has gotten a good reception in this household.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so great to  be able to just shampoo and go again and</li>
            <li>great and lthe rest of my hair is thicker and more manageable.</li>
            <li>but it sure gives a great shine and softness to my hair.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, shampoo smells like nutmeg and the conditioner smells like bananas!</li>
            <li>Thicker, more volume!</li>
            <li>Love them both!</li>
            <li>My wife tried it and liked it also</li>
            <li>Had a nice smell to it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This formula does have some good herbal ingredients but it also contains many things that I don&#x27;t know what they are.</li>
            <li>Nice shampoo.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, it really is a nice product, and it may even improve the hair and scalp of some users.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is alright and it makes a nice lather.</li>
            <li>This product has helped me quite a bit to be honest.</li>
            <li>As of 2 weeks, my hair feels nice</li>
            <li>I think it smells nice too.</li>
            <li>I must say I liked the shampoo</li>
            <li>The best part for me (besides the new growth) is the smell.</li>
            <li>So, it&#x27;s very easy for me to see if my hair is \\&quot;thicker\\&quot; or if I have any areas that are beginning to grow hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>as far as a shampoo she says its one of the best, she feels her hair has never been cleaner and does not need conditioner.</li>
            <li>Maximum Strength (which is honestly nothing more than folic acid and B6).</li>
            <li>The shampoo itself smells ok; sort of a &#x27;warm&#x27; herbal odor.</li>
            <li>The job it did on my mom’s hair was more than nice.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and falls out by the handful.</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell or if it does even have an odor it is very light since I couldn&#x27;t smell</li>
            <li>However, they tell you what “most people” say they see.</li>
            <li>This is from their website:&lt;br /&gt;“Most</li>
            <li>but I did get most of it.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>we will continue to buy this and hope things get better</li>
            <li>so I added the serum because my hair is relaxed and below my shoulders and it needs all the help it can get to grow even more.</li>
            <li>Gives my hair more body and lift.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in growth and haven&#x27;t seemingly lost any more hair, which had stabilized before trying this product.  </li>
            <li>Now I have more hair .</li>
            <li>I have thinning hair (but it’s mostly because of genes) and</li>
            <li>The box indicated I would get better results if I paired this with the serum.</li>
            <li>In fact, it looks better now than my hair did before the chlorine damage.  </li>
            <li>The package recommends using a serum along with it so that may help with seeing more benefits.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying another item and am seeing more results.</li>
            <li>My thinning crown&#x27;s breakage looks better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would’ve</li>
            <li>And more and more seems to find it&#x27;s way in the sink or on the comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I won&#x27;t get your hopes up that you&#x27;ll start growing any more hair.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Just wish it could work its magic and stop the thinning hair.</li>
            <li>It might still be safe, it might not be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I bought this product because it claims to give your hair more volume.</li>
            <li>This product is great, it smells good, and definitely works...!</li>
            <li>I have finally found something that will save me from becoming bald!!!!  </li>
            <li>Hair all over the place on the top of my head and not a speck in place.  </li>
            <li>I think it’s better now.</li>
            <li>in!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed but at the same time I wonder if it could be the scalp massage more than the shampoo that is doing it.</li>
            <li>I hope it will continue to stimulate even more</li>
            <li>I LOVE that smell!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It will probably take some more time to know for sure.  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I love it.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s something to think more about.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s magic..</li>
            <li>It matters to the one using it more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The shampoo foams up nicely and rinses cleanly.</li>
            <li>Not so much it stands out or others have commented, but I wish it had a bit of more pleasant scent to it.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo has a nice, mild fragrance to it.</li>
            <li>fast delivery and good price&lt;</li>
            <li>I can breath easy again.</li>
            <li>My biggest worry upon ordering this was there would be a strong chemical smell, or it would burn or hurt my scalp.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used sulfur solutions, both pre-made and my own DIY, and while they are good, this stuff is terrific, and smells</li>
            <li>shampoo has a mellow scent that isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li>it’s fine.  </li>
            <li>It used to be that I&#x27;d go and get my hair cut and always be told &#x27;You have fine hair, but a lot of it&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I have fine, color treated hair.</li>
            <li>It really sounded too good to be true.</li>
            <li>It says safe for treated hair and men and women, but does not state pregnant or nursing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fragrance is actually light and pleasant, and no allergic reactions so far.</li>
            <li>There are some fantastic beach sprays that &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; your hair up too.</li>
            <li>but this aint cheap .</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC Product.  </li>
            <li>is an important part of my look.  </li>
            <li>It sort of has a light herbal smell.</li>
            <li>of the women in my family have experienced age related thinning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gentle nice shampoo</li>
            <li>It looks goopy, but the scent is light and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish it was sulfate free.</li>
            <li>instructions included are for both the shampoo and the serum, which they warn will darken light hair.</li>
            <li>I looked it up and the primary documents state that the &amp;#34;bioxsine&amp;#34; has no meaning apart from its use on the product.</li>
            <li>I am currently on my second bottle of the Biota shampoo and am still happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Either way, I&#x27;m thrilled about getting some new hair in!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a good, general shampoo, but I don’t feel it helped my thinning hair at all.</li>
            <li>The more natural a shampoo is, the more comfortable I am using it.</li>
            <li>So far I am very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>It lathers up well and rinses cleanly.</li>
            <li>but it did make my hair feel rejuvinated and clean.</li>
            <li>It does a god job cleaning my hair and stimulating my scalp, I even let the shampoo clean my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>The smell scent is ok JUST There is TOO MUCH OF It.</li>
            <li>I saw it a while back at CVS and read that it was good for thinning hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>- I don&#x27;t think I have used it enough to notice a tremendous difference in hair volume but its a good product and</li>
            <li>My hair was shinier from the first use and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;For now, pregnant women and nursing women, stay away.</li>
            <li>A meaningful improvement  of my decently cared for skin and hair would be almost a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried so many before, would highly recommend this shampoo, also the conditioner.</li>
            <li>tried the Biota and it lathered nicely, my hair looked clean and soft, so no weird issues there.</li>
            <li>blonde/silver 67 yo and my hair is much thicker, shines and is super easy to style.  </li>
            <li>After just two shampoos my hair is softer and definitely fuller and my blond highlights have never looked better!  </li>
            <li>I will finish the bottle but right now feel the harshness won&#x27;t be good for my hair in the long run.</li>
            <li>In terms of how well it works, after having used BIOTA BOTANICALS BIOXSINE SHAMPOO for almost five weeks, my hair does feel fuller and with slightly more volume than it did when I used my old shampoo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it just for that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be aware that if you are pregnant or nursing, you are advised against using this.  </li>
            <li>From the very first use, I liked it as a general shampoo because my hair felt clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>However, although BIOTA BOTANICALS BIOXSINE SHAMPOO does seem to offer some help in giving “life” back to one’s hair, I probably will not buy any of it because of the very strong distinct smell it has.</li>
            <li>Medicine smell means it&#x27;s working, right?  </li>
            <li>I noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I would use this right after I had my hair highlighted for that reason.</li>
            <li>like it and give it four stars as a shampoo to clean my hair, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in how much hair I have.  </li>
            <li>That’s not a “bad” thing (though some certainly might not like it). . . .</li>
            <li>I used both the serun and shampoo for 6 months and was nothing but amazed at how my top, crown, and top back head-hair problem areas have mostly filled back in, and I&#x27;m in my 50s.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t attest at this point to the many results that this shampoo claims such as thicker, faster growing hair or less shedding, but I can say that this is some very nice shampoo.</li>
            <li>Only time will tell to see if its claims for helping stop hair loss is accurate; meanwhile, it&#x27;s a good shampoo that doesn&#x27;t hurt and may actually help.</li>
            <li>This is a very “unusual” smelling shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo!</li>
            <li>the first use with this product</li>
            <li>owever, at the price, it&#x27;s not any more than a regular quality shampoo, so,</li>
            <li>After the third day of use, two people commented, “I can see the top of your head.”  </li>
            <li>First of all is the “aroma”.  </li>
            <li>The folks at Biota are pretty darn</li>
            <li>The color had me put off at first, but I got used to it</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>So after using it for the first time and after drying and setting my hair</li>
            <li>The shampoo is affordable enough to have a go by itself and see if it provides more body.</li>
            <li>hair looked thicker after the first shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks Biota Botanicals!</li>
            <li>( I visually scanned over 5,000 characters and not one satisfied the question.  </li>
            <li>First think I noticed is the look.&lt;br /&gt;Looks and reminds me of motor oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He was worried at first because the shampoo comes out of the bottle colored brown.  </li>
            <li>Must admit that my washed and dried hair  felt silky good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is intended to accompany the Biota Bioxsine Serum, which is a fair bit more expensive.</li>
            <li>I do use my own conditioner after, but on the occasions I have used only the shampoo, my hair has felt soft after.</li>
            <li>was wondering how long you are supposed to use this before you see results, so I went to their website for more information.</li>
            <li>not sure yet how good this stuff works my barber recommended it&lt;br</li>
            <li>As we all know, if you can reduce the shedding enough, your new hair growth will catch up and you&#x27;ll be able to (hopefully) maintain what you have.</li>
            <li>I had to get a mirror out and check and sure enough there are new hairs coming</li>
            <li>But since results can take much longer, I will keep using it until my bottle is finished and will update this review if I notice any improvement.</li>
            <li>All I really care about is if it works &amp; it does seem to make my hair healthier.  </li>
            <li>My hair, is really shiny.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t really tell if its working....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about ready to give up on the product just because of the shampoo.</li>
            <li>fast shipping, this shampoo really works, I was thininnig .</li>
            <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I recommend it as a shampoo -</li>
            <li>Very noticeable.</li>
            <li>(though not so much I&#x27;m out of the placebo effect zone).  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for almost a month now and have not seen much of in improvement as of yet.</li>
            <li>this product really works.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a miracle cure by any means, but it DOES help and for that I&#x27;m very thankful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s VERY noticeable.</li>
            <li>It took about 2 weeks to see a real difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I posted  the same detailed response in the Q&amp;A section for this product.</li>
            <li>VERY Brown.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t seen a whole lot of change.</li>
            <li>many words, but the purpose is to say not much has changed except now</li>
            <li>It turned my natural blonde hair more of a henna hue.</li>
            <li>I suggest using a really good conditioner after shampooing that you leave in at least 10-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>I have a shampoo that has superior results and leaves my hair full-bodied that stays in place all day and even into the following morning.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m aware that I most likely have not used this long enough to determine whether it actually provides good results.  </li>
            <li>Most of the other products simply provide clean, unruly hair, especially since it is so fine to begin with.  </li>
            <li>I have been seeking that just right shampoo for all those old fibers growing out of my scalp and this just might be the one.  </li>
            <li>More so than with other volumizing shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I will look for other products that promise relief from thinning hair but seem more geared toward women.</li>
            <li>see that is hair is better conditioned but not any of the other effects.  </li>
            <li>My hair shedding has increased markedly with age, and at this point I am willing to try anything.  </li>
            <li>My hair does seem a little thicker, though it isn&#x27;t growing faster, which, since I am wearing a short pixie haircut is a good thing.</li>
            <li>My hair is thinning so I am always ready to try a new product to make my hair feel fuller</li>
            <li>In light of all the good reviews, I decided to purchase this product and give it a try since I was desperate for a remedy for my thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>My wife is currently breastfeeding but there is a warning on the box that says not to be used by pregnant women, or breastfeeding women.  </li>
            <li>main ingredient is bioxsine.</li>
            <li>Again, it works just fine as a shampoo, but other than that it’s really nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far it is getting a positive reception.</li>
            <li>Seeing results, slowly but surely!</li>
            <li>I think if you&#x27;re worried about hair loss vitamin E and biotin should be looked into or eat foods high in those vitamins.</li>
            <li>It does lather up really nice and rinses easily with no build up or residue left behind.</li>
            <li>My hair is in better condition now, softer, and it does feel a little thicker.</li>
            <li>Can still see the scalp a little, but it&#x27;s workable and getting better every week.</li>
            <li>The way B&#x27;iota works right now is good enough for a 5 star and any other benefits are just fluff.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It supposedly is herbal/botanical and since I normally use natural products I thought it would be a safe product to test, needless to say, I no longer think this product is safe for anyone&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Love that fluffy stuff.  </li>
            <li>Combine daily use of this with a regular dose of Biotin and this should help those out with thinning or just naturally fine hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is dyed light brown and it didn&#x27;t have any effect - good or bad - on my color.</li>
            <li>I am using it concurrently with the serum after experiencing more than normal hair loss for the past three months.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I started using this when my hair was longer than usual, but for most of the month, I&#x27;ve had it cut to about 1/4\\&quot; in length.  </li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s not obnoxiously more expensive than my regular Pantene shampoo, I might try another bottle and give it more time.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not really sure what to call it) smell of most shampoos.  </li>
            <li>you only need a very small amount for a good lather</li>
            <li>The shampoo has stopped all shedding, I wash my hair only twice a week, as my hair is long and fine.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell yet whether more hair is arriving due to this shampoo, but I do so many other things to keep my thinning hair to look less thinning</li>
            <li>I noticed less shedding in the first week of use, and the amount of shedding has been pretty consistent since about the second week.</li>
            <li>I use to wake up with hair all over my pillow, no more hair loss, my hair is more soft and thicker</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty flat after using both the shampoo and and conditioner.</li>
            <li>First I just used the shampoo for normal to dry hair.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical when I bought the shampoo and the serum, since I&#x27;ve tried so many fine and a few thinning hair shampoos, but you can notice a difference from the very first time.</li>
            <li>the product.&lt;br /&gt;Years ago a hair stylist told me ALWAYS use a CLEAR shampoo on your hair</li>
            <li>It seems to clean rather well and leaves one with a slight tingling sensation.</li>
            <li>it does leave the hair soft...</li>
            <li>got this for wife her hair is thinning, as far as a miracle hair growth potion i am unsure.</li>
            <li>I was completely panicked.  </li>
            <li>– when did I get so old???  </li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as shampoo.</li>
            <li>appreciated and preferred a corresponding Biota Conditioner, regular or leave-in, to thoroughly test and review.  </li>
            <li>far, I&#x27;m please with the Biota line.</li>
            <li>and it still made my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have been using the product regularly for about a month and my hair is already not falling out as much.</li>
            <li>I like this natural shampoo, but I can&#x27;t verify that it has all the benefits claimed.  </li>
            <li>This Biota Botanicals product offers hope for those of us with thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>It seems far too masculine for my comfort,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair loss doesn&#x27;t seem as much and the shampoo does add body to my short hair.  </li>
            <li>Wish I could have tried a whole bottle&#x27;s worth of shampooing over the course of a few weeks to see how  Biota lives up to its promises----particularly of thicker hair.</li>
            <li>I used my own volumizing conditioner which may have decreased rather than enhanced Biota Bioxsine results.</li>
            <li>Been using it now for about 2 weeks and have seen a difference in my hair, its a lot more thick and looks healthier.</li>
            <li>I use this daily at the top of my head (putting other organic shampoo on the back of my head).  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I am used to seeing white or light colored shampoo and this is a dark colored shampoo.</li>
            <li>When I first poured this on my hand I hesitated because it&#x27;s a deep, deep brown color.</li>
            <li>special brushes, no hair dryers or curling irons, no harsh chemicals, yet one use of this shampoo caused me to lose more hairs than I normally do in 10 days, that is how bad it was for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shampoo has a slightly medicinal fragrance but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>My first and only use of the shampoo was a terrible experience, it left my hair looking and feeling dry and damaged, even a double dose of conditioner after shampooing only helped a little, and my hair was actually very nice looking before I used the shampoo as I consider it my best feature</li>
            <li>my hair looks so much better without all that other stuff weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>I needed something that would allow my scalp to calm down and heal.</li>
            <li>I bought a 2 month supply and I have new hair growing in already, only after 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>asking our doctor, they said they always put these warnings on products because there is no data to what happens to nursing or pregnant women who use them because no pregnant or nursing woman is willing to be a test subject.  </li>
            <li>The smell is a clean medicinal smell that lasts for a small amount of time after you use it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it does everything it says, I haven&#x27;t noted those improvements, but as a general shampoo, I like it.</li>
            <li>I can barely see my scalp in those areas anymore.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve definitely have notice new growth in area&#x27;s where I was starting to go bald.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t believe the ads, this stuff doesn&#x27;t work like a lot of other products that want to capitalize on those of us dealing with hair loss at a certain time in life....</li>
            <li>Turned my beautiful white thin hair dull tan color...will not us anymore</li>
            <li>My scalp was very tender and eczema due developing severe sensitivity to Wen conditioner and oil products that I&#x27;d using for three years.</li>
            <li>This product smells a little funny</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little early yet to really see how well this ultimately functions.  </li>
            <li>BIOTA BOTANICALS BIOXSINE SHAMPOO is a shampoo that is supposed to be used for people with normal or dry hair and can possibly help people with thinning hair.</li>
            <li>Biota Botanicals Bioxsine Series Shampoo for Thinning Hair for Normal and Dry Hair, 10.1 Fluid Ounce&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;6 weeks later,  the sparse areas are barely noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can’t tell if it’s doing anything yet, because I dyed my hair not long before I began using Biota.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really was a let down.</li>
            <li>Although advertised almost as a natural product but there are a lot of ingredients that are not natural (PEGS) and such.</li>
            <li>But not only was it a waste of my money, but after the first use, it caused a lot of my hair to fall out.  </li>
            <li>Its dark brown shampoo that&#x27;s highly fragranced and it seems to add junk to my scalp like build up.</li>
            <li>I have fine thinning hair and a sad little bald spot on the crown of my head - nothing huge but still extremely noticeable (to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I was ecstatically impressed!!!!!</li>
            <li> My wife really is impressed with its results</li>
            <li> HAPPY HAPPY!!</li>
            <li> great shampoo.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell that great while using it, but no lingering smell.  </li>
            <li> Iam so happy.</li>
            <li> Works great for all hair types.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Biota is a great hair product period</li>
            <li> What a joy this shampoo is.  </li>
            <li> I just haven&#x27;t been all that happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> Biota Botanicals Bioxsine Series Shampoo for Thinning Hair is amazing - I&#x27;m so happy I tried it!!!!</li>
            <li> I am cursed with no so great genes, both in the hair department and health department.  </li>
            <li> Just amazing!</li>
            <li> The nurse commented how nice it smells!</li>
            <li> Thoroughly wetting my hair for a minute or two loosened and rinsed away styling product residue  prepared my hair and scalp for the pleasant herbal scented shampoo.</li>
            <li> I plan to continue to use both Biota products along with a very good conditioner, as I believe more hair will continue to fill in.  </li>
            <li> That aside, using it has been a good experience for me.</li>
            <li> My hair looks really good since I have been using it.</li>
            <li> Rumors still exist that I was the originator of &#x27;morning hair&#x27; and for good reason.  </li>
            <li> It has gotten a good reception in this household.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so great to  be able to just shampoo and go again and</li>
            <li> great and lthe rest of my hair is thicker and more manageable.</li>
            <li> but it sure gives a great shine and softness to my hair.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, shampoo smells like nutmeg and the conditioner smells like bananas!</li>
            <li> Thicker, more volume!</li>
            <li> Love them both!</li>
            <li> My wife tried it and liked it also</li>
            <li> Had a nice smell to it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This formula does have some good herbal ingredients but it also contains many things that I don&#x27;t know what they are.</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, it really is a nice product, and it may even improve the hair and scalp of some users.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is alright and it makes a nice lather.</li>
            <li> This product has helped me quite a bit to be honest.</li>
            <li> As of 2 weeks, my hair feels nice</li>
            <li> I think it smells nice too.</li>
            <li> I must say I liked the shampoo</li>
            <li> The best part for me (besides the new growth) is the smell.</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s very easy for me to see if my hair is \\&quot;thicker\\&quot; or if I have any areas that are beginning to grow hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> as far as a shampoo she says its one of the best, she feels her hair has never been cleaner and does not need conditioner.</li>
            <li> Maximum Strength (which is honestly nothing more than folic acid and B6).</li>
            <li> The shampoo itself smells ok; sort of a &#x27;warm&#x27; herbal odor.</li>
            <li> The job it did on my mom’s hair was more than nice.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and falls out by the handful.</li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell or if it does even have an odor it is very light since I couldn&#x27;t smell</li>
            <li> However, they tell you what “most people” say they see.</li>
            <li> This is from their website:&lt;br /&gt;“Most</li>
            <li> but I did get most of it.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> we will continue to buy this and hope things get better</li>
            <li> so I added the serum because my hair is relaxed and below my shoulders and it needs all the help it can get to grow even more.</li>
            <li> Gives my hair more body and lift.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in growth and haven&#x27;t seemingly lost any more hair, which had stabilized before trying this product.  </li>
            <li> Now I have more hair .</li>
            <li> I have thinning hair (but it’s mostly because of genes) and</li>
            <li> The box indicated I would get better results if I paired this with the serum.</li>
            <li> In fact, it looks better now than my hair did before the chlorine damage.  </li>
            <li> The package recommends using a serum along with it so that may help with seeing more benefits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying another item and am seeing more results.</li>
            <li> My thinning crown&#x27;s breakage looks better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would’ve</li>
            <li> And more and more seems to find it&#x27;s way in the sink or on the comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I won&#x27;t get your hopes up that you&#x27;ll start growing any more hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Just wish it could work its magic and stop the thinning hair.</li>
            <li> It might still be safe, it might not be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I bought this product because it claims to give your hair more volume.</li>
            <li> This product is great, it smells good, and definitely works...!</li>
            <li> I have finally found something that will save me from becoming bald!!!!  </li>
            <li> Hair all over the place on the top of my head and not a speck in place.  </li>
            <li> I think it’s better now.</li>
            <li> in!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed but at the same time I wonder if it could be the scalp massage more than the shampoo that is doing it.</li>
            <li> I hope it will continue to stimulate even more</li>
            <li> I LOVE that smell!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will probably take some more time to know for sure.  </li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I love it.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s something to think more about.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s magic..</li>
            <li> It matters to the one using it more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shampoo foams up nicely and rinses cleanly.</li>
            <li> Not so much it stands out or others have commented, but I wish it had a bit of more pleasant scent to it.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo has a nice, mild fragrance to it.</li>
            <li> fast delivery and good price&lt;</li>
            <li> I can breath easy again.</li>
            <li> My biggest worry upon ordering this was there would be a strong chemical smell, or it would burn or hurt my scalp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used sulfur solutions, both pre-made and my own DIY, and while they are good, this stuff is terrific, and smells</li>
            <li> shampoo has a mellow scent that isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li> it’s fine.  </li>
            <li> It used to be that I&#x27;d go and get my hair cut and always be told &#x27;You have fine hair, but a lot of it&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I have fine, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> It really sounded too good to be true.</li>
            <li> It says safe for treated hair and men and women, but does not state pregnant or nursing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fragrance is actually light and pleasant, and no allergic reactions so far.</li>
            <li> There are some fantastic beach sprays that &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; your hair up too.</li>
            <li> but this aint cheap .</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC Product.  </li>
            <li> is an important part of my look.  </li>
            <li> It sort of has a light herbal smell.</li>
            <li> of the women in my family have experienced age related thinning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gentle nice shampoo</li>
            <li> It looks goopy, but the scent is light and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish it was sulfate free.</li>
            <li> instructions included are for both the shampoo and the serum, which they warn will darken light hair.</li>
            <li> I looked it up and the primary documents state that the &amp;#34;bioxsine&amp;#34; has no meaning apart from its use on the product.</li>
            <li> I am currently on my second bottle of the Biota shampoo and am still happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Either way, I&#x27;m thrilled about getting some new hair in!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a good, general shampoo, but I don’t feel it helped my thinning hair at all.</li>
            <li> The more natural a shampoo is, the more comfortable I am using it.</li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li> It lathers up well and rinses cleanly.</li>
            <li> but it did make my hair feel rejuvinated and clean.</li>
            <li> It does a god job cleaning my hair and stimulating my scalp, I even let the shampoo clean my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> The smell scent is ok JUST There is TOO MUCH OF It.</li>
            <li> I saw it a while back at CVS and read that it was good for thinning hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> - I don&#x27;t think I have used it enough to notice a tremendous difference in hair volume but its a good product and</li>
            <li> My hair was shinier from the first use and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;For now, pregnant women and nursing women, stay away.</li>
            <li> A meaningful improvement  of my decently cared for skin and hair would be almost a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried so many before, would highly recommend this shampoo, also the conditioner.</li>
            <li> tried the Biota and it lathered nicely, my hair looked clean and soft, so no weird issues there.</li>
            <li> blonde/silver 67 yo and my hair is much thicker, shines and is super easy to style.  </li>
            <li> After just two shampoos my hair is softer and definitely fuller and my blond highlights have never looked better!  </li>
            <li> I will finish the bottle but right now feel the harshness won&#x27;t be good for my hair in the long run.</li>
            <li> In terms of how well it works, after having used BIOTA BOTANICALS BIOXSINE SHAMPOO for almost five weeks, my hair does feel fuller and with slightly more volume than it did when I used my old shampoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it just for that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be aware that if you are pregnant or nursing, you are advised against using this.  </li>
            <li> From the very first use, I liked it as a general shampoo because my hair felt clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> However, although BIOTA BOTANICALS BIOXSINE SHAMPOO does seem to offer some help in giving “life” back to one’s hair, I probably will not buy any of it because of the very strong distinct smell it has.</li>
            <li> Medicine smell means it&#x27;s working, right?  </li>
            <li> I noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I would use this right after I had my hair highlighted for that reason.</li>
            <li> like it and give it four stars as a shampoo to clean my hair, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in how much hair I have.  </li>
            <li> That’s not a “bad” thing (though some certainly might not like it). . . .</li>
            <li> I used both the serun and shampoo for 6 months and was nothing but amazed at how my top, crown, and top back head-hair problem areas have mostly filled back in, and I&#x27;m in my 50s.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t attest at this point to the many results that this shampoo claims such as thicker, faster growing hair or less shedding, but I can say that this is some very nice shampoo.</li>
            <li> Only time will tell to see if its claims for helping stop hair loss is accurate; meanwhile, it&#x27;s a good shampoo that doesn&#x27;t hurt and may actually help.</li>
            <li> This is a very “unusual” smelling shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo!</li>
            <li> the first use with this product</li>
            <li> owever, at the price, it&#x27;s not any more than a regular quality shampoo, so,</li>
            <li> After the third day of use, two people commented, “I can see the top of your head.”  </li>
            <li> First of all is the “aroma”.  </li>
            <li> The folks at Biota are pretty darn</li>
            <li> The color had me put off at first, but I got used to it</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> So after using it for the first time and after drying and setting my hair</li>
            <li> The shampoo is affordable enough to have a go by itself and see if it provides more body.</li>
            <li> hair looked thicker after the first shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks Biota Botanicals!</li>
            <li> ( I visually scanned over 5,000 characters and not one satisfied the question.  </li>
            <li> First think I noticed is the look.&lt;br /&gt;Looks and reminds me of motor oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He was worried at first because the shampoo comes out of the bottle colored brown.  </li>
            <li> Must admit that my washed and dried hair  felt silky good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is intended to accompany the Biota Bioxsine Serum, which is a fair bit more expensive.</li>
            <li> I do use my own conditioner after, but on the occasions I have used only the shampoo, my hair has felt soft after.</li>
            <li> was wondering how long you are supposed to use this before you see results, so I went to their website for more information.</li>
            <li> not sure yet how good this stuff works my barber recommended it&lt;br</li>
            <li> As we all know, if you can reduce the shedding enough, your new hair growth will catch up and you&#x27;ll be able to (hopefully) maintain what you have.</li>
            <li> I had to get a mirror out and check and sure enough there are new hairs coming</li>
            <li> But since results can take much longer, I will keep using it until my bottle is finished and will update this review if I notice any improvement.</li>
            <li> All I really care about is if it works &amp; it does seem to make my hair healthier.  </li>
            <li> My hair, is really shiny.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t really tell if its working....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about ready to give up on the product just because of the shampoo.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, this shampoo really works, I was thininnig .</li>
            <li> very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I recommend it as a shampoo -</li>
            <li> Very noticeable.</li>
            <li> (though not so much I&#x27;m out of the placebo effect zone).  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost a month now and have not seen much of in improvement as of yet.</li>
            <li> this product really works.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a miracle cure by any means, but it DOES help and for that I&#x27;m very thankful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY noticeable.</li>
            <li> It took about 2 weeks to see a real difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I posted  the same detailed response in the Q&amp;A section for this product.</li>
            <li> VERY Brown.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t seen a whole lot of change.</li>
            <li> many words, but the purpose is to say not much has changed except now</li>
            <li> It turned my natural blonde hair more of a henna hue.</li>
            <li> I suggest using a really good conditioner after shampooing that you leave in at least 10-20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have a shampoo that has superior results and leaves my hair full-bodied that stays in place all day and even into the following morning.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m aware that I most likely have not used this long enough to determine whether it actually provides good results.  </li>
            <li> Most of the other products simply provide clean, unruly hair, especially since it is so fine to begin with.  </li>
            <li> I have been seeking that just right shampoo for all those old fibers growing out of my scalp and this just might be the one.  </li>
            <li> More so than with other volumizing shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I will look for other products that promise relief from thinning hair but seem more geared toward women.</li>
            <li> see that is hair is better conditioned but not any of the other effects.  </li>
            <li> My hair shedding has increased markedly with age, and at this point I am willing to try anything.  </li>
            <li> My hair does seem a little thicker, though it isn&#x27;t growing faster, which, since I am wearing a short pixie haircut is a good thing.</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning so I am always ready to try a new product to make my hair feel fuller</li>
            <li> In light of all the good reviews, I decided to purchase this product and give it a try since I was desperate for a remedy for my thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> My wife is currently breastfeeding but there is a warning on the box that says not to be used by pregnant women, or breastfeeding women.  </li>
            <li> main ingredient is bioxsine.</li>
            <li> Again, it works just fine as a shampoo, but other than that it’s really nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far it is getting a positive reception.</li>
            <li> Seeing results, slowly but surely!</li>
            <li> I think if you&#x27;re worried about hair loss vitamin E and biotin should be looked into or eat foods high in those vitamins.</li>
            <li> It does lather up really nice and rinses easily with no build up or residue left behind.</li>
            <li> My hair is in better condition now, softer, and it does feel a little thicker.</li>
            <li> Can still see the scalp a little, but it&#x27;s workable and getting better every week.</li>
            <li> The way B&#x27;iota works right now is good enough for a 5 star and any other benefits are just fluff.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It supposedly is herbal/botanical and since I normally use natural products I thought it would be a safe product to test, needless to say, I no longer think this product is safe for anyone&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Love that fluffy stuff.  </li>
            <li> Combine daily use of this with a regular dose of Biotin and this should help those out with thinning or just naturally fine hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is dyed light brown and it didn&#x27;t have any effect - good or bad - on my color.</li>
            <li> I am using it concurrently with the serum after experiencing more than normal hair loss for the past three months.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I started using this when my hair was longer than usual, but for most of the month, I&#x27;ve had it cut to about 1/4\\&quot; in length.  </li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s not obnoxiously more expensive than my regular Pantene shampoo, I might try another bottle and give it more time.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not really sure what to call it) smell of most shampoos.  </li>
            <li> you only need a very small amount for a good lather</li>
            <li> The shampoo has stopped all shedding, I wash my hair only twice a week, as my hair is long and fine.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell yet whether more hair is arriving due to this shampoo, but I do so many other things to keep my thinning hair to look less thinning</li>
            <li> I noticed less shedding in the first week of use, and the amount of shedding has been pretty consistent since about the second week.</li>
            <li> I use to wake up with hair all over my pillow, no more hair loss, my hair is more soft and thicker</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty flat after using both the shampoo and and conditioner.</li>
            <li> First I just used the shampoo for normal to dry hair.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought the shampoo and the serum, since I&#x27;ve tried so many fine and a few thinning hair shampoos, but you can notice a difference from the very first time.</li>
            <li> the product.&lt;br /&gt;Years ago a hair stylist told me ALWAYS use a CLEAR shampoo on your hair</li>
            <li> It seems to clean rather well and leaves one with a slight tingling sensation.</li>
            <li> it does leave the hair soft...</li>
            <li> got this for wife her hair is thinning, as far as a miracle hair growth potion i am unsure.</li>
            <li> I was completely panicked.  </li>
            <li> – when did I get so old???  </li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as shampoo.</li>
            <li> appreciated and preferred a corresponding Biota Conditioner, regular or leave-in, to thoroughly test and review.  </li>
            <li> far, I&#x27;m please with the Biota line.</li>
            <li> and it still made my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product regularly for about a month and my hair is already not falling out as much.</li>
            <li> I like this natural shampoo, but I can&#x27;t verify that it has all the benefits claimed.  </li>
            <li> This Biota Botanicals product offers hope for those of us with thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> It seems far too masculine for my comfort,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair loss doesn&#x27;t seem as much and the shampoo does add body to my short hair.  </li>
            <li> Wish I could have tried a whole bottle&#x27;s worth of shampooing over the course of a few weeks to see how  Biota lives up to its promises----particularly of thicker hair.</li>
            <li> I used my own volumizing conditioner which may have decreased rather than enhanced Biota Bioxsine results.</li>
            <li> Been using it now for about 2 weeks and have seen a difference in my hair, its a lot more thick and looks healthier.</li>
            <li> I use this daily at the top of my head (putting other organic shampoo on the back of my head).  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I am used to seeing white or light colored shampoo and this is a dark colored shampoo.</li>
            <li> When I first poured this on my hand I hesitated because it&#x27;s a deep, deep brown color.</li>
            <li> special brushes, no hair dryers or curling irons, no harsh chemicals, yet one use of this shampoo caused me to lose more hairs than I normally do in 10 days, that is how bad it was for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shampoo has a slightly medicinal fragrance but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> My first and only use of the shampoo was a terrible experience, it left my hair looking and feeling dry and damaged, even a double dose of conditioner after shampooing only helped a little, and my hair was actually very nice looking before I used the shampoo as I consider it my best feature</li>
            <li> my hair looks so much better without all that other stuff weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> I needed something that would allow my scalp to calm down and heal.</li>
            <li> I bought a 2 month supply and I have new hair growing in already, only after 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> asking our doctor, they said they always put these warnings on products because there is no data to what happens to nursing or pregnant women who use them because no pregnant or nursing woman is willing to be a test subject.  </li>
            <li> The smell is a clean medicinal smell that lasts for a small amount of time after you use it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it does everything it says, I haven&#x27;t noted those improvements, but as a general shampoo, I like it.</li>
            <li> I can barely see my scalp in those areas anymore.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve definitely have notice new growth in area&#x27;s where I was starting to go bald.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe the ads, this stuff doesn&#x27;t work like a lot of other products that want to capitalize on those of us dealing with hair loss at a certain time in life....</li>
            <li> Turned my beautiful white thin hair dull tan color...will not us anymore</li>
            <li> My scalp was very tender and eczema due developing severe sensitivity to Wen conditioner and oil products that I&#x27;d using for three years.</li>
            <li> This product smells a little funny</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little early yet to really see how well this ultimately functions.  </li>
            <li> BIOTA BOTANICALS BIOXSINE SHAMPOO is a shampoo that is supposed to be used for people with normal or dry hair and can possibly help people with thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Biota Botanicals Bioxsine Series Shampoo for Thinning Hair for Normal and Dry Hair, 10.1 Fluid Ounce&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;6 weeks later,  the sparse areas are barely noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can’t tell if it’s doing anything yet, because I dyed my hair not long before I began using Biota.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really was a let down.</li>
            <li> Although advertised almost as a natural product but there are a lot of ingredients that are not natural (PEGS) and such.</li>
            <li> But not only was it a waste of my money, but after the first use, it caused a lot of my hair to fall out.  </li>
            <li> Its dark brown shampoo that&#x27;s highly fragranced and it seems to add junk to my scalp like build up.</li>
            <li> I have fine thinning hair and a sad little bald spot on the crown of my head - nothing huge but still extremely noticeable (to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to do this before with other shampoos (time passes MUCH more slowly with a headful of rapidly-cooling shampoo suds!)</li>
            <li> I do use my regular conditioner after using the shampoo (to make de-tangling a little less painful, later on :D).</li>
            <li> I am mainly concerned about losing hair round the forehead</li>
            <li> My beautiful thick hair started breaking like crazy and bleaching out.  </li>
            <li> The colour almost looked black at first, and then I realized it was a dark reddish brown.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much this has helped retain hair prevent breakage, but I like how it gives my hair volume.  </li>
            <li> For me at least this stuff really worked!  </li>
            <li> people we speak with who try our products say they notice that the hair fall that they are experiencing begins to slow, if not stop, altogether within the first 45-to-60 days of use.</li>
            <li> But, alas, a look in the mirror revealed after just one shampoo that, when dried,  my mostly white hair had acquired a distinct yellowish cast  (It&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve had that particular problem with a shampoo.)</li>
            <li> It’s hard to tell, because I can’t see very well back there, but I don’t see it when I look in the mirrors.</li>
            <li> and this is my new shampoo which I will use everyday.</li>
            <li> After using the shampoo for only a week my daughters hair was dry, bushy, and brittle.</li>
            <li> It is too early to test the growth factors, but for me they are not terribly significant.  </li>
            <li> It did not dry out my hair or cause any other problems.</li>
            <li> Minus 1 star because I did not get all of my hair back in 6 month garrantee,</li>
            <li> My one minor critique is that it&#x27;s a bit mediciny in smell.</li>
            <li> What I did notice is that my hair feels softer, smoother, and feels healthier than it has in a long time.</li>
            <li> I think bioxsine is just a trade name for a mix of botanicals - any mix as long as it is used by the company.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a slow process, but it seems to really be working.</li>
            <li> This is a brown shampoo with a deep scent that&#x27;s nearly impossible to describe because it has so many scent-causing</li>
            <li> if it will have a lasting effect or if less hair will be falling out, since I&#x27;ve only been using this for 5 days</li>
            <li> This bottle will not last long because the other member of the household likes it after using it for two days.</li>
            <li> Hair also feel dry and fussy.</li>
            <li> I used the shampoo and serum for about 5 weeks but stopped because the shampoo over time made my hair increasingly brittle, dry and un-manageable.</li>
            <li> When finished, I dry off, dress and go.  </li>
            <li> It seems to dry out my hair, and after a week of use I see no measurable difference.  </li>
            <li> Not that it really makes any difference, but needless to say I was quite  “surprised” when I squirted it out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Go can and usually defines a trip to the computer to check some time sensitive programs and then hit the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
            <li> Shedding has stayed about the same once reduced, so my hair had gotten a little thicker.</li>
            <li> It feels a little bit fuller, but that may be because I&#x27;ve had to use a stronger conditioner to keep it soft and fluffy - this shampoo has a drying effect on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not blow dry my hair (never did) nor apply any chemicals other than deodorant.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Sadly my hair is starting to thin on top</li>
            <li> I have noticed no real changes in my hair or its thinning, nor does it seem like it is making it thicker.</li>
            <li> Maximum Strength Tablets, 100-Count]]&lt;br /&gt;Following up a few months later.</li>
            <li> started using the shampoo on Sept. 16 and followed the directions carefully.</li>
            <li> I have short gray hair, very thin and fine, but now it looks thick and you can&#x27;t see my scalp anymore.  </li>
            <li> I am an African American woman who had been having a long standing problem (years) with my hair falling out and getting incredibly thin, so I figured what did I have to loose?  </li>
            <li> Unlike some other reviewers, this doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my hair or have any other adverse effects.  </li>
            <li> The only other complaint I have is that I may have to use a conditioner after this shampoo the next time as you will need one.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the extremely low price, a fraction of what I was paying for all the other products!!!</li>
            <li> After I wash my long hair I clip it up for a few minutes</li>
            <li> and I have had two medical problems in the past that my hair falls out at an alarming rate!  </li>
            <li> I lost a lot of hair and length due to breakage.  </li>
            <li> This is NOT safe on Blonde Hair!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to buy &amp; try the other products in this line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s literally twice as thick as it was, and before I had almost bare scalp in the front/center.</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a very distinct smell that I find unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Bad strong smell that stays with you all day long,I used once and threw it away.</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo several times, but it didn&#x27;t make my hair thick.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick consistency, lathers well, cleans and refreshes hair and scalp, adding overall volume and body.</li>
            <li> I have to say that it makes my hair a bit dry and hard to brush while it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> My hair is a little wavier and harder to manage, but hey, it looks like I have some!</li>
            <li> it means there are less things in it to weigh your hair down</li>
            <li> My hair seems thicker, less breakage &amp; healthier.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m losing less hair and its shinier.</li>
            <li> I feel a slight “burning” sensation when I use this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> shedding after brushing and less hair on my clothes.</li>
            <li> It also seems to keep my hair less oily.</li>
            <li> After years of expensive Dermatology visits and prescription shampoos and topical creams and ointments, and thinking that maybe it was just heredity, I found that after only 3 days of using Biota Botanicals products, my hair literally stopped shedding!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have very thin and fine hair that is made worse by medications I take for arthritis.  </li>
            <li> I’m not sure it’s just wishful thinking, but the back of my head always looked pretty bad.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Biota Botanicals Shampoo for Thinning Hair for a little over a month and have seen a slight change in the thickness of my hair.</li>
            <li> There are dimethicones in here as well which WEIGH hair down glycerin and castor oil too (heavy hair products).</li>
            <li> The color of the shampoo is a little off putting because it is an amber color.</li>
            <li> the clip usually stays in my hair for those few min, well with this shampoo the clips handling and dangling from my hair due to the heavy weight of</li>
            <li> But after having used it for a few weeks, I can tell neither a difference in the thickness of my hair nor the speed of growth.  </li>
            <li> Dries my hair out if I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will try to give my updated review in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s on your head, you are to let it sit for a few minutes so it can do its job of helping you retain those errant hairs.</li>
            <li> In a few months when she is no longer nursing, I will update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I felt it dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> but I have been using is now for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I also take hair supplements, eat a lot of berries/green veggies, and massage my scalp with organic coconut oil (a few times a week) to compliment the Biota shampoo and serum regimen.</li>
            <li> We just leave it in for a few minutes before washing</li>
            <li> ’s been a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> It was not easy to comb my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very dark color and doesn&#x27;t have the usual sweeter</li>
            <li> and I can feel little fuzzy hairs in the bald spot!</li>
            <li> leaves my hair a little hard</li>
            <li> The shampoo is thick and a very dark brown color.</li>
            <li> I’m not particularly sure about that</li>
            <li> Not sure it lives up to it&#x27;s claim.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the volume part..</li>
            <li> Lazy me.)  </li>
            <li> But the shampoo is terrible, it left my hair in a ton of knots and made it feel real brittle.</li>
            <li> It was hard to comb out, I&#x27;m supposed to be gaining thicker hair not losing the hair I have.</li>
            <li> Plus it did nothing for my hair but make it dull.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a bit confusing.  </li>
            <li> The breakage stopped by at least 85%.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally. . . at least sometimes.</li>
            <li> From December 2014 to now (end of January 2015), I&#x27;ve seen at least 1 1/2 inches in growth where my hair was almost non-existent.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad, but it&#x27;s different.  </li>
            <li> But it’s not a “good” thing either.  </li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s hair has been thinning due to breastfeeding and hormonal changes, but she is afraid to use this.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo itself is a disturbing color of brown, and while it lathers well, I was not pleased with the scent.  </li>
            <li> My hair is still shedding and thin.  </li>
            <li> The worse shampoo I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I think it made my thinning hair worse.</li>
            <li> She said her hair was in worse condition after using B,Iota.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my shedding has decreased, and my hair loss has noticeably slowed.</li>
            <li> Mom has thin hair and we are hoping this will help.</li>
            <li> They seriously need to create a conditioner to go with it!</li>
            <li> It’s a dark and ugly goo without the smell.</li>
            <li> It dried my hair out so badly I have to get it cut.  </li>
            <li> The hair tangled and difficult to comb.</li>
            <li> ill give it a go</li>
            <li> I had been using a rather expensive treatment \\&quot;system\\&quot; recommended by my hairdresser for two or three years.  </li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with it.  </li>
            <li> Shampoos for thinning hair, for some weird reason, always seem to have a chemical smell.</li>
            <li> Less than 10!!!!!</li>
            <li> But this product was just disappointing.</li>
            <li> Some hair products are very expensive and promise growth.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t see that it was helping but was afraid to stop!  </li>
            <li> of the ingredients are plant derived/herbal.. but it does contain sulfates :(</li>
            <li> That’s what it’s supposed to do, but we’ve been disappointed before.</li>
            <li> I will have to get highlights in my hair, this is horrible.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This shampoo has a nice, mild fragrance to it. It lathers up well and rinses cleanly. It did not dry out my hair or cause any other problems. However, after using this for a few weeks, I can’t really say that my hair is any thicker.&lt;br /&gt;I was wondering how long you are supposed to use this before you see results, so I went to their website for more information. They don’t actually make any claims as to when you will see results. However, they tell you what “most people” say they see. This is from their website:&lt;br /&gt;“Most people we speak with who try our products say they notice that the hair fall that they are experiencing begins to slow, if not stop, altogether within the first 45-to-60 days of use.”&lt;br /&gt;And, keep in mind, this quote refers to “products” and not “shampoo”.&lt;br /&gt;They do have results of a 6-month clinical trial, but that studied the use of the shampoo and the serum together. There is no study of either product alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good, general shampoo, but I don’t feel it helped my thinning hair at all. But since results can take much longer, I will keep using it until my bottle is finished and will update this review if I notice any improvement.</li>
            <li> I like the way my hair looks after shampooing with it  - I don&#x27;t think I have used it enough to notice a tremendous difference in hair volume but its a good product and you only need a very small amount for a good lather so it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Shampoo does not work, I use in conjunction with Serum and conditioner for thinning hair and it does not work at all.  My hair is still shedding and thin.  Used about 3wks now.</li>
            <li> You will see results if you continue to use it!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair clean and fresh.  Somewhat fuller.</li>
            <li> great shampoo. This is my 3rd bottle</li>
            <li> This product does give the volume of hair. But you can not use hair conditioning after shampoo with this product. It will cancel out the effect. The hair tangled and difficult to comb. Hair also feel dry and fussy. After couple of time, I stop to use it.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my dad whose hair is thinning and he says that it seems to be working. I’m not particularly sure about that though, but who am I to argue?</li>
            <li> My hair seems thicker, less breakage &amp; healthier.  It doesn&#x27;t smell that great while using it, but no lingering smell.  All I really care about is if it works &amp; it does seem to make my hair healthier.  I&#x27;d purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> it does leave the hair soft...i have not seen any evidence of it being thicker.</li>
            <li> fast delivery and good price&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure yet how good this stuff works my barber recommended it&lt;br /&gt;so ill give it a go</li>
            <li> My hair, is really shiny.</li>
            <li> I use this daily at the top of my head (putting other organic shampoo on the back of my head).  I can&#x27;t tell yet whether more hair is arriving due to this shampoo, but I do so many other things to keep my thinning hair to look less thinning, it&#x27;s a bit confusing.  But I figure it can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about three months and I can&#x27;t really tell if its working....leaves my hair a little hard</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a bit of difference after several months exclusively using this product.  It really was a let down.</li>
            <li> The worse shampoo I have ever used.  It dried my hair out so badly I have to get it cut.  I do not recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me at all. Its dark brown shampoo that&#x27;s highly fragranced and it seems to add junk to my scalp like build up. The smell scent is ok JUST There is TOO MUCH OF It. My hair not only doesn&#x27;t feel any fuller it&#x27;s pretty flat after using both the shampoo and and conditioner. Although advertised almost as a natural product but there are a lot of ingredients that are not natural (PEGS) and such. There are dimethicones in here as well which WEIGH hair down glycerin and castor oil too (heavy hair products). After I wash my long hair I clip it up for a few minutes the clip usually stays in my hair for those few min, well with this shampoo the clips handling and dangling from my hair due to the heavy weight of the product.&lt;br /&gt;Years ago a hair stylist told me ALWAYS use a CLEAR shampoo on your hair it means there are less things in it to weigh your hair down, I think there&#x27;s some merit to this as well. I think if you&#x27;re worried about hair loss vitamin E and biotin should be looked into or eat foods high in those vitamins. There are some fantastic beach sprays that &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; your hair up too. But this product was just disappointing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t vouch as to whether it works or not, only used a couple times. But the shampoo is terrible, it left my hair in a ton of knots and made it feel real brittle. It was hard to comb out, I&#x27;m supposed to be gaining thicker hair not losing the hair I have. They seriously need to create a conditioner to go with it! I&#x27;m about ready to give up on the product just because of the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I used the shampoo and serum for about 5 weeks but stopped because the shampoo over time made my hair increasingly brittle, dry and un-manageable.</li>
            <li> Minus 1 star because I did not get all of my hair back in 6 month garrantee, but I did get most of it. I used both the serun and shampoo for 6 months and was nothing but amazed at how my top, crown, and top back head-hair problem areas have mostly filled back in, and I&#x27;m in my 50s. I&#x27;ve definitly been inspired to use these products for another 6 months, then continue using the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Seeing results, slowly but surely! Combine daily use of this with a regular dose of Biotin and this should help those out with thinning or just naturally fine hair.</li>
            <li> I just learned about this product on the radio and I have had two medical problems in the past that my hair falls out at an alarming rate!  Thyroid and Vitamine D deficiency and I am hoping that Biota can help reverse my problem.  I love the smell, shampoo smells like nutmeg and the conditioner smells like bananas!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  I will not use anything else now.  It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but well worth the price.</li>
            <li> got this for wife her hair is thinning, as far as a miracle hair growth potion i am unsure. as far as a shampoo she says its one of the best, she feels her hair has never been cleaner and does not need conditioner. the thinning hair may be a medical condition so nothing may help. but this aint cheap . we will continue to buy this and hope things get better</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo! I have been using it for about three months now. I had been using a rather expensive treatment \\&quot;system\\&quot; recommended by my hairdresser for two or three years.  Couldn&#x27;t see that it was helping but was afraid to stop!  I also started adding a somewhat pricey fiber product to my parts, etc.  What a hassle!&lt;br /&gt;From the first use with this product I have never used the fiber again!  I could tell the difference immediately.  I don&#x27;t know whether it is helping with the thinning problem or just creating an optical illusion but it works!  It&#x27;s so great to  be able to just shampoo and go again and my hair looks so much better without all that other stuff weighing it down.  Not to mention the extremely low price, a fraction of what I was paying for all the other products!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a slow process, but it seems to really be working. I have been using it now for about a month and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my hair&#x27;s volume and length.</li>
            <li> I bought a 2 month supply and I have new hair growing in already, only after 3 weeks.  Smells great and lthe rest of my hair is thicker and more manageable.</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo several times, but it didn&#x27;t make my hair thick.  I will not buy again.  I will give this one for my husband to use.</li>
            <li> I am African American. I am 62. It seems to be working. I&#x27;m losing less hair and its shinier. First I just used the shampoo for normal to dry hair. It seem to be working so I added the serum because my hair is relaxed and below my shoulders and it needs all the help it can get to grow even more.</li>
            <li> Turned my beautiful white thin hair dull tan color...will not us anymore</li>
            <li> Gives my hair more body and lift.</li>
            <li> Bad strong smell that stays with you all day long,I used once and threw it away.They need a unscented version.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in growth and haven&#x27;t seemingly lost any more hair, which had stabilized before trying this product.  owever, at the price, it&#x27;s not any more than a regular quality shampoo, so, what the heck?  Some hair products are very expensive and promise growth.  This product is the price of a bottle of quality shampoo in any department store.  Why Not?</li>
            <li> fast shipping, this shampoo really works, I was thininnig . Started using this product, let me tell you. It works . Makes your hair stronger, and thicker. Iam so happy. Now I have more hair . Thankyou !!!! Biota .</li>
            <li> Love love love! Fuller hair. Thicker, more volume! Just amazing! I order like 3 in advance because this shampoo is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Wish I could have tried a whole bottle&#x27;s worth of shampooing over the course of a few weeks to see how  Biota lives up to its promises----particularly of thicker hair. Must admit that my washed and dried hair  felt silky good.  But, alas, a look in the mirror revealed after just one shampoo that, when dried,  my mostly white hair had acquired a distinct yellowish cast  (It&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve had that particular problem with a shampoo.) Will probably pass this product on to a blond friend and see what it does for her.  If she gives it a rave, especially about hair thickening, I&#x27;ll try to remember to return here and report that.</li>
            <li> BIOTA BOTANICALS BIOXSINE SHAMPOO is a shampoo that is supposed to be used for people with normal or dry hair and can possibly help people with thinning hair. I have thinning hair (but it’s mostly because of genes) and figured I would give it a shot. I have been using this shampoo now daily for just over a month and have not noticed any difference in the loss of my hair. The shampoo has a very distinct smell that I find unpleasant. Also, the shampoo is brown in color. Personally, I’m indifferent to the color of the shampoo, but there are some people who will not like that. In terms of how well it works, after having used BIOTA BOTANICALS BIOXSINE SHAMPOO for almost five weeks, my hair does feel fuller and with slightly more volume than it did when I used my old shampoo. It seems to clean rather well and leaves one with a slight tingling sensation. However, although BIOTA BOTANICALS BIOXSINE SHAMPOO does seem to offer some help in giving “life” back to one’s hair, I probably will not buy any of it because of the very strong distinct smell it has.</li>
            <li> My biggest worry upon ordering this was there would be a strong chemical smell, or it would burn or hurt my scalp. The fragrance is actually light and pleasant, and no allergic reactions so far. I have thinning hair and I&#x27;ve stopped coloring it, letting it go gray. This actually does make a difference, hair color (not taking out color like going blonde) sits on the hair shaft and actually can give the illusion of thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Biota and it lathered nicely, my hair looked clean and soft, so no weird issues there. My hair does seem a little thicker, though it isn&#x27;t growing faster, which, since I am wearing a short pixie haircut is a good thing. The box indicated I would get better results if I paired this with the serum.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC Product.  I swim a mile a day.  I didn&#x27;t realize how damaging the chlorine is.  My beautiful thick hair started breaking like crazy and bleaching out.  I lost a lot of hair and length due to breakage.  I was completely panicked.  I found this product and decided to try it.  WOW! The breakage stopped by at least 85%.  My hair (color treated) is now thicker, healthier and shinier.  In fact, it looks better now than my hair did before the chlorine damage.  I am so grateful to have found this product.  I&#x27;m an entertainer and my hair is an important part of my look.  I can breath easy again.</li>
            <li> Sadly my hair is starting to thin on top – when did I get so old???  Anyway, I thought I would give this stuff a try.  Up until I started using it, I noticed my hair thinning.  After the third day of use, two people commented, “I can see the top of your head.”  Yikes – this stuff does the opposite of what was prescribed and sped up the process!  I think it made my thinning hair worse.</li>
            <li> First of all is the “aroma”.  This is a very “unusual” smelling shampoo.  That’s not a “bad” thing (though some certainly might not like it). . . . But it’s not a “good” thing either.  Just very “different”.  Also, it’s brown.  Not that it really makes any difference, but needless to say I was quite  “surprised” when I squirted it out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as shampoo. . . it’s fine.  Nothing wrong with it.  But after having used it for a few weeks, I can tell neither a difference in the thickness of my hair nor the speed of growth.  Again, it works just fine as a shampoo, but other than that it’s really nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally. . . at least sometimes. .. I feel a slight “burning” sensation when I use this shampoo.  Not “tingling” but “burning”.  It’s not enough to make me stop using it, but it’s there.  I do as the bottle recommends and leave it in for a couple of minutes before rinsing.</li>
            <li> My first and only use of the shampoo was a terrible experience, it left my hair looking and feeling dry and damaged, even a double dose of conditioner after shampooing only helped a little, and my hair was actually very nice looking before I used the shampoo as I consider it my best feature so I pamper it, special brushes, no hair dryers or curling irons, no harsh chemicals, yet one use of this shampoo caused me to lose more hairs than I normally do in 10 days, that is how bad it was for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It supposedly is herbal/botanical and since I normally use natural products I thought it would be a safe product to test, needless to say, I no longer think this product is safe for anyone&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re washing your hair with this shampoo, you can feel that your hair feels thicker, but once you wash it out and comb your hair, it doesn&#x27;t feel any different than before you washed it. It does lather up really nice and rinses easily with no build up or residue left behind. It sort of has a light herbal smell. The package recommends using a serum along with it so that may help with seeing more benefits. I did not use the serum.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair out if I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> This is NOT safe on Blonde Hair! It turned my natural blonde hair more of a henna hue. I will have to get highlights in my hair, this is horrible. Plus it did nothing for my hair but make it dull.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working but I wish it would hurry up. I&#x27;m trying another item and am seeing more results.</li>
            <li> Thoroughly wetting my hair for a minute or two loosened and rinsed away styling product residue  prepared my hair and scalp for the pleasant herbal scented shampoo. It&#x27;s thick consistency, lathers well, cleans and refreshes hair and scalp, adding overall volume and body. My thinning crown&#x27;s breakage looks better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would’ve appreciated and preferred a corresponding Biota Conditioner, regular or leave-in, to thoroughly test and review.  I used my own volumizing conditioner which may have decreased rather than enhanced Biota Bioxsine results.</li>
            <li> The folks at Biota are pretty darn clever.&lt;br /&gt;I received this shampoo in order to test and review.&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m hooked.&lt;br /&gt;Many of the women in my family have experienced age related thinning. It used to be that I&#x27;d go and get my hair cut and always be told &#x27;You have fine hair, but a lot of it&#x27;. That doesn&#x27;t get said anymore. And more and more seems to find it&#x27;s way in the sink or on the comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used sulfur solutions, both pre-made and my own DIY, and while they are good, this stuff is terrific, and smells better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less shedding after brushing and less hair on my clothes. Can&#x27;t wait to buy &amp; try the other products in this line.</li>
            <li> After using the shampoo for only a week my daughters hair was dry, bushy, and brittle. On the upside, she said her head smelled &amp;#34;like a waterfall.&amp;#34;  Vanity trumped olfactory pleasure though, because she threw the bottle out and vowed she&#x27;d never use it again.  She said her hair was in worse condition after using B,Iota.</li>
            <li> Works great for all hair types. My hair is thinning so I am always ready to try a new product to make my hair feel fuller and I cant say that it did that but it did make my hair feel rejuvinated and clean. My wife tried it and liked it also and her hair is not even thinning. Had a nice smell to it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend!</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a fresh herbal fragrance and cleans well without leaving the hair feeling stripped, but it is NOT effective in preventing hair loss as claimed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Biocomplex B11 Herbal Extract (Urtica Urens Leaf Extract), Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Root Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Ceratonia Siliqua (Carob) Fruit Extract, Equisetum Arvense Extract, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Propylene Glycol, Mel, Sodium Chloride, PEG/PPG 120/10 Trimethylolpropane Trioleate, Laureth 2, Polysorbate 20, Fragrance, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Hydroxypropyl Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Butylene Glycol, Amodimethicone, PPG 26 Buteth 26, PEG 40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, C11 15 Pareth 7, Laureth 9, Glycerin, Trideceth 12, Apigenin, Oleanolic Acid, Biotinoyl Tripeptide 1, Geraniol, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Citric Acid.</li>
            <li> Shampoo has a slightly medicinal fragrance but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gentle nice shampoo but it hasn&#x27;t actually improved my hair thinning problem</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a month.  From the very first use, I liked it as a general shampoo because my hair felt clean and soft.  I also don&#x27;t feel the need to use a conditioner with this.  I started using this when my hair was longer than usual, but for most of the month, I&#x27;ve had it cut to about 1/4\\&quot; in length.  So, it&#x27;s very easy for me to see if my hair is \\&quot;thicker\\&quot; or if I have any areas that are beginning to grow hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it and give it four stars as a shampoo to clean my hair, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in how much hair I have.  Because it&#x27;s not obnoxiously more expensive than my regular Pantene shampoo, I might try another bottle and give it more time.  This 10.1-ounce bottle still has some left after a month, so it&#x27;s not overly expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this shampoo looks and smells different than any shampoo that I remember using.  It&#x27;s a very dark color and doesn&#x27;t have the usual sweeter (I&#x27;m not really sure what to call it) smell of most shampoos.  The smell isn&#x27;t bad, but it&#x27;s different.  The color had me put off at first, but I got used to it very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I recommend it as a shampoo - but I won&#x27;t get your hopes up that you&#x27;ll start growing any more hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this from WalgIreens because it went on sale for $8.00. I used it for the first time.  I saw it a while back at CVS and read that it was good for thinning hair. So I was on the fence for a while until I saw that it was on sale. So after using it for the first time and after drying and setting my hair I noticed that my hair&#x27;s volume was just superfluous. Very noticeable. So perhaps it also works to improve volume for thinning hair. The only other complaint I have is that I may have to use a conditioner after this shampoo the next time as you will need one. It was not easy to comb my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try to give my updated review in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a while, I think it has helped my hair loss.</li>
            <li> Have been using this shampoo, plus conditioner (no serum) AND Biotin supplement10,000 - for 4 months, 2-3 times a week.  I am blonde/silver 67 yo and my hair is much thicker, shines and is super easy to style.  I wash my hair first, leave the shampoo set while I finish showering &amp; rinse out shampoo &amp; do small conditioner at the vey last.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it. Great product.</li>
            <li> Shampoos for thinning hair, for some weird reason, always seem to have a chemical smell. Biota Botanicals is entirely different. It looks goopy, but the scent is light and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo foams up nicely and rinses cleanly. While it&#x27;s on your head, you are to let it sit for a few minutes so it can do its job of helping you retain those errant hairs. I&#x27;ve had to do this before with other shampoos (time passes MUCH more slowly with a headful of rapidly-cooling shampoo suds!) That&#x27;s to give it a fighting chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;m please with the Biota line. Only time will tell to see if its claims for helping stop hair loss is accurate; meanwhile, it&#x27;s a good shampoo that doesn&#x27;t hurt and may actually help. (I will update this in a month to see how well the hair issue is resolved.)</li>
            <li> I have to admit it was a shock to pour this shampoo out into my hand. The colour almost looked black at first, and then I realized it was a dark reddish brown. The smell is a clean medicinal smell that lasts for a small amount of time after you use it. I could smell it when I was drying my hair.&lt;br /&gt; I have noticed no real changes in my hair or its thinning, nor does it seem like it is making it thicker. Just wish it could work its magic and stop the thinning hair.</li>
            <li> My wife is currently breastfeeding but there is a warning on the box that says not to be used by pregnant women, or breastfeeding women.  It does not state this on the description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From asking our doctor, they said they always put these warnings on products because there is no data to what happens to nursing or pregnant women who use them because no pregnant or nursing woman is willing to be a test subject.  It might still be safe, it might not be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they would put the disclosure on the description.  It says safe for treated hair and men and women, but does not state pregnant or nursing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that if you are pregnant or nursing, you are advised against using this.  My wife&#x27;s hair has been thinning due to breastfeeding and hormonal changes, but she is afraid to use this.  In a few months when she is no longer nursing, I will update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, pregnant women and nursing women, stay away.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t attest at this point to the many results that this shampoo claims such as thicker, faster growing hair or less shedding, but I can say that this is some very nice shampoo. This shampoo does make your hair noticeably stronger. My hair was shinier from the first use and easy to manage. It strengthened my hair as well, but hasn&#x27;t made it grow quicker and thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo has a mellow scent that isn&#x27;t too strong. The color of the shampoo is a little off putting because it is an amber color. It reminds me of something my grandmother used to use, but I can&#x27;t remember the name of the product. Anyway, I am used to seeing white or light colored shampoo and this is a dark colored shampoo. That aside, using it has been a good experience for me. I don&#x27;t know if it does everything it says, I haven&#x27;t noted those improvements, but as a general shampoo, I like it. I think it does help with damaged ends. My hair looks really good since I have been using it. This formula does have some good herbal ingredients but it also contains many things that I don&#x27;t know what they are. I didn&#x27;t use this with the recommended serum but I do like the shampoo quite a bit and would consider buying it in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update: this shampoo does help to reduce shedding hair! I&#x27;ve used it for several weeks now and this has helped.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little early yet to really see how well this ultimately functions.  But, I&#x27;m hopeful in using it and after a month I do seem to see some progress (though not so much I&#x27;m out of the placebo effect zone).  Unlike some other reviewers, this doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my hair or have any other adverse effects.  My one minor critique is that it&#x27;s a bit mediciny in smell. Not so much it stands out or others have commented, but I wish it had a bit of more pleasant scent to it.  Medicine smell means it&#x27;s working, right?  Right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is intended to accompany the Biota Bioxsine Serum, which is a fair bit more expensive. The shampoo is affordable enough to have a go by itself and see if it provides more body.</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo.  Not sure it lives up to it&#x27;s claim.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and I bought this product because it claims to give your hair more volume. I&#x27;m not sure about the volume part.. but it sure gives a great shine and softness to my hair. I do use my regular conditioner after using the shampoo (to make de-tangling a little less painful, later on :D). But, I did try using just the shampoo and it still made my hair soft and shiny. Also, I&#x27;m losing much lesser hair in the shower than I did before I started using this.&lt;br /&gt;Most of the ingredients are plant derived/herbal.. but it does contain sulfates :( I wish it was sulfate free.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost a month now and have not seen much of in improvement as of yet.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe the ads, this stuff doesn&#x27;t work like a lot of other products that want to capitalize on those of us dealing with hair loss at a certain time in life....save your money</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference right away. My hair is very fine and falls out by the handful. I have been using the product regularly for about a month and my hair is already not falling out as much. It also seems to keep my hair less oily. I don&#x27;t need to wash it as often when using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> this product really works.&lt;br /&gt;my hair looked thicker after the first shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;6 weeks later,  the sparse areas are barely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried so many before, would highly recommend this shampoo, also the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I like this natural shampoo, but I can&#x27;t verify that it has all the benefits claimed.  It does a god job cleaning my hair and stimulating my scalp, I even let the shampoo clean my face and neck.  It does no damage to this elderly reviewers hair or skin.  But I am 76.  A meaningful improvement  of my decently cared for skin and hair would be almost a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, it really is a nice product, and it may even improve the hair and scalp of some users.  I would give it 5-STARS except for the price.  I can&#x27;t afford pricey luxuries..</li>
            <li> I have been using the Biota Botanicals Shampoo for Thinning Hair for a little over a month and have seen a slight change in the thickness of my hair. It feels a little bit fuller, but that may be because I&#x27;ve had to use a stronger conditioner to keep it soft and fluffy - this shampoo has a drying effect on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s not bad. The fragrance is alright and it makes a nice lather. The shampoo is thick and a very dark brown color. My hair is dyed light brown and it didn&#x27;t have any effect - good or bad - on my color. I&#x27;ll continue to use it and see if after another month or so there is any additional thickening. In the meanwhile, if I want fuller-looking hair, I use volumizing mousse and a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> This product is great, it smells good, and definitely works...! I use to wake up with hair all over my pillow, no more hair loss, my hair is more soft and thicker then it use to be and I&#x27;ve definitely have notice new growth in area&#x27;s where I was starting to go bald.  I recommend this product to anyone that&#x27;s is noticing thinning or hair loss, I also recommend it for those that are not experiencing neither. Biota is a great hair product period</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for several months. My hair is in better condition now, softer, and it does feel a little thicker. I&#x27;ve noticed that my shedding has decreased, and my hair loss has noticeably slowed. I noticed less shedding in the first week of use, and the amount of shedding has been pretty consistent since about the second week. As we all know, if you can reduce the shedding enough, your new hair growth will catch up and you&#x27;ll be able to (hopefully) maintain what you have. This product has helped me quite a bit to be honest. This isn&#x27;t a miracle cure by any means, but it DOES help and for that I&#x27;m very thankful. It&#x27;s definitely worth buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004H7GB9G Natrol Biotin 10,000 mcg Maximum Strength Tablets, 100-Count]]&lt;br /&gt;Following up a few months later. I&#x27;ve now been using this shampoo for almost a year. Shedding has stayed about the same once reduced, so my hair had gotten a little thicker. I then added a vitamin supplement, Natrol Biotin 10,000 mcg (10 mg) Maximum Strength (which is honestly nothing more than folic acid and B6). Now that I&#x27;ve added the vitamin supplement about three months later I am ACTUALLY GROWING HAIR! I should post the before and after pics, but don&#x27;t have them on this computer. It&#x27;s VERY noticeable. It&#x27;s literally twice as thick as it was, and before I had almost bare scalp in the front/center. I now have hair there! Can still see the scalp a little, but it&#x27;s workable and getting better every week. The combination of the two seems to do the trick. I can&#x27;t believe this is actually working! HAPPY HAPPY!!</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo and did not see much different in my hair. I felt it dried out my hair. No shine</li>
            <li> This product smells a little funny but I have been using is now for a few weeks and I do believe it has helped some.  This is my second order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much this has helped retain hair prevent breakage, but I like how it gives my hair volume.  After I lather and let it sit for a couple minutes, I rinse out, and my hair definitely feels thicker!  More so than with other volumizing shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s worth it just for that.</li>
            <li> For me at least this stuff really worked!  It took about 2 weeks to see a real difference in my hair.  I have short gray hair, very thin and fine, but now it looks thick and you can&#x27;t see my scalp anymore.  My hair is a little wavier and harder to manage, but hey, it looks like I have some!</li>
            <li> After just two shampoos my hair is softer and definitely fuller and my blond highlights have never looked better!  Might try the serum too. VERY happy with this purchase and this is my new shampoo which I will use everyday.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought the shampoo and the serum, since I&#x27;ve tried so many fine and a few thinning hair shampoos, but you can notice a difference from the very first time. I am using it concurrently with the serum after experiencing more than normal hair loss for the past three months. I don&#x27;t know yet if it will have a lasting effect or if less hair will be falling out, since I&#x27;ve only been using this for 5 days but it definitely makes an improvement in appearance.</li>
            <li> I posted  the same detailed response in the Q&amp;A section for this product. I have been using the shampoo and serum for a couple of months now.  My scalp was very tender and eczema due developing severe sensitivity to Wen conditioner and oil products that I&#x27;d using for three years. I needed something that would allow my scalp to calm down and heal. I&#x27;ve found that the serum does just that. The shampoo has stopped all shedding, I wash my hair only twice a week, as my hair is long and fine. I use the serum daily ( I get about three to fours applications out of a bottle). I suggest using a really good conditioner after shampooing that you leave in at least 10-20 minutes. The hair on my crown and the nap of my neck were severely affected by the Wen products. From December 2014 to now (end of January 2015), I&#x27;ve seen at least 1 1/2 inches in growth where my hair was almost non-existent. I can barely see my scalp in those areas anymore. I plan to continue to use both Biota products along with a very good conditioner, as I believe more hair will continue to fill in.  I also take hair supplements, eat a lot of berries/green veggies, and massage my scalp with organic coconut oil (a few times a week) to compliment the Biota shampoo and serum regimen.</li>
            <li> I heard about Biota Botanicals on my local radio news station. Great stuff! I am an African American woman who had been having a long standing problem (years) with my hair falling out and getting incredibly thin, so I figured what did I have to loose?  After years of expensive Dermatology visits and prescription shampoos and topical creams and ointments, and thinking that maybe it was just heredity, I found that after only 3 days of using Biota Botanicals products, my hair literally stopped shedding!!!!! I could actually count the hairs that fell out! Less than 10!!!!!! I was ecstatically impressed!!!!! I have finally found something that will save me from becoming bald!!!!  Thanks Biota Botanicals!</li>
            <li> I have fine, color treated hair. When I first poured this on my hand I hesitated because it&#x27;s a deep, deep brown color. VERY Brown. I don&#x27;t think I would use this right after I had my hair highlighted for that reason. The shampoo itself smells ok; sort of a &#x27;warm&#x27; herbal odor. I am mainly concerned about losing hair round the forehead so I concentrated it there. I have to say that it makes my hair a bit dry and hard to brush while it&#x27;s wet. So then,  used my Aveda conditioner to soften my hair a bit afterwards.  As of 2 weeks, my hair feels nice but I haven&#x27;t seen a whole lot of change. I will finish the bottle but right now feel the harshness won&#x27;t be good for my hair in the long run.</li>
            <li> What a joy this shampoo is.  I have been seeking that just right shampoo for all those old fibers growing out of my scalp and this just might be the one.  Most of the other products simply provide clean, unruly hair, especially since it is so fine to begin with.  Rumors still exist that I was the originator of &#x27;morning hair&#x27; and for good reason.  Hair all over the place on the top of my head and not a speck in place.  Enter B&#x27;IOTA and the transmogrification has begun.  I started using a dime dollop and worked my way up to a nickel sized drop of the shampoo.  The final choice for me is between the 2 sizes and I leave each application on for about 2 minutes.  That is about the time it takes me to wash the skin portion of my head, arms and shoulders.  Rinse and repeat.  I now shave with an electric razor since I have to be cautious with afib and by the time I finish shaving it is rinse time again.  I do not blow dry my hair (never did) nor apply any chemicals other than deodorant.  When finished, I dry off, dress and go.  Go can and usually defines a trip to the computer to check some time sensitive programs and then hit the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too many words, but the purpose is to say not much has changed except now I have a shampoo that has superior results and leaves my hair full-bodied that stays in place all day and even into the following morning.  It is too early to test the growth factors, but for me they are not terribly significant.  The way B&#x27;iota works right now is good enough for a 5 star and any other benefits are just fluff.  Love that fluffy stuff.  Now I have to figure how to insert the correct character (&#x27;) to make the logo legitimate.  ( I visually scanned over 5,000 characters and not one satisfied the question.  Lazy me.)  This bottle will not last long because the other member of the household likes it after using it for two days.</li>
            <li> The shampoo reminds me of hair dye or coal tar. It’s a dark and ugly goo without the smell. Once it’s in, it feels like regular. We just leave it in for a few minutes before washing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions included are for both the shampoo and the serum, which they warn will darken light hair. I hope the shampoo does that, also. Maybe I won’t have to dye my hair so often. I can’t tell if it’s doing anything yet, because I dyed my hair not long before I began using Biota.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s been a few weeks. Does my hair feel thicker? I’m not sure it’s just wishful thinking, but the back of my head always looked pretty bad. There’s an area my mom fretted since I was a kid, saying it looked like I was going bald. I think it’s better now. It’s hard to tell, because I can’t see very well back there, but I don’t see it when I look in the mirrors.</li>
            <li> This Biota Botanicals product offers hope for those of us with thinning hair.  My hair shedding has increased markedly with age, and at this point I am willing to try anything.  I just haven&#x27;t been all that happy with this product.  The shampoo itself is a disturbing color of brown, and while it lathers well, I was not pleased with the scent.  It seems far too masculine for my comfort,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m aware that I most likely have not used this long enough to determine whether it actually provides good results.  It seems to dry out my hair, and after a week of use I see no measurable difference.  Because of my concerns with the scent, I will probably go back to using my regular shampoo and conditioner.  I will look for other products that promise relief from thinning hair but seem more geared toward women.</li>
            <li> Biota Botanicals Bioxsine Series Shampoo for Thinning Hair for Normal and Dry Hair, 10.1 Fluid Ounce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this for my mom, who I care for, to use with the bathing nurse. Mom has thin hair and we are hoping this will help. So far it is getting a positive reception. The nurse commented how nice it smells! I think it smells nice too. The job it did on my mom’s hair was more than nice. After a number of showers it seems to be making my mom’s hair fuller. That’s what it’s supposed to do, but we’ve been disappointed before. So far so good. It has gotten a good reception in this household.</li>
            <li> I will admit I was more than skeptical when I decided to try the Biota Botanicals Bioxsine Series Shampoo for Thinning Hair. It really sounded too good to be true. I have fine thinning hair and a sad little bald spot on the crown of my head - nothing huge but still extremely noticeable (to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the shampoo on Sept. 16 and followed the directions carefully. I massaged my scalp for the 1-1/2 to 2 minutes religiously and used the shampoo every time I washed my hair. It is now Oct. 3 and I can feel little fuzzy hairs in the bald spot! I had to get a mirror out and check and sure enough there are new hairs coming in!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed but at the same time I wonder if it could be the scalp massage more than the shampoo that is doing it. Either way, I&#x27;m thrilled about getting some new hair in! I hope it will continue to stimulate even more growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this is an herbal shampoo with such ingredients as nettles. The more natural a shampoo is, the more comfortable I am using it. The best part for me (besides the new growth) is the smell. It reminds me of the Body on Tap shampoo I used as a teen. I LOVE that smell!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Biota Botanicals Bioxsine Series Shampoo for Thinning Hair is amazing - I&#x27;m so happy I tried it!!!!</li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased with the product.  I have been using it for a few weeks and it appears as if my hair loss has been reduced.  It will probably take some more time to know for sure.  What I did notice is that my hair feels softer, smoother, and feels healthier than it has in a long time.</li>
            <li> In light of all the good reviews, I decided to purchase this product and give it a try since I was desperate for a remedy for my thinning hair.  But not only was it a waste of my money, but after the first use, it caused a lot of my hair to fall out.  Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I must say I liked the shampoo but did it do what it claims? NO not for me anyway. I wish it worked.</li>
            <li> Been using it now for about 2 weeks and have seen a difference in my hair, its a lot more thick and looks healthier. Have to use the shampoo with it. Love them both! I will definitely replenish this product.</li>
            <li> I could swear my hair is thicker after using this product. Nevertheless, I love it.</li>
            <li> This is a brown shampoo with a deep scent that&#x27;s nearly impossible to describe because it has so many scent-causing ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using it for one month. My hair got stronger, no doubt. I think it might be growing faster and that&#x27;s something to think more about.  The company claims that independent studies have shown that it increases strength of hair and stimulates hair growth in 80% of tested subjects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main ingredient is bioxsine. I haven&#x27;t noted any side effects from it. I think bioxsine is just a trade name for a mix of botanicals - any mix as long as it is used by the company. I looked it up and the primary documents state that the &amp;#34;bioxsine&amp;#34; has no meaning apart from its use on the product.</li>
            <li> My wife really is impressed with its results</li>
            <li> First think I noticed is the look.&lt;br /&gt;Looks and reminds me of motor oil.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell or if it does even have an odor it is very light since I couldn&#x27;t smell it?&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, been using it a month now and can&#x27;t personally notice any extra hair or thickening so maybe it takes a while to work it&#x27;s magic..&lt;br /&gt;Good thing is I haven&#x27;t seen increased thinning either.&lt;br /&gt;Will have to wait and see.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this shampoo for about a month now and is a big fan of it.  He says that it makes his hair feel fuller.  He was worried at first because the shampoo comes out of the bottle colored brown.  He did not want to end up with dyed hair; his is white and we both like it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see that is hair is better conditioned but not any of the other effects.  It matters to the one using it more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it only a month and have noticed a big difference in my hair. I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I am cursed with no so great genes, both in the hair department and health department.  I have very thin and fine hair that is made worse by medications I take for arthritis.  I have tried many products out there to minimize my hair loss and maximize what hair I have, with mediocre results.  I am currently on my second bottle of the Biota shampoo and am still happy with the results.  My hair loss doesn&#x27;t seem as much and the shampoo does add body to my short hair.  I do use my own conditioner after, but on the occasions I have used only the shampoo, my hair has felt soft after.</li>
