            <li>This one is the best buy out of all</li>
            <li>but this one is great!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ergonomics: The best of the breed.</li>
            <li>The shave heads are angled perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome feature and one you will (or should) use often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer</li>
            <li>/&gt;Vortex cleaning system leaks a bit, and is sticky, not the best scent</li>
            <li>Compared to this wonderful device, I had been shaving with the equivalents of garden rakes all my life!</li>
            <li>Great Job Panasonic!!!!</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ES8109S provides me with an excellent shave.  </li>
            <li>Best electric razor I have owned.</li>

            <li>The HydraClean System does an excellent job of cleaning.</li>
            <li>The price is excellent for the quality of the razor.</li>
            <li>The best feature of this razor is the wet/dry capability.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the shave I get, and the HydraClean system is convenient.  </li>
            <li>When I buy something I want the best I can afford.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for the job.</li>
            <li>Buying another one just like it is about the best recommendation you can get.</li>
            <li>this is the best ever, my son loves it.</li>
            <li>And that my friends, gave me the best shave of my life!  </li>
            <li>Under those conditions, the Panasonic gave me the best shave that I can remember.  </li>
            <li>The best of any electric shaver that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Looking forward to shaving without water and soap and getting my face conditioned for this wonderful shaver.</li>
            <li>I Googled the best electric shavers, and this one was on the list.  </li>
            <li>Happy Shaving!</li>
            <li>I have owned Braun shavers for years and have been very happy with them.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is no exception, it is the best shaver I have owned.  </li>
            <li>Amazon was excellent to deal with on the return.  </li>
            <li>All in all, this is one of the best things I have every done for my face.    </li>
            <li>I went from a rotary to this shaver and have been very happy.</li>
            <li>Best shaver I ever bought.</li>
            <li>and this is the best one ever.</li>
            <li>No matter what anyone says, an electric will never shave as close as a blade, but this one does the best job of any electric I&#x27;ve had over the years.</li>
            <li>, I am VERY impressed with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Because of that experience I was prepared to give Braun a try this time but when I went over all the electric razor reviews I could find the Panasonic once again sounded the best.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the job.     </li>
            <li>I was very impressed with the unit.</li>
            <li>you want the best shave you can get regardless</li>
            <li>-To best shave the sides of your cheeks along the jawline up the sideburns</li>
            <li>This shaver is the best thing since sliced bread.  </li>
            <li>My husband said this is the best gift he has ever had</li>
            <li>Service was excellent with delivery as promised.</li>
            <li>The best part, a bonus if you will, is the Panasonic is water-resistant.</li>
            <li>However, all of that being said, this is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>think this is an excellent razor.  </li>
            <li>I think this is an excellent razor.  </li>
            <li>I did read in a consumer&#x27;s report where it&#x27;s best to stick to one type of electric shaver, so I may be destined to stay with a rotary shaver.</li>
            <li>I realized that you have to know the grain of your beard to get the best of this shaver.</li>
            <li>I replaced a Braun with this Panasonic and have been very happy.  </li>
            <li>The panasonic razor is a great razor!  </li>
            <li>I bout this 3 years ago and the best investment in years.</li>
            <li>An excellent value in this price range.</li>
            <li>Braun 1 was an excellent shaver that cost around $80 - $100.  </li>
            <li>All that to say I believe this is the best electric razor I have ever owned, and</li>
            <li>Well, after using this shaver for almost two months now, I have to say it is the best shaver I could imagine using.</li>
            <li>I gave up electric shavers years ago but tried this on a lark and am impressed.  </li>
            <li>And the cleaning unit was awesome.  </li>
            <li>He says that it works best when used with shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with the quality of workmanship.</li>
            <li>Best price for the features and technology, including the cleaning unit.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re both very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Best shaver ever.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with this shaver after about one week.</li>
            <li>I purchased this unit after researching it for 2 weeks and found that for the price it had the best review.  </li>
            <li>have also had almost all brands of electrics, from the best models of Norelco, Braun, Remington, etc.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>The King Of Shaves line is THE BEST for anyones skin.</li>
            <li>This razor works amazingly!!!</li>
            <li>Used it in the shower too and all in all, an excellent value for the money.</li>
            <li>but this one is the best I&#x27;ve ever bought.  </li>
            <li>For those of us who prefer a foil headed shaver, this is one of the best I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>No need for concern as he said it&#x27;s the best razor he&#x27;s ever had.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is awesome and if you&#x27;ve read this review you have to buy one!</li>
            <li>Great birthday gift for him!!!!!!!!!    </li>
            <li>I have been amazed at how great this works!!  </li>
            <li>and it still works great!!</li>
            <li>know Panasonic makes the best shavers out there (from my experience) but</li>
            <li>is the best invention ever.  </li>
            <li>Close shave each time and the battery life is awesome.</li>
            <li>After 1 month of using this shaver, I&#x27;m convinced it is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Great deal!  </li>
            <li>One of the best shavers I have owned!</li>
            <li>AWESOME!!</li>
            <li>Awesome.  </li>
            <li>Razor is the best of the newer razors on the market today.</li>
            <li>I miss my norelco from 20 years ago because it gave the best shave.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The razor is truly superb.</li>
            <li>A great Shaver!</li>
            <li>Happy shopping!</li>
            <li>Excellent razor.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Showed up on time, and in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a blade for decades, but decided to try an electric razor to see how close it comes to the excellent shave provided by a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best of all, the motor provides a \\&quot;linear\\&quot; performance throughout the battery&#x27;s charge, and doesn&#x27;t drop off as the battery charge is diminished.  </li>
            <li>An excellent value for the Amazon price!</li>
            <li>In summary, my husband has been shaving for over 4 decades and he says this is THE best shaver he has ever owned.</li>
            <li>Perfect</li>
            <li>The shaver really is awesome.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li>Going against the grain has the best results that I&#x27;ve noticed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months and haven&#x27;t replaced the cleaning catridge or the water and still get excellent results.  </li>
            <li>Best razor I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>My husband said this was the best razor he ever had.  </li>
            <li>and this works perfectly for him.</li>
            <li>does he love it!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did!!!</li>
            <li>Interestingly, it shaves also 3 days beard!!!</li>
            <li>It is awesome in that aspect too as it gives an incredibly close shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li>All of the reviews were very good</li>
            <li>ll in all a very good razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shave quality: Just about on par with the Braun, which is very, very good.</li>
            <li>I got a very good deal on the ES8109S Vortex, which makes it easier to appreciate.</li>
            <li>Very good.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good shaver.</li>
            <li>This shaver is very good when it is working.  </li>
            <li>Very good cleaning   device.</li>
            <li>Incredible.      </li>
            <li>and I must say that the closeness of the shave with shaving cream is incredible.  </li>
            <li>you will get an incredibly close shave that lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>Works great best electric razor I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with this shaver and got it at a great deal.</li>
            <li>This is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced from an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>Recharging station works great and cleans the shaver perfectly every time.  </li>
            <li>Cons:  The cleaning and drying selections on the stand aren&#x27;t incredibly intuitive, however.</li>
            <li>I use a wonderful Body Shop shaving cream and a great set of blades and razor.  </li>
            <li>Good purchase indeed!</li>
            <li>This is perhaps the best product of any kind that I have purchased in years!</li>
            <li>For my money, Norelco is superior!</li>
            <li>frankly it feels quite good for the face!     </li>
            <li>Every bit as good!  </li>
            <li>Definitely a good buy!</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s how good it looks!</li>
            <li>side burn trimmer is excellent, and very handy in trimming unruly hair - I&#x27;d imagine it would do a great job for trimming mustaches, although I don&#x27;t have one.  </li>
            <li>I shave my head bald, and my beautiful face,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with too, it does a good job</li>
            <li>It is also ergonomic and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>It is a good razor with excellent shipping.  </li>
            <li>and I must say I am very pleased and impressed with it.  </li>
            <li>the shave is really very good and surprisingly close.  </li>
            <li>The charging/cleaning stand is a very good idea and gives you a good place to store it between shaves.</li>
            <li>I am completely happy with this shaver and highyl recommend it.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>Great Shaver.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 4 month&#x27;s now and it works great.  </li>
            <li>I can shave faster and get a great shave.</li>
            <li>I thought the self cleaning was a gimmick, but it it great.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>LOL.    </li>
            <li>So unless I shave every 2 days, this shaver isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>It is great for on-the-go</li>
            <li>The neck still burned, but this time I was prepared with post shave lotion and that helped out greatly.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>I got this product in June, and I am really happy with the purchase</li>
            <li>WHAT&#x27;S ALSO GREAT</li>
            <li>the Panasonic is a great investment.  </li>
            <li>the price is great as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a trimmin, choppin&#x27; machine that does provide a great close shave.  </li>
            <li>happy</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m happy and still trying.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Gives a great close shave.</li>
            <li>This product worked great for me.</li>
            <li>After that it is great.  </li>
            <li>Great with lather in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Great buy.  </li>
            <li>I would reccomend this to anyone, great product.</li>
            <li>It is great.</li>
            <li>Considering the great reviews this gets</li>
            <li>The lone \\&quot;pro\\&quot; for this razor is that it&#x27;s sideburn trimmer is great.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t shaved in two days and the shave was great.  </li>
            <li>I immediately ordered this model and have been a happy customer for 5 days.  </li>
            <li>Having the HydraClean is great too.  </li>
            <li>This is a great razor.</li>
            <li>Keep up the great techology Develpoement.</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with this shaver.</li>
            <li>It is still running great.  </li>
            <li>He says it shaves great and stays charged.</li>
            <li>That was a great decision.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is great.</li>
            <li>The way it shaves in the shower is great for him.  </li>
            <li>This is the closest shave I&#x27;ve experienced with an electric razor.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t see the proud nanotechnology.</li>
            <li>Owned for over a year and still working great.</li>
            <li>great.</li>
            <li>It never quite gave a great shave</li>
            <li>the fact that I can use shaving cream is great.  </li>
            <li>One great feature is that you dont have to use the cleaner if you don&#x27;t want to or can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>it does a great job.  </li>
            <li>This shaver works great</li>
            <li>It shaves close, does not irritate my skin and the cleaning module is great.  </li>
            <li>The self-cleaning system is a great way to shave and forget it.</li>
            <li>This is a GREAT shaver.  </li>
            <li>Battery life is great</li>
            <li>And it gives a great shave every time.</li>
            <li>I think it is the 3 blade system, but whatever it is its great.</li>
            <li>I can see all the wiskers, and my face feels great after shaving.</li>
            <li>and it still works great.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li>I have never been happy with an electric shaver until now.  </li>
            <li>But the end result now is a great shave.  </li>
            <li>cleaning station works great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great shaver and cleaning system.  </li>
            <li>It is improved and works great</li>
            <li>He needed a shaver that works great in the shower and this was the one.</li>
            <li>Great item.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This product has been working great for me.</li>
            <li>the cleaning feature works great</li>
            <li>The cleaning feature was a great idea.</li>
            <li>This is a great find and cheaper than buying it in the store.</li>
            <li>It works great.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning system is great except when away from home</li>
            <li>But, now speaking about 4 weeks into it, I can honestly say I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li>The Braun gave me a great shave</li>
            <li>The Panasonic has been great for the two weeks I&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li>Until then, I&#x27;ll be happy using this one.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Panasonic ES8109S Vortex Wet/Dry Shaver in mid-December 2008 at a great price.  </li>
            <li>Altho I will admit that I also use Neutrogena after shave lotion which helps out greatly.    </li>
            <li>With a great shave, the ability to go into the shower with you, and a price well below The Braun, Panasonic has the winner here.  </li>
            <li>This is the type of shaver a person can use for years, with replacing the foils, of course, and be completely happy with.</li>
            <li>The shaver is great.</li>
            <li>A charging stand would greatly increase the convenience of this shaver.</li>
            <li>anyhow, my dad raves how great it is and how it doesn&#x27;t bother his skin at all</li>
            <li>It still is giving me a great shave.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need to worry about packing shaving cream when I fly.</li>
            <li>It still works great.</li>
            <li>and I realy like it,does a great job.</li>
            <li>great battery life...</li>
            <li>I think this was a great product.</li>
            <li>It has been great.</li>
            <li>the products I use to obtain a great shave.  </li>
            <li>All the great reviews are true,this is the elite of electric shavers and should cost twice what you&#x27;ll get it for on Amazon.</li>
            <li>but Im happy to have been proved otherwise.  </li>
            <li>and I got it at a great price.   </li>
            <li>The self cleaning feature works great</li>
            <li>The Panasonic came on Amazon for a great price and decided to give a try.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great shaver, however, I don&#x27;t know why they bother to include the cleaner / charger stand.  </li>
            <li>Great shaver.</li>
            <li>and I get great results every time I use the razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for about 2 months now and happy with this model.</li>
            <li>it does a great job on shaving my face</li>
            <li>It sometimes does not give a great shave in the neck area.</li>
            <li>Great gift item.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, great product if you&#x27;re looking for a great shave.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>But that has been resolved and Mr. Fussy is happy as a pig in mud with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this was a great electric shaver for the money.  </li>
            <li>I got this device after using my dad&#x27;s ES8077S (which is also a great shaver mind you).</li>
            <li>Amazon is a great place for just this purpose.  </li>
            <li>Their policies allow a great deal of freedom when shopping and it works to the buyers favor.  </li>
            <li>purchased the Panasonic when Amazon was having a great sale, and ended up paying about $75 for it -</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does a great job and close shave.</li>
            <li>Shaves great if it works.</li>
            <li>Great razor, would recommend and buy again from Amazon.</li>
            <li>The wet/dry is great.  </li>
            <li>am I glad I did!!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!!.</li>
            <li>The automatic cleaning cycle is very nice as well.</li>
            <li>Plus, you get the cleaning system which is very nice as well.</li>
            <li>I am in no way kidding with you, and am in fact being very honest,</li>
            <li>The self cleaning and charging dock is very nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the cleaning system is very nice</li>
            <li>this shaves very nicely, you must follow the recommend directions and allow 30 days for body to adjust to shaving in this manner.</li>
            <li>Im very happy with it, I used it on week ends, great to have , love the product</li>
            <li>The results are amazing!  </li>
            <li>What I find remarkable is that over 200 people gave this a favorable review.    </li>
            <li>I was getting the most absolutely perfect shave you could think of or envision.    </li>
            <li>To each their own I guess!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall good, product at a great price.</li>
            <li>This electric shaver is the best of the many I&#x27;ve had through the years.  </li>
            <li>It is a beautiful piece of hardware, well balanced with perfect fit and finish.  </li>
            <li>If it works as good as it does now, great.  </li>
            <li>The Braun has a slightly better shave, but the Panasonic is the best if you shave in the shower.</li>
            <li>Product is popular for a reason.!</li>
            <li>In fact, it&#x27;s fully immersible, if you feel like shaving underwater! :p  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m looking forward to more years with another wonderful razor.</li>
            <li>This shaver is the best of the many electric shavers I have owned.  </li>
            <li>I was more than impressed.</li>
            <li>He shaves more often, gets a closer shave and best of all the cleaning system</li>
            <li>razor is Good to Great 4 stars</li>
            <li>I will say that the shaver fits very nicely into one&#x27;s hand, and being a Panasonic, will probably be fairly trouble-free.</li>
            <li>Best shaver I ever had own, by the way this was the 5th shaver I own,</li>
            <li>so try to get it with the lowest price available and you, too, can have an excellent product at a great steal.</li>
            <li>easily the best I&#x27;ve ever owned, and the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>and he loved it, so I switched to Norelco too.  </li>
            <li>but the results were not so good when I did.  </li>
            <li>I have been searching for a good shaver for my head and face for years.</li>
            <li>I use it in a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; fashion, and the shave quality is good.  </li>
            <li>good soldier never needs a shave/haircut).</li>
            <li>Nivea is supposed to have a good cooling one, and again Billy Jealousy is supposed to have good after shave balm as well.  </li>
            <li>The battery is good for well over a week.</li>
            <li>thinking that this was as good as it gets with an electric.</li>
            <li>It was never as good as a blade</li>
            <li>Dry/wet is good</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>So, we read good reviews about the Panasonic shaver and decided to purchase one as a Father&#x27;s Day gift for him.</li>
            <li>I tried this linear shaver and it still cuts surprisingly close.</li>
            <li>I gave the Panasonic a fair chance but over all my face felt irritated</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall - Good product - value for money.</li>
            <li>well built and good quality.</li>
            <li>bottomline - good shaving results.</li>
            <li>He likes the cleaning feature and the trimmer and gets a good close shave.</li>
            <li>I think this razor is as good as any electric razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a good shave.  </li>
            <li>I like this shaver works good.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as a razor</li>
            <li>The one drawback is the it doesn&#x27;t seem to do quite as good a job on my neck</li>
            <li>Does not give a good shave at all.</li>
            <li>Yes battery life good.</li>
            <li>All is good except the noise of the cleaning and drying.  </li>
            <li>Good product design.</li>
            <li>I like the foil razors over the rotary blade shavers and this is a good buy for the $$.  </li>
            <li>The HydraClean system is not as good as Braun&#x27;s, but hey: by then you are shaved.</li>
            <li>Good going for Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I have used a razor blade type shaver (two &amp; four blade) for over forty years and thought I was getting a good shave.</li>
            <li>It is a replacement for a Braun 8585, which performed well, but was not as good as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Closest shave ever, nice feel, and great cleaning system.</li>
            <li>It worked fairly well, but always irritated my neck.    </li>
            <li>three weeks off use my shaves are as good  </li>
            <li>As my Schick quatro and are consisitant.the blade is good for two days but begins to fade after that.</li>
            <li>This shaver is as good as the 320.00 Braun shaver.</li>
            <li>Shave is amazingly good and no irritation.  </li>
            <li>This does as good a job shaving me as my blade and foam without the hassle.</li>
            <li>easy to clean and the BEST BEST shave I have ever received.  </li>
            <li>The shave is almost as good but not quite.</li>
            <li>&quot;  Good decision.     </li>
            <li>Optionally recharges with just the cord; good for extended travel.    </li>
            <li>Read all the good things everyone has to say about Panasonic and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I figured that was Panasonic&#x27;s way of saying, \\&quot;Electrics don&#x27;t shave as good as a blade, but give it 30 days</li>
            <li>The Panasonic is giving me just as good a shave as the Braun did.  </li>
            <li>Very impressive shave results at a fantastic price point.  </li>
            <li>I bought this model after reading a number good reviews about this shaver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about 9 months, and it does a good job.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s that good.  </li>
            <li>It works great, gives you a nice shave, and I \\&quot;think\\&quot;</li>
            <li>For a good shave I use Williams</li>
            <li>but it does a good job.</li>
            <li>It works everywhere good except for my neck somtimes</li>
            <li>If there&#x27;s an electric razor out there that does that good of a job I would like to know about it.  </li>
            <li>However the trimmer cannot trim hair too good.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I did not shave with the Pulsonic and took the recommendation of others who had.</li>
            <li>using it in Afghanistan now good for on the go</li>
            <li>I got the ES8109s for around $86 here at Amazon before Christmas and was delighted.  </li>
            <li>He likes the cleaning feature, although it took him a while to get used to it - the directions weren&#x27;t as good as they should have been.</li>
            <li>This product was a good buy.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this shaver for a good, close shave.  </li>
            <li>I guess if it&#x27;s good for 007</li>
            <li>That was a good sign.</li>
            <li>This razor is not as good as the Norelco on shaving the curves under your neck</li>
            <li>On a good day, it gets about 90% of the job done.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good on my face but not on my neck.  </li>
            <li>whereas the Braun block and foil were good for 18 months and cost around $40-45 dollars to replace.</li>
            <li>Good shaver, I like the cleaning station.</li>
            <li>Trimmer works good on sideburns too.</li>
            <li>Its a good stubble remover.</li>
            <li>but anyway it is good for me</li>
            <li>Good close shave, good ergonomics.</li>
            <li>In both of those qualifiers, this was a good purchase.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Panasonic ES8109S in Dec. 2011 and have never had an electric shaver as good as this one.  </li>
            <li>Good battery life  3.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve preferred to use in the shower but never wanted to spend +$100 to get a good one.  </li>
            <li>This shaver gives a good close shave.</li>
            <li>Always had good service from them</li>
            <li>He is delighted.  </li>
            <li>sometimes let my beard grow for 2 days and still get a good shave.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m happy that he liked it and uses it.</li>
            <li>razor does a good job.</li>
            <li>I would think in this class of razor in this price point that the cleaning machine would be as good as the razor remember that the cleaning unit has a monthly cost of cleaner cartridges of $4 a month so in a years time you are in the $225</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s my situation, I&#x27;m fair skinned and somewhat acne prone.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good to go.</li>
            <li>When used with shaving cream as good as a blade razor and easier on the skin.  </li>
            <li>The electric razor seemed like a good place to start.    </li>
            <li>No matter what you buy, good luck in your shopping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good razor.</li>
            <li>Fair  razor.  </li>
            <li>There is also a drying mode, but I haven&#x27;t figured out a good use for that yet.  </li>
            <li>Bought this shaver for my boyfriend and he loved it.</li>
            <li>This shaver does a good job.</li>
            <li>Does a good job.</li>
            <li>The good things about this shaver are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shaver does a good job.  </li>
            <li>I was very favorably impressed with this shaver and agree and thank all those who wrote good reports about it before!</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ES8109S Vortex wet/dry shaver with nano technology and hydra clean system is the best shaver I ever used.</li>
            <li>Works beautifully and love the battery life marker.</li>
            <li>unit looks impressive and I realized that I had just purchased the best electric razor in my life, after several purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You see, to get the best (and most comfortable!)</li>
            <li>This product is designed exceptionally well and performs to my highest expectations.  </li>
            <li>For the most part I have to work at it to get most hairs, about 95% at best.</li>
            <li>All in all, this shaver performed exceptionally well throughout</li>
            <li>I read so VERY MANY reviews, on this site and others, and I looked into all the \\&quot;technology\\&quot; that goes into the shavers.  </li>
            <li>and it is great being able to use it in the shower.   </li>
            <li>Worth the buy, excellent price for this shaver!</li>
            <li>and I am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the Panasonic ES8109S.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the cleaning/charging functions and the number of shaves per charge.</li>
            <li>This has been great if you shave every 3-4 days you will love it.</li>
            <li>We are very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Quality, stylish, and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>I replace another brands shaver with the Panasonic and I have been very pleased.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this razor.  </li>
            <li>All in all, a wonderful shaver and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been very pleased.  </li>
            <li>However, it seems to one-up the Braun in one very interesting</li>
            <li>I finish up shaving off my goatee and am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Panasonic wet/dry and have been very pleased.  </li>
            <li>i was very pleased with the razor that i order for my husband for christmas  </li>
            <li>I am a very light bearded guy, YMMV!</li>
            <li>Replaced my Braun shaver w/ this unit and am very satisfied with the performance, battery life of the shaver and cleaning unit.</li>
            <li>Have owned this shaver for a year now and am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, good things come to an end, and this amazing device eventually gave up the ghost.</li>
            <li>2 stars, Great Idea but has many downfalls.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaner is a great Idea for sure but for a $150+ razor</li>
            <li>/&gt;Solid charger, great self-cleaning, better cut than any razor have ever</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;m extremely happy with my purchase and don&#x27;t think you can get much more for your money.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with that.  </li>
            <li>A++ for closeness of shave, as good as a blade.&lt;br /&gt;Practical , flexible, looks nice and blows away the competition.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that I am glad I did!  </li>
            <li>The first gave me the best shave ever - then died after 2 years.  </li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m quite impressed with it for a first shaver -</li>
            <li>The closer the better for him!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>and he said it&#x27;s better than he could have imagined!  </li>
            <li>I love this shaver!</li>
            <li>He tried it out and love it!</li>
            <li>First use, perfect shave.  </li>
            <li>$200 or more for a razor?!  </li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>The first time I used the razor I was really impressed.</li>
            <li>But I was immediately impressed with the Vortex after the first use, I had to write a review.  </li>
            <li>First off let me say that this Panasonic Razor is excellent.</li>
            <li>From the first day I used this shaver, I knew it was going to be my best electric razor ever.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I did!</li>
            <li>I say more?!  </li>
            <li>And the service I received from Panasonic was outstanding!</li>
            <li>Wife does not worry about cuts any more!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re both great shavers, and in the end you&#x27;ll be pretty happy with both.  </li>
            <li>charger/cleaner is easy to use and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>According to him: it gives a closer shave, is easy to use, and the self cleaning function is great.</li>
            <li>This shaver is hands down the best shaver that I have ever used, and best of all, it cleans itself!  </li>
            <li>You first unplug the unit!!!!</li>
            <li>It is very smooth, quit and the fact that it is just as good in the shower or at the sink, is mind boggling.</li>
            <li>Amazing.  </li>
            <li>The charge life is amazing as well.</li>
            <li>Great batterly life with  smooth, close shaves without irritation.  </li>
            <li>No nicks, no pulls, just a great smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I use it with shaving cream and it works amazingly.  </li>
            <li>The rpm&#x27;s are amazing.  </li>
            <li>This electric shaver is AMAZING.      </li>
            <li>This thing is amazing.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic shaver is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>And the HydraClean System is amazing.    </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>battery life on this thing is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This shaver deals with them all nicely.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say...</li>
            <li>It is nice not to have to use shaving cream.</li>
            <li>The self-clean feature is also nice when I&#x27;m done with it</li>
            <li>I kind of use a swirling motion, then horizontal strokes, followed by verticle movement.</li>
            <li>I have read some reviews that say the self cleaning mode is somewhat noisy but honestly can&#x27;t say that we have noticed that problem.</li>
            <li>but its a nice feature and Panasonic does not use an alcohol based cleaner</li>
            <li>He is THRILLED.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled, and so is my fiancé.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>The shave is identical between the two Panasonics (8103/8109) that I own.</li>
            <li>The cleaner is nice and seems to keep the blades sharper.</li>
            <li>My step-son had a Panasonic and liked it, so I decided to purchase it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still loving this shaver.</li>
            <li>The automatic cleaning system is a nice feature but haven&#x27;t used it yet.</li>
            <li>but I liked the fact that it could use lotion and be used in the shower.  </li>
            <li>He loves it and it looks nice sitting on the counter</li>
            <li>he has been using it and loving it evryday..</li>
            <li>but honestly I speak the truth.</li>
            <li>The floating head is probably nice for some people: I don&#x27;t care for it</li>
            <li>, I have bought a really nice shaver for myself that was over 40.00.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent shaver that is very versatile.</li>
            <li>the others have a lot of catching up to do.</li>
            <li>Now I have more time in the morning to spend with my kid, and that is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not wanting to shell out again for another series 7, I settled on this as a cheaper (hopefully almost as effective) alternative... and received it for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With warm water flushed through the shaver head</li>
            <li>The shaver head foams up with the water and soap, and I just rinse it out in running warm water.  </li>
            <li>I bought this shaver about six months ago and waited to see if I still liked it after some use before writing a review.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic ES8109S Men&#x27;s 3 Blade Arc3 Wet/Dry Nanotech Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Vortex Cleaning System - Silver - Liked the product.</li>
            <li>The Vortex container provides a handy, compact and convenient storage recharging station so for that reason alone</li>
            <li>In any case, it really is the best razor I ever bought.  </li>
            <li>In any case, it really is the best razor I ever bought.  </li>
            <li>I noticed my neck was kind of itchy which has since subsided.  </li>
            <li>I have now used the Panasonic every day for a couple of months now and am still thrilled with the purchase.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of good.&lt;br /&gt;shaving</li>
            <li>: I had hoped that the four blades of the Panasonic ES8243A just might be able to give a superior shave.</li>
            <li>I liked having a cleaning unit, so I decided to give the Panasonic a try.  </li>
            <li>For the negatives:  Honestly, I could swear I&#x27;ve gotten a closer shave with the Panasonic ES4026NC</li>
            <li>Nice, close shave with practically no irritation.</li>
            <li>Takes longer to shave than a blade, but the convenience is nice.</li>
            <li>It takes some time for your skin to get used to this eletric razor, but that really goes for any electric razor...but as soon as your face and neck is used to this razor it is awesome from there!</li>
            <li>nice machine  </li>
            <li>And the shave I get is nice and close.</li>
            <li>It does work as advertised and is a nice addition, but if price was my biggest concern</li>
            <li>As you would expect, takes awhile (weeks) for face to warm up up to using electric razor vs blade.  </li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best shave I ever received from any electric shaver.....</li>
            <li>It is equally effective at a 10 percent remaining charge as it is at 100 percent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I want him to look nice.  </li>
            <li>and I am happy to say I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>The HydraClean system is great for cleaning the unit when I am in a hurry and don&#x27;t want to take the time to clean it by hand.  </li>
            <li>The self clean system works great</li>
            <li>The cost was high (retail) but I found that Amazon had the best price and trust me, I looked everywhere!!  </li>
            <li>Hesitant at first, I told him the reviews were very good and asked him to try it.</li>
            <li>Awesome, I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Very nice, close shave, and still using the original blades.</li>
            <li>The rave reviews were true and the use of this shaver is great.  </li>
            <li>I am VERY pleased with both the shave quality and LOVE the automatic cleaning function   with this razor.</li>
            <li>My new ES8109S is absolutely great!  </li>
            <li>This Nano technology that the New Panasonic Wet/Dry Shaver uses is the best shave that in my 56yrs.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with my purchase of a new Panasonic ES8109S razor.</li>
            <li>This new razor is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>After ordering it a Amazon.com I was happy with how quickly it was shipped and at my front door.</li>
            <li>Well let me start by saying I have owned many electical shavers before that I thought were wonderful, but this one unlike the others, really is.    </li>
            <li>I really enjoy the fact you can dunk the head under a warm running faucet and clean it brilliantly.  </li>
            <li>And I can honestly say that this is by far the best shaver that I have ever used.     </li>
            <li>This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used at the most reasonable price for a shaver of the quality of the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>It fit perfectly in my hand, had the closest shave I have experienced so far, was good around the neck, and was comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Amazon return was very easy.</li>
            <li>It is VERY easy.  </li>
            <li>The wet/dry feature makes cleaning very easy.</li>
            <li>Very easy to set up and use</li>
            <li>He seems very happy with it so far!</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean, holds a charge nice, and does a good job shaving.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not knocking the razor, it&#x27;s awesome, just making sure you are realistic in your expectations.    </li>
            <li>Having gone through many electrics in my quest for a decent shave, I believe I can state that this is the best in it&#x27;s class...</li>
            <li>I was pretty happy with that shave, and thought that once my neck, and particularly my adams apple got used to it, this thing would be awesome.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a good looking tool (always important).  </li>
            <li>and this is the best so far).</li>
            <li>but so far so good!!  </li>
            <li>and it is by far the best shaver I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>still get an amazingly close shave and covers the more tricky areas (neck / chin)</li>
            <li>B000VKZMHK Panasonic ES8109S Vortex Wet/Dry Shaver with Nano Technology and HydraClean System]]This is by far the best shaver that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>For an electric shaver, this model was the best by far.  </li>
            <li>Nice to be able to wash/</li>
            <li>So far I am very, very happy.</li>
            <li>I bought this razor about a month ago and it is by far the best razor I&#x27;ve ever come across.</li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, the Panasonic ES8109S Vortex is the best of the lot.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best shaver EVER!   </li>
            <li>but it is by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned -- if you&#x27;re judging based on the process of shaving and the end</li>
            <li>My best purchase of 2012 so far.</li>
            <li>OK, so I have decided to stop being a review parasite (I often look to reviews to help me in buying decisions, but don&#x27;t write my own review).  </li>
            <li>Given the results of the shave so far, I am thoroughly impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for over 20 years, both linear and rotary, and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best electric shaver I have used from the quality of shave I get from it.  </li>
            <li>So far so good!!!</li>
            <li>I can honestly say it&#x27;s a better shaver.  </li>
            <li>I read about it being a comfortable good shave.</li>
            <li>the travel shaver from Braun (as close shaving capability) and the best so far from everything I tried.</li>
            <li>The best part is the complete lack of irritation.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best system I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Never been more satisfied with any purchase I have ever made (and am very glad I didn&#x27;t spend $200 plus on a Braun)</li>
            <li>: The integrated trimmer is the best I have seen - it is stronger than the Braun and Norelco and also very well positioned to easily reach your face.</li>
            <li>In a sense, he was right; the shaver got the job done, but I now know that it takes a truly great product to get the job done WELL.  </li>
            <li>great right?</li>
            <li>i am convinced that it delivers a much closer shave while being more comfortable and economical - so its a win / win / win every which way.</li>
            <li>The cutters and head, original to the shaver, were still providing good service.  </li>
            <li>Great shaver, cuts close and easy to keep clean even without the hydraclean system.  </li>
            <li>He looks good, looks clean shaven, and we&#x27;ve heard no complaints.</li>
            <li>The shave is good if the shaver is kept clean.</li>
            <li>I switched from razor blade to this electric razor and experienced no discomfort even the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>Worked great until the cleaner stopped draining after I replaced the cartridge the first time.</li>
            <li>I used it when I shaved my head for the first time and it worked great.    </li>
            <li>I have been using this razor for about 3 months and am pretty happy with the performance.</li>
            <li>As a first time user of an electric razor, I am so happy with my choice.</li>
            <li>This is a great shaver, clean it with water, since its wet/dry and it does result in a smooth shave on your skin.</li>
            <li>The charge indicator is now in percent and is very accurate--</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable to shave with gel/cream.</li>
            <li>I like to use some baby powder on the face to help make it a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>He had a very old Norelco that just wasn&#x27;t doing a very good job anymore.</li>
            <li>(I refuse to buy the Braun Pulsonic since they feel very cheap in the hand, in my opinion, and have integrated blades/shaver screens that cannot be cleaned out with a brush.)  </li>
            <li>I also use this to keep my head shaved and it does a very smooth job of that as well.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth shave and ease of use.</li>
            <li>I like the feel of the floating head, as it makes it very comfortable and equalizes pressure.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very comfortable razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the end though, a good post shave lotion can take care of that quickly.  </li>
            <li>To be honest it was good for the first 3 months and after that....</li>
            <li>a good quick shave.</li>
            <li>Therefore, it took some really positive reviews and a great Amazon price to tempt me into this one.</li>
            <li>So far the results are very good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far the results are very good.  </li>
            <li>Applying more pressure causes a pain on the skin.</li>
            <li>so I used that brand of shaver for many years.  </li>
            <li>but the point I am making is that you should get the best pre electric shave lotion (not foam) you can (avoid the drug store stuff if possible).  </li>
            <li>About a month ago,I told my wife that I was going to try one more electric razor.</li>
            <li>the electronics companies might hawk as the latest thing might not translate into a better shave.    </li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>so I can so for sure I am a convert.</li>
            <li>I have used many electric shavers over the years, even Braun for my head and face.</li>
            <li>You cannot get any closer than this shaver for a nice smooth shinny head.</li>
            <li>I read reviews, researched and found many men recommend this Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I used it every day for three weeks and the results did not get better.</li>
            <li>After a year, I am reasonably pleased with the performance.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve all heard the claims of a closer shave from so many razor manufactures that it doesn&#x27;t phase us any longer.</li>
            <li>love the self-cleaning system of the razor, and the fact that it also dries the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>because most of the time it takes a degree in engineering to set things up.  </li>
            <li>It also means I can&#x27;t get away with a crappy shave, it makes the Joe Dirt effect much more pronounced.    </li>
            <li>I thought there could be a better way, without lathering up and forgetting to pick up more razors when I run out.    </li>
            <li>Lesson one, use this for one or maybe two days&#x27; growth at most (for me, your mileage may vary).</li>
            <li>This is certainly a more flexible and forgiving arrangement.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been many years since I used an electric shaver, but I can still remember the irritation of the skin that I endured.</li>
            <li>I bought this razor and am totally satisfied with how it shaves.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this for anyone who is looking for a great electric shaver at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I use to be able to shave in a couple of mins, now it takes about 10 mins.</li>
            <li>We are both extremely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I figured I&#x27;d have the winning combo nailed.  </li>
            <li>Still not \\&quot;AS CLOSE AS A BLADE WITHOUT THE IRRITATION!!\\&quot; like so many of these companies claim.      </li>
            <li>Cheaper than buying tons of blades, but more irritation if you aren&#x27;t used to electrics.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Norelco&#x27;s all my life and they&#x27;ve done the job, but I&#x27;ve always thought they could do a bit better.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t see how you can do better than this shaver.</li>
            <li>I used to have Braun and Philips Norelco shavers and I decided to upgrade to a better one.</li>
            <li>I am glad to report that it passed the test with flying colors.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with the Panasonic ES8109S Wet/Dry Shaver.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten chafed by having to run the shaver over stubbly areas too  many times; But at the price this unit is more than satisfactory.</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Glad I did.</li>
            <li>The nono technology are phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I feel its better than shaving with a Mach3 .</li>
            <li>However, one has to run the shaver over the neck more than once to reach the contour areas.</li>
            <li>Braun didn&#x27;t even come close, no matter how many passes you made.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now tell me how many shavers can you buy that does all this for under $100 (2007 Dec price on Amazon)</li>
            <li>I bought this razor and have been COMPLETELY satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>I have used this razor for about a month now and it is nothing short of awesome!</li>
            <li>I am totally pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>maybe even more so...</li>
            <li>but I think that is more my fault then</li>
            <li>I love mine, I think you will too.</li>
            <li>Outstanding product.</li>
            <li>This shaver is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Once I got this, I was glad to get rid of them.</li>
            <li>Make sure moisturizer is non-comedogenic.    </li>
            <li>I love this product and would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li>Like most guys, I don&#x27;t like shaving, but I like a clean-shaven face.</li>
            <li>I love Panasonic shavers, this one is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read many reviews about the Panasonic ES8109S Vortex Wet/Dry Shaver with Nano Technology and HydraClean System and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Most of them I have to get used to.</li>
            <li>Most tellingly, i have not used my fusion razor in two weeks....</li>
            <li>The cleaner cratridges are much better thought out as well, you supply the water and it supplies the cleaner.</li>
            <li>I have tried many electric shavers, but I thought I would try 1 more.</li>
            <li>Although this one did better than any of the others I have had, it still doesn&#x27;t do the neck area</li>
            <li>He told us to \\&quot;get a better razer\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>It does a better job</li>
            <li>I just space out my chargings cleanings a bit more.</li>
            <li>but still a much better job than the Philips (I guess you could say that for most razors).</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better razor.  </li>
            <li>I love the speed and convenience of an electric razor, but love the closer shave of a bladed razor.</li>
            <li>It also seems that every electric razor I buy doesn&#x27;t shave well for more than about a year, despite upkeep and blade/foil replacements.</li>
            <li>After a heart attack he was put on many blood thinners</li>
            <li>He has tried MANY electric shavers over his 71 years.....</li>
            <li>It works OK for me</li>
            <li>The manual blade worked best (as almost anyone would attest), and the two automatic shavers seem to provide the same closeness/comfort.    </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>but this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>They keep getting better, this one being no exception.  </li>
            <li>So, I tried an electric one more time.</li>
            <li>His face is baby&#x27;s bottom smooth!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t go more than 7-8 days and it needs a charge &amp; cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Better than I could have hoped.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver.</li>
            <li>I did quite a bit of research before purchasing, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I bought this shaver a week ago and love it.</li>
            <li>It is so much better than anything I tried under $125 that is belongs in a class by itself.</li>
            <li>and they love it and use it all the time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone with the top of the line Braun&#x27;s, Philips Norelco&#x27;s, and</li>
            <li>I love how the charge lasts for days if I&#x27;m traveling.  </li>
            <li>but again, its doing the job for the most part.  </li>
            <li>After reading many reviews, I purchased the Panasonic Vortex.</li>
            <li>I must say that I am quite pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>for my favorite electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can safely say that I have never had a better shave in my life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased as punch with this razor.</li>
            <li>I am mostly a blade guy and have been dissappointed with electrics over the years but decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li>I had more than a bit of skepticism about how it would perform on my face.  </li>
            <li>I have had this shaver for about a month now and am pleased with the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li>I wash my face AFTER shaving to make sure I don&#x27;t get any ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I am extrememly pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is able to trim anything but peach fuzz.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I love Amazon reviews.      </li>
            <li>But after reading I didn&#x27;t think $200 was going to get me any more than $100.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it in the shower since I&#x27;d be sure to lose a sideburn without a mirror.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to get a fogless mirror</li>
            <li>If you have a prominent Adam&#x27;s apple, you may be better off with a blade razor.  </li>
            <li>I have visited many shaving forums and message boards over the years.  </li>
            <li>I have visited many shaving forums and message boards over the years.  </li>
            <li>Having said that, I love this one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this razor for just under a month and love it.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I have had many electric razors throgh the years</li>
            <li>and I really love this one.</li>
            <li>I am totally in love with this.  </li>
            <li>so unless you&#x27;re sure this razor will work for you, I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>But I decided it was time to replace it and bought what I thought would be the latest upgrade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works if you want to shave in the shower;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many electric razors before.</li>
            <li>The bottom line is that this shaver is the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric shaver - meaningfully closer on my face than even the Bruan.  </li>
            <li>I have owned the a couple Norelcos including their \\&quot;top of the line\\&quot;</li>
            <li>within 3 months I was looking for something better.    </li>
            <li>This thing shaves incredibly close, very sleek and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>This is the best overall electric razor I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>but, they were more concerned about profits in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>To the best of my knowledge, the only way the Braun dries the shaver is with a heating element.  </li>
            <li>The cleaner function looks interesting but I have not used it yet.</li>
            <li>I could write a lot about the razor but let be simplify it to say, it does not irritate my face any more than my Gillette Mach 5 razor and it cuts as close.  </li>
            <li>There is a \\&quot;break in period\\&quot; which I would attribute to learning how to shave with an electric razor more than your face learning how to be shaved.  </li>
            <li>, I thought it might get better after a couple of weeks, but it HASN&#x27;T</li>
            <li>Get this Panasonic and enjoy what shaving is suppose to be like!</li>
            <li>I tried the Braun last year for a week; also a very impressive shaver.  </li>
            <li>Vortex wet/dry are outstanding.</li>
            <li>meh, could be designed better.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for over a month now and really love it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using electric razors for about 25 years and for many of those years preferred the Norelco triple head razor line as it did not pinch like the foil shaver of those days did.</li>
            <li>This razor is better in every way than it&#x27;s predecessor.</li>
            <li>but I intend to try one more time before returning the it.</li>
            <li>You will love it just like I do.</li>
            <li>(I think it is more efficient than the induction charger).</li>
            <li>and it gave a better shave.  </li>
            <li>So I did what most men do</li>
            <li>Switched from rotary to foil with this razor and am highly satisfied in all regards: speed, closeness, skin comfort, even cleaning.</li>
            <li>When I do use a razor I get razor burn, and that does not happen with this shaver, or most shavers for that matter, and neither do the ingrown whiskers.    </li>
            <li>So I switched, and am glad I did.</li>
            <li>But I have come to love the Panasonic shavers over the years.  </li>
            <li>My $20 airport shaver does a better job.  </li>
            <li>shaves okay</li>
            <li>used panasonic electric razors for many years, this one is more of a toy than a mans grooming tool .  </li>
            <li>I love the quality, and I love the speed in which it was delivered.</li>
            <li>I have had this razor for almost 3 years and just thought I would share how much I love it.  </li>
            <li>He said it was better than anything his father had and his dad has one of those top notch Braun razors.</li>
            <li>He said it was perfect around the next and jaw area and there was no pinching or tearing out of the hair.</li>
            <li>There were so many times</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m glad I bought that unit.  </li>
            <li>After many hours of research I thought I wanted another Braun...</li>
            <li>their top of the line Pulsonic model.</li>
            <li>The top of the line Braun can be rinsed under water but not used \\&quot;wet\\&quot; or with creams or lotions.</li>
            <li>I was hoping they could have supplied a better case to hold the cord and shaver for extended trips.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure there will be plenty of room in there for a cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since purchasing, this razor still continues to be my favorite.</li>
            <li>The results are better.</li>
            <li>And to top it off, you&#x27;re looking at a cheaper upkeep than blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for over a month now and am extrememly satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>&quot; that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
            <li>I love the complaints about the noise it makes.  </li>
            <li>So glad I got it.  </li>
            <li>So glad I got it.  </li>
            <li>Too many nitpickers around here complaining about stuff that doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li>are gripping it</li>
            <li>But.... in last 2 months, I am getting the best shave ever!</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Most electric razors cut up my neck</li>
            <li>but this one does awesome especially in the shower,</li>
            <li>Glad I have it.  </li>
            <li>Any suggestions are welcome, as I really don&#x27;t want to return it.</li>
            <li>I am now debating whether to give this shaver one more try by replacing the blades or try a Braun 360 instead.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to get a close shave at all.  </li>
            <li>So I decided to try a foil shaver and see if it worked any better.</li>
            <li>Another great razor from Panasonic -- highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied it.</li>
            <li>I suppose this is proof that shavers cannot \\&quot;lift\\&quot; hairs to cut better.</li>
            <li>I used this rotary-type of shaver for many years during the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I also love being able to shave in the shower again (</li>
            <li>Speaking of charging it does come with one of the fancy smancy self cleaner&#x27;s &#x27;ala&#x27; more profit for Panasonic on accessories(need&#x27;s cartridges).    </li>
            <li>The upside of the ES8109 is that is does to a better job at getting neck hairs, but still has yet to impress me.</li>
            <li>I reinserted the cleaner cartridge to see if I could get more out of it but ran into a couple problems.</li>
            <li>and he is pleased that it does not irritate his face.</li>
            <li>Perhaps any electric shaver would be better than what I was doing.  </li>
            <li>They have the most thorough reviews for these types of products on the web.</li>
            <li>DO I NEED TO SAY MORE?</li>
            <li>did a much better job.  </li>
            <li>I love the close shave I can get with this shaver.</li>
            <li>As is it turned out he tried it for 10 days and it would not make it better.  </li>
            <li>It felt as smooth as a babies face!</li>
            <li>I prefer not to use the pivoting head, so I&#x27;m glad that it can be locked in place.    </li>
            <li>It made an excellent christmas present this year.</li>
            <li>SMOOTH as a baby&#x27;s bottom!   </li>
            <li>I read many reviews on electric razors</li>
            <li>Glad I did.</li>
            <li>For every day use, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Overall Great Buy !</li>
            <li>I can shave for many days in a row without irritation.</li>
            <li>After using Braun shavers for many years, and being satisfied, I just thought I&#x27;d give a Panasonic</li>
            <li>Within about 6wks of buying it, the battery began to not hold a charge more than 5-6 minutes total...and after about 3 more weeks, it just would not come on at all...</li>
            <li>, I love it...</li>
            <li>the hydraclean system :)</li>
            <li>This thing has no problem with longer growth, just takes a couple more minutes.  </li>
            <li>It seems to give me a better shave than the Braun.  </li>
            <li>far I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality of this razor and the comfortable shave it provided.  </li>
            <li>Now one thing that took the longest to get used to was figuring out which way the hair grows out of my face, razors where much more forgiving in that sense</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t think you can get a better shaver for the price.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product for the low cost.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am a convert to the electric, I might have to shave more often but the relieve of the pain is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Started using this shaver for over a month and love it.</li>
            <li>and I never could seem to get all the hair no matter how many passes I made.  </li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;ll be able to shave every day.  </li>
            <li>You can run it deeper and more if you want to get the closest shave and it will not irritate you.  </li>
            <li>And shaving 2 days in a row is no longer a dreaded experience, it is actually okay.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m saving that 5 stars for a magic wand that I can just wave over my beard and it disappears.</li>
            <li>The shave quality on this Panasonic is WAY better than the Braun.  </li>
            <li>for the most part it does what it should.  </li>
            <li>Also be sure not to pour water in the cleaning unit.</li>
            <li>I shave my head as well as my face, and this linear Panasonic shavers  are a favorite among the cue-ball set.</li>
            <li>And the clippings in the razor or more like dust   than bits of whiskers.</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t always pleased with the finished result of these electric shavers.</li>
            <li>I told myself that someday I would invest the money for a better model.</li>
            <li>I shave every day and shave is definitely better than my Braun model.  </li>
            <li>It does well around my ears and sideburns, and my neck, better than a blade.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with it</li>
            <li>Without exaggeration, it gives me the closest shave ever, and I&#x27;ve been using the top of the line electrics from Norleco and Braun for over 20 years.</li>
            <li>Also, one more tip regarding the cleaning cartridges in the Vortex cleaning system - you DON&#x27;T HAVE TO replace the cleaning solution at the manufacturer recommended interval.</li>
            <li>but I do love the Lithium-Ion battery technology.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dropped more than one slippery shaver in the shower over the years.</li>
            <li>And, of course, it could work in the shower, with my favorite shaving cream, or without.    </li>
            <li>I did NOT buy it because of the money, I was prepared to buy the one advertised and $70 more.  </li>
            <li>I believe you will be pleased.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a Panasonic wet/dry shaver user for many years and they keep getting better.</li>
            <li>More like 1 or 2 cleanings</li>
            <li>I do like this better than the Wahl shavers though.  </li>
            <li>After extensive research, looking for \\&quot;the best electric shaver\\&quot; as a gift for my husband, I confidently settled on Panasonic&#x27;s ES8228.</li>
            <li>I bought it after comparing many brands and model #&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>The 8019 is awesome - closer shave, longer lasting battery (almost 2.5 weeks!)</li>
            <li>like I need one more thing to clutter my bathroom.</li>
            <li>I willl never be as satisfied as I was with the blade.</li>
            <li>it was because he was going to ask for it for Christmas :).</li>
            <li>ENJOY!</li>
            <li>and I feel pleased with my decision to go for this.</li>
            <li>It gives nice smooth and close shave&lt;br</li>
            <li>The wet/dry function is nice, I&#x27;ve found that I tend to get really good results by shaving with it in the shower, but the hassle-free ability to pop in and shave with it real quick before going out is also very convenient.     </li>
            <li>I was delighted to hear this as I put a lot of effort in getting him the right product.  </li>
            <li>Loved my first Braun but wasn&#x27;t as impressed with the second.  </li>
            <li>So...I bought this Panasonic ES8109S and after using it a few times to perfect my technique and learning what the shaver can do and how it does it, all I can say is I&#x27;m VERY satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>It gives a nice, clean, close cut.</li>
            <li>First, it feels so good in the hand--built like a tank, stylish, and effortless to hold and manipulate.</li>
            <li>- just clean it yourself with some warm water and rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>It did give me nice clean shave on the sides of the face.</li>
            <li>I figured for the price, it better be pretty darn good - $90 (on sale)</li>
            <li>This is a great product and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>The price for the Panasonic has always been fairly high but this is a great deal and</li>
            <li>Very fast, gets neck hairs good and cuts close.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning function works great and keeps the blades in much better condition for like new shaves everytime.  </li>
            <li>Also, the HydraClean System keeps the shaver very clean and hygienic.</li>
            <li>It is now very clean.</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s great to have an indicator light to tell you something is charging, or that it is fully charged, or that there is some kind of problem that requires an action.</li>
            <li>The shavers also work great for normal perpendicular hair.</li>
            <li>Best decision I have made in a long time.</li>
            <li>The cleaning system is pretty good too.  </li>
            <li>I have been a life long electric shaver user like my father and grandfather and can say this is the best one I have owned.  </li>
            <li>and i have to say it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>It even works pretty good on the neck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a first impression and it is a good one.</li>
            <li>I had always thought of trying the Panasonic as they&#x27;re products are usually pretty good from my experience.  </li>
            <li>Battery life is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty good electric razor.  </li>
            <li>The shaver has pretty good battery life, I can get about three shaves before wanting to recharge.  </li>
            <li>To preface, this shaver is the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve used in probably a good decade.</li>
            <li>Good quality item, sent fast by Amazon!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quieter than my old one and works beautifully.  </li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re not climbing Everest for your next vacation and staying away from a power outlet more than 10 days this is a very good shaver.</li>
            <li>A COUPLE DAYS WORTH OF STUBBLE!!</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money!!</li>
            <li>My face experienced zero irritation as a result of switching to this new razor.  </li>
            <li>Despite this shortcoming I keep buying a new one each year because the shave is so great.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning system works great and the shaver looks new every time.  </li>
            <li>but it has worked great and gives a great shave in shorter time than a messy blade and shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>buying a good razor is important and worth the money over the years of service you would expect from the razor....</li>
            <li>Best results on dry face, with the grain.</li>
            <li>Another thing I liked is that the Panosonic charged quickly</li>
            <li>I love the pivoting head that adjusts easily to the countours of my face.</li>
            <li>The Braun does provide a head that does seem to catch more hairs easily, but the sharpness of these blades, and the closeness of the shave, just about make it even in terms of shave time and hairs cut.</li>
            <li>electric shaver works best on a dry face.  </li>
            <li>The battery life isn&#x27;t quite as good as I&#x27;d like, but it&#x27;s good enough for 1.5 weeks on the road.  </li>
            <li>It makes you have a good feeling to receive such a good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to clean up under the faucet</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the Braun is a fine razor</li>
            <li>It shaves good, battery life is great, and it does not irritate my face like some of the other ones.  </li>
            <li>It certainly has all the bells and whistles and makes for an excellent gift--I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>, it gives a clean perfect shave than traditional razors.</li>
            <li>Overall a very good electric razor.</li>
            <li>This is my third Panasonic over the years and all have been very good.</li>
            <li>overall a very good shaver.</li>
            <li>My husband is absolutely satisfied with the shavers ability to hold a long charge, its self cleaning performance, as well as the results of using it, as he obtains a very attractive clean shave.   </li>
            <li>Shaves as close as a blade and much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>This went much more smoothly - so things are looking up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver with the intention of getting the most comfortable shaver around.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable and I like being able to shave in the shower.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t change the cleaning cartridge until the light goes on--in contrast to the recommended changing which is much more frequent--and this seems to be working quite well.</li>
            <li>It has been nearly 30 years since I shaved with a foil razor and the technology has improved greatly.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the purchase and not sorry I switched.</li>
            <li>I was buying them off of Ebay for way cheap and way more.</li>
            <li>Have had this since xmas and so far, it is a great shaver.  </li>
            <li>It is the most comfortable of the three.  </li>
            <li>this is my first electric razor and i am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion it does its best as a wet shaver.</li>
            <li>But what is more important then stability...does it work?</li>
            <li>Great razor even at the retail price but look for it to go on sale which it frequently does.</li>
            <li>Put the Remington blades and cutter (keeping the center blade of the Panasonic) on a Panasonic 13,000 RPM shaver and you would have the World&#x27;s best electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I think it does a great job of shaving closely and taking care of his sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>but so far it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the es8109s so far.</li>
            <li>I had tried electric razors early on (15 years ago) and wasn&#x27;t happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>I have learned that using a electric razor it is more important that shave every day instead on leaving my beard over the days I don&#x27;t need to shave.</li>
            <li>With six years of shaving with it,it was becoming useless,so I thought I would try the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I spent $110 dollars and my biggest regret is that i did not return it for the 30 day guarantee (I guess at the time I thought thats the best you can get out of a shaver).</li>
            <li>Not only that, but the replacement foils for the Panasonic wore out with incredible frequency --</li>
            <li>This thing is incredible, no irritation  immediately after shaving and no skin breakouts the next day.  </li>
            <li>The great thing about this razor is I don&#x27;t get near the razor</li>
            <li>It does old charge for a great amount of time</li>
            <li>Replacement blades, screens, and cleaning cartridges are fairly reasonable in price, so that is good.  </li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and does a good job.</li>
            <li>Nice colorful as advertiised?</li>
            <li>Easy to clean as it can be put under running water!  </li>
            <li>The blade design and motor speed make it very easy to shave smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>The price was better than the \\&quot;In store best price\\&quot; at the major retail stores, and the shipping was extremely fast.</li>
            <li>Most important, it is portable, easy to clean and shaves better than all the others I have used.   </li>
            <li>THIS RAZOR IS VERY NICE, AND I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT DEALS2U.COM, THESE PEOPLE ARE VERY CONSIDERATE, AND QUICK TO RESPOND IF THERE IS ANY PROBLEMS</li>
            <li>No I am not a paid endorser, I&#x27;m just excited that I found a better mousetrap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all the other shavers and after 2 months of use I like this one best.</li>
            <li>The best of all, I didn&#x27;t spend a fortune on it like some of the other ones are priced at.  </li>
            <li>I have owned other rechareable razors and this is the best one I have used.</li>
            <li>If my mind changes significantly after more use, I&#x27;ll edit my review.  </li>
            <li>This was COMPLETELY true!</li>
            <li>Shaving with the grain is a quick, easy and painless process however you don&#x27;t get anything resembling a close shave!</li>
            <li>It is rechargeable and the best part is that it can be charged while you are travelling other countries that have 220 volts instead of 110 volts that we have in USA.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>Clinique and Billy Jealousy, as well as Zihr, are all supposed to have great ones that provide excellent razor glide, although they are expensive, and I haven&#x27;t yet tried them.  </li>
            <li>The Hydra Clean feature is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>It works well in water and cleans easily.</li>
            <li>I ordered the shaver and received it very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>My husband bleeds easily.  </li>
            <li>he says that it gives a close shave &amp; is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>the cleaning was easy.</li>
            <li>easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I love the LED feature that tells you how charged it is, when you need to clean it, etc.     </li>
            <li>It is easy to use, cuts close, I&#x27;ve not had any razor burn issues.  </li>
            <li>And the Vortex&#x27;s cleaning system allows you to easily clean your shaver and make sure that it stays that way.</li>
            <li>Easy to use....</li>
            <li>the self cleaning system is easy, but you can just as easily run it under the faucet and 3) easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>The recharge is very quick.  </li>
            <li>Easily a five-star product.</li>
            <li>It maintains its charge for a number of shaves and can be easily cleaned manually, if you dont want to use the automated system.  </li>
            <li>The thing even charged very quickly.</li>
            <li>The 2 days of growth allows the shaver to capture the hairs much more easily and the gel helps give a comfortable, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>My preference, clean the shaver under water most days.  </li>
            <li>The razor is easy to use and versatile.  </li>
            <li>The pivoting head is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>but the documentation shows the razor can be easily cleaned with soup and water under the faucet.  </li>
            <li>While it did not provide as close of a shave as I hoped for, it did not irritate my face and cleanup was easy.  </li>
            <li>My husband likes everything that is easy for him</li>
            <li>a clean shave eventually irritated my skin leading to lots of razor bumps and then led to me not being able to shave for one week and having to remove a lot of ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>where easy it&#x27;s just the neck/</li>
            <li>well and cleaning is easy by just lowering it into the sink under water with it running.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to hear about the electric shaver that can shave clean in one pass</li>
            <li>Shaver itself is compact and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>Easy care razor.</li>
            <li>Convenient,  easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>And easy to recharge, too.</li>
            <li>As you can imagine, after 3+ years of using it the shaver itself has build up in places that aren&#x27;t easily able to clean.</li>
            <li>I have even been able to shave daily which makes my wife extremely happy.  </li>
            <li>The razor handles the sensitive neck area very well, and does an excellent job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Charger is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and place and go.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic gives a much better shave, is easy to clean and provides a week of shaving before it need recharging.</li>
            <li>There may be later more advance models offered by Panasonic but this model does a great job.  </li>
            <li>Battery is still going strong.</li>
            <li>Recommend it strongly.</li>
            <li>It has been going strong with no problems.</li>
            <li>Still using it and going strong.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor to men that want a good razor, but don&#x27;t want to spend $200.</li>
            <li>I liked it very much, so decided to get this one.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product if you are looking for a good shaver.</li>
            <li>That and the fact that I love different electronic gadgets and this thing fit the bill and sounded great, so I took the plunge.    </li>
            <li>It seemed to work fine and was easy to use.</li>
            <li>It apparently has and to a great degree!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial</li>
            <li>Liked it so much, I bought my brother one!</li>
            <li>It does a grand job once you&#x27;re used to it, and I can&#x27;t imagine going a full week without shaving again.</li>
            <li>The led that gives the remaining charge in 10% increments is also nice (and puts it in competition with higher priced competitors).  </li>
            <li>For the first month it is shaving quite nicely.</li>
            <li>I like my new razor alot its easy to use goes around the curves of my face easaly and does a good job.  </li>
            <li>It is hands down the best shaver that I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best electric shaver I ever have had.  </li>
            <li>I  used a Braun (the model in the cradle that cleans itself) for many years and liked it as well, but I like this Panasonic better -- and I like its smaller cradle and cleaning mechanism better.</li>
            <li>This razor is AWESOME (as far as electric razors go) and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>One other thing, I&#x27;ve found that the cheap shaving soap available in the grocery store works best.</li>
            <li>For added measure and the price of new blades and foil, I found a really good deal on the ES8228S shaver.</li>
            <li>However, I kept buying new ones because they either broke, shave quality wasn&#x27;t good, etc.  </li>
            <li>Paid $150 to Good as New Electronics for this shaver which died after a year.</li>
            <li>I was comparing the Braun Pulsonic and this particular model and made the right choice as the ES8109 is working great</li>
            <li>Another huge improvement over the Braun system is that if I feel like just charging and not cleaning my razor I can do that easily.  </li>
            <li>I used it for the first time yesterday and was very very happy with how close of a shave that it actually got.  </li>
            <li>It did a fine job on my face.  </li>
            <li>My skin DOES seem to be adjusting, but it seems to be extremely important that you first have the razor cleaned, as the shaving solution also acts as a kind of lubricant, or so it seems.  </li>
            <li>My neck is shaved just fine</li>
            <li>But a friend compelled me try it by arguing that the self cleaning feature made for a better and more consistent shave.  </li>
            <li>just fine.</li>
            <li>The shaver charges quickly, is comfortable to hold, glides easily over your skin and cleaning</li>
            <li>The motor seemed to be performing fine though</li>
            <li>In the shower or out, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>As the title says, the razor is fine, the cleaning system s**ks.</li>
            <li>I use an inexpensive electric pre-shave and that works just fine.</li>
            <li>The shaver is light and easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>The ergonomics are fine for me.  </li>
            <li>It is cordless and the battery works just fine.</li>
            <li>I have no doubt that the Panasonic ES8109S Vortex Wet/Dry Shaver with Nano Technology and HydraClean System is a fine product</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S FINE.  </li>
            <li>Battery life is fine.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to charge, easy to clean,</li>
            <li>He then realized it was working fine</li>
            <li>I just used the cleaner setup tonight and it did a fine job.  </li>
            <li>and I think using this setup just a couple times a week will be fine.    </li>
            <li>Shirt collars don&#x27;t cause discomfort because the skin feels fine.</li>
            <li>Still works fine as a shaver.</li>
            <li>Razor line just fine with that,</li>
            <li>The best part about it is that the cleaning catridges cost about half of what they did for the Braun</li>
            <li>So far, I have been pleasantly surprized by the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I needed a quick razor to get most of the hair before I had to head out to work.    </li>
            <li>Just a super razor for the money!</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t very good to begin with and at the time we really couldn&#x27;t afford to put a lot of money into a new quality one.</li>
            <li>I had a really good experience with this seller, he is very professional and i received my item in prompt time</li>
            <li>If you are a simple guy looking for a decent shaver at a good price, you can find just as good or better at a lower price.  </li>
            <li>For as good a job as this thing does, I wouldn&#x27;t care if it was as loud as my lawnmower!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean (with the cleaning solution OR with soap and water).  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;ve had a rather pleasant and refreshing experience with the shaver.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Also, the money you spend trying to find the right kind of pre shave, during the shave, and after shave lotions could add up quickly.    </li>
            <li>(It worked fine out of the box, but replacement blades never seem to be near as good).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with this shaver and highly recommend it to anyone shopping for a quality electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Very good quality as expected from Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>This means I have to be clean shaven, but I don&#x27;t want to shower first because I will get sweaty and have to shower anyway, which makes softening the coarse whiskers a dubious process at best because I am drowsy and in a hurry.</li>
            <li>It provides a shave that is far superior to my Norelco rotary but still cannot provide a perfect shave on my neck; I need a little touch up after I am out of the shower in front of the mirror.</li>
            <li>This one does a very average job, at best, providing a close shave.</li>
            <li>Now before you put in a new cartridge I use some dial soap and water in the cleaner chamber to clean it good...</li>
            <li>This is my second panasonic vortex and the smooth shave I receive is great.</li>
            <li>Being able to use it wet is a great feature -</li>
            <li>The LCD display is neat and gives an accurate measurement of the battery life remaining in which I start to charge it around 10%.</li>
            <li>That is so huge.</li>
            <li>The claims are 100% accurate.</li>
            <li>is a huge improvement over the Braun system.  </li>
            <li>Lab Series is great and has very low odor.  </li>
            <li>Remember, God created a few beautiful heads, the rest, he put hair on!</li>
            <li>This razor filled that request and went above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One problem with this unit and the  Panasonic ES8103S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade shaver is that it has a light that flashes after its charged so you cannot keep it plugged in all the time.</li>
            <li>Despite this, my face feels smooth as velvet after use, despite some irritation.  </li>
            <li>After two light passes with it on my neck</li>
            <li>This Panasonic shaver has given me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had, very close and comfortable without having to go over the same area over and over again.  </li>
            <li>Still, I liked it so much I bought another.  </li>
            <li>I use a shave gel and it helps keep my face smooth and soothed after I shave.  </li>
            <li>I shave after I shower and with shaving cream and its a close comfortable shave every time.  </li>
            <li>Easy to maintain and clean.  </li>
            <li>This product is so easy and clean to use.</li>
            <li>and yes, it is extremely comfortable.</li>
            <li>got this Panasonic as a present and it has been great.</li>
            <li>It does require more passes to remove the hair, but well worth it for the comfort.</li>
            <li>Not only do I get dermatitis anymore, I feel great after shaving.</li>
            <li>For detailed cleaning I use the office supply cleaner air can used on the computers and so.</li>
            <li>Now I am happy after going back to electric.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and charge.</li>
            <li>Just the feel of the shaver was fantastic.</li>
            <li>I switched to this shaver after using a cheap $35 shaver for a while (and a manual one before that).    </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic razor.  </li>
            <li>So I looked at electric again figuring the technology had advanced</li>
            <li>It is at a cheap price.</li>
            <li>The cleaning system works great and the trimmer is an extra bonus.</li>
            <li>My shaves are both closer and faster and the shaver is so easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It is incredibly comfortable.</li>
            <li>Shaving has gone from a chore to a genuine pleasure.</li>
            <li>I love how it&#x27;s fun to use.  </li>
            <li>, how smooth my face feels after using it.    </li>
            <li>As mentioned, this is the closest shave currently available (February 2012).</li>
            <li>Sculpted to fit either hand.</li>
            <li>It charges it perfectly, but the Vortex cleaning system is a bit messy</li>
            <li>(I have had it leak) and smells a but sticky and cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so close that my skin is baby smooth</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it worth every penny.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t buy cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>Shave is not as smooth as the phillips one.   </li>
            <li>/&gt;This shaver has given me the closest shave \\&quot;ever\\&quot; and my face feels so smooth even when feeling against the grain.</li>
            <li>Its comfortable to hold and</li>
            <li>Prior to that, I had a Panasonic that worked great</li>
            <li>Overall it was a great razor until the charger/cleaner died.</li>
            <li>I will probably just break the indicator light.</li>
            <li>Change the cleaning solution monthly, using purified water, not tap, and this shaver will provide months and months of smooth, close shaves.</li>
            <li>smooth face-</li>
            <li>It felt REALLY SMOOTH while shaving, no sensation of burn whatsoever.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on the skin, but cuts close and the cleaning system is nice to have.(I almost didn&#x27;t get</li>
            <li>Smooth, so smooth.</li>
            <li>- You can take it in the shower &amp; its easy to wash and clean.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re an intelligent shopper you&#x27;re doing some research comparing different shavers and brands.  </li>
            <li>Overall a great product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as close as a blade shave, but it&#x27;s mighty darn close.  </li>
            <li>and I have a light to medium beard.  </li>
            <li>It gives a close, smooth and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>If you notice after the cleaning cycle is over, take the foil off and look at the blades in the light.  </li>
            <li>Easy to wash and clean.</li>
            <li>Before this shaver I used  Remington 304&#x27;s for years and was quite happy with them, but their quality and durability seemed to go downhill over the last three of them I wore out.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li>read that the sound can be</li>
            <li>The ability to use it with lather makes it fantastic.  </li>
            <li>- I can feel my skin against the direction of my beard and it feels smooth.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning portion of this system works great but the actual shaver is garbage.  </li>
            <li>Cheap razors were terrable</li>
            <li>I have been happily using it daily for almost 4 years.</li>
            <li>almost enjoy shaving.</li>
            <li>A few passes, perfect.      </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>The detergent packs are cheap ($15 for a set of 3, each one lasts a month), and you need to replace the foil (once a year, with the blades once every two years</li>
            <li>Not annoyingly so,</li>
            <li>The shave is close and smooth.  </li>
            <li>And smooth.  </li>
            <li>It goes through my face hair w/ out shuddering and leaves my face smooth.  </li>
            <li>You can wait till the light comes on and then change it.    </li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great buy</li>
            <li>a cheap rotary non-cordless Norelco, a Braun 6520 and now this one.  </li>
            <li>I took advantage of free shipping and my shaver arrived sooner than the estimated date.    </li>
            <li>It gave a great shave, held a charge for a couple of weeks, and quietly hummed when operating.  </li>
            <li>I will say that I love using shaving cream again, and it is worth the miniscule difference that may occur in closeness.  </li>
            <li>My face never felt so smooth.  </li>
            <li>I went back to the shave oil again, and voila, another great shave.</li>
            <li>so i couldn&#x27;t really give it a honest review.      </li>
            <li>I have an advanced engineering degree and it still took me an inordinate amount to time to figure out what the hell they were talking about.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t cheap and now I have to go looking for another one. :</li>
            <li>(my job requires a face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s caboose).  </li>
            <li>When I finished, my skin was smooth and I could not feel any stubble at all.  </li>
            <li>It gives a smooth shave too.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Now remember I only bought this to shave my goatee and it did a great job.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s it,this Panasonic shaves as smooth as a Fusion.</li>
            <li>an amazing 13,000rpms which is fast for an electric razor</li>
            <li>Easy to use, clean and store.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this Panasonic.</li>
            <li>The shaver is comfortable to hold and can reach all areas of face and neck.  </li>
            <li>, it wasn&#x27;t cheap</li>
            <li>I can pull off a razor smooth finish on my head and face with this shaver</li>
            <li>It shaves close and smooth.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I purchased this razor as a replacement for another Panasonic model that I was only marginally happy with.  </li>
            <li>and overall think it is a great electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>Ok, so this is my third Panasonic wet/dry shaver in about 5 years and, by far, this one is the best one yet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The head \\&quot;floats\\&quot;, or can be locked in place, similar to a shock absorber - a great feature.  </li>
            <li>We were only going to be there 3 days, however the SeaTac airport snow closure resulted in our being stranded for 9 days before we could fly home.  </li>
            <li>As I shopped around for the best deal, I came across Panasonic&#x27;s ES8109S on Amazon, at a much lower price PLUS an instant rebate PLUS free shipping.</li>
            <li>Buy it and enjoy.</li>
            <li>My husband felt like it would work the same, and if not, well he would be happy to oblige and use it himself.  </li>
            <li>everyone I do shows with want to know how I get such a great shave.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Comfortable shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li>which helps it to move smoothly over your skin.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this razor to be awesome and do what it said it does, but frankly it falls well short.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>After using this for several weeks I&#x27;ve discovered a shaving method that really takes advantage of this wonderful machine.    </li>
            <li>You can super easily clean this in the shower or under the faucet, however - just pull off the top foil and run it under running water.</li>
            <li>So far it seems like he gives him a good shave.  </li>
            <li>I had a Norelco electric shaver back in the 90&#x27;s and wasn&#x27;t really that impressed.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m really surprised how this item have that good reviews...</li>
            <li>The best part is when I am done, I just put it in the cleaner unit and it takes care of getting it ready for my next use.  </li>
            <li>Again the Panasonic clearly beats Braun 2, but the more aptly compared Braun 1 gives it a run for</li>
            <li>It still cannot get all of them and this is the biggest downfall on top of the OK quality shave, really nothing to brag about on this shaver.</li>
            <li>I had been using a Panasonic and LOVED my old razor, but it gave out on me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the process but this has been really good so far.</li>
            <li>but I am delighted with its performance so far.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned Braun and norelco and this trimmer is unreal and far superior.  </li>
            <li>The customer comments that were submitted for this product were very positive and were in fact better</li>
            <li>Even though, the shave is still better than what i used to get shaving with Mach 3 - just not as good as the first month of shaving - i am thinking i will try putting a new blade - that may help -</li>
            <li>The original is still fine</li>
            <li>I always just rinse in the sink and it gets clean just fine.</li>
            <li>thanks Panasonic!!!</li>
            <li>Not only as good as using a blade, but much better and more consistent.</li>
            <li>The sideburn trimmer works acceptably, and the % charged display is very useful when anticipating the need to recharge.  </li>
            <li>No tugging at hairs at all, it&#x27;s quiet, and the auto clean works great.</li>
            <li>Just pop the head off under the tap(or in the shower) and presto nice and clean and ready to be used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous electric shavers, including the really excellent high end Braun shavers.</li>
            <li>I love the self cleaning system, it helps to keep the blades sharp and the drying feature is very nice.  </li>
            <li>Great quality, battery life, high speed motor and sharp blades make any Vortex Panasonic a good choice.</li>
            <li>The cleaning system is fantastic - used about every 3-4 days to clean the shaver.</li>
            <li>It really does work pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I have been satisfied with all of them, but buying this Vortex was the first time that purchase price was not my primary consideration.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Charging is quick and easy using the supplied cord.  </li>
            <li>Manual cleaning is quick and easy.     </li>
            <li>At this point I feel comfortable in recommending this razor based off of the shave I was able to get on the first use.</li>
            <li>He was thrilled when he got it, his older shaver was about 6 yrs.</li>
            <li>The razor head bends &amp; moves very easily to shave the curves of your face very well.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge for much longer and is very easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>And the best thing also is that it clean&#x27;s itself and does not take a lot of bathroom counter space which is important in small bathrooms.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s the new electric razor guru, the next best thing to God.  </li>
            <li>Very good shaver lasts 2 weeks on a full charge using every other day.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and recharges quickly.  </li>
            <li>This was a good buy, maybe 250 bucks and 3 years later, still going strong.</li>
            <li>so far I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Panasonic did not disappointed me.  </li>
            <li>When it arrived I took it in a started to charge it, and one of the first things I noticed was that the cleaning solution was not combustible like the Braun and that made me feel a bit better.</li>
            <li>the charge lasts for two legs, but mine are short with course hair :^) if you have amazon women legs and</li>
            <li>Never thought I would be so excited over a shaver, but I am indead with this one.</li>
            <li>Well so far I have been very pleased.</li>
            <li>Panasonic is a great brand, and I expect a long life from this one.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Was not disappointed .After</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been very satisfied.</li>
            <li>This product is eco friendly because you don&#x27;t have to keep throwing razors in the trash and wasting plastic etc.     </li>
            <li>It shaved me better than a blade the first time I used it with 5 days of beard.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I just got this thing around 2 months ago, and it was the first time in my life</li>
            <li>I was so excited...</li>
            <li>I read some other reviews that stated this was a good razor for reducing razor-burn, and they were correct!</li>
            <li>All in all I am very pleased with this product so far.</li>
            <li>It shaves more hairs on the first pass, the cream eliminates any friction, and gives me the closest shave yet with an electric (some areas of the face feel like I shaved with a blade).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>my dad is in his fifties and has a beard that can grow almost as long as santa claus, so i was happy for him.    </li>
            <li>The sideburn trimmer does a better job than the Norelco and operates at a higher trimming speed.  </li>
            <li>The unit restores the shaving head unit and screen to their original condition.  </li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>This is the first electric razor that I&#x27;ve purchased and been satisfied with.  </li>
            <li>This is my first foil shaver and after using it for about a month I am enjoying it.  </li>
            <li>Once he read all the instructions and became familiar with the shaver I don&#x27;t believe he would give it up.</li>
            <li>I bought this as my first electric shaver after borrowing and trying many others.</li>
            <li>This is the first electric shaver I have purchased that cost more than $25.  </li>
            <li>have been very pleased with the performance so far.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>The shaver seemed of good quality, but the shave was only fair compared to my old Braun 7526.  </li>
            <li>This is the first razor that I have owned that has not pulled most of my beard out.</li>
            <li>I fell in love the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with my new Panasonic razor, it performs even better than the old one did when it was new.</li>
            <li>about 3 weeks very pleased so far, gives close shave east to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li>My son, Jose, who is a Personal Trainer and has to look his best always, is absolutely in love with his new shaver and told me it was the BEST of all his shaves!!; even from his previous old model that was a Panasonic model also.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a clean shave</li>
            <li>I set it to clean</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ll just keep it charged ahead of time and will put it in to clean when leaving for work in the AM.</li>
            <li>and it comes with a charging, and cleaning system, or you can clean it and charge it by hand and with the charging cord.</li>
            <li>This means you should always look clean shaven.</li>
            <li>when I send it home to clean up it still says 100%.    </li>
            <li>Clean shave with minimum effort.</li>
            <li>So I decided clean manually instead of using it.  </li>
            <li>My old norelco did this, and even the perfect gilette fusion nicked my neck every now and then at the adams apple, same spot this thing is having issues.  </li>
            <li>Factor in that you can use it dry or in the shower (which you can&#x27;t with a Braun), and the great price,</li>
            <li>Shaving during shower and the clean kit are the plus to the shaver.</li>
            <li>every time I clean the shaver.  </li>
            <li>and I never had to re-rinse or clean off the hairs</li>
            <li>I get an incredibly smoother shave and do it in half the time.</li>
            <li>and I could not get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>I prefer a clean shaved face over any type beard, even a two day weekend stub.</li>
            <li>It took just two passes on my scruffy face to clean it up.  </li>
            <li>Then, clean it with just soap and water every week or so.</li>
            <li>and I no longer could get a clean shave on my neck.</li>
            <li>Even the trimmer shaves you almost as clean as a blade shave.</li>
            <li>I have averaged using the clean system once a week.  </li>
            <li>and it got the shaving done quick and thorough, although it wasn&#x27;t nearly as comfortable as this Panasonic shaver.    </li>
            <li>You can clean it with soap and water, or you can use the cleaning stand.  </li>
            <li>The shave is so good that my face is smooth all throughout the next work day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>The razor comes out clean and recharged.  </li>
            <li>a month even when you don&#x27;t clean the blades every day&lt;</li>
            <li>Smooth quick shave.</li>
            <li>Rinses out so cleanly with just the faucet</li>
            <li>- It has a neat cleaner machine that will thoroughly clean the unit for you.  </li>
            <li>The shave is smooth and quick.</li>
            <li>This thing shaves so much better and closer and faster and quieter than the Braun, it&#x27;s like a completely different kind of product.  </li>
            <li>and I am amazed every time I use it at how clean the razor is when it finishes it&#x27;s cycle.</li>
            <li>The cleaning gets the blades cleaner and they smell soapy clean and not chemically clean.</li>
            <li>He is amazed with the clean shave he gets with his razor.</li>
            <li>Luckily  I realized Braun&#x27;s warranty is 2 years, not 1 as I had thought, so I got Braun 1 repaired for free</li>
            <li>Luckily I find that I get used to the sound</li>
            <li>You could argue it is a gimmic, since you can easily clean the razor under the sink faucet.</li>
            <li>The reviews for this model were so good, I trusted them as I trusted the reviews that were accurate about my last panasonic.</li>
            <li>I have to come in and clean up with a hand razor.</li>
            <li>And this razor does a clean and close shave that rivals the hand razors.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning system does take a while, but again you do not use this to clean every day.  </li>
            <li>I am also impressed with the HydraClean system as it is a big improvement from their old models.</li>
            <li>I decided to clean shave with a blade for a while and give my face a break.</li>
            <li>Now I know why I have not been shaving clean for all those years.</li>
            <li>It is noisy when you clean it, but I do it in the morning and then leave for work.</li>
            <li>I use it to clean up my neck, sideburns, ears, nose, and unruly eyebrows.    </li>
            <li>It is much heavier than it looks and the build quality is great (so far).  </li>
            <li>I can tell you, shaving dry is great.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic gives me a close clean shave.  </li>
            <li>My face feels like the shave was nearly as clean as a razor shave,</li>
            <li>You can use turbo mode to clean but</li>
            <li>I put it on clean and leave when I need the razor again</li>
            <li>But I believe anybody who complains that it doesn&#x27;t shave clean with 1 pass has just never used electric before.</li>
            <li>Even easier to clean and charge.  </li>
            <li>Just remove the foil cap and clean with tap water in between charging cycles.</li>
            <li>Then, when recharging, go through the clean process.</li>
            <li>One thing I always do is clean the unit after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>a month or sooner if needed you have to clean the cleaner.</li>
            <li>You will want to use bleach water it so it is clean and not smelly.</li>
            <li>It delivers a comfortable, clean, and quick shave.  </li>
            <li>This razor has a number of options, a number of ways to clean it, including  the self-cleaning/charging system (doing both at once).  </li>
            <li>This is my fourth Panasonic wet/dry shaver and so far it is the best.  </li>
            <li>The difference is, the Braun always seemed clean after a cleaning while the Panasonic did not.</li>
            <li>but the shaver feels/smells clean every time you run the cleaning</li>
            <li>I do wash it myself and use the stand to dry it, which works great.</li>
            <li>I guess that makes it easier to clean the foil?      </li>
            <li>Use Scrubbing Bubbles to clean the blades once in a while.</li>
            <li>If I need a clean shave I have to go over it with a razor.  </li>
            <li>Honestly I hardly clean it anymore and have NEVER changed the blade inside.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it in the shower or tried to clean it with hand soap........</li>
            <li>Over the years I have had several skin cancers removed from my face and head creating a surface that is none too pleasant to shave with a blade.</li>
            <li>It did give a good shave in some areas but most still felt rough.</li>
            <li>The razor itself is fantastic - close shave, very reasonable noise level, waterproof head assembly, easy to clean, etc.  </li>
            <li>Or, I could take this opportunity to purchase Panasonic&#x27;s latest offering, the Arc IV Nano Men&#x27;s Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaver, which I&#x27;ve scoped out and seen positive reviews of here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>With my very first shave I could tell a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>This is my 2nd Panasonic shaver and it&#x27;s just as good or better than the first.  </li>
            <li>I have always had a Braun shaver, but the Panasonic was much faster, quiet, great side burn trimmer and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The Panisonic Vortex was perfect for me it gives a nice close shave wet or dry and</li>
            <li>So far I have to say that this one is far superior!</li>
            <li>Whatever special shaving angle or cleaning technology</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a  Gillette razor user, but picked up this electric razor on an Amazon special just to give it a shot.    </li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t have anything special going on</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll still use blades for touch up or special occasions.</li>
            <li>But, with the special, well, that was the tipping point, though how it worked and</li>
            <li>He was right!  </li>
            <li>He was RIGHT!</li>
            <li>when i finally do get a good shave with this, it is a clean, close shave, but it takes forever.  </li>
            <li>I get a nice clean shave with almost no irritation to my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It may not be the best razor on the market but for the money it&#x27;s hard to beat.</li>
            <li>I love Panasonic&#x27;s shavers because I like being able to shave in the shower with an electric shaver and a little glycerin based shaving foam (Gilette Series foam in the long silver tube works best for me and doesn&#x27;t gum up the shaver like gels do).</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this shaver has been truly amazing since the get-go.  </li>
            <li>My last shaver was the Braun 360, pretty much happy with it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean by holding under hot water from the facet, or by using the stand with a cleansing solution.  </li>
            <li>and it is great but shaving with it takes a while because you have to be careful not to cut yourself.</li>
            <li>The first few strokes and I was impressed with its performance.</li>
            <li>I would skip the higher end models with \\&quot;self cleaning,\\&quot; since this is so easy to clean, but that&#x27;s up to you.</li>
            <li>I would skip the higher end models with \\&quot;self cleaning,\\&quot; since this is so easy to clean, but that&#x27;s up to you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a Norelco 8865 XL for several years now, and I was pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>I think it works great although it did not work that will wet.</li>
            <li>I imagine it may reduce the life of some components, but it&#x27;s cool as hell to have</li>
            <li>Lastly, get a really really good soothing after shave balm.  </li>
            <li>but I figured that was good enough for me.</li>
            <li>The ergonomics of this shaver is very well designed and better than my Braun.  </li>
            <li>you should be able to get a really close shave.    </li>
            <li>Never been satisfied with an electric shaver this much before.</li>
            <li>If you like electric razors you will love this one, but I guess I need to buy a straight razor or something.</li>
            <li>This razor cuts as good as any traditional razor.</li>
            <li>That was good enough for me.</li>
            <li>I spray two short burst of air and that&#x27;s good to go another month or two.  </li>
            <li>I saw only good things about it.</li>
            <li>But this was such a good deal that I decided to risk it again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and makes a clean cut every time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros - Nice, classy design.  </li>
            <li>I really like this cleaning system better.</li>
            <li>so people in similar circumstances can get an idea of whether it&#x27;d be good for them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The only really good thing I can say is</li>
            <li>The reason for this is because no product ever will be good to use in a vast amount of water.</li>
            <li>Turns out the reviews are true.</li>
            <li>Overall I would say for the price, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li>It has held up incredibly well during that time and heavy use, and the battery shows no sign of quitting.</li>
            <li>I have replaced the blades only once, as the cleaning/charging stand keeps the head in good</li>
            <li>Knowing what I know now, I probably wouldn&#x27;t pay full retail for this shaver.</li>
            <li>It got to the point that the batteries wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge and the shaver wasn&#x27;t running at full speed.  </li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to anyone who does not expect a shave as good as a regular blade.  </li>
            <li>When the shaver is at full charge it blinks all the time.  </li>
            <li>That could well be true.  </li>
            <li>So far, after 2 weeks of using it, I&#x27;m thrilled.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall a good product with a moderate price.</li>
            <li>so in my books, this is a true winner</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li>and I liked that it had the self-cleaning system like my old Braun.</li>
            <li>My old Braun just had to be plopped into its stand and it figured out what it needed to do on its own.</li>
            <li>I recently started my year-long deployment to Afghanistan and wanted a good shaver that charged and cleaned.  </li>
            <li>It feels good to use and can run over areas several times without any burning,</li>
            <li>To go a step further; my wife even tried it on her legs and was exstatic about how good it done.  </li>
            <li>fast and prompt service had it in time for christmas and he enjoyed the gift  </li>
            <li>A full charge took about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;ve had 8109S for almost one full year now</li>
            <li>Better than any plastic shaver with 4-5 blades on a very stubborn beard.</li>
            <li>My husband also tried it, and he thought it was superior to any shavers he had used before, so I bought him one next.  </li>
            <li>I think the Norelco 3 blade does a better job, But the Panasonic is twice as fast.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ES8109S still gives me a good close shave after a year of use, even though I haven&#x27;t yet used the cleaning fluid..</li>
            <li>Their MUCH cheaper battery powered ES4815 is a better design</li>
            <li>Not a bad deal for the money.  </li>
            <li>but right now I&#x27;m happy I bought the razor as long as the noise isn&#x27;t bothering my neighbor.</li>
            <li>Mowed right thru the hair getting most in the first pass</li>
            <li>The clean system is hardly worth the effort - you do just as well holding the razor under a tap to clean it.  </li>
            <li>He insists on a super clean, super close shave.</li>
            <li>I loved my previous Panasonic Wet/Dry, but the ES8109S is substantially better.</li>
            <li>The Braun is an extremely high quality machine, shaves very fast, the battery is amazing,  and the trimmer is better than on this one, but the Panasonic beats it for closest shave (on my beard), and really cuts as close as a manual razor, but without the nicks and irritation of a manual shave.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for your first electric razor or a replacement, I strongly suggest you give this a try.  </li>
            <li>I got this one due to the fact that it&#x27;s a wet/dry shaver and shaving in the shower just seemed like a great idea.</li>
            <li>The shave is pretty good, especially for an electric, but does not compare to the MACH system I was using for quite sometime, or even cheap 3-blade disposable razors for that matter.</li>
            <li>When you first take it out of the box make sure you give it a FULL charge for the first time</li>
            <li>With the HydraClean system, the unit is kept clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Takes maybe 15 seconds and it&#x27;s clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>With the HydraClean system, the unit is kept clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>However when using a gel, it shaves super close, and can rub on the skin, which can lead to skin burns.</li>
            <li>The cleaning system works great though, although its a bit noisy but hey at least i can make it do that while i go to work, so I don&#x27;t have to listen to it :)    </li>
            <li>I logged onto Amazon and reviewed many different electric shavers, concidering many brands and price ranges.   </li>
            <li>So I am replacing an older model of the Panasonic Wet/Dry variety and I am again satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Shaver works super.</li>
            <li>This razor will quickly pay for itself.  </li>
            <li>It should pay for itself quickly, considering I was paying out the rear for replacement Quattro blades for my Schick.</li>
            <li>He was overwhelmed by the programming features (he&#x27;s not a detail person) but he quickly figured it out and plugged it in.  </li>
            <li>And most importantly, I love (and my girlfriend especially loves)</li>
            <li>Best results so far are using it wet with a gel-type shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Charges super quick.</li>
            <li>My guess is that different shavers will suit different beards/faces, and for some the Braun may be best.  </li>
            <li>I also like the clippers that it comes built-in with, allowing me trim my burns in one quick shot.  </li>
            <li>I bought this shaver as replacement of an older Panasonic with linear motor, and I am pleased with the shaver itself.</li>
            <li>The liquid on the blades is lubricant, and it will help tremendously to provide a smoother, closer shave as well as preserve the life of the blades.  </li>
            <li>I have light skin yet a fairly heavy beard, which suggests that this razor would be a great asset to virtually anyone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In conclusion, a great shaver with all the current technology and features offered by the competition at a reasonable asking</li>
            <li>Bottom line, it does the job adequately.</li>
            <li>I really looked forward to receiving this product and trying out simply based on all the great reviews it received.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very quiet, does a great job on the beard and holds a charge very well.  </li>
            <li>It charges quickly and holds a charge well.</li>
            <li>What you lose (for shaving your head) is a bit of width and flatness  that seemed to help make quick work of head-shaving.    </li>
            <li>The latest model is also quieter than the last model and has a more substantial feel to it while holding it.    </li>
            <li>We have tried several different shavers but this is the best one yet and&lt;br /&gt;it has a cleaning attachment.</li>
            <li>I have also used a blade between razor purchases, when the razors needed new parts and on special occasions just because it looks better.    </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for anyone, you will really love it.</li>
            <li>I love everything about this shaver and highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also had it 3 weeks and have not used up the first cleaning cartridge yet, and I clean it daily, so that seems to be good too.</li>
            <li>Once the hair adapts to new type of blade, shave is very smooth.</li>
            <li>I rinse my razor after ever use before I let the machine clean the razor, so my cartridge is pretty clean not tons of hair in the filter of the cartridge</li>
            <li>For the first 2 weeks it was shaving unbelievably smooth, but, the sharpness-smooth aspect has deminished somewhat noticeably.  </li>
            <li>It is more efficient and effective than any other shaver I have ever owned...</li>
            <li>The cleaning solution is pretty cheap on Amazon too (about $10 for a 3 month supply).    </li>
            <li>And the results left my face as smooth as if I had used shaving cream and a good straight razor.</li>
            <li>First off it took about two weeks of using it every day for my neck line to become accustomed to it(some irritation/red bumps) and after that it has been smooth sailing.  </li>
            <li>Some light hair still remained but its just the first shave.</li>
            <li>Panasonics have consistently had the highest motor speed available in any electric shaver.    </li>
            <li>the old fashioned way -- in the shower while my face was nice and wet (believe me you get a good shave that way).    </li>
            <li>The fancy technologies on this shaver are all cool and useful</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be aware that the auto clean feature uses a special cleaning cartridge that must be replaced after 30 cleaning cycles.</li>
            <li>This razor is fast, clean, and irritation free.  </li>
            <li>push a button and the next time you use it is nice and clean.</li>
            <li>Not having to clean it is a huge time saver, and it&#x27;s surprisingly gentle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experimented with other manufacturers&#x27; shavers over the years, including Brauns, Norelcos and Grundig shavers, but I&#x27;ve ultimately found nirvana, ok, not quite nirvana, but a most pleasant shaving experience with Panasonic shavers.  </li>
            <li>What convinced me to take the plunge and buy a new one was the fact that my travel remmington battery powered razor worked better than my Bruan.  </li>
            <li>I really love the new panasonic lineup.</li>
            <li>I just wanted a new, and potentially better, version of what I already had.</li>
            <li>and i learn a new pattern, this is getting better.    </li>
            <li>I will wait and see if it is the razor or the new blades that are doing a better job on my \\&quot;difficult\\&quot; spots.</li>
            <li>My husband told my father how satisfied he was with his new shaver, and loaned it to him to try.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, in spite of all the new bells and whistles, these expense razors don&#x27;t shave any better than their predecessors, regardless of brand.</li>
            <li>I get about 8 shaves from a full charge right now --</li>
            <li>Both the Braun and the Panasonic use a straight vibrating cutter, so switching is easy.</li>
            <li>Fast and easy.</li>
            <li>He wanted a wet/dry shaver but it works so good dry</li>
            <li>The Net makes pretty much everything easy to buy so why not do your research and spend money wisely?  </li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave very quickly.</li>
            <li>When used dry it was as good as a blade.</li>
            <li>It was very well designed, easy to grip and use.</li>
            <li>It takes about 10 minutes (no shaver will give you a first-pass close shave) to get to that good dry shave (with or without pre-electric gels/oils) and you do have to put pressure on to get a close shave.</li>
            <li>The cleaner is nice, although quite loud and pretty cheap-looking.</li>
            <li>Overall though, the performance of the shaver as well as the convenience and versatility make this still a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>I do not have much facial hair, so this model with 3 blades is pretty good to me.</li>
            <li>when used dry as good as any electric.  </li>
            <li>After reading several reviews and seeing that most of you were rating this razor at 4-5 stars, I bought it!</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s used different kinds of electric razors since they first started to be sold \\&quot;way back when\\&quot; and he says this is the best ever.  </li>
            <li>The Braun was a joke, would not cut a beard more than a day old, wouldn&#x27;t cut the long hairs at all, and never did a good job.  </li>
            <li>The only thing magical about 30 days is that you can no longer return it for a refund - what a coincidence!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the new shaver for about two weeks now with Neutrogena shave cream (low foam, great smell)</li>
            <li>Anyhow, after a quick review of the top of the line shavers from various manufacturers currently available (including the new Braun Pulsonic models), I opted to go for the latest offering from Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Use shaving gel (not only does it give help the razor glide more easily, it lubricates the blades so that they won&#x27;t get damaged)    </li>
            <li>Weirdly enough, the best shave I&#x27;ve managed to get with this is shaving bone dry.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had this for a few days, but it&#x27;s easily the best shave from an electric that I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>I run the clean cycle after every use and the first cartridge is still in use after a month or so.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic is more suitable than other razors</li>
            <li>Instead of a large alcohol filled container you need to replace monthly</li>
            <li>It works great in the shower with a little soap.  </li>
            <li>The best part is that I can get to all the tough spots without accidentally drawing blood.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been very satisfied with any Panasonic products I&#x27;ve owned from phones, DVD players, to TV&#x27;s, so I was pleasantly surprised to see a Panasonic razor in the list of highly reviewed razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Later on I upgraded to a high end norelco shaver XL series and at first it seemed great with its 3 floating heads.</li>
            <li>I look forward to the next improvement on this shaver, but until then I am happy, I got it for less than $100., and if I change in even two years, I got more than my money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li>it really gives you a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>This razor is very ergonomic and comfortable in hand.  </li>
            <li>My infection has cleared up, and this shaver is nothing short of amazing.  </li>
            <li>It provides a very close and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>Much like a cheap Reming^0n.  </li>
            <li>I use the cleaning system everyday, and it is great.</li>
            <li>Especially reading all of the amazing reviews on this product.     </li>
            <li>The shave was smooth and very close...not as close as a blade of course but much better than the old Braun i was using before.  </li>
            <li>Smooth as a blade, takes about 4 minutes for whole head.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable with no irritation and gets a very close shave for an electric.  </li>
            <li>but you really need to find out which way the grain is going and then move against it, for that razor smooth finish</li>
            <li>Light weight, shaves very close..</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;d use it very sparingly on my neck, as it wasn&#x27;t as comfortable as the floating triple heads on the Norelco.   </li>
            <li>Recently bought a plasma TV and its amazing as well.</li>
            <li>It gives a very close, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>If you shave everyday, this razor will keep you in great shape.</li>
            <li>Amazon had the best price, and free shipping, how can you go wrong?</li>
            <li>The foam was thick, which I&#x27;m sure gunked up the blades resulting in me having to go over my face and neck more, resulting in more irritation.  </li>
            <li>The razor does a nice enough job on the face, but it murders anything below my jaw line.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>and I believe itis well worth it.    </li>
            <li>For the most comfortable shave, shave in the shower using a shaving gel with glycerine such as gillette Fusion or Noxema Comfort Gel.</li>
            <li>Once I knew what direction to shave on the different parts of my face, I went from a five to six minute shave to a 2.5 to 3 minute shave that is closer and more comfortable  than any blade I have ever used.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s  still cheaper than a couple months worth of blades.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how picky people can be for this item as I am 100% satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I think this shaver is very much worth the price I paid on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The auto cleaner works wonders and although sometimes leaves a couple pieces of hair behind, it is simply amazing how good of a job it does.</li>
            <li>Another thing worth noting is its running cost.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to use and even on the neck</li>
            <li>I figured if I had a quality electric razor I could shave more frequently</li>
            <li>The LCD display works nicely showing the current charge level of the device.  </li>
            <li>It is quite, smooth, has a better cleaning station and the cartridges are cheaper and last longer.  </li>
            <li>Having a heavy beard and sensitive skin, I took the advice of the directions and have used shaving cream every time (best wet/dry product I&#x27;ve ever used).</li>
            <li>Eventually, I just kind of stopped shaving regularly.  </li>
            <li>He got it early to make sure it did not break him out and has not stopped using it.</li>
            <li>the most comfortable to hold of any of the above mentioned shavers.</li>
            <li>Notches on the side provide a solid grip, and a patterned thumb dot on top provides a comfortable place for said digit to rest.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased it for my stepfather who is 91 yrs old ,he loves it reccommended to his brother they both love it...</li>
            <li>I wanted a charging/cleaning station but haven&#x27;t really been able to tell if the cleaning makes much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s totally worth it, for me and for him.</li>
            <li>and it was worth every pennie.</li>
            <li>the wet shave is much better and leaves your face more smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its WELL worth the money.  </li>
            <li>The cleaner is pretty cool too, although it takes an hour to do the job.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the price of the product</li>
            <li>well worth it.    </li>
            <li>I have tried to use an electric shaver many times over the years but have never really been satisfied with the shave.  </li>
            <li>Using shaving cream, I can say is wow, this is just as close as a razor and so much better than Braun.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>My wife has remarked more than a few times how close my shave is and how effective the product has worked.  </li>
            <li>With the Panasonic coming in at the $95-$105 price range I thought it would be worth a shot.  </li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT IS WELL WORTH</li>
            <li>This makes the skin kind of roll underneath the shaver, then the 13,000 RPM blades make short work of the hairs.    </li>
            <li>The last model of Panasonic that I had lasted nearly seven years and was a great product.</li>
            <li>second guess yourself, try it out and make your own decision as skin types do vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>only thing I liked about this was the beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>and they just don&#x27;t seem to be worth it.  </li>
            <li>I suspect the cleaning feature will be useful if and when I use it</li>
            <li>They convinced me the 8109 was worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li>I always liked the cleaning system but cleaned and charged my shaver in the cleaner only once a week (every Sunday).  </li>
            <li>This is really frustrating since Panasonic makes wonderful shavers but always appears to have an \\&quot;Achille&#x27;s heel.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>For $104 on Amazon, it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>then helps keep the blades fresh smelling.  </li>
            <li>Love this razor so far.  </li>
            <li>As a direct comparison to my old Braun, the results of the shave are as good as ever.</li>
            <li>Considering that I paid $99 (plus tax), and it shaves as close and comfortably as my old $250 Braun, I don&#x27;t think I could do any better.</li>
            <li>You see for me the most sensitive part to shave has always been the mustache and chin area.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>Rest assured that this product is well worth the investment.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for the Fast FREE Shipping !  </li>
            <li>It is capable of achieving a very close shave in most areas, however I noticed it lacking in my neck and the bottom of my chin.</li>
            <li>All in all, good value for the money spent</li>
            <li>One touch with  a fingertip proves it.    </li>
            <li>My experience so far:  The shaver works better after a couple of uses (in my case I would say after 3 weeks of use).</li>
            <li>This is the second Panasonic shaver I&#x27;ve own.  </li>
            <li>My Norelco gave me almost twice that, despite being many years old.  </li>
            <li>My old Panasonic didn&#x27;t have a cleaning station and was easy to clean just running it under the faucet.</li>
            <li>I got this product when it was on sale for about $100, which is probably what it is worth.  </li>
            <li>It was worth every penny I paid, and then some.</li>
            <li>Switched to the old mug soap and top of the line   razors from Mach3 to Fusion, but for me, cuts way to close</li>
            <li>This shaver is faster, closer and easier on the face (multi pivotal head) than Panasonic it replaced (9 yrs old).   </li>
            <li>If I need it, I can lock the head, but have rarely found the need.  </li>
            <li>It was a far better rated razor than what is offered for women.  </li>
            <li>30days for the skin to get use to the shaver, and so far I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>: so far it has held a charge for 10 or more days while traveling.  </li>
            <li>So far I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>First I trimmed my goatee down a bit with the pop out trimmer on the unit,a great feature in itself.</li>
            <li>It seemed too good to be true, but Panasonic products have never let me down yet.</li>
            <li>The closeness of the shaver is far better than I anticipated, Sharper Image was right giving this thing an award.</li>
            <li>charger looks ridiculously big, but it also comes with a more travel friendly charger.  </li>
            <li>Shaving is fast and clean, my face is smooth and it has cleared up very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a cheapie Norelco years and years ago when I first hit puberty, but I quickly changed to razors.</li>
            <li>The need to clean your shaver will depend in large part on what you shave with (I use a foam, which tends to rinse cleaner than creams and gels).</li>
            <li>When I finish shaving, my face feels totally clean shaven, and I only notice the difference at the end of the day (stubble seems slightly more pronounced).    </li>
            <li>I was most recently using a Norelco shaver (Speed XL I think) with a jet clean unit.  </li>
            <li>I do have to go over the spots twice or three times for the clean shave, but the action is smooth and doesn’t irritate</li>
            <li>I debated a long time on whether to buy an electric shaver again after many years of being a blade boy!  </li>
            <li>Price is good compared to the other one.</li>
            <li>the closest, most comfortable shave possible with this shaver, shave after your stubble has had 2 days to grow and shave with shaving gel/cream and hot water like a blade.  </li>
            <li>Quiet, powerful, recharges quickly, and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the Panasonic is much louder in Db, but it is much more high pitched, almost like a Dentist&#x27;s drill and hair clippers had a baby, and this is it.  </li>
            <li>My face felt super smooth and soft afterward!    </li>
            <li>They were right.    </li>
            <li>I bought this razor as a Gold Box Deal of the day because the price was right</li>
            <li>It just buzzes right on through effortlessly.   </li>
            <li>The price was right</li>
            <li>He could shave right from bed.</li>
            <li>must go the right way there</li>
            <li>I pulled this out of the packaging and tried it out right away.  </li>
            <li>I just drop the shaver in the cleaner, press the selector button to get the right lights to come on, and I let it do its thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you&#x27;d like - the Panasonic cuts right through them.</li>
            <li>Panasonic got it right with this one.</li>
            <li>Takes 15 - 20 minutes to do it right</li>
            <li>Maybe I wasn&#x27;t using it right</li>
            <li>They may actually be right on this one.  </li>
            <li>just* right so as to break off the flip-out trimmer head.</li>
            <li>am amazed that Panasonic can&#x27;t get this detail right</li>
            <li>Right out of the box</li>
            <li>If you hold the shaver just right you will get shaver clippings all over your face, your clothes, your sink, etc.</li>
            <li>Even right out of the box, the Norelco shave quality was marginal, and my face still felt like 100 grit sandpaper after working it over for 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I had never used a Panasonic shaver before, but the price was right</li>
            <li>It just cruises right through the thickest parts with no signs of struggle.</li>
            <li>However, with my job and the amount of travel I do, overnight flights, right into meetings and so on</li>
            <li>I have not gotten irritation, though I moisturize right after shaving.      </li>
            <li>Lets get right to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Provides a great shave even after the first few times.</li>
            <li>Of course it&#x27;s not loud and is inaudible probably more than 4 feet away in a quite room, but still, sounds like cheap parts to me.    </li>
            <li>Just to review, my first Panasonic wet/dry was great and served me well for about 3 years, but when the Panasonic models came out a few years ago with the Vortex cleaning systems, I just had to have one, so I moved on to the model ES8078 wet/dry shaver.</li>
            <li>While I believe it was clean (most of the time), it just didn&#x27;t seem as clean, and when the cleaning fluid was near the end of its life, it wasn&#x27;t clean.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic razor works well; it cuts smoothly (closer than the Norelco) but it is particular about which way you draw the razor across your face.  </li>
            <li>It is quick, relatively quiet, smooth on the skin and leaves said skin just about as smooth as the proverbial baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>Its also very esy to clean</li>
            <li>I shave first thing every morning just to have it behind me and this shaver does an excellent job.</li>
            <li>The only difference between the two is the ES8228S adds a zippered vinyl travel case (vs cloth bag with draw strings) and the head has independent floating foil (each of the 3 foils is on their own suspension to track the curves of the face better).th draw strings) and the head has independent floating foil (each of the 3 foils is on their own suspension to track the curves of the face better).</li>
            <li>I look forward to the next improvement on this shaver, but until then I am happy, I got it for less than $100., and if I change in even two years, I got more than my money&#x27;s worth!by that time upgrade it.</li>
            <li>I have had an assortment of electric razors over the past 30 years and by far this is the best one yet.  </li>
            <li>, I wanted a way to clean up a bit, and fairly fast.  </li>
            <li>Works perfectly in the shower and is very easy to clean without using the base -</li>
            <li>The Panasonic family is best for beards where the hair grows parallel to the face where the hairs lay down.</li>
            <li>No other electric shaver I used was able to do this.</li>
            <li>It has a nice pivot and the very finely crafted foil glides across the face, at least my face.    </li>
            <li>This works great, takes up little space, has a nice easy to read display, charges fast, and unless I run into serious problems (although with a 2 year parts and labor warranty I am not worried) in the next year or more, I am sure it can be handled</li>
            <li>I found the shaver screen got hot pretty quickly, even when using it wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The battery life of the shaver is more than adequate, it should last for between five and seven shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like the ink cartridge for the printer, except in this case everyone DOES have soap lying around--Panasonic could have easily made this an environmentally friendly mechanism whereby one uses common household soap to refill the cleaning machine;</li>
            <li>It is very nice, but the display died after a few months.&lt;br /&gt;After one year it shaves me every morning as it was the first</li>
            <li>It still works fine today, but I thought that I should retire it after 22 years and try a new Panasonic.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s apparent most people swear by it and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this razor every day for the past month, and it works great.  </li>
            <li>My first electric razor in 25 years for whatever that&#x27;s worth when checking this review.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic razor gives me a close shave without the irritation experienced in the past.</li>
            <li>Just $20 more than the bare bones shaver.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the actual size of the razor, this isn&#x27;t a lightweight cheap feeling product, it has some mass to it and fits nicely in your hand.  </li>
            <li>Excellent overall shaver -- works very well as a wet shaver in the shower.</li>
            <li>Recently the fusion disposables (which are great) have been racking up a bill and its kind of a slow process in the morning.</li>
            <li>The whole cleaning thing is a bit much, i just wash it once a week with liquid soap, and after every shave with water and it works fine.</li>
            <li>While it took time for my face to adjust to the new shaver, over a couple of weeks I noticed that I was able to get a closer and closer shave with this razor until it was pretty much shaving as close as a non-electric razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably use that latter method the large majority of the time, and the \\&quot;cleaning fluid\\&quot; once in a while to ensure it&#x27;s nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shave obviously is not as close as a razor, but it is very good - if you take the time to feel for rough spots.</li>
            <li>For other first time users, it will take a while to get a good shave the first time around.</li>
            <li>and I really feel I got good value for the money spent.</li>
            <li>The closest shave and most comfortable occurs when wet</li>
            <li>It is super fast, and doesn&#x27;t pull or irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>I had a rotary and replaced blades religiously but the ES8109S is far superior.  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the bottom line: sometimes it is worth paying more money than you are accustomed to, and this is definitely one of those times.</li>
            <li>Good if you don&#x27;t mind replacing every 12 months or less.</li>
            <li>The foil system is very similar to the Braun, and its easy to clean either with the cleaning unit or under water.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is much better and gives a much closer shave than my old Norelco.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, not messy like the Norelco one, and it even dries the razor.  </li>
            <li>Just a few more sentences and better organized layout,  </li>
            <li>Its well thought out, well built, easy to clean and has a lot of potential.</li>
            <li>I got good, close shaves from the start and noted it was about half the size of my Braun.  </li>
            <li>I just decided to try traditional DE razor blades instead because I prefer simplicity and the ability to easily keep my shaver clean.  </li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re looking for a close, quick shave this Panasonic can very well be the answer for a fraction of its competitors.</li>
            <li>I have not tried the auto clean feature yet, but CR reviews spoke highly of that too.</li>
            <li>It produced a clean smooth shave every time, right up to the final shave.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and the little screen lets you know the battery level,very cool!</li>
            <li>It was the right decision because this razor works better then both of the brands mentioned above and is cheaper.</li>
            <li>So, if you are going to buy this for a present make sure that if you don&#x27;t like return it right away</li>
            <li>You can tell right away it does a better job overall</li>
            <li>THEN MY OLDER ONE!!</li>
            <li>Bonus feature, the unit is very very light.&lt;br /&gt;2-The flexibility to use dry/wet is a plus.</li>
            <li>This is one close shaving machine and very fast.</li>
            <li>I like the percentage of charge left indicator rather than a light that indicates when recharging is necessary - much more accurate.</li>
            <li>The cutters on this Panasonic oscillates very fast, against the foil.  </li>
            <li>If you want very fast speed and use an electric shaver, expect abit of noise.</li>
            <li>I bought it for a friend who likes it very much.</li>
            <li>I very much like the charge indicator.  </li>
            <li>This is a very smooth razor that is also very quiet.</li>
            <li>Other than being loud, this is a great product.  </li>
            <li>I have never used a wet/dry version before, but so far I am enjoying the ability to use it in the shower, it works much better than a dry shave.    </li>
            <li>Due to that I learned to shave never going against the grain with a razor and that has let me shave my face twice a week problem free, if I shaved more than twice... skin irritation.    </li>
            <li>and I much prefer the reminder on the Braun models however this shaver is way superior in every other.</li>
            <li>Charging is pretty fast, for a quick shave just few minutes should be good.    </li>
            <li>I was hoping this new shaver would be significantly improved over the Braun Model 7526</li>
            <li>I always run the razor under running water to partially clean it so the solution lasts a bit longer (not that cheap just can&#x27;t find it locally).</li>
            <li>It almost started bleeding after so many tries but I could not get a clean shave on the neck at all.   </li>
            <li>The 2nd time around was so quick and easy.</li>
            <li>And I also feel that the poor craftsman blames his tools, and this tool will allow a very good shave when used correctly.  </li>
            <li>(learned that the hard way lol.)    </li>
            <li>After discounts, the new unit was only ~$40 more -- so upgrade time!  </li>
            <li>/charge/dry my razor and it came out sparkling new and shiny clean.  </li>
            <li>First off, it wound up taking longer than a manual razor.  </li>
            <li>this thing really works!  </li>
            <li>The Vortex ended up being exactly what I thought it would be...</li>
            <li>About the sound of somebody&#x27;s loud vibrating cell on a glass table.    </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve all tried many different types and styles to get that close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li>I use Gillette Shave Gel with Glycerin when I shave in the hot shower.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m generally pretty hairy.</li>
            <li>This is my first review EVER</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find how smooth a shave it gave.</li>
            <li>Either way ya go, this Panosonic does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>This is the first wet/dry electric razor I have owned</li>
            <li>last was 18 months, but most of them died within 12 months.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, It took me a while to get use too and took me about an hour to shave my beard off.</li>
            <li>I have gotten some pretty damn close shaves with this thing.    </li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver</li>
            <li>that the comments for some of the higher priced selections.   </li>
            <li>(he is not shy about speaking his mind if he is not).</li>
            <li>It just isn&#x27;t as consistent as a blade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many electric shavers during my 64 years and until now they all left a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li>Boy am I glad that I purchased the Panasonic over the Braun, there is no comparison to the shave quality not to mention the noise level being reduce and the overall cost.     </li>
            <li>Make sure you buy an extra set of replacement blades.</li>
            <li>First one was a ES8066 and it lasted about 7 years or so.</li>
            <li>With the Norelco it did not seem to matter because of the circular blade action; with the Panasonic it is important to draw the razor against the direction in which my beard grows.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin and have normally bought the 3 head shavers, mostly Norelcos.  </li>
            <li>I bought a series 7 Braun which gave a close shave for the first year.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning/charging dock does very well on cleaning!</li>
            <li>2) Turn on hot tap water.  </li>
            <li>Turn on shaver, rinse in hot water while it&#x27;s on, then start shaving    </li>
            <li>Periodically dip the (running) shaver under the hot water.  </li>
            <li>You will be rewarded with a pleasurable, close and comfortable shave that compares to going to the barber shop for a hot towel/straight razor professional shave.  </li>
            <li>Got this as my first electric.</li>
            <li>My facial hair grows in softer, and I am able to shave every day if need be (unlike every 2 to 3 days with the Mach 3).  </li>
            <li>for the noise, this shaver is actually quieter than most electrics I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>changes that don&#x27;t make either the blades or the cleaning system better but do keep you from having extra parts if</li>
            <li>However, I have stored the elaborate cleaner and charger (overkill) under my bathroom sink, and I use the simpler charging and cleaning methods that the instructions offer as equally acceptable options.</li>
            <li>I first go over the face and neck with the shaver.  </li>
            <li>first impressions are \\&quot;WOW!\\&quot; and \\&quot;AMAZING!\\&quot; and \\&quot;UNBELIEVABLE\\&quot; so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It shaves pretty close.  </li>
            <li>+ on this if I had tried it out in a store first.</li>
            <li>That is exactly what i was trying to replace.</li>
            <li>The only problem when in the shower is not being able to see what your doing.  </li>
            <li>After using them item he gets a much smoother shave and rarely an ingrown hair.</li>
            <li>The shaver works well on the face, but it never once got my neck clear and smooth like I like it.</li>
            <li>Upon the first time I used the Vortex, I felt like I was using a shaver I had already been using for six months.  </li>
            <li>A razor system should last more than a year...</li>
            <li>Additionally, and this is a big con, I break out much, MUCH more when I use this often.</li>
            <li>This is the first electric shaver in 6 years that I have tried.</li>
            <li>You really do have to try this shaver!  </li>
            <li>I am a consistent user of this product.  </li>
            <li>I purchased lectric shave and even followed the advice of some users to take a hot shower, apply the alcohol based solution to my skin, and then shave.</li>
            <li>It takes me many swipes in different directions to shave an area acceptably.</li>
            <li>You can get the same quality of shave in many cheaper razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have only had this razor for a couple of days, so I will update my review as time passes and try more of the functions.</li>
            <li>First a liitle background, I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in 10 years and always shaved with a razor.  </li>
            <li>Shaves pretty close.</li>
            <li>Overall pleased.</li>
            <li>Absolutely!</li>
            <li>Takes time to retrain to an electric but results are promising!   </li>
            <li>I bought this based on the reviews, which were stellar.</li>
            <li>i have to make several passes, it doesn&#x27;t cut most of the hairs, and i have to adjust the angles ad infinitum.  </li>
            <li>I believe this issue is more personal and wouldn&#x27;t let it affect the review.    </li>
            <li>This is my first experience with a foil</li>
            <li>The first was the ES8066 and if I used shaving cream it would shave so close</li>
            <li>This is my first razor with a cleaning station</li>
            <li>It shaves my face better than a regular razor.  </li>
            <li>Turning on this razor for the first time summoned a response akin to what an aviation engineer must have felt when he heard a jet engine for the first time...</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with a foil shaver</li>
            <li>However, that soon passed after my first shave.  </li>
            <li>After I shaved with it the first time I could not stop running my hands over my face in amazement, and I still can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare it to some of the higher end competition, but I can say I couldn&#x27;t imagine getting a closer shave than this</li>
            <li>The first time around for me, it looked like I was attacked by my girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, my regular razor gave me a better closer shave.</li>
            <li>It shaves closer and cuts more hair on the first pass, eliminating a 3rd or 4th pass.</li>
            <li>I have now started using it \\&quot;wet\\&quot; by warming my face with hot water, then applying a Neutragena shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Despite the cleaning problem, I was willing to buy the $200+ Braun shaver since I like their foil system.  </li>
            <li>My first shaver lasted about four years and had one blade/screen replacement.  </li>
            <li>Ok, after using the &#x27;cheaper&#x27; offerings in the Norelco brand of shavers for the last 20+ years I wanted to upgrade.</li>
            <li>After the first two or three uses</li>
            <li>That now allows for a smoother feeling and I look better til my next shave.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t give any updates as to charging time/battery life or the cleaner as I haven&#x27;t had to use either yet, but I&#x27;m sure they are as solid as the shaver itself is.</li>
            <li>It gives a pretty close shave around the mustache and goatee chin area.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning system takes about an hour and is pretty</li>
            <li>First, it is cheaper than Braun&#x27;s with comparable features, and I was intrigued by the ability to shave using shaving cream again.  </li>
            <li>It was a 4000 series (I don&#x27;t remember the exact number, but I still have Braun 2, which is model 5770).      </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never shaved better in my life, and plan on sticking with Panasonic shavers in the future.</li>
            <li>This shaver is even better if that is possible.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver and observe that not only do I get a closer shave, which surprised me, but a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>First thing I did was go to Amazon.</li>
            <li>Panasonic needs to hire some better technical writers.</li>
            <li>and I think they could sell more units, especially if people download the manual before they buy a product.</li>
            <li>My Panasonic wet/dry that I purchased more than ten years ago</li>
            <li>Please read the reviews for the higher end Panasonic razors.  </li>
            <li>This is my First Electric Razor..</li>
            <li>The more you use it, the longer it should last (what?)</li>
            <li>This is my first electric/ cordless shaver</li>
            <li>If the noise bothers you, either use a blade or perhaps listen to music while you&#x27;re shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I did not spend extra money for the model with the self cleaning business.</li>
            <li>My 5 o&#x27;clock shadow looks likes most peoples 3rd day without shaving.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s how the first try went and</li>
            <li>Then I took a hot shower to soften up the hair.</li>
            <li>I fill the sink with HOT water and lube up my face with King Of Shaves Gel.</li>
            <li>I generally use shaving gel and it works real well and is convenient being able to shave in the shower.  </li>
            <li>This is my first Panasonic Razor.</li>
            <li>Since it is on the small side  you actually get a good grip of it in your hand which is cool because the razor is under total control with a good grip.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with my first purchase of a Panasonic Electric Razor........</li>
            <li>best of all is the price $$$  compared to expensive Brauns and Norelcos....</li>
            <li>My first was a rotory.</li>
            <li>on more than one occasion I tried repeated to get these areas with the shaver only to end up getting nicks and razor-burn.</li>
            <li>Just died on me and only used like once a month as razers were better and faster.</li>
            <li>The first I dropped and broke.  </li>
            <li>Have owned three electric shavers before this purchase, with my most recent two being Braun&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I first opened the box</li>
            <li>, I just charged the razor with the cord the first time.  </li>
            <li>I just rinsed the shaving cream off of the head with hot water and held the power button until the razor went into it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>This is my first electric razor.  </li>
            <li>but I have since quit using it because I mainly use the shaver in the shower now so a quick pull apart and rinse gets it cleaner than the stand.  </li>
            <li>Ok, here are my initial thoughts after four days of use.  </li>
            <li>In the ensuing four days, it has only gotten better.  </li>
            <li>After I finish, it feels in most areas as close as a blade although truth be told, it&#x27;s not quite because the five o&#x27;clock shadow creeps in a bit earlier in the day</li>
            <li>and I think I could shave more then once a day if needbe, something I never thought would be possible.    </li>
            <li>This is the first shaver that I purchased with a cleaning unit</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a \\&quot;zing\\&quot; as opposed to the old  \\&quot;chopping\\&quot; sound.</li>
            <li>He told me the exact model and brand</li>
            <li>So, I recommend it and can truly say paying more is not necessary.</li>
            <li>Be aware that an electric razor may cut hair that it is not visible in your face (example, the area below your eyes); so I would recommend to use a mirror in order to see what you are shaving.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted me eleven years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase and could summarize the difference between my old shaver and this one as smaller, sleeker, quieter and faster.  </li>
            <li>i just can&#x27;t imagine how it would be possible for another razor to be better than this.   </li>
            <li>After reading reviews on here, I decided to go out for the first time in my life and buy shaving cream to try out with this razor.</li>
            <li>This is my first Panasonic brand electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>I have just ordered the first replacemt foil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it since last November and love it.  </li>
            <li>I first picked it up at a Sam&#x27;s Club 5 years ago.</li>
            <li>That is more than 1300 shaves total!</li>
            <li>Thanks Panasonic!  </li>
            <li>I too have tried many different brands over the years.</li>
            <li>which is something that I&#x27;ve only been able to do with blades.</li>
            <li>This is the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve had, but I read reviews before buying this one.  </li>
            <li>It is my first electric razor.  </li>
            <li>Being able to shave in the shower in the morning gives me an extra 5 minutes of sleep time.</li>
            <li>first purchase was a Norelco Arcitec.  </li>
            <li>(thanks Amazon for your return policy!)  </li>
            <li>He has pretty course hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the cleaning system twice and actually found that I do a better job of cleaning it by hand</li>
            <li>This product is my first electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good electric shaver for a few years now.</li>
            <li>I think this unit is good for someone who needs to shave everyday.</li>
            <li>It will take a few weeks for it to go a really good job on your face.</li>
            <li>, I knew that she bought it and had not shaved for 3 days, I have a heavy beard and thought that this would be a good test for it.  </li>
            <li>I did a good bit of research and was looking at another razor which has commercials being aired all day long.  </li>
            <li>These Panasonic models will give you a good shave if you plan to use them for just a few months and them throw them away.</li>
            <li>The shave is every bit as good as the Braun, and the Panasonic is about $100 to $150 LESS!  </li>
            <li>This new one is better and shaves closer then the old one.  </li>
            <li>Super fast recharge and very efficient cleaning cycle.  </li>
            <li>I received the razor after just three days, using the free Super Saver shipping and used it the following day.    </li>
            <li>With the Panasonic, I can shave twice daily quickly and smoothly.</li>
            <li>the Mach 3 Turbo razor or even the Gillette Fusion blade razor leaves my face less than perfectly smooth as I would expect with that many blades.</li>
            <li>the unit is easy to clean, including a mode where you rinse it and then just put it in the cradle and select the dry option.  </li>
            <li>One tip I have about cleaning the razor - I shave and rinse clean my shaver every day, and I only clean it in the Vortex when it needs charging which, for me, is about once every two weeks.</li>
            <li>Not as good as blades, but very close and with less irritation and no danger of cuts.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand, the shave is even better--- the sound alone tells  you this is a very \\&quot;fine\\&quot; cut.</li>
            <li>I have researched online to find the right product that doesn&#x27;t have too much maintenance and spare parts to purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too bad, but on days that I have important meetings/interviews, I do have to go over my neck with a regular razor just to make sure everything is perfect.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend this razor and didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars simply because I couldn&#x27;t compare it with others to be sure it absolutely deserved a top rating.</li>
            <li>To my understanding it shaves as good or better then high end Brauns or Nokias, but it has half initial and ongoing costs.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this one based on many positive reviews from users &amp; a positive fan following over here.</li>
            <li>Like every new shaving method, it takes about a month for the beard to adjust, and the first shave wasn&#x27;t entirely pleasant (as I recall from my previous foray with electrics a decade ago).     </li>
            <li>My 3 year old Norelco shaves closer even with the original blades.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to those who are sensitive to standard shaving razors, and want more than full value for their money.</li>
            <li>The flat design of the foil is a better design than the \\&quot;Arc</li>
            <li>Also the first cartridge didn&#x27;t even last the whole month, and this was after hearing someone being able to use it twice over.</li>
            <li>The same quality that I found with the original razor was easily rediscovered with the new unit.  </li>
            <li>If I had to do it again, I might not get model with Hydraclean system, just double clicking on button drives motor to higher rpm, stick it under faucet and its clean!</li>
            <li>Hands down the slickest most soothing gel ever created!</li>
            <li>This is a great razor!nafter the initial 2-3 weeks of your skin getting used to the new type of shaving (if you&#x27;re switching from a traditional razor)</li>
            <li>A huge bonus to it is that it&#x27;s able to work through a few days&#x27; growth.</li>
            <li>In the world of electric razors this might be one of the best, but why would you spend $100 for a product that eats up an outlet and counter space, and offers a worse shave than a $10 blade would offer?    </li>
            <li>I am a professional, explains to be clean shaven every day..  </li>
            <li>You can put some soft soap into the heads &amp; let them clean themselves because water can&#x27;t hurt this shaver, unlike the Braun.   </li>
            <li>Third, it shaves my testicles OK, but the the shaver really stings the seam between them.    </li>
            <li>Despite this flaw, I&#x27;m giving the razor 4 stars to reflect its superior performance with short facial hair.</li>
            <li>Panasonic shaves better than the old Braun and the old Norelco.  </li>
            <li>In that time I have had at least 6 different models and have found them all to be excellent.  </li>
            <li>The self-cleaning system is definitely worth it -- very convenient and doesn&#x27;t clog often, although you really do have to replace the cleaning carterage every month.</li>
            <li>its charger works well and the razor holds a long charge, but considering one needs to stroke an area many times to shave it in the first place</li>
            <li>It has not been able to shave nearly as close as my 8 year old Norelco and this shaver has a design flaw.</li>
            <li>No having to take a not so good product back, no having to buy a different shaver over and over before I get one that works as the product description says.</li>
            <li>In conclusion, I&#x27;d say the number 1 reason I like this shaver so much, is because after 30 years of hating shaving and the irritation I knew I was going to feel, I actually don&#x27;t mind shaving any more.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this shaver and its much quieter than some of the prior models.</li>
            <li>The battery held the charge the entire time, and worked well - good thing, since I left the charger at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In fact, since its electric, I&#x27;m also able to go against the grain which gives me a much smoother shave than a traditional razor blade.  </li>
            <li>now I am pretty pleased and will definitely recommend this product to those looking for a good and long lasting electric shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone who&#x27;s looking at an electric shaver and is pondering whether it&#x27;s worth the ~$100 investment.</li>
            <li>The new unit is faster, charges quicker, and runs quieter (great with 2 small kids).  </li>
            <li>In fact, I think that the fourth blade in the middle actually interferes with a better shave and these two middle blades are not as good as the primary cutters.</li>
            <li>The first shave I got was very good, it did miss a few hair on the neck as they were long</li>
            <li>I just cannot understand the 200+ positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>Purchased based on positive reviews from amazon.</li>
            <li>After a week, I have to say, I&#x27;m convinced the positive reviews of this product are spot on.  </li>
            <li>After reading all the positive reviews here I thought I&#x27;d give this one a try.</li>
            <li>But after going through the positive reviews on Amazon I thought of taking a chance.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, these new Panasonic \\&quot;Arc Foil\\&quot; shavers have the foil curving AWAY from your face at the ends of the foil, further decreasing exposure to the blades and requiring many more passes to cover the same area.</li>
            <li>This shaver is amazing, it provides a very smooth close shave, with less effort, and is not loud.  </li>
            <li>Frankly speaking, this is how long it took for me to realize the full potential of this amazing shaver.</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with a wet/dry razor, and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I have been using a Norelco for as long as I can remember and was satisfied with it</li>
            <li>and I like it as much as I did the first day</li>
            <li>Really well designed and consistent.  </li>
            <li>I pretty much keep it in the shower and shave without soap, recharging/cleaning about once a week.</li>
            <li>It works, others have left stray hairs and stubble, The first shave took longer than the average 3 minutes, but produced a great shaving experience.</li>
            <li>This pretty much wraps it up.  </li>
            <li>But it is pretty fast, I think.  </li>
            <li>The first being that yes, the cartridge was really used up, after it was done &#x27;cleaning&#x27; quite a bit of hairs were still around the razor.</li>
            <li>It would do a sorta ok job on the face and cheeks although no semblance of being as close as a blade but refused to cut the long hairs in the neck.  </li>
            <li>if you have a light beard, especially in the upper lip area, they are OK.</li>
            <li>and it has some lube in the cleaner to keep the blades nice and sharp and ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;Sounds</li>
            <li>It is cheaper than the Braun and the arcitec and rates just as good (if not better).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how true those claims are, but here is my experience so far:    </li>
            <li>I get incredibly close, it is amazing, though it takes a long time; and, occasionally it will leave my neck a bit rough and red.  </li>
            <li>I gave it a three because of the hydra clean system and ease to clean, dry and charge.</li>
            <li>For the positives:  Very fast smooth motor, much more comfortable shave overall compared to the $30 shavers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>After nine months and a set of fresh  blades I sold the shaver and switched to the new Gillette 5 blade power system &amp; their pro glide shave gel.</li>
            <li>the razor doesn&#x27;t seem to hold a charge for very long, so don&#x27;t travel any more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say the shave is very nearly if not as close as I&#x27;ve been able to get with a blade.  </li>
            <li>After shaving Friday morning, I usually don&#x27;t shave again until Monday morning, after which I get an amazing shave that puts a smile on my face and prepares me to face the challenges of the work week.  </li>
            <li>This razor set up with ease and I could understand the easy instructions; in English.</li>
            <li>I have not had a closer shave with an electric razor than this and even my girlfriend commented that my face was more smooth than usual.  </li>
            <li>I concluded that it is better as a dry shaver.     </li>
            <li>For me this shaver shaves better dry.</li>
            <li>using shave cream but using it dry is more than acceptable.</li>
            <li>I sometimes don&#x27;t clean the shaver for a few days and the cleaner works just as good then as when I do it daily.  </li>
            <li>I like the % battery charge left feature and also how easy it cleans up.</li>
            <li>I love how it can be used dry</li>
            <li>I LOVE how one can use it in the shower or on dry skin.</li>
            <li>It is quiet, well balanced and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Its considerable power makes shaving quick and as close as I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>and I was amazed that it better than dry.</li>
            <li>As for the self cleaning stand, I&#x27;m less enthusiastic.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t plan on using mine in the shower as I seem to get better results dry anyway and want to avoid the problems of leaking some</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;ve noticed as time passed on the &amp;#34;Cleaning&amp;#34; function on the dock became less effective.</li>
            <li>I know for certain it&#x27;s the charger, since I tested it with a multimeter.  </li>
            <li>It certainly isn&#x27;t nosier than my television.  </li>
            <li>It certainly isn&#x27;t nosier than my television.  </li>
            <li>As it turns out, the large four-blade surface is like trying to keep the end of a 2x4 on your face.</li>
            <li>A NEW MODEL FEELS LIKE!!</li>
            <li>Back in the day my first shaver was a cheap $40 panasonic which shaved very well but could not shave around the neck area.</li>
            <li>It also gets very hot during your shave which the old versions never did.</li>
            <li>Panasonic is a joy to use - wet or dry</li>
            <li>Works great wet or dry.</li>
            <li>Wet shaves are great but even dry</li>
            <li>This razor works great, in wet or dry.</li>
            <li>At a better price than the Braun and about the same as the Norelco the Panosonic gives a better shave hands down.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this razor less than one year after buying a Norelco (as a replacement for a good Norelco that gave up the ghost after nearly 10 years).  </li>
            <li>This one is far superior to the previous one.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I give the Panasonic 5 stars because it is reasonably priced, gives a great shave, holds it&#x27;s charge for a long time and isn&#x27;t unreasonably loud.  </li>
            <li>It cuts really close (even when dry it is comparable to a disposable manual razor) and is much quicker than my safety razor (though I will probably still use my Merkur on weekends when I have more time).</li>
            <li>1st, in my opinion, based on using two rotary electric razors (Norelco), 2 foil razors (Braun), and now a 3rd foil razor, none give as close of a shave as a razor blade, but if you give your face about a month to adapt you can generally get a good shave from the better (more expensive) electrics.  </li>
            <li>Not only is the razor noticeably lighter, it is skinnier, with a contoured shape for easy gripping, and a rubberized handle to reduce slipping.  </li>
            <li>My last one did not shave closely and would not cut some of the fine hair on my neck under my chin.  </li>
            <li>It worked fine the day before and was charged a day prior</li>
            <li>This shaver actually works fine.  </li>
            <li>: Overall, on the cheeks, the product works fine.  </li>
            <li>The first use resulted in a decent shave but nothing that would pass inspection.  </li>
            <li>I thought my Braun&#x27;s run of almost 5 years was pretty decent.</li>
            <li>The cleaning system is its strong suit and I&#x27;ve used this poorly designed razor for over a year because I liked the cleaning system so much.</li>
            <li>Very highly recommended to all who are hesitant to move from blades to electric.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a very high frequency pulsating noise (that you won&#x27;t notice in about 30 seconds into the shave),</li>
            <li>If it does turn on it will fill the chamber holding the razor with the cleaner and run on a very high speed to get the hairs to fall out.</li>
            <li>A nice close shave with little to no irritation.  </li>
            <li>Your cleaning cartridges will last longer because the shaver is already pretty clean when you start the cycle.    </li>
            <li>Also since this is a wet/dry model I can clean my shaver under running tap water first and use hydraclean only once a week.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it can be used wet or dry, I typically use it in the shower and it does a pretty close shave not quite as good as the razor</li>
            <li>I feel that foil shavers rinse cleaner than do rotary ones, and it is probably purely because the blades are more straight on these, whereas the old rotary shavers I had contained slightly curved blades, and could never seem to get fully clean.    </li>
            <li>It does OK on short stubbly stuff but tends to miss stuff that&#x27;s longer or not stiff.  </li>
            <li>My first real electric shaver and it works amazingly, that whole 30 days to adjust is true so tough it out.</li>
            <li>It probably works even better than the old one when it was new, and it weighs less, costs less (made in China), and looks more stylish.</li>
            <li>After a few days of using this razor my face was smooth and free of nicks or bumps.  </li>
            <li>Personally, i desire a shaver that&#x27;s comfortable, thorough, and fast (as in completing a shave).</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s HUGE different between the two.</li>
            <li>At least it can perform the most important functions.</li>
            <li>Ordered and received the  shaver in a very timely manner from Amazon.com and plugged it in for a charge.</li>
            <li>That is how much I like this.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but I figured the cleaning/drying cycle would take like 20mins tops.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is absolute trash.</li>
            <li>I have coarse whiskers densely arrayed around my chin, with a light sprinkling elsewhere.</li>
            <li>The package arrived, I had everything out and ready to go and charged up in no time.    </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I have a light beard and still it requires sevreral passes over the same spot.</li>
            <li>Anyway I get a really close shave with the ES8109S and</li>
            <li>They shave your face very evenly and do not tear up your neck like the Norelco ones.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this shaver!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t feel it on my skin until after the shave when I notice how much smoother my face is compared to when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>It is NOT as thorough as a razor in my opinion, nor is it as fast.  </li>
            <li>After much research, I purchased this shaver to replace my dying Norelco wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t think of any at all.</li>
            <li>Whole kit cost just $100.</li>
            <li>I can say that it shaves my head much better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I will absolutely buy another Panasonic when time necessitates it.</li>
            <li>I switched to an electric because of the amount of irritation I get from a straight razor.</li>
            <li>So I suggest that you don&#x27;t replace the blades, just replace the whole shaver.  </li>
            <li>While happy, I was tired of spending 20 bucks on a pack of blades.  </li>
            <li>Now I need to test it with lather in the shower to see what it can really do.</li>
            <li>It is incredibly fast and provides the closest shave that I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>For the price, this is well worth it to have such a reliable, fast, and powerful shaver.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>It provides me with a much closer shave than I get with my Braun Synchro electric razor.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really used the cleaning system, so</li>
            <li>The HydraClean system works really well.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>He reports that he is very satifisfied</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t feel much of a burn because it isn&#x27;t shaving.</li>
            <li>I often notice that it misses some hairs (ones that are not sticking straight up in the air) no matter how often I go over that area.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic shaver shaves very close to the skin, but it does not damage the skin.</li>
            <li>My only gripe is that the ac adapter now is noticeably cheaper and makes a buzzing sound.  </li>
            <li>I used to use a Philips rotary shaver - all I can say is that this unit shaves much closer.</li>
            <li>I have very sesitive skin</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Would recommend this shaver to anyone who wants a close shave.</li>
            <li>Not objectionable to me but much louder than my Norelco.    </li>
            <li>Not to mention it was at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Panasonic and Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It holds a charge very well.  </li>
            <li>It lists on here that it shaves in \\&quot;1\\&quot; pass, not so much.</li>
            <li>I did get a smokin&#x27; deal on here though and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Really like the battery indicator</li>
            <li>For $100 I expected so much more from the Vortex.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wondering if I have a faulty product, but I really don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>He comments every day about how much he loves it and has never had an electric shaver that worked so well.  </li>
            <li>To my surprise (and his) he absolutely loves it and has been using it ever since.  </li>
            <li>Does very well shaving on the jawline and under the chin.</li>
            <li>The ES8109S has really exceeded my expectations in every way.  </li>
            <li>But I still expected more.</li>
            <li>I have been shaving with a blade for over 30 years and have not had much experience with electric shavers.</li>
            <li>Shaving in the shower softens your beard, and creams really lubricated and soften the blow of scraping steel across your face.</li>
            <li>I thought the Gillette MACH Fusion Power ad of $1 a week as too much, so I bought this for $69 at Circuit City days, just before they went out of biz.  </li>
            <li>Maybe $1 a week is not too much after all.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the absolute closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Its very helpful to know how much charge the razor has,</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this razor!</li>
            <li>I really like the razor and the cleaning/charging station rocks.</li>
            <li>This is a real time saver.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried electric before and not been happy but the newer multi-blade razors were irritating me</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really close.</li>
            <li>Razor is fast, gives a close shave.</li>
            <li>I really like the cleaning system that comes with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job very well.  </li>
            <li>This is a wet/dry razor which I hadn&#x27;t really thought about.  </li>
            <li>thanks so much</li>
            <li>And no, I do not have the courage to try a straight razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While the razor can be cleaned with tap water and soap, I really do recommend the use of the cleaning stand.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic wet-dry shavers are very versatile.</li>
            <li>I would have kept the Braun had the automatic cleaner part of it not broken.</li>
            <li>whatever Panasonic is doing, it works REALLY well</li>
            <li>and I really like the self cleaning feature.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t believe it really does much cleaning of the head at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the shave is very close and does not irritate your skin.  </li>
            <li>I do like the waterproof design of the Panasonic shavers, but not the fact that you have to use them wet to get the most out of them.    </li>
            <li>I bought my husband this shaver after seeing how much time and money he was spending on the Mach 3 blades.</li>
            <li>just turn it on the fast mode and hold it under running water.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not as close a shave as my father&#x27;s straight razor, but then again I would sever my jugular if I used a straight razor.  </li>
            <li>I tried a rotary and it didnt work very well</li>
            <li>I use it with shaving cream, and now I can shave my whole face.</li>
            <li>Braun&#x27;s foil is straight, with a flexible head.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic&#x27;s head is also flexible, but has a convex foil, which makes shaving under the neck much easier.  </li>
            <li>For the price you pay for those I would have expected more.</li>
            <li>Some customers complain of the cleaning unit being very load.  </li>
            <li>and it all works very well.</li>
            <li>It shaves close and fast, with no irritation....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now had this for almost a month and it works really well and gets almost as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li>I am on my third 8109 shaver and they all shave me close and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect such an advanced device with a built-in electric dryer etc.</li>
            <li>This product truly did change my whole perspective.    </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve shaved with a rotary your whole life, you will not believe the difference in performance this foil razor gives.  </li>
            <li>Charges fast.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll really like the cleaning system.  </li>
            <li>THANKS AGAIN</li>
            <li>I really do get a shave as close as a razor</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor!</li>
            <li>I get a very close shave</li>
            <li>and my wife expresses how much she loves it every time.    </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really a fan of this shaver.</li>
            <li>Someone suggested a foil shaver and, after much hesitation, I purchased the Braun.</li>
            <li>Braun has hit the snooze button and no longer wants to get up in the morning with me.</li>
            <li>I got the whole thing with another coupon for $75.  </li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s why I like it so much.  </li>
            <li>I got the whole thing with another coupon for $75.  </li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s why I like it so much.  </li>
            <li>The wet shave option on the Panasonic is better than my blade.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think that it would be any more liable to wake someone up in an adjacent room.    </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say this is a miracle razor, because it isn&#x27;t, but it allows me to shave my face against the grain for a much closer shave than I was getting with my razor with the grain.</li>
            <li>This is what really disappoints me about this product.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for a much closer shave.</li>
            <li>Its really neat.</li>
            <li>i just can understand why a razor costs so much</li>
            <li>love that it can be used wet.</li>
            <li>(This is as close as a barber&#x27;s straight blade.)    </li>
            <li>Panasonic&#x27;s shavers convinced me that shaving with an electric could come very close to the quality of a blade.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning cycle is noisy, but it does not need to run very often, so it doesn&#x27;t bother.  </li>
            <li>I understand that electric shavers don&#x27;t get quite as close as a real razor.</li>
            <li>This 3-blade shaver gives a very close shave, with some work.</li>
            <li>As a result, closeness of the shave is better and time spent is shorter.</li>
            <li>It does have a much wider trimmer and longer battery life between charges, though.    </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worked very well.</li>
            <li>Movie advertising really does work.</li>
            <li>I still use the blade occasionally when I want a smooth shave.     </li>
            <li>Thanks a lot Norelco.</li>
            <li>Highly reccommended!</li>
            <li>Much faster and closer than the norelco(and</li>
            <li>When he used it the 1st time it didn&#x27;t shave around the adams apple very well.  </li>
            <li>The pop-up trimmer works really well too.</li>
            <li>A real gem.</li>
            <li>Very close shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Gilette Fusion man,a wet shaver who needs more lubrication than Joan Rivers on date night.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m ready.</li>
            <li>IS WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW</li>
            <li>It did my cheeks really well</li>
            <li>i dont have too much hair in my face</li>
            <li>Thanks for the Deal of the Day price.</li>
            <li>Shaves very well and leaves his skin smoooooooth.    </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Shaves as close and as fast, and cleans as efficiently.   </li>
            <li>It gives you a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>The re-charging cleaning system is a pain, not so much the cost</li>
            <li>really haven&#x27;t found any at this time.  </li>
            <li>It seems to me that I will spend just as much time cleaning the cleaning/charge station as I would just cleaning my razor by hand after each use, but I&#x27;ll give it a shot and see if I like using</li>
            <li>it also does this very neatly in the sense that I don&#x27;t have any hair to sweep up after I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave for an electric... not as close as a blade, of course, but the closest of any electric shaver I have used.</li>
            <li>Wonder how much I paid for it?</li>
            <li>and I really hope the noise is not bleeding thru.  </li>
            <li>And I also have always used a foil type shaver, currently a Remingtom Titanium and earlier a cheaper Braun, because I couldn&#x27;t use the 8865 to square off my sideburns with a nice straight line, or get a couple spots under my nose and lower lip.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t feel a difference on my neck where I did and didn&#x27;t use the razor.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know much about it since I don&#x27;t use it, it was for my husband&#x27;s Father&#x27;s Day.  </li>
            <li>Anything over $85 for a razor is too much (my opinion).</li>
            <li>This razor is light and smaller than what it appears on the pics.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t wake her up when I&#x27;m getting ready in morning.  </li>
            <li>It does not work very well in the shower.</li>
            <li>I like this shaver, it cuts close and fast.</li>
            <li>In fact I wish it didn&#x27;t glow at all, which only adds to power drain and light pollution in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>This foil razor really can claim to shave as close as a blade.</li>
            <li>It actually shaves my neck smooth</li>
            <li>and I like a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>It handled the neck better than I expected</li>
            <li>, the cheeks and side burns come out much smoother than I though an electric razor could get.  </li>
            <li>I really like the cleaning system.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real champ.</li>
            <li>He was also pleased that he didn&#x27;t get any nicks or irritation, which he expected as part of the getting-used-to-a-new-shaver experience.    </li>
            <li>This shaver works really well.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I dont really care about/use the Hydraclean system,</li>
            <li>so I got the shaver all ready for him to use</li>
            <li>It looks like I went to the ole time parlor and got a straight razor shave</li>
            <li>Perhaps it works better wet?</li>
            <li>I travel A LOT with this razor and one thing that really sticks out for me</li>
            <li>He has very sensitvie skin</li>
            <li>Very convenient to shave in shower.  </li>
            <li>Close shave, nice battery state indicator, relatively quiet, trimmer only runs when it&#x27;s in the up position</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Braun electric shavers religiously for the last 20+ years once I determined that they were far superior to the competitors at that time -- Norelco and Remington.  </li>
            <li>I have owned several electric shavers over the years, but so far this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still loving it and using it everyday.</li>
            <li>I can go two days after shaving with a blade with only the mustache / goatee area looking kind of scraggly on the second day.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic discussion: Panasonic had developed an outstanding shaver line some ten years ago.</li>
            <li>All in all on the clean/charge station, I honestly think its a waste of a plug and money on cartridges.</li>
            <li>You get a much better shave with this shaver and so far no defects after several months use.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic parallel blades just did not cut many hairs on each pass, requiring a far longer shave.  </li>
            <li>I have always had extremely sensitive skin and was only able to tolerate shaving with a razor once a week.  </li>
            <li>It works well in the most sensitive areas, such as bikini lines, underarms etc.  </li>
            <li>shaves later - first dry, then with a little shaving gel, I am very happy with this shaver.</li>
            <li>I bought this razor based mainly on the positive reviews I read here.  </li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s mostly a gimmick to get you to continuously buy the associated replacement parts, and in any case I was able to clean my last razor simply by using the little brush that came with it.</li>
            <li>The idea of a wet dry electric shaver appealed to me and the reviews of the Panasonic were on balance pretty good</li>
            <li>&quot; So far that&#x27;s held true and it has given him a better shave then his Braun electric foil razor he previously used.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyone that isn&#x27;t happy with this razor either isn&#x27;t using it right, has a defective unit, or holds unrealistic expectations.</li>
            <li>Did a great job on the neck as well although the hair was not too long to begin with as I had shaved the previous day.  </li>
            <li>its pretty quick once the hair is short.</li>
            <li>The sound is pretty average for eletric razors...not too loud, not too quiet...pretty decent sound.</li>
            <li>If you are like me, and are &#x27;ok&#x27; with the cheaper models offered at the local box stores, I highly suggest putting a few more dollars into this razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a very quick shaver doesn&#x27;t take long at all to shave.</li>
            <li>Well I have to say, much to my surprise that this Panasonic electric razor shaves my face about 99% as close as the Fusion razor and that is impressive to me since I don&#x27;t have to keep buying those expensive Fushion blades!  </li>
            <li>was using an older model Panasonic ES8066 that is still working, but I wanted an update and took all the time needed to make a decision that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;A concern that I did have with these shavers was the large looking docking/cleaning stations.  </li>
            <li>Where it cut, it cut closer then the rotary but left huge gaps, particularly on the neck</li>
            <li>Even if I don&#x27;t shave for a few days, it takes off everything clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Give it a try as it sure beats using a styptic pencil or that old stand by toilet paper.  </li>
            <li>My razor was always clean and ready to use the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My razor was always clean and ready to use the next morning.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cinch to clean, and since I don&#x27;t travel much, working only uncorded does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li>Maybe the three floating heads of other brands may be better at covering all the spots.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands (typically more bulking than the Panasonic), but the size, feel and cut of this shaver</li>
            <li>the battery inside wore out before the replacement blades did (I go through a normal razor in a week!)</li>
            <li>The hot, wet blades melt the gel on your skin and help you to get a really close and comfortable shave.    </li>
            <li>I am not an engineer, but I suspect the Panasonic has a greater need for lubrication than most other foil razors due to its faster speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shaver itself is probably a bit better than any other I&#x27;ve tried (Norelco, Braun, Grundig).  </li>
            <li>but when it came in I was too excited and had to have him open it!</li>
            <li>The Norelco may or may not have done a better job on my neck due to the rotary heads</li>
            <li>There are better models out there, just do your due diligence.  </li>
            <li>I continued to read reviews, mostly on Amazon, but also other places</li>
            <li>I purchased this Panasonic razor after reading the reviews thoroughly for the Panasonic and most other razors offered by Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I still get a much better shave than with any other electric razor even if I&#x27;m in a hurry.  </li>
            <li>This Panasonic from day one worked better than my other brand ever did.  </li>
            <li>Another downside I found was that contrary to most other men reviewing here on Amazon, the electric shaver took LONGER for me to shave.  </li>
            <li>I have used it shaving dry and wet and had good results both ways but the wet yields the closest shave which I tend to use the most.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought the cleaning system was a little over the top, as rinsing and tapping usually work just as well to clean out a razor, but I have to admit that the HydraClean system is really cool and seems to improve the blade life!</li>
            <li>Although the old one was getting weaker for several reasons, I was pleasantly surprised at how easily and quickly the new one went over my face.  </li>
            <li>Then I recieved this bad boy as a Father&#x27;s day gift and now after a couple of months usage I have to say I&#x27;m pretty impressed</li>
            <li>Out of habit I still manually clean this razor every day, and so have only used the HydraClean system once.</li>
            <li>I let it clean the shaver every third day.</li>
            <li>Have not yet tried the deep clean in the cleaner yet.  </li>
            <li>I literally have to go over my face in all directions multiple times to get a clean shave</li>
            <li>Also, my cleaning unit will only clean if I unplug it and plug it in again.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning system works very well; only caveat there is that the full cycle takes about two hours to run.  </li>
            <li>Also, reviews stated that the shave is such a close clean shave that you need one pass...</li>
            <li>Actully mostly just trimming around a full beard because shaving with a blade every day is painfull, at least for me.</li>
            <li>Now my goatee has alot of gray in it and it really makes me look older than I&#x27;d like to.</li>
            <li>I eventually had to pull my regular andis shaver and clean the areas that the Vortex couldn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and the product looks decent.</li>
            <li>I expect that the auto clean feature will be equally effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only nit is that the foil pops out of the top too easily, this happened a few times before I caught on what I was pushing (those 2 balck tabs).  </li>
            <li>It has different modes so that I can set it to charge and clean or just charge.  </li>
            <li>In the past I&#x27;ve used Braun and Remington electric razors (cheap ones in the $25-$35 range) but have mainly used blades, in recent years the rather effective Mach3.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned to use it effectively, though, so it is only a minor inconvenience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It takes a little longer than the traditional route, but it&#x27;s quite nice to be able to shave and watch TV at the same time.</li>
            <li>Either way, it will be nice to be able to thoroughly clean it and not have to rely on the dumb little brushes.    </li>
            <li>I dare you to compare the 2 razors back to back and honestly say the Braun is worth double the price.</li>
            <li>He really loves it and comes with high recommendations.</li>
            <li>This is not due to the craftsmanship of the shaver; it is due to my own clumsiness.  </li>
            <li>I figured the money would be better spent buying a new razor.  </li>
            <li>I am used to Gillette Mach3 for last 5 years or so and wanted to try something new that is maintainence free.</li>
            <li>Even though the new Brauns cost $100 more than the Panasonics, their motors are still slower, and you still can&#x27;t shave with &#x27;em wet.</li>
            <li>I am very please with this product, after purchasing so many women&#x27;s electric wet dry razors, and have them \\&quot;crap\\&quot; out after a few months, it is exciting to use something with this many nice features to keep the blades lubricated and sharp.  </li>
            <li>Amazon was having a special deal, so the product with the charger/cleaning system was only around $80.</li>
            <li>To my surprise this razor is still rated really high and doesn&#x27;t seem like their are to many other razors that compare.    </li>
            <li>it gives a nice close shave with very little skin irritation.</li>
            <li>I swear, this unbeatable combination (i.e., shower steam, Panasonic wet/dry shaver and Gilette Series foam) shaves me closer than even the best blades that Gilette offers (at present, the Gilette Fusion) with far less irritation and with no annoying little cuts in conspicuous locations around my face and/or neck.    </li>
            <li>and I get a comfortable, quick and dead close shave (</li>
            <li>The dry shave option is nice later in the day as well if he has something to do in the evening</li>
            <li>Either wet or dry, this shaver didn&#x27;t do a good job for me.  </li>
            <li>Its dry wet option is good as well.  </li>
            <li>wise I&#x27;d give it a solid four and a half stars.    </li>
            <li>I have only tried to dry shave and was thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>Gives a better shave with far less irritation  Rotary shaver had difficulty with certain spots (jawline, above adams apple) that this one gets just fine  </li>
            <li>He can use it wet or dry which was a great option before he left the hospital and in his first days home recovering.</li>
            <li>well and easy to Maintenance also price is not high.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge for a long time, cuts close and smooth, and never irritates my skin.  </li>
            <li>, even back when I used a Norelco it was a cool skin model</li>
            <li>but this guy almost always gets everything - and if it doesn&#x27;t, the handy trimmer can usually get the tricky spots.  </li>
            <li>I have run the full clean+dry+charge cycle only 3-4 times (once a month) since i got the shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far this has worked pretty well but not as well as a razor.  </li>
            <li>First there is no skin adjustment period as with old electric razors.  </li>
            <li>my opinion)&lt;br /&gt;the razor is pretty loud</li>
            <li>then that I do love this razor for being my first electric razor, I hope this last me a long time.</li>
            <li>If you run out of charge, 10 minutes in the charger will do enough to give a full shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving with this for about a month now and while I won&#x27;t go so far as to say that this product has changed my life, it is exactly what I was looking for-</li>
            <li>Panasonic, hire some good American English technical writers.</li>
            <li>have let my beard grow for most of the last 20 years and only shaved when I absolutely couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore...</li>
            <li>My next venture was with the Philips Norelco Advantage and then the updated Cool Skin.  </li>
            <li>I orginally bought this razor for my son, who has a thick beard, and he has been very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I, like many others here, have used all major brands, but Panasonic has set a new standard....</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s great razor and being $75 to $80 less than the new Brau that replaced my 15-year old one.</li>
            <li>It seems to take a long time and is very noisy as it goes through its cycles, but i don&#x27;t clean it all the time and just wait until everyone is up or out of the house when I do use that mode.  </li>
            <li>Last one is 8 years old and still works fine.</li>
            <li>After a normal run through, I&#x27;d have to go back 3 or 4 times all at differing angles to clean up the neck hair--and even then it doesn&#x27;t catch them all.  </li>
            <li>I have owned about half a dozen electric razors over the past 25 years and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Shaves as close as my old Brau razor; however, the foil gets a little warm against my face.</li>
            <li>Even on the cheeks, after a good shave, I&#x27;d see little hairs poking out that I&#x27;d have to go back to.  </li>
            <li>I was LUCKY to get it on super duper mark down</li>
            <li>During the first few weeks, it left several marks on my skin that I wasn&#x27;t happy about.</li>
            <li>Other brands like Braun use a liquid detergent pack, which is easy to spill, and takes up WAY to much room in a closet or drawer.</li>
            <li>The reviews were positive, it scored slightly higher than the one being advertised, it was said to handle the neck very well, that it was quiet, held a charge, plus it also had the self cleaning device, if one wanted to use it.  </li>
            <li>I have to make a few extra passes at the neck area - but other than that - excellent performance on rest of face.</li>
            <li>recommend this shaving system to anyone who wants to try a new electric razor.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this shaving system to anyone who wants to try a new electric razor.  </li>
            <li>I just decided to get the whole new razor as it was ~2X</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t make much sense to keep buying parts for that one compared to a new one, so I upgraded to the ES8109 and will craigslist the ES8162 (hopefully).      </li>
            <li>Since I am not planning to use it (cleaning by hand may be less fun for some people, but it seems to be more effective and it definitely costs less effort, time, and energy), I could probably have saved a considerable amount of money by selecting one of the Pansonic shavers that come without the cleaning device.</li>
            <li>I have always enjoyed Panasonic products and noticed this razor at half the asking price of the Braun.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic does a better job in less time.  </li>
            <li>The power button certainly is in an odd place where I suspect most men put their thumb when shaving</li>
            <li>What amazes me is the battery, which is much better than my previous model of Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic E8109s costs twice as much as my older shavers, but you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li>I had been leery of buying an electric razor for several years, after using Brauns for many years, then switching back to a blade because no electric razor shaves as close as a blade...    </li>
            <li>I use it mainly with shaving cream</li>
            <li>In this day and age when most products are mediocre performers, and  only last for a year at most this Panasonic has performed outstandingly since I have owned it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different shavers, and this is the only one I can recommend.</li>
            <li>My above review was somewhat a rant, but I still feel it adequately reflects my feelings for this razor.</li>
            <li>In order for this to do half-way decent</li>
            <li>After a while, when I noticed people started assuming I was about ten years older than I actually am, I decided I better start shaving again.  </li>
            <li>It takes a lot longer to shave compared to my older phillips shaver with 3 circular heads.</li>
            <li>was to get a decent shave.</li>
            <li>It looked to be the only well rated one around $100 which was probably because its not Panasonic&#x27;s most recent model.    </li>
            <li>I bought this product based on my experience with older Panasonic models.  </li>
            <li>and still this thing misses a decent amount of hair.  </li>
            <li>It was a gift as I gave up on getting a decent shave with a electric razor years ago.  </li>
            <li>&quot;  does a decent job on the face, routinely misses neck hairs, leaves stray hairs on the neck.  </li>
            <li>I tried a shaving oil for the last three days, American Crew, and it is even better than shaving gel.</li>
            <li>They are affordable and work better then the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>The main thing about it is that it does not tug and scrape on my face</li>
            <li>I had an older Panasonic shaver that I got about 6 years ago that I decided to replace with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>I HAD A OLDER MODEL OF THE VORTEX AND JUST THOUGHT I WOULD SEE WHAT</li>
            <li>Have been using it for six months now and have no serious complaints.    </li>
            <li>Works exceptionally well to shave the head - wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>I have not burned my neck since I began using it, and it stays much cleaner than my old razor, thanks to the HydraClean System and even the ease of cleaning with running under a faucet.</li>
            <li>I am sure it will out last my LAST Brauns 90 day life span.</li>
            <li>Ok, this is only my second electric razor.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect these types of electronics to last forever, but I do expect them to last more than 13 months.  </li>
            <li>Has to go over same spot many times to only get 3/4.</li>
            <li>I miss the charging stand that came with my older Panasonic shaver.  </li>
            <li>With the Panasonic I found that you can go over the same spot 2-3 times and from different directions to make sure you don&#x27;t miss anything.  </li>
            <li>and I would blow through razors like they where going out of style so mainly I just used a beard trimmer to keep it stubbly/short and said to hell with razors</li>
            <li>With this razor I mainly use it</li>
            <li>by the end of the week my face hurts and this is the main reason I did not shave on my time off.  </li>
            <li>The razor is quieter than the older linear models, which will be a   relief to some.    </li>
            <li>It gives you a close and quick shave if you lack time in the morning to do a proper shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The very first shave was done completely dry and did better than I expected.</li>
            <li>It seems like no matter what I do, whether it&#x27;s using special shaving cream, hot wash cloths on my face, the finest disposable razors, etc, that I get nicks, ingrown hairs, and general irritation if I use a regular disposable razor.  </li>
            <li>On the positive side, you can connect the charging cord directly to the shaver, bypassing the cleaning</li>
            <li>Very smooth and very minimal skin irritation,that&#x27;s saying a lot since I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although this product is touted as suitable for wet use, I found that the shave quality suffers greatly unless you rinse off the shaver and your face every couple</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, and this is definitely my favorite attribute; with the method above there&#x27;s so little irritation (only on the outskirts underneath my chin)</li>
            <li>It did a little better job around the neck area but after every shave my neck would be red and severely sensitive with some light hair still there.</li>
            <li>Good luck to the thick bearded!</li>
            <li>I bought a high end Remington to leave at the gym</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>So, I would highly recommend this shaver.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this razor</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li>Travel charger cord makes it possible to take it with you even for longer trips but generally one full charge is good at least 10 shaves.  </li>
            <li>The high speed shaving is the difference.</li>
            <li>I will highly recommend the clients to get this model.</li>
            <li>Give it about a week so that your skin gets used to the high power blades before you comment on the quality of the shave.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anybody.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this shaver.</li>

            <li>I generally try to alternate every other day with razor/electric shaves; however, when I&#x27;m traveling and use this more often, I get a significant amount of ingrown hairs/pimple looking bumps.</li>

            <li>And this wasn&#x27;t just for the Panasonic foil I bought, which was the ES8109S, but all of the Panasonics were getting consistently high reviews.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li>Unlike some reviewers, I am not bothered by the hum or high pitched noise it makes.</li>

            <li>I would highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a proven, reliable, charger.</li>
            <li>This product has high RPM</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone that swears by electrics, as it is smooth, comfortable, can work wet or dry, and leaves you with the smoothest shave you can have from an electric.</li>
            <li>The clean shaver icon takes to long to come on</li>
            <li>I was sad to see my older razer go since it had the great induction charging that was the halmark of older Panasonic razors.  </li>
            <li>I also have noticed that I can shave my face more frequently as well, every other day bringing it to 3 times a week instead of the 2 before hand.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s only one significant drawback, it&#x27;s LOUD.  </li>
            <li>the setup is good as far as being useable wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>My beard doesn&#x27;t grow fast, and it&#x27;s not very thick</li>
            <li>I really love this little beauty.</li>
            <li>Hesitantly i decided to try this Panasonic shaver after reading the reviews here - WOW !!  </li>
            <li>I was a little reluctant making the change to a foil, and I&#x27;m glad I switched.</li>
            <li>I have found that squirting a little hand soap on top of the blades and running the razor about 20 seconds every now and</li>
            <li>A little better then</li>
            <li>Then I only use the complete clean cycle once a week or so which should extend the life of the cleaner cartridges.</li>
            <li>(    The trimmer and self-cleaning features are good but main functionality is broken, so doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li>I was excited as a kid on christmas when this thing got to my house, and made the mistake of attempting to shave with it dry, since I didn&#x27;t have time for a shower.  </li>
            <li>I can easily shave with this, put on my uniform and go in for a shift; something I would have never considered with other electrics.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too many nitpickers around here complaining about stuff that doesn&#x27;t matter.t live in cities near other people and stuff</li>
            <li>At times i find my self really impressed on how close of a shave I get from this bad boy.</li>
            <li>I have found both to be much quieter than my old braun.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy using this electric shaver wet (i.e., with shaving gel).</li>
            <li>I use my shaver dry and it is perfectly clean.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;service\\&quot; department requires that you send in the whole system for a remedy, and hangs up on you when you question the wisdom of that course of action.  </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t really see a clear winner.</li>
            <li>The vortex cleaner is sweet,you can charge and dry this baby when you&#x27;re done and clean it every week or two.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot of foam or cream, just a light wet coat to give your face</li>
            <li>This one works very well and shaves me as close if not closer than my old rotary shaver.  </li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t write reviews, but I tend to benefit from them and this gadget blew me away.</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical at first because of all of the good reviews that it had.  </li>
            <li>but you know, normally.)</li>
            <li>Not a complaint but just a word of caution.  </li>
            <li>I still use lather/foam to shave with this shaver and the shave is so close that the 5 O clock shadow always shows up late :) by as much as a whole day !</li>
            <li>Although admittedly it gets a closer cut, I don&#x27;t see it being worth the extra 25 minutes it takes to shave.</li>
            <li>I will be looking for their newer and better products in the coming few days to replace this workhorse.</li>
            <li>No irritation or razor burn or nicks ( normally caused by Gillette Mach3)</li>
            <li>I will try it for a few more days and then will decide whether its a keeper.   </li>
            <li>The Panasonic trimmers are so narrow, on all of these models, that you will not be able to trim sideburns with one attempt.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, many hundreds of dollars later, I decided to try one of the Panasonic linear wet/dry shavers I had seen advertised for so long.</li>
            <li>Well worth the extra couple of bucks.  </li>
            <li>So this was well worth the money though if I could go back I would save some money and just buy the shaver by itself.</li>
            <li>because it&#x27;s pretty much the only place I could find it and</li>
            <li>PS: For the last few years I have been buying panasonic products and have been very very pleased.</li>
            <li>I had to shave several times a day - and it just wasn&#x27;t worth</li>
            <li>I mentioned this thing can get as close as a normal razor does.  </li>
            <li>It works great and is a little bit quieter than the previous model.  </li>
            <li>I was concerned about cleaning frequency but the once every few weeks when the battery gets run down seems to work just great for me.</li>
            <li>I have a very tough, fast-growing (and increasingly grey) beard and this shaver does an excellent job.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic shaver is great, used wet or dry, and the battery lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li>The combination of the swivel head that contours over your face with the high RPMs of the blade that capture even the toughest hairs make for an extremely close, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>Most times i just rinse the blades under the tap and leave the head open to dry.</li>
            <li>; Its powerful, very close shave even on dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is about half as loud and the HydraClean system has more pluses to it than the Braun&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>The 8103 is the same razor without the fancy charging and cleaning system and frankly if I was reading this and couldn&#x27;t afford this one and needed/wanted it RIGHT</li>
            <li>Very shiek and nice but sucks biggest waist of my money!</li>
            <li>The result is a perfectly clean shaver; and I mean just-out-of-the-box clean.  </li>
            <li>I have tried it in the shower with and without shaving cream, and my face looks fine til I get out of the shower and notice several missed hairs, especially on my neck.</li>
            <li>It shave very clean but does have trouble getting the area below his nose.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it exclusively for several months and despite my best efforts it still gives a pretty bad shave.</li>
            <li>The only benefit to that is that it doesn&#x27;t take as long per shave if you use it more frequently.</li>
            <li>So as to not be long winded, the moral of the story is: Close, comfortable, convenient shave at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic has options for a few different modes, but I&#x27;m not sure which is the best method yet.</li>
            <li>Used to take 15-20 minutes to shave with the Braun and now it takes a little over 10 minutes for the same kind of shave.  </li>
            <li>As far as performance goes, it is just as good as the blade I was using for the past several years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve shaved with the new ES8109S shaver for a few days now, and my first impression after the very first shave was that I got a very close shave (consistent with the performance of my prior Panasonics) and, try to understand this</li>
            <li>am \\&quot; scared \\&quot; away from new things</li>
            <li>and I needed a new shaver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this new shaver for a week, and I&#x27;ve used it three times.  </li>
            <li>and I decided to buy a new model.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like brand new</li>
            <li>I decided to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>I researched new razors and saw a lot of favorable comments connected to the Panasonic Vortex, so I decided to try it.    </li>
            <li>There is no way to replace the batteries so you just have to throw the shaver away and get a new one.</li>
            <li>I decided to try using Edge shave gel with my new razor.</li>
            <li>In fact I look forward to using my new Panasonic every morning.</li>
            <li>When I used the honey&#x27;s new razor I had NO razor burn, NO pulling,</li>
            <li>Had I known the differences were so slim, I would have gone ahead and bought new blades and screen for my 8103.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mind the Norelcos, but was at the point of needing new blades.  </li>
            <li>Given the cost of the new blades</li>
            <li>I decided to try something new and bought this razer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once you feel the razor tugging, it&#x27;s time for a new blade.  </li>
            <li>I tried it for 30 days (as you&#x27;re supposed to do with any new shaving treatment before judging) and it never got better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>where I live the cost of water would make that a luxury I don&#x27;t chose to afford so haven&#x27;t tried that.    </li>
            <li>- The cleaner unit requires $10-13 &#x27;recharge&#x27; units every three months or so, which are basically new soap cartridges.  </li>
            <li>Even a new blade doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>The instructions say to give it 30 days as your face adjusts to the new shaving technique.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves his new shaver.  </li>
            <li>Still runs but needs a new set of blades.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t had to buy a new cartridge.    </li>
            <li>Where do you live, in an isolation chamber?  </li>
            <li>I started my search for a new shaver and came across this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Since the Braun needed a new screen and blades</li>
            <li>I have had it for a couple of years and still performs like new.</li>
            <li>I just replaced foils and blades, its like new again.</li>
            <li>but it went downhill from there and didn&#x27;t improve with new cutter and screen.</li>
            <li>I have a set nearly new cutters and foil and two spare cleaning cartridges and no shaver.  </li>
            <li>In the instructions it says \\&quot;Give your beard 30 days to adjust to the new razor and it will grow out softer and easier to shave.\\</li>
            <li>they sent me a new Panasonic ES-LA-93 three head shaver.  </li>
            <li>the price of a new head.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li>My husband loves his new Panasonic ES8109S.  </li>
            <li>I live in a condo with my bathroom wall facing another unit</li>
            <li>Compared to a brand new, out of the box blade, the blade will shave closer.  </li>
            <li>These new blades are *</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this shaver to anyone in the market for a new one.</li>
            <li>Heck, maybe it&#x27;s the new curved blade and foil assembly that reduces irritation or something.</li>
            <li>it works like new.  </li>
            <li>Time to teach an old dog new tricks!</li>
            <li>: After 3 months of daily use, i feel that i dont get a shave as smooth as i initially got when the blades on this were new</li>
            <li>I only used it for a few weeks, I liked the Braun as well as the Panasonic when it was new</li>
            <li>The wet dry option makes it even better, and I seem to get a closer (straight razor close) shave using it in the shower with a shaving gel.</li>
            <li>Also the side-burn push acctuator is less than easy to put-in-play.</li>
            <li>It shaves way closer than the Remington and more comfortably (and less messily) than my Mach 3.  </li>
            <li>It shaves very close and it is not as loud as my old one.  </li>
            <li>It looks like shaving with a Norelco again is not in my future as it never cut as good as this Panosonic does either wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>However, it is only comfortable because it doesn&#x27;t actually shave.</li>
            <li>My roomate was so kind to let me use his Panasonic because the Mach 3 would have caused some serious damage.  </li>
            <li>If you are like me and not too sure about it cutting as close as a razor,well let me fill ya in, i was using a Gillette Fusion Razor,and this thing cuts better</li>
            <li>The facial shave seems to be quite good either on wet or dry shave</li>
            <li>It simply does not shave close enough to make my neck feel smooth like a blade.  </li>
            <li>The first thing you will notice is the weight and the comfortable handle (I have small hands).  </li>
            <li>additional features are water based cleaning base (cheaper refills), super accurate sideburn trimmer, and nice display.  </li>
            <li>It has worked decent for me so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be adding more after a wet shave and a longer period of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s more quiet than I expected.  </li>
            <li>He gets a clean shave in less time than the straight edge.</li>
            <li>it charges fast and cleans easily, and i really like the drying mechanism (though it is a bit noisy and slow).  </li>
            <li>There really did not appear to be a major difference between the rotary and foil products.</li>
            <li>My face is very sensitive and this one never irritates it.</li>
            <li>Very gentle and quiet.  </li>
            <li>I bought this item for my husband who has very sensitive skin and boy</li>
            <li>My husband has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive, but this razor does not irritate the skin at all.  </li>
            <li>Both the cleaning cycle and the shaver itself are VERY loud.</li>
            <li>In summary, I highly recommend the Panasonic ES8109S shaver to persons like me with sensitive skin that is prone to irritation</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive neck</li>
            <li>His old electric left his face feeling whiskery even right after he shaved.</li>
            <li>just right with out slipping and taking to much</li>
            <li>The cleaning system also works fine and there are no major technical downfalls.&lt;br</li>
            <li>if it was a little quieter and didn&#x27;t need so many passes over the same problem areas I would give it 5 stars because it really does shave close.</li>
            <li>This is a great shaver because you can use it both wet or dry and shaves extremely close</li>
            <li>Initially, I bought this (1) due to my previous experience with a Panasonic shaver; and (2) the great price on Amazon.     </li>
            <li>I will most likely go back to dry shaving very soon.  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>And, best of all, no concern about cutting my neck!</li>
            <li>The first one was the ES8103 (same model as this</li>
            <li>For most of my shaving life I have used blades but have have also used a couple of Norelco electric shavers in the past.  </li>
            <li>When this one was the same as the first I started looking and found the Panosonic wet/dry.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>This was my first shaver, I got it after extensive research on which shavers to get.    </li>
            <li>More often than not the others that I&#x27;ve tried in the past would leave me with ingrown hairs and razor bumps.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it shaves as close   as a regular razor, but it shaves pretty damn close -- if you&#x27;re in a hurry, you can take the thing with you and shave in the  car.      </li>
            <li>/&gt;Writing back after over a year of using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Still holding up pretty well.</li>
            <li>The Braun ones have it it all in one which causes larger packaging and higher cost in the end.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m willing to give that up for a razor and cleaner that actually works.</li>
            <li>I even developed dermatitis from time to time!</li>
            <li>If you get 3yrs out of it its worth it in the long run plus it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin at all.  </li>
            <li>I did not seea big improvement from the first day to</li>
            <li>Actually bought this one as a gift for my son, but I have one exactly like it.  </li>
            <li>My first was a Braun Syncro 7526 (with a cleaning stand), which I bought back in January of 2001.  </li>
            <li>Wow!-</li>
            <li>I have owned my first and last Panasonic shaver.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning station is pretty quite; however, do not start the cleaning cycle and leave the room while your wife is sleeping in the next room.  </li>
            <li>I bought my first Panasonic almost ten years ago.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>is no small drop in the bucket for me when it comes to this stuff.    </li>
            <li>It is my second electric razor, first being a Braun that lasted me 7 years.  </li>
            <li>Initially I was planning on getting another higher priced Braun, but was pulled to the Panasonic by a couple of points.  </li>
            <li>I read somewhere that blade shaving looks closer at first because it causes the skin to swell, but that wears off after a short period of time.  </li>
            <li>It feels better than the Panasonic I used for the past four years.</li>
            <li>Loud!  </li>
            <li>Loud!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this Panasonic electric shaver with nano blade technology (ES8228 or ES8109S) for the past 2 months and love it.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I shave with an eletric razor that I feel it can get as close as a traditional razor.  </li>
            <li>I just shaved with a blade for the first time in a year and was amazed at how short it took me.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I am not giving it a 5 star rating is because they always make a couple of small changes that keep the replacement blades and hydra clean system from one model from fitting the next model....</li>
            <li>I use it every morning and only clean &amp; charge it when the battery gets low.  </li>
            <li>This unit has exceptional quality and the charging/cleaning base outstanding.  </li>
            <li>My reasons for doing so were just about the reasons of everyone who prefers razors: My beard grows thick and quick, and within a week I&#x27;ve usually got a good \\&quot;crumb catcher\\&quot; going.</li>
            <li>But compared to a blade that is a couple of days old, this is at least equal, and compared to a four day old blade, the Panasonic is superior.  </li>
            <li>the clean cycle simply doesn&#x27;t do a very good job and the controls for selecting what you want the base to do</li>
            <li>so I cannot comment about how loud it is or how big it is, although it was bigger then i originally.  </li>
            <li>From the other popular brands and more expensive price tags, this shaver is an under rated sleeper.     </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m going to buy a new foil for my 7 year old braun and just start using that again.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been bothering me since Christmas for a new shaver, so I let him get an early start for Father&#x27;s day.</li>
            <li>My old ES8067 still shaves closer than this new \\&quot;NANO Technology\\&quot;- a misnomer (marketing gimmick).</li>
            <li>I replaced an old panasonic with this new one.</li>
            <li>I go by the sound of the head to judge how long or short the whiskers are.</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t use  the autoclean function very often(too long and noisy).  </li>
            <li>My 3+ year old Braun 7526 Syncro with Clean and Charge finally had enough.</li>
            <li>With this model, I simply have to very lightly run it back and forth along the grain (as per the instructions) and it is able to cut down my beard millimeter by millimeter, much less hassle than using a razor.    </li>
            <li>Provides a close shave, trimmer works fine, battery requires little charging.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable in my hand and much like shaving with a big bladed conventional razor.    </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I have yet to find a Target, Wal-Mart or similar discount store that stocks replacement foils and blades or cleaning solution for the HydraClean system, but that is no major problem since these items are readily available at good prices via Amazon.    </li>
            <li>until there&#x27;s no more gel on your face, then give it one last good rinse before setting it in for a daily cleaning/charge.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to see so many average ratings and discovered from several written reviews that Gillette had purchased Braun.  </li>
            <li>My old and worn Panasonic Vortex shaver battery died and instead of sending it to California to be fixed, I decided to get a new one.  </li>
            <li>This commercial claims that it really gets the neck very well and the new design allows for an overall new electric razor experience.    </li>
            <li>Panasonic exceed my expectations, and glad I chose one with wet and dry capabilities.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried electric shavers that were half this price, and I&#x27;ve tried electric shavers that were more than double this price.  </li>
            <li>I have always used a dry shave, and the Panasonic gave me a smooth shave in the same amount of time.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK as a dry razor but one would think that using it wet would give a close shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The plastic casing on this model is thinner than previous models which will most likely equate to easier</li>
            <li>He has tried it both wet and dry and, either way, was quite pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is still a perfectly adequate razor and I will be using it for the next fifteen years in all likelihood.</li>
            <li>He actually admits that there has been tremendous progress in electric shavers in the last 20 years!</li>
            <li>It performed well, but the replacement blades started to go down in quality significantly.</li>
            <li>, i live the different settings on the charger, if i want to charge, clean, or dry.  </li>
            <li>but it lasts a long time and works better than any other pre electric shave lotion I&#x27;ve tried.    </li>
            <li>but I have tried a golf club grip a few times which worked fine but will take some getting used to.    </li>
            <li>Also, I like the large digital display of the power level ...</li>
            <li>So, I researched the razor described above, from the commercial, and while its overall rating was quite good, the negatives were real and very concise, especially about its lack of quality in the neck area, the very thing it was selling so hard.    </li>
            <li>Of course it&#x27;s not completely gone, but after a few weeks of use, this razor is performing better than my standard disposable razors: I&#x27;m able to shave 5-days/week with minimal irritation!    </li>
            <li>This razor does the best job with those weird little hairs on my neck and has yet to give me an ingrown</li>
            <li>As for noise, cheap feel, and so on I agree with other negative reviews, but honestly I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it were twice as loud and felt like a toy, so long as it could shave my face.  </li>
            <li>I prefered a dry shave, as I didn&#x27;t think it would stay very clean if it were getting wet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a few years since I last tried an electric (rotary) shaver but the new foils like this really have come a long way in a few years and give an amazing, quick shave.  </li>
            <li>When I need it later it is dry and clean, even on the inside.</li>
            <li>this shaver is a clear \\&quot;Buy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I was put on antibiotics to clear up this infection.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it was an improvement over the old shaver, in spite of the old one having a 5 year old foil/cutter assembly.  </li>
            <li>I can read it clearly without my glasses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Panasonic is a clear winner here as well.  </li>
            <li>The instructions made it clear that it might take 30 days for your beard to get used to it, so don&#x27;t give up.  </li>
            <li>Im a daily shaver, and this thing saved me so much time every morning.</li>
            <li>old and have shaved with a blade ever since I began to shave.</li>
            <li>You may have sensitive skin or may not take well to an electric, but that&#x27;s not the razor&#x27;s fault.  </li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s a bit loud if you have it near your bed</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the closeness of this razor.</li>
            <li>It smells like old school aftershave and supposedly stands your whiskers up for the shave.</li>
            <li>Ultimately, I bought this razor to save money on fusion blades, which are costing me a reasonable chunk of cash.  </li>
            <li>I have to go over my face a few times but it gives a close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t find it loud, as one reviewer mentioned.  </li>
            <li>The pop up trimmer makes this razor a complete grooming tool.  </li>
            <li>Item is completely as described.</li>
            <li>The skin feels soft after a shave.</li>
            <li>but my old Braun out performs the Panasonic in this arena as well.  </li>
            <li>a 2-year warranty, March 2013 isn&#x27;t too far off.</li>
            <li>I will use Dermologica Professional Shave</li>
            <li>I was very upset to finally use it and to realize that it isn&#x27;t doing anything.</li>
            <li>I knew it could never get near the closeness of a blade, but I had hopes it would get the job done.</li>
            <li>No noticeable reduction in performance or ability to hold charge and it has been used nearly every day for 2 years.     </li>
            <li>It is quiet, fast and gives you a close shave.</li>
            <li>Throughout my adult life I have alternated between electric and bladed razors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent the last two months trying what I could, replenishing cartridges, using it daily, changing the water more often.......</li>
            <li>I have a beard like wire and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have gotten the &#x27;bumps&#x27; from Norelco style razors.</li>
            <li>Whole system is simple to use including changing out cleaning</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons - Cleaning system and shaver are a bit loud.  </li>
            <li>so I gave it to him early.  </li>
            <li>My skin is extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li>He says it gives him a close shave, and does not have any problems with it giving him sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>As far as how well itworks.  </li>
            <li>It seems to do the job; however does not seem to shave as close as my old electric (cheaper Remington) shaver.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the closet electric shave I have found so far.</li>
            <li>by far.</li>
            <li>old father.</li>
            <li>I have only had it for a week or so at the time of writing this review and it works really, really well.  </li>
            <li>The shave actually is close, the operation is smooth, and it is quiet enough that you can hear it cut the hairs!</li>
            <li>Takes 4-5 times for a complete shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m done with panasonic shaver, back to the blades, much quicker.</li>
            <li>which it also holds a charge very well; for several days, maybe even a week.</li>
            <li>It is very well built it will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li>my old 20.00 electric shaver i had to have a cord connected to the power company just to use it.    </li>
            <li>The shave I get really is as close as my regular razor.  </li>
            <li>No complaints so far.</li>
            <li>and it is ready to go when I need my next shave.  </li>
            <li>I use it in the shower with shave gel and get nearly as close a shave as I would with a blade with NONE of the irritation.</li>
            <li>And the skin is always sensitive.  </li>
            <li>my old electrics</li>
            <li>but it charges fast enough</li>
            <li>If it works like my Braun that has a year old blade does, then I will be unsatisfied.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Panasonic wet/dry shaving system for nearly twenty years.  </li>
            <li>I am never going back to a regular razor blade ever again, this razor left my face soo smooth, and I don&#x27;t get the razor burn from it either</li>
            <li>the cleansing system is loud too so you must remember to start it in the morning before going to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought this razor hoping for a solution to my irritable and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I replaced my old Norelco circular-blade razor with this one from Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver to replace my 10yr(+/-) old Panasonic Linear shaver.  </li>
            <li>His old shaver had run it&#x27;s course a while ago and he had gotten used to using the disposable blades.</li>
            <li>works well with his sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It shaves close, and doesn&#x27;t pinch like my old rotary shaver, and it shaves faster and closer</li>
            <li>Very please with my purchase and would definitely buy another as a replacement.     </li>
            <li>I tried to give the unit to my brother who, after testing it, thanked me for the generosity but insisted on sticking with old school razors.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic not only dries your shaver with heat, but also a fan to really air it out.  </li>
            <li>In the end, I not only saved money, but got my hands on a real gem of a shaver:  </li>
            <li>Not only do they not shave very well</li>
            <li>While this razor still works, it is loaded with mildew in the cracks and creavases which the old razor wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Went from 6 year old Braun to this and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li>My old Braun pouch will work with this razor and power supply though...</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d try an electric because recently my face has been getting very irritated and breaking out after shaving with a blade.  </li>
            <li>When the unit is charging the shaver, it is loud.</li>
            <li>wow.  </li>
            <li>HOW MUCH CHARGE IS LEFT.</li>
            <li>I love it, since I shave him at least once a week.</li>
            <li>I found that you don&#x27;t have to use the station all the time as you can plug the station&#x27;s electrical cord directly into the shaver for charging purposes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>loud-</li>
            <li>Bought this as a replacement to a four or five year old Panasonic wet-dry.  </li>
            <li>in operation it is a tad loud.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a blade since I was 18 years old.  </li>
            <li>and I would still be using it if I were not concerned about how much longer the battery would last.  </li>
            <li>one tip that will save you some money - dont use the Vortex cleaning system as frequently as the manual says.</li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver to replace my existing 6 year old Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>As far as electric razors go, this one is up there in terms of efficiency and comfort.  </li>
            <li>Loud to the point where you worry about waking people up if you use it early in the morning.</li>
            <li>This is, however, the loudest (and it is loud) of all shavers and there are no bells and whistles.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed any deterioration of the blades so far, unlike the Norelco that seemed to fade after 4-5 months</li>
            <li>i did not realize how worn out my old shaver was until i used this one.  </li>
            <li>He loves it and comments frequently about how well it works.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and had an issue of ingrown hairs, but now I get none.</li>
            <li>Drop it into the cleaner/charger and it&#x27;s ready to go the next day</li>
            <li>so it explains that I did not want to try one because of the sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>In places where it did shave, my skin felt sensitive and inflamed afterwards.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely important to allow a few weeks for your skin to adapt.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit loud</li>
            <li>old Norelco 9160XL</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get nearly as close a shave.  </li>
            <li>This will be my first impressions rather than a long term quality review.  </li>
            <li>I consider my skin to be relatively sensitive.  </li>
            <li>You can actually hear how fast the blades are moving...</li>
            <li>My stubble isnt very stubborn and that possibly helps.    </li>
            <li>and this is by far the closest, smoothest shave</li>
            <li>but so far I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>It completely died on me in February 2011.</li>
            <li>The only complaint is that my wife wants me to shave more often than once a week.[[ASIN:B000VKZMHK Panasonic ES8109S Vortex Wet/Dry Shaver with Nano Technology and HydraClean System]]</li>
            <li>Bought because my husband needed to replace the heads in his old shaver.  </li>
            <li>For the cleaning station, I dont have much to say about it yet as I have only used it about 3 times.  </li>
            <li>I could not tell how much reserve was left.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a snap to wash the heads out under the faucet and charge with the direct, plug in charger.  </li>
            <li>So far my face and neck do not hurt and no bleeding from the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is be far the loudest shaver I have used, louder then the Braun and way louder then the Norelco rotary.  </li>
            <li>I do get a few nicks from this each day, but none are enough to need to do anything to staunch the bleeding or otherwise address the issue (which is more than I can say for a 3 day old blade).  </li>
            <li>old</li>
            <li>but the 9595 needed replacing and naturally I started reading reviews of the newer Brauns.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use it and post updates but from what I have seen so far</li>
            <li>Razor is much louder than the Norelco, enough that I have to shave in the guest bathroom</li>
            <li>maybe too early to tell,</li>
            <li>Much rather use a regular razor.</li>
            <li>Also, the docking station is loud if that&#x27;s something your conscious about, I can hear it from across the house in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>I bought the Panasonic ES8109S Vortex Wet/Dry Shaver with Nano Technology and HydraClean System, at age 50 (still young in my book).  </li>
            <li>The noise from operation is fairly quiet, and very tolerable.  </li>
            <li>recommend this razor for the person who prefers a blade, but wants to try something different.  </li>
            <li>It does not drain completely.  </li>
            <li>I have used a blade razor all my adult life.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t need much water and you only replace it when you replace the cleaning catridge.  </li>
            <li>I still use my old Panasonic ES8068 from years ago.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t necessarily like keeping a beard, but I disliked shaving even more, so I just stopped.  </li>
            <li>it will definitely miss more than a few hairs.  </li>
            <li>So keep it cool and the shaver foil and blade should last a long time.  </li>
            <li>I just wanted to use it for a few more months and switch back to blades.</li>
            <li>The last 3 Panasonic shavers I have purchased each lasted at least 2 years, so I decided to purchase the 8109S with the handy shaver cleaner/charger.  </li>
            <li>Overall pleased, but a few of my observations have been:  Pros:  </li>
            <li>If you like an electric shaver, this is a good (though a bit expensive) choice.</li>
            <li>2nd Shave: WOW!!!</li>
            <li>I have had to switch back to blades many times because other electric shavers couldn&#x27;t shave close enough.</li>
            <li>I have been shaving for many years, and it has always been uncomfortable to shave more than every other day whether I used a blade or shaver.</li>
            <li>He said most shavers he has used in the past has always tugged on his hairs and this one doesn&#x27;t do that at all!</li>
            <li>It took me less than half the time, under 3 minutes, to get a shave that was far better than what the Spectra will ever be capable of, and that&#x27;s coming from a foil \\&quot;virgin\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Why take up extra counter space with something to put this in, at extra cost, when this is so simple to clean my six year old grandson could do it?</li>
            <li>Now, this doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close as he can get with a traditional sharp razor but it truly does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>The dry shave was closer than the shave with shaving cream the first couple of days, but it seems to be shaving closer as I continue using shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>Based upon other reviewers, I was expecting it to sound like a lawn mower, but it is just an occasional buzzing noise as it cleans.</li>
            <li>After not shave for a week, I shaved dry for the first use.  </li>
            <li>This shaver did well the first time I used it with just a dry face.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this system to anyone interested in a quality shave and long lasting equipment.</li>
            <li>I clean the shaver head with a little liquid soap in the palm of my hand.</li>
            <li>but I think the clean bucket of little use.</li>
            <li>Completely recommended, no down side yet 2 months out.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was broken, but when I changed the cleaning cartridge it worked fine again.</li>
            <li>it glides very smoothly but doesn&#x27;t seem to shave any closer than dry, and using it wet takes extra time fussing with lather and cleanup</li>
            <li>I got this shaver and tried it for about four weeks, wet and dry, many different configurations.  </li>
            <li>Cartridges\\&quot; every few months (assuming you clean your shaver using the HydraClean system)...lame.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is much less expensive than the top-end Braun, which I haven&#x27;t tried, but I&#x27;m glad I bought this one as I don&#x27;t see how an electric shaver could perform much better.</li>
            <li>I used slight pressure and a smooth long motion like you would normally use, but I did this in 3 directions.  </li>
            <li>With extra effort I could get a decent shave.    </li>
            <li>A solid razor with a self contained cleaning unit for a decent price.    </li>
            <li>Have used many different razors in the past.</li>
            <li>First shave is the most difficult.</li>
            <li>It was obviously translated by someone who&#x27;s first language was definitely not English.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why exactly, maybe it was simply because I feel that it actually works, but I even have \\&quot;fun\\&quot; using it.      </li>
            <li>Panasonic&#x27;s cleaning detergent is small, simple, and safe.</li>
            <li>However, since it&#x27;s only a hair or two, once in a while, I simply pull out a regular disposable razor and do a quick clean-up with no problems.    </li>
            <li>use electric razors because my beard requires hot steam treatment prior to shaving with a regular razor.  </li>
            <li>and you will definitely be better off in the long run when you compare to buying shaving cream and triple blade razor heads every few weeks.</li>
            <li>You had to make several passes to get a decent shave.</li>
            <li>Overall decent product for the price.</li>
            <li>I end up using the machine up,down, down up, to left, right, right left.  </li>
            <li>My favorite method, I&#x27;ve found, is dry shaving at the end of the day/beginning when your face isn&#x27;t so sensitive, and just running the blades under some cold water now and then (both to clean them momentarily, lubricate your skin just a tad, and keep them cool - the blades do get hot) while simultaneously moving it in small circles over the area you want shaved (almost like brushing your teeth).    </li>
            <li>And it is a cool little toy that does work well</li>
            <li>After going through the gauntlet with pretty much every other high and low end electric shaver out there, I decided to try this Panasonic (a decision I made from reading these reviews on Amazon actually).  </li>
            <li>Other times I just clean the shaver with my hands under running water using regular hand soap.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would highly recommend this razor.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend use of lather for the closest possible shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using this shaver with a glycerin-based shaving gel, such as those by Gilette or Nivea with MicroTec.  </li>
            <li>Overall I highly recommend this shaver and am planning on getting another one for my father for Christmas.</li>
            <li>As far as other reviews stating that it can be loud, this is true, but after using in the morning, I am on my way out the door, so I am not generally there to notice.  </li>
            <li>They would just vibrate in a strange manner, not enough to actually cut (no, it wasn&#x27;t the turbo clean mode).  </li>
            <li>I developed new areas of razor burn on my face (even in the fourth week)</li>
            <li>Knowing that Panasonic shavers were available for using wet with lotion, and having tried one dry (</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how smooth my skin was after shaving with this model, dry or wet</li>
            <li>The wet dry feature is fantastic as well.</li>
            <li>Also, its nice that when you put it into the base you can select from various modes, charge, clean, dry, or combinations of those, so if you just want to clean it, but not charge, you have those options.</li>
            <li>What I used to do with the other two is within the week use the electric razor and during the weekend/going out with girlfriend or special events use the regular razor(mach 3).  </li>
            <li>, you get compact hard soap filled catridges that last much longer.  </li>
            <li>long as the shaver shaves I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Not dead silent, but so much quieter than the Braun I had before it; especially the cleaning cycle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no issues with the gel, as I&#x27;ve read others complained of it becoming \\&quot;gummy\\&quot; or clogged after use.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t hold a charge as long, didn&#x27;t have the cleaning system, didn&#x27;t shave as well and was much louder.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic also has several different selectable functions (clean, dry, charge, etc.)</li>
            <li>I unfolded a metal paper clip so that it is a long straight piece of metal.  </li>
            <li>Using a shaving brush, I whipped up some foam on a mug, wet my face with hot water, and lathered it on.  </li>
            <li>Last but not least, neck hairs seem to be a problem for it requiring mulitple passes.  </li>
            <li>With a full beard, I just trim it my upper checks and around and under my neck every other day or so.    </li>
            <li>So I would use that as a first shave and then touch up the rough spots in the shower with a blade.  </li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m patient and go over the same section enough I do feel like I&#x27;ve shaved with a normal razor, but I normally don&#x27;t have the patience.  </li>
            <li>The shaving is very smooth with far less irritation than my previous shavers.</li>
            <li>I think a long term usage review is more useful to know if your hard earned money is being well spent.</li>
            <li>You will notice that without lubricant the blades actually give off a slight grinding, abrasive sound barely noticeable to the ear.  </li>
            <li>Except for the automatic cleaning/charging station, I&#x27;m not sure that this shaver was worth the high price.</li>
            <li>The new motor is far less noisy than the older models--you do not need ear protection anymore!    </li>
            <li>I will probably come back to this review later to update it, but for now all I can say is that the performance of the shaver is EXTREMELY important to me, over aesthetics, cleaning systems, and all that other stuff.  </li>
            <li>The cartridges are better than the Braun because they are dry and simply have a hard soap, vs the Braun that has alcohol and is bulky and costs five times as much.</li>
            <li>This new Panasonic Vortex is a totally different story.</li>
            <li>I have been using the new shaver for several weeks now</li>
            <li>Another future problem with the 4-blade system is that you&#x27;ll want to buy a new shaver when your blades and foil need to be replaced.</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco razors since 1968 my last new one I bought in 2005.</li>
            <li>Well, the next time I shaved, I lathered up and went to town with my new razor.</li>
            <li>Not only was it a new unit, but also the updated model (ES8109S).</li>
            <li>it is cleaned and dry ready to go.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, he loves the auto-cleaning and the fact that he can use it in the shower or dry if he wants.  </li>
            <li>With a blade I can only shave about once every 3 or 4 days because shaving short stubble for some reason really irritates my skin.</li>
            <li>However, it was giving me a very close shave until, I believe, the battery finally lost enough power.  </li>
            <li>The one wide foil is not well suited to shaving a round skull and it takes a lot more passes to run the razor closely over all areas.  </li>
            <li>These items are best not completed while sleeping in the room next to the recharging/cleaning base.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not perfect, but then again I never found a razor that could shave my thick beard perfectly.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts well between charges and maintains strong motor power throughout the discharge cycle, rather than fading slowly as the battery discharges.    </li>
            <li>This one wasn&#x27;t as good as the second, but not as bad as the first.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if mine are standing up any more than usual, but it provides a lubricating quality to your skin which prevents razor burn when you have to go over the same spot several times, which you will be doing if you get any electric shaver.</li>
            <li>The irritation is a major issue though on the neck and adams apple.  </li>
            <li>I did the original charge for the recommended time and usually charged it once a week thereafter.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had numerous shavers in the past,this is by the far the closest shave!</li>
            <li>I still have a hard time with the neck area, but otherwise it&#x27;s a fine tool.</li>
            <li>And almost all of them have been Panasonic, because they carry a broad line of wet/dry shavers.</li>
            <li>When the faucet appears on the readout to indicate a self-cleaning is due, I just remove the foil and run the blades under hot water.</li>
            <li>Have had two wet/dry shavers, the only reason I bought this one several years ago is I left the first one in a hotel room.</li>
            <li>After I read the reviews, and looked at the distribution of ratings, it appeared that the Panasonic foil product line was getting consistently higher reviews vs other foils and the rotaries.</li>
            <li>Apparently they did some work since I tried one of these 20 years ago!  </li>
            <li>My husband likes this razor, he says he has a pretty close shave compared to other electric razors.</li>
            <li>Having no other choice</li>
            <li>I can say that it was enough for a very long first shave.  </li>
            <li>Granted the previous 2 were rougly $50 or $60, so you can&#x27;t expect anything more than average from them.  </li>
            <li>The first test was dry, and then the next cut</li>
            <li>Okay, so, let me preface this buy saying that my Dad has been a thick, coarse bearded dude his entire adult life.</li>
            <li>overall i think i might go back to using a braun or an older model panasonic if i can find one .</li>
            <li>The Remington gave a decent shave, but it would actually draw tiny dots of blood around the edges of my mouth, which is a bit too close for comfort.</li>
            <li>It does charge quickly, you have the option to shave dry or wet.</li>
            <li>This was my first attempt to use an electric shaver after about 10 years of conventional shaving.</li>
            <li>Fast forward to a few weeks ago, I purchased this shaver based on the high reviews on Amazon.     </li>
            <li>Also, much like the prior models, the little pop up trimmer on the side of the new shaver is great not only for trimming sideburns (which I actually never use it for), but also for capturing those awkward little hairs that lie flat or may be becoming ingrown.</li>
            <li>This razor gave me a shave equal to or better than any shave I&#x27;ve gotten without using a regular blade (even a somewhat dull blade).    </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that is easily irritated by shaving with blades, and  I was told by quite a few people that this shaver got closer than any other electric out there.    </li>
            <li>But this razor is able to get a very close shave with very little, usually none, irritation.</li>
            <li>My Facial Background: I have very sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve never been able to shave more than once a week due to skin irritation because I would get those water pimples that would make the area painful if I shaved against the grain with a razor or by using those electric razors from the 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I was given this shaver as a Christmas gift, and I generally like it.  </li>
            <li>I generally like it.  </li>
            <li>But, particularly with regard to charging, there is absolutely no reason to have it flash, and since people typically leave their razor in the bathroom, where they may need to go in the middle of the night, a flashing light is actually an annoyance as it tends to wake one up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve returned merchandise before because the instructions in English consisted of two to three words and complete sentences in Spanish.&lt;br</li>
            <li>To add insult to injury, some days I have to be up fairly early for physical training.</li>
            <li>the only problem is the dock is loud and takes forever...</li>
            <li>I have tried salves, electric, manual, and just about everything else, this shaver however, has reduced the red marks and bumps on my neck almost completely.    </li>
            <li>I tried manual razors which took too much \\&quot;prep work\\&quot; and had that rough feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li>Now... it still doesn&#x27;t shave and barely cuts hair when i shave against the flow of the hair.</li>
            <li>and yet there is still no need to change the blades, and I have only used one cleaning cartridge so far.</li>
            <li>Once your skin adapts to the shaver you don&#x27;t have to be as gentle and skin irritation is minimal.  </li>
            <li>It seems that 13,000 RPMs does apparently make a difference.  </li>
            <li>Only con to the razor is it is rather loud.</li>
            <li>but I would have to shave the same area on my face for about 4-5 times to get a complete shave</li>
            <li>It does a decent job dry as well.</li>
            <li>Although I haven&#x27;t yet had the occasion to use the wet shave feature, I feel that the shaver will perform very well when used in that mode.</li>
            <li>The old shave should be banded from stores.</li>
            <li>All of them have been wet/dry, because shaving with a wet beard gives a much closer shave.</li>
            <li>When it was time to replace my old shaver I wanted to try something that did not require ongoing purchases of cleaning cartridges which were adding up with the Braun after several years.  </li>
            <li>My next shaver will have rotary action.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this shaver for 2 weeks so far</li>
            <li>The Vortex is easy to clean under the faucet, but it also comes with a charging/cleaning base, which works very well.</li>
            <li>He had an old chargeable razor for years and it finally broke.</li>
            <li>I was really suprised how well the shaver works wet.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like I have my old shaver back.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic ES8109S 3-blade - barely.</li>
            <li>but I just find for the price this shaver sells at, far exceeds what it can actually do.</li>
            <li>Prior to this I was a Norelco user for nearly 25 years.  </li>
            <li>Replace that word with \\&quot;sequence\\&quot; and use some other American English words in some other instances and the manual will be more readable.</li>
            <li>apparently the lower ratings were not for the shaving effectiveness at all.  </li>
            <li>Compared to my father&#x27;s old shaver I recall, this is very, very quiet.</li>
            <li>that can be used individually or together for a complete refresh of the unit.</li>
            <li>As in, loud enough that it WILL wake up someone if you shave in a nearby room.</li>
            <li>Also because of my sensitive skin by using the blade, I had to skip shaving the next day.  </li>
            <li>Had my old shaver for about a decade, but the battery finally died.  </li>
            <li>The Vortex quietly cleans, lubricates and even fully recharges your shaver for you (alternatively, you can just plug the power cable for the Vortex directly into the shaver to recharge it).</li>
            <li>The designers apparently thought I needed a mini lightshow in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>First, even when I have skipped a couple of days of of shaving, and my beard is really rough, this shaver does its job smoothly, quietly, and effortlessly.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a good idea to wet my face and use a thin cream to lube my mug for the big event.</li>
            <li>I have shaved with a regular razor and a rotary razor and this is by far the most comfortable and least irritating shaving device I have used.  </li>
            <li>I take blood thinners and got tired of running to the emergency room every time I nicked myself  :) .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit messy, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>usually takes around 2 1/2hrs to FULL Charge.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately Remington no longer makes the kind of razor I wanted.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little time to get it just right, but I&#x27;m in the shower and don&#x27;t mind having the water pouring over me as I get my shave on.  </li>
            <li>, I mean if you add up how much it will cost you to use disposable razors or whatever you use you will realize that this price equals out to about the same cost as a years worth of disposable razors.     </li>
            <li>First, what is it supposed to do...clean your razor and then air dry it while charging it back up for the next use</li>
            <li>(plus i only paid $70 in total for a brand new set from amazon).  </li>
            <li>I have tried shaving with this thing many different ways: bone dry, wet in the shower, in the shower with soap on my face, in the shower with regular shaving cream, with a shaving gel, and dry but with Afta pre-electric lotion.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work very well dry, so you have to spend extra time in the shower in the morning and buy gel for a close shave.  </li>
            <li>Another big difference between Braun &amp; Panasonic cleaning, Braun uses alcohol based liquids which dry up fast no matter</li>
            <li>Like I said, I haven&#x27;t used it a ton yet, and never have I had multiple days&#x27; stubble to shave off, but this shaver is worth every penny (I paid less than $80 for it with the $30 code thru March 31st).  </li>
            <li>I have studied and restudied and restudied the instructions, but still don&#x27;t know how much fluid to put into the reservoir tank initially and how to know when it needs a refill; there is no apparent line on the device marking the limit beyond which the instructions say one must not fill, on penalty of ruining the whole device.    </li>
            <li>Now I can live with the noise as long as the shaver gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Putting in a new cartridge every month for the cleaning system is a minor nag  </li>
            <li>Since you can&#x27;t buy a replacement cleaner, you are forced to buy a new whole new kit.</li>
            <li>However right out of the box I used the panasonic and went over the neck few times and no burn at all.</li>
            <li>This one seems to work better and costs less than half!  </li>
            <li>It has a higher pitch than my previous shavers, but that is not a problem.</li>
            <li>The cleaning units us a dry detergent pack with normal tap water.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this electric shaver my face looked like I was slapped by my wife about half a dozen times.  </li>
            <li>It is slower, more expensive and doesn&#x27;t give a decent shave unless you go over your beard several times.      </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this is due to my face adjusting, me learning better technique, or what.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a top of the line Braun in the past, which extremely   irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li>If you have really thick hair I would save your money till you can buy a more expensive electric razor that may actually cut through your manly beard :)</li>
            <li>This is a shaver and not a magic wand, so it does require several passes to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>I had bought in the past some other shavers but didn&#x27;t work out as it says, but this Panasonic ES8109S Vortex Wet/Dry did so far a great job, I have really hard facial hair</li>
            <li>As for irritation, i did not get to much of that other</li>
            <li>cleaning mode works very well, and again it is quieter than any other self-cleaning shaver I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic wet-dry shavers are very versatile.er foil razors due to its faster speed.      </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t find it much louded than any other electric that I have used.</li>
            <li>The shave is very close and does not irritate my skin like other electric razors.  </li>
            <li>I finally decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the risk of replacing the blades with that shaver so far past the waranty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took me about three times as long as shaving with a normal razor, despite the fact that when I shave with a normal razor I have to get wet, wash my face, use shaving gel and after shave, etc.      </li>
            <li>Needless to say, it didn&#x27;t take long before I was ready to shell out some cash for a better razor.      </li>
            <li>For those of us that live in cities near other people and stuff, I don&#x27;t think this is noisy.  </li>
            <li>I began bleeding and was left with a big red smile looking mark from one side of my neck to the other.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver a year ago, and while I have traditionally preferred blades, I thought I&#x27;d give this one a try due to the positive reviews.      </li>
            <li>My only complaint about it is the cheap travel bag.  </li>
            <li>Also, with all the passes needed to actually cut the hairs, shaving with this razor took me FAR longer than with a blade, so back to blades</li>
            <li>If you keep going over the same spot gently (not baby gently</li>
            <li>and I find myself not having to go over the same spot several times as I was doing with my old razor.  </li>
            <li>but i would consider myself hairy for a young Asian male).</li>
            <li>however I seem to be one of these people who can only get a proper shave using the old low-tech razor.</li>
            <li>The only feature of the shaver that should be improved is the fold-out trimmer, which is even smaller than its predecessor and doesn&#x27;t look and feel as if it has been designed for frequent use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve shipped it back and gone back to my old blade razor.</li>
            <li>:       For the actual shave; this thing shaves as close as any straight wet razor.  </li>
            <li>Shaving (the actual act of removing hair) takes a few minutes longer, but it is well worth it</li>
            <li>For this reason I decided to buy replacement screens, but in Amazon&#x27;s many pages of Panasonic razor stuff I find screens for dozens of different razors, but alas, none for this model.</li>
            <li>The most important thing this cleaning base does to your shaver is LUBRICATE.  </li>
            <li>Oh, one more thing, the ES8109S comes with Panasonic&#x27;s latest iteration of its Vortex Cleaning and charging base, which is slightly different from its prior models, but appears to use the same cleaning cartridge.</li>
            <li>Simply stated it shaves like no other razor I have used.  </li>
            <li>Just keep in mind, if this is the first electric shaver for you, it is NOT as close as a razor shave, not even a little bit.</li>
            <li>First, a little background on my shaving history.  </li>
            <li>Recently, I was at a major club/warehouse store and saw this shaver on sale for $99.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s grey so less is better and it is noticeably less with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>The only reason the old unit was retired was that I was due for a new razor/foil set (approx $30).  </li>
            <li>Using the little brush has never really gotten a shaver completely clean and it&#x27;s 5 minutes of time</li>
            <li>only complaint about the shaver is that the location and angle of the trimmer is somewhat awkward for trimming a moustache, though it is perfect for sideburns.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much to add to the other reviews about the actual function of the razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back to the real razor, and this one will be used for other areas.</li>
            <li>and I will never go back to a straight razor or any other electric.  </li>
            <li>We both worked on his shaving and decided to get a standard razor to do the hard work and use this razor to clean up the stubble.</li>
            <li>As long as you use soap (nearly any soap will do)</li>
            <li>oddly enough he barely uses it.</li>
            <li>After 6 months, I can barely get an acceptable shave at all, having to go over and over the same area and still not get a close shave.  </li>
            <li>The first few days I was not convinced, and even the product literature will tell you to stick with it.</li>
            <li>The shaver is cool and has all these gadgets but sucks.</li>
            <li>However, it was also messy and probably wasteful of hot water.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully on Amazon, it&#x27;s discounted pretty heavily.</li>
            <li>For the first couple of months I thought I wasted my money.</li>
            <li>I did not enjoy the first, so I switched to a Gillet.    </li>
            <li>First of all I have a fairly heavy beard coming from a Welsh background.  </li>
            <li>I shave in the shower so the fancy cleaning system is pretty much a waste of space</li>
            <li>I assume this is from the base not being able to clean it</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money - go buy ST2 Sensitive for Men 12 ct for $6.58 at WalMart!!!!</li>
            <li>With a traditional blade, even with my thick hair, I&#x27;d have the initial shaving with little pulses until the area is clean and follow up with a new lather and new shave.  </li>
            <li>several shaves to get used to a new razor and so, takes a little extra time to get close; after only a few minutes of shaving, my face was smooth (almost as close as a blade).</li>
            <li>Instead, I decided to purchase the Panasonic for roughly half the price of the Braun, based on the very high ratings it had received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you hate wasting your money and want to have a good shaver that will last a reasonable amount of time, then buy a different brand.</li>
            <li>but the save was actually closer than a blade (hard to believe I know but true).</li>
            <li>Because the blade and foil are very sharp and have a high RPM, you get cuts periodically...just like a blade!  </li>
            <li>It also has an annoying indicator light that flashes frantically when it is fully charged, as though I should be excited about that information and take some action.</li>
            <li>but did you all notice that your old style blade was not as sharp just prior to the introduction of a new more expensive blade.</li>
            <li>Like any product of this nature getting a new one every 3-5 years is expected.  </li>
            <li>What kind of an idiot is going to spend 80% of the cost of a new shaver just to get a set of new cutter blades and foil?</li>
            <li>This electric razor gives me a much closer shave than the previous name brand I&#x27;d been using.</li>
            <li>I get much closer shaves than my previous rotary razor.  </li>
            <li>and as others have said, doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin as much or leave that \\&quot;slight burn\\</li>
            <li>Generally, cartidges seem to last about a month with daily use, although I now manage quite a bit longer cartridge life by opening the shave head and rinsing off the bulk of the stubble in the sink before sticking it into the unit to be cleaned.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my aging Braun 8500 series razor, which performed consistently well but managed to destroy its foils every 2-3 months recently.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m willing to spend a few extra bucks if it makes a difference.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to be as close shaved as I used to and have been lazy about shaving I thought an electric would get me to trim back the stubble a little more.  </li>
            <li>The hair on my neck really lays down and I must make several passes sometimes when I haven&#x27;t shaved in a couple of days.</li>
            <li>With shaving every other day the battery normally depletes to about 50-60% in a weeks period.  </li>
            <li>The only issue I have is it, like all other electric razors I have used, doesn&#x27;t do very well with the thick stubble right under my chin.</li>
            <li>I wanted something that I could just pick up and shave with -- it would have to be fast and it would have to work both wet and dry.    </li>
            <li>It provides a very close shave either wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>So far I have only used it dry with some pre-shave lotion and it gave me as close a shave as a blade, but without the trauma.</li>
            <li>Very close shave wet or dry</li>
            <li>Really likes the wet or dry feature.</li>
            <li>In this respect, the new ES8109S actually outperforms Panasonic&#x27;s prior top of the line offering (the ES8078) and actually causes even less shaving irritation than that model (which itself wasn&#x27;t all that irritating to begin with).</li>
            <li>Just helps a little, especially if there are a large number of reviews.    </li>
            <li>Remington has the ideal blades (that Panasonic used to make) and it shows in closer cutting and less time spent doing so.</li>
            <li>I have only used it as a dry shave so far, and I definitely plan on using it in the shower soon with a recommended menthol based shaving cream.</li>
            <li>It is a good as a my former Braun and the replacement parts (blades/foils) are less expensive.</li>
            <li>After numerous attempts to buy electra shavers manufactured by Remington (cheap, but should be labeled as a self-torture device for those that want to destroy their faces slowly and painfully) and Noelco (they work OK until it&#x27;s time to clean them--then it takes a PHd in rocket science to put them back together again--</li>
            <li>It shaves very close with little or no irritation.</li>
            <li>The upfront cost is a little pricey, but not when you factor in how much you would pay for disposable blades.</li>
            <li>Plus he can used this wet (for a real close shave) or dry!</li>
            <li>I think after 2-3 shaves I&#x27;ll have a pattern down that works for my particular beard</li>
            <li>Self cleans like a champ and the little sideburn trimer on the back is high powered too!</li>
            <li>It took a while to get my routine down, but get a decent enough shave now.</li>
            <li>Speaking of the cutters and the screens, they become quite warm before I am finished shaving which leads me to believe that there is friction and that the very thin screens are not likely to last very long.</li>
            <li>It also was much less expensive due to a great Amazon sale.  </li>
            <li>Rather than hit every good and bad point about this product I&#x27;m going to give some info on me</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I figured $100 wasn&#x27;t a bad price for supposedly such a good razor (and cleaning system).</li>
            <li>To put it simply it does not shave at all, leaving behind huge patches of hair on my neck, underside of my head and also on my face.</li>

            <li> but this one is great!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ergonomics: The best of the breed.</li>

            <li> This is an awesome feature and one you will (or should) use often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer</li>
            <li> /&gt;Vortex cleaning system leaks a bit, and is sticky, not the best scent</li>
            <li> Compared to this wonderful device, I had been shaving with the equivalents of garden rakes all my life!</li>
            <li> Great Job Panasonic!!!!</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8109S provides me with an excellent shave.  </li>

            <li> Looking forward to shaving without water and soap and getting my face conditioned for this wonderful shaver.</li>
            <li> I Googled the best electric shavers, and this one was on the list.  </li>
            <li> Happy Shaving!</li>
            <li> I have owned Braun shavers for years and have been very happy with them.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is no exception, it is the best shaver I have owned.  </li>
            <li> Amazon was excellent to deal with on the return.  </li>
            <li> All in all, this is one of the best things I have every done for my face.    </li>
            <li> I went from a rotary to this shaver and have been very happy.</li>
            <li> Best shaver I ever bought.</li>
            <li> and this is the best one ever.</li>
            <li> No matter what anyone says, an electric will never shave as close as a blade, but this one does the best job of any electric I&#x27;ve had over the years.</li>
            <li> , I am VERY impressed with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Because of that experience I was prepared to give Braun a try this time but when I went over all the electric razor reviews I could find the Panasonic once again sounded the best.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the job.     </li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the unit.</li>
            <li> you want the best shave you can get regardless</li>
            <li> -To best shave the sides of your cheeks along the jawline up the sideburns</li>
            <li> This shaver is the best thing since sliced bread.  </li>
            <li> My husband said this is the best gift he has ever had</li>
            <li> Service was excellent with delivery as promised.</li>
            <li> The best part, a bonus if you will, is the Panasonic is water-resistant.</li>
            <li> However, all of that being said, this is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> think this is an excellent razor.  </li>
            <li> I think this is an excellent razor.  </li>
            <li> I did read in a consumer&#x27;s report where it&#x27;s best to stick to one type of electric shaver, so I may be destined to stay with a rotary shaver.</li>
            <li> I realized that you have to know the grain of your beard to get the best of this shaver.</li>
            <li> I replaced a Braun with this Panasonic and have been very happy.  </li>
            <li> The panasonic razor is a great razor!  </li>
            <li> I bout this 3 years ago and the best investment in years.</li>
            <li> An excellent value in this price range.</li>
            <li> Braun 1 was an excellent shaver that cost around $80 - $100.  </li>
            <li> All that to say I believe this is the best electric razor I have ever owned, and</li>
            <li> Well, after using this shaver for almost two months now, I have to say it is the best shaver I could imagine using.</li>
            <li> I gave up electric shavers years ago but tried this on a lark and am impressed.  </li>
            <li> And the cleaning unit was awesome.  </li>
            <li> He says that it works best when used with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with the quality of workmanship.</li>
            <li> Best price for the features and technology, including the cleaning unit.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re both very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Best shaver ever.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this shaver after about one week.</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit after researching it for 2 weeks and found that for the price it had the best review.  </li>
            <li> have also had almost all brands of electrics, from the best models of Norelco, Braun, Remington, etc.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The King Of Shaves line is THE BEST for anyones skin.</li>
            <li> This razor works amazingly!!!</li>
            <li> Used it in the shower too and all in all, an excellent value for the money.</li>
            <li> but this one is the best I&#x27;ve ever bought.  </li>
            <li> For those of us who prefer a foil headed shaver, this is one of the best I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> No need for concern as he said it&#x27;s the best razor he&#x27;s ever had.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is awesome and if you&#x27;ve read this review you have to buy one!</li>
            <li> Great birthday gift for him!!!!!!!!!    </li>
            <li> I have been amazed at how great this works!!  </li>
            <li> and it still works great!!</li>
            <li> know Panasonic makes the best shavers out there (from my experience) but</li>
            <li> is the best invention ever.  </li>
            <li> Close shave each time and the battery life is awesome.</li>
            <li> After 1 month of using this shaver, I&#x27;m convinced it is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Great deal!  </li>
            <li> One of the best shavers I have owned!</li>
            <li> AWESOME!!</li>
            <li> Awesome.  </li>
            <li> Razor is the best of the newer razors on the market today.</li>
            <li> I miss my norelco from 20 years ago because it gave the best shave.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The razor is truly superb.</li>
            <li> A great Shaver!</li>
            <li> Happy shopping!</li>
            <li> Excellent razor.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Showed up on time, and in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a blade for decades, but decided to try an electric razor to see how close it comes to the excellent shave provided by a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Best of all, the motor provides a \\&quot;linear\\&quot; performance throughout the battery&#x27;s charge, and doesn&#x27;t drop off as the battery charge is diminished.  </li>
            <li> An excellent value for the Amazon price!</li>
            <li> In summary, my husband has been shaving for over 4 decades and he says this is THE best shaver he has ever owned.</li>
            <li> Perfect</li>
            <li> The shaver really is awesome.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> Going against the grain has the best results that I&#x27;ve noticed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months and haven&#x27;t replaced the cleaning catridge or the water and still get excellent results.  </li>
            <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> My husband said this was the best razor he ever had.  </li>
            <li> and this works perfectly for him.</li>
            <li> does he love it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did!!!</li>
            <li> Interestingly, it shaves also 3 days beard!!!</li>
            <li> It is awesome in that aspect too as it gives an incredibly close shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li> All of the reviews were very good</li>
            <li> ll in all a very good razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shave quality: Just about on par with the Braun, which is very, very good.</li>
            <li> I got a very good deal on the ES8109S Vortex, which makes it easier to appreciate.</li>
            <li> Very good.  </li>
            <li> This is a very good shaver.</li>
            <li> This shaver is very good when it is working.  </li>
            <li> Very good cleaning   device.</li>
            <li> Incredible.      </li>
            <li> and I must say that the closeness of the shave with shaving cream is incredible.  </li>
            <li> you will get an incredibly close shave that lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> Works great best electric razor I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> Very happy with this shaver and got it at a great deal.</li>
            <li> This is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced from an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> Recharging station works great and cleans the shaver perfectly every time.  </li>
            <li> Cons:  The cleaning and drying selections on the stand aren&#x27;t incredibly intuitive, however.</li>
            <li> I use a wonderful Body Shop shaving cream and a great set of blades and razor.  </li>
            <li> Good purchase indeed!</li>
            <li> This is perhaps the best product of any kind that I have purchased in years!</li>
            <li> For my money, Norelco is superior!</li>
            <li> frankly it feels quite good for the face!     </li>
            <li> Every bit as good!  </li>
            <li> Definitely a good buy!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how good it looks!</li>
            <li> side burn trimmer is excellent, and very handy in trimming unruly hair - I&#x27;d imagine it would do a great job for trimming mustaches, although I don&#x27;t have one.  </li>
            <li> I shave my head bald, and my beautiful face,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with too, it does a good job</li>
            <li> It is also ergonomic and beautiful.  </li>
            <li> It is a good razor with excellent shipping.  </li>
            <li> and I must say I am very pleased and impressed with it.  </li>
            <li> the shave is really very good and surprisingly close.  </li>
            <li> The charging/cleaning stand is a very good idea and gives you a good place to store it between shaves.</li>
            <li> I am completely happy with this shaver and highyl recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Great Shaver.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 4 month&#x27;s now and it works great.  </li>
            <li> I can shave faster and get a great shave.</li>
            <li> I thought the self cleaning was a gimmick, but it it great.</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> LOL.    </li>
            <li> So unless I shave every 2 days, this shaver isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li> It is great for on-the-go</li>
            <li> The neck still burned, but this time I was prepared with post shave lotion and that helped out greatly.  </li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> I got this product in June, and I am really happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> WHAT&#x27;S ALSO GREAT</li>
            <li> the Panasonic is a great investment.  </li>
            <li> the price is great as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a trimmin, choppin&#x27; machine that does provide a great close shave.  </li>
            <li> happy</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m happy and still trying.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Gives a great close shave.</li>
            <li> This product worked great for me.</li>
            <li> After that it is great.  </li>
            <li> Great with lather in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Great buy.  </li>
            <li> I would reccomend this to anyone, great product.</li>
            <li> It is great.</li>
            <li> Considering the great reviews this gets</li>
            <li> The lone \\&quot;pro\\&quot; for this razor is that it&#x27;s sideburn trimmer is great.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t shaved in two days and the shave was great.  </li>
            <li> I immediately ordered this model and have been a happy customer for 5 days.  </li>
            <li> Having the HydraClean is great too.  </li>
            <li> This is a great razor.</li>
            <li> Keep up the great techology Develpoement.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with this shaver.</li>
            <li> It is still running great.  </li>
            <li> He says it shaves great and stays charged.</li>
            <li> That was a great decision.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is great.</li>
            <li> The way it shaves in the shower is great for him.  </li>
            <li> This is the closest shave I&#x27;ve experienced with an electric razor.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t see the proud nanotechnology.</li>
            <li> Owned for over a year and still working great.</li>
            <li> great.</li>
            <li> It never quite gave a great shave</li>
            <li> the fact that I can use shaving cream is great.  </li>
            <li> One great feature is that you dont have to use the cleaner if you don&#x27;t want to or can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> it does a great job.  </li>
            <li> This shaver works great</li>
            <li> It shaves close, does not irritate my skin and the cleaning module is great.  </li>
            <li> The self-cleaning system is a great way to shave and forget it.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT shaver.  </li>
            <li> Battery life is great</li>
            <li> And it gives a great shave every time.</li>
            <li> I think it is the 3 blade system, but whatever it is its great.</li>
            <li> I can see all the wiskers, and my face feels great after shaving.</li>
            <li> and it still works great.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have never been happy with an electric shaver until now.  </li>
            <li> But the end result now is a great shave.  </li>
            <li> cleaning station works great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a great shaver and cleaning system.  </li>
            <li> It is improved and works great</li>
            <li> He needed a shaver that works great in the shower and this was the one.</li>
            <li> Great item.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> This product has been working great for me.</li>
            <li> the cleaning feature works great</li>
            <li> The cleaning feature was a great idea.</li>
            <li> This is a great find and cheaper than buying it in the store.</li>
            <li> It works great.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning system is great except when away from home</li>
            <li> But, now speaking about 4 weeks into it, I can honestly say I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> The Braun gave me a great shave</li>
            <li> The Panasonic has been great for the two weeks I&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li> Until then, I&#x27;ll be happy using this one.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Panasonic ES8109S Vortex Wet/Dry Shaver in mid-December 2008 at a great price.  </li>
            <li> Altho I will admit that I also use Neutrogena after shave lotion which helps out greatly.    </li>
            <li> With a great shave, the ability to go into the shower with you, and a price well below The Braun, Panasonic has the winner here.  </li>
            <li> This is the type of shaver a person can use for years, with replacing the foils, of course, and be completely happy with.</li>
            <li> The shaver is great.</li>
            <li> A charging stand would greatly increase the convenience of this shaver.</li>
            <li> anyhow, my dad raves how great it is and how it doesn&#x27;t bother his skin at all</li>
            <li> It still is giving me a great shave.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need to worry about packing shaving cream when I fly.</li>
            <li> It still works great.</li>
            <li> and I realy like it,does a great job.</li>
            <li> great battery life...</li>
            <li> I think this was a great product.</li>
            <li> It has been great.</li>
            <li> the products I use to obtain a great shave.  </li>
            <li> All the great reviews are true,this is the elite of electric shavers and should cost twice what you&#x27;ll get it for on Amazon.</li>
            <li> but Im happy to have been proved otherwise.  </li>
            <li> and I got it at a great price.   </li>
            <li> The self cleaning feature works great</li>
            <li> The Panasonic came on Amazon for a great price and decided to give a try.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great shaver, however, I don&#x27;t know why they bother to include the cleaner / charger stand.  </li>
            <li> Great shaver.</li>
            <li> and I get great results every time I use the razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about 2 months now and happy with this model.</li>
            <li> it does a great job on shaving my face</li>
            <li> It sometimes does not give a great shave in the neck area.</li>
            <li> Great gift item.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, great product if you&#x27;re looking for a great shave.</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> But that has been resolved and Mr. Fussy is happy as a pig in mud with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this was a great electric shaver for the money.  </li>
            <li> I got this device after using my dad&#x27;s ES8077S (which is also a great shaver mind you).</li>
            <li> Amazon is a great place for just this purpose.  </li>
            <li> Their policies allow a great deal of freedom when shopping and it works to the buyers favor.  </li>
            <li> purchased the Panasonic when Amazon was having a great sale, and ended up paying about $75 for it -</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does a great job and close shave.</li>
            <li> Shaves great if it works.</li>
            <li> Great razor, would recommend and buy again from Amazon.</li>
            <li> The wet/dry is great.  </li>
            <li> am I glad I did!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!!.</li>
            <li> The automatic cleaning cycle is very nice as well.</li>
            <li> Plus, you get the cleaning system which is very nice as well.</li>
            <li> I am in no way kidding with you, and am in fact being very honest,</li>
            <li> The self cleaning and charging dock is very nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the cleaning system is very nice</li>
            <li> this shaves very nicely, you must follow the recommend directions and allow 30 days for body to adjust to shaving in this manner.</li>
            <li> Im very happy with it, I used it on week ends, great to have , love the product</li>
            <li> The results are amazing!  </li>
            <li> What I find remarkable is that over 200 people gave this a favorable review.    </li>
            <li> I was getting the most absolutely perfect shave you could think of or envision.    </li>
            <li> To each their own I guess!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall good, product at a great price.</li>
            <li> This electric shaver is the best of the many I&#x27;ve had through the years.  </li>
            <li> It is a beautiful piece of hardware, well balanced with perfect fit and finish.  </li>
            <li> If it works as good as it does now, great.  </li>
            <li> The Braun has a slightly better shave, but the Panasonic is the best if you shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> Product is popular for a reason.!</li>
            <li> In fact, it&#x27;s fully immersible, if you feel like shaving underwater! :p  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m looking forward to more years with another wonderful razor.</li>
            <li> This shaver is the best of the many electric shavers I have owned.  </li>
            <li> I was more than impressed.</li>
            <li> He shaves more often, gets a closer shave and best of all the cleaning system</li>
            <li> razor is Good to Great 4 stars</li>
            <li> I will say that the shaver fits very nicely into one&#x27;s hand, and being a Panasonic, will probably be fairly trouble-free.</li>
            <li> Best shaver I ever had own, by the way this was the 5th shaver I own,</li>
            <li> so try to get it with the lowest price available and you, too, can have an excellent product at a great steal.</li>
            <li> easily the best I&#x27;ve ever owned, and the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> and he loved it, so I switched to Norelco too.  </li>
            <li> but the results were not so good when I did.  </li>
            <li> I have been searching for a good shaver for my head and face for years.</li>
            <li> I use it in a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; fashion, and the shave quality is good.  </li>
            <li> good soldier never needs a shave/haircut).</li>
            <li> Nivea is supposed to have a good cooling one, and again Billy Jealousy is supposed to have good after shave balm as well.  </li>
            <li> The battery is good for well over a week.</li>
            <li> thinking that this was as good as it gets with an electric.</li>
            <li> It was never as good as a blade</li>
            <li> Dry/wet is good</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> So, we read good reviews about the Panasonic shaver and decided to purchase one as a Father&#x27;s Day gift for him.</li>
            <li> I tried this linear shaver and it still cuts surprisingly close.</li>
            <li> I gave the Panasonic a fair chance but over all my face felt irritated</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall - Good product - value for money.</li>
            <li> well built and good quality.</li>
            <li> bottomline - good shaving results.</li>
            <li> He likes the cleaning feature and the trimmer and gets a good close shave.</li>
            <li> I think this razor is as good as any electric razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a good shave.  </li>
            <li> I like this shaver works good.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as a razor</li>
            <li> The one drawback is the it doesn&#x27;t seem to do quite as good a job on my neck</li>
            <li> Does not give a good shave at all.</li>
            <li> Yes battery life good.</li>
            <li> All is good except the noise of the cleaning and drying.  </li>
            <li> Good product design.</li>
            <li> I like the foil razors over the rotary blade shavers and this is a good buy for the $$.  </li>
            <li> The HydraClean system is not as good as Braun&#x27;s, but hey: by then you are shaved.</li>
            <li> Good going for Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I have used a razor blade type shaver (two &amp; four blade) for over forty years and thought I was getting a good shave.</li>
            <li> It is a replacement for a Braun 8585, which performed well, but was not as good as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Closest shave ever, nice feel, and great cleaning system.</li>
            <li> It worked fairly well, but always irritated my neck.    </li>
            <li> three weeks off use my shaves are as good  </li>
            <li> As my Schick quatro and are consisitant.the blade is good for two days but begins to fade after that.</li>
            <li> This shaver is as good as the 320.00 Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> Shave is amazingly good and no irritation.  </li>
            <li> This does as good a job shaving me as my blade and foam without the hassle.</li>
            <li> easy to clean and the BEST BEST shave I have ever received.  </li>
            <li> The shave is almost as good but not quite.</li>
            <li> &quot;  Good decision.     </li>
            <li> Optionally recharges with just the cord; good for extended travel.    </li>
            <li> Read all the good things everyone has to say about Panasonic and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I figured that was Panasonic&#x27;s way of saying, \\&quot;Electrics don&#x27;t shave as good as a blade, but give it 30 days</li>
            <li> The Panasonic is giving me just as good a shave as the Braun did.  </li>
            <li> Very impressive shave results at a fantastic price point.  </li>
            <li> I bought this model after reading a number good reviews about this shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about 9 months, and it does a good job.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s that good.  </li>
            <li> It works great, gives you a nice shave, and I \\&quot;think\\&quot;</li>
            <li> For a good shave I use Williams</li>
            <li> but it does a good job.</li>
            <li> It works everywhere good except for my neck somtimes</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s an electric razor out there that does that good of a job I would like to know about it.  </li>
            <li> However the trimmer cannot trim hair too good.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I did not shave with the Pulsonic and took the recommendation of others who had.</li>
            <li> using it in Afghanistan now good for on the go</li>
            <li> I got the ES8109s for around $86 here at Amazon before Christmas and was delighted.  </li>
            <li> He likes the cleaning feature, although it took him a while to get used to it - the directions weren&#x27;t as good as they should have been.</li>
            <li> This product was a good buy.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this shaver for a good, close shave.  </li>
            <li> I guess if it&#x27;s good for 007</li>
            <li> That was a good sign.</li>
            <li> This razor is not as good as the Norelco on shaving the curves under your neck</li>
            <li> On a good day, it gets about 90% of the job done.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good on my face but not on my neck.  </li>
            <li> whereas the Braun block and foil were good for 18 months and cost around $40-45 dollars to replace.</li>
            <li> Good shaver, I like the cleaning station.</li>
            <li> Trimmer works good on sideburns too.</li>
            <li> Its a good stubble remover.</li>
            <li> but anyway it is good for me</li>
            <li> Good close shave, good ergonomics.</li>
            <li> In both of those qualifiers, this was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Panasonic ES8109S in Dec. 2011 and have never had an electric shaver as good as this one.  </li>
            <li> Good battery life  3.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve preferred to use in the shower but never wanted to spend +$100 to get a good one.  </li>
            <li> This shaver gives a good close shave.</li>
            <li> Always had good service from them</li>
            <li> He is delighted.  </li>
            <li> sometimes let my beard grow for 2 days and still get a good shave.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m happy that he liked it and uses it.</li>
            <li> razor does a good job.</li>
            <li> I would think in this class of razor in this price point that the cleaning machine would be as good as the razor remember that the cleaning unit has a monthly cost of cleaner cartridges of $4 a month so in a years time you are in the $225</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my situation, I&#x27;m fair skinned and somewhat acne prone.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s good to go.</li>
            <li> When used with shaving cream as good as a blade razor and easier on the skin.  </li>
            <li> The electric razor seemed like a good place to start.    </li>
            <li> No matter what you buy, good luck in your shopping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good razor.</li>
            <li> Fair  razor.  </li>
            <li> There is also a drying mode, but I haven&#x27;t figured out a good use for that yet.  </li>
            <li> Bought this shaver for my boyfriend and he loved it.</li>
            <li> This shaver does a good job.</li>
            <li> Does a good job.</li>
            <li> The good things about this shaver are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shaver does a good job.  </li>
            <li> I was very favorably impressed with this shaver and agree and thank all those who wrote good reports about it before!</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8109S Vortex wet/dry shaver with nano technology and hydra clean system is the best shaver I ever used.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully and love the battery life marker.</li>
            <li> unit looks impressive and I realized that I had just purchased the best electric razor in my life, after several purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You see, to get the best (and most comfortable!)</li>
            <li> This product is designed exceptionally well and performs to my highest expectations.  </li>
            <li> For the most part I have to work at it to get most hairs, about 95% at best.</li>
            <li> All in all, this shaver performed exceptionally well throughout</li>
            <li> I read so VERY MANY reviews, on this site and others, and I looked into all the \\&quot;technology\\&quot; that goes into the shavers.  </li>
            <li> and it is great being able to use it in the shower.   </li>
            <li> Worth the buy, excellent price for this shaver!</li>
            <li> and I am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the Panasonic ES8109S.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the cleaning/charging functions and the number of shaves per charge.</li>
            <li> This has been great if you shave every 3-4 days you will love it.</li>
            <li> We are very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Quality, stylish, and does a great job.  </li>
            <li> I replace another brands shaver with the Panasonic and I have been very pleased.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this razor.  </li>
            <li> All in all, a wonderful shaver and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been very pleased.  </li>
            <li> However, it seems to one-up the Braun in one very interesting</li>
            <li> I finish up shaving off my goatee and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Panasonic wet/dry and have been very pleased.  </li>
            <li> i was very pleased with the razor that i order for my husband for christmas  </li>
            <li> I am a very light bearded guy, YMMV!</li>
            <li> Replaced my Braun shaver w/ this unit and am very satisfied with the performance, battery life of the shaver and cleaning unit.</li>
            <li> Have owned this shaver for a year now and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, good things come to an end, and this amazing device eventually gave up the ghost.</li>
            <li> 2 stars, Great Idea but has many downfalls.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaner is a great Idea for sure but for a $150+ razor</li>
            <li> /&gt;Solid charger, great self-cleaning, better cut than any razor have ever</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m extremely happy with my purchase and don&#x27;t think you can get much more for your money.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with that.  </li>
            <li> A++ for closeness of shave, as good as a blade.&lt;br /&gt;Practical , flexible, looks nice and blows away the competition.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that I am glad I did!  </li>
            <li> The first gave me the best shave ever - then died after 2 years.  </li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m quite impressed with it for a first shaver -</li>
            <li> The closer the better for him!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> and he said it&#x27;s better than he could have imagined!  </li>
            <li> I love this shaver!</li>
            <li> He tried it out and love it!</li>
            <li> First use, perfect shave.  </li>
            <li> $200 or more for a razor?!  </li>
            <li> and I love it!  </li>
            <li> The first time I used the razor I was really impressed.</li>
            <li> But I was immediately impressed with the Vortex after the first use, I had to write a review.  </li>
            <li> First off let me say that this Panasonic Razor is excellent.</li>
            <li> From the first day I used this shaver, I knew it was going to be my best electric razor ever.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I did!</li>
            <li> I say more?!  </li>
            <li> And the service I received from Panasonic was outstanding!</li>
            <li> Wife does not worry about cuts any more!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re both great shavers, and in the end you&#x27;ll be pretty happy with both.  </li>
            <li> charger/cleaner is easy to use and does a great job.  </li>
            <li> According to him: it gives a closer shave, is easy to use, and the self cleaning function is great.</li>
            <li> This shaver is hands down the best shaver that I have ever used, and best of all, it cleans itself!  </li>
            <li> You first unplug the unit!!!!</li>
            <li> It is very smooth, quit and the fact that it is just as good in the shower or at the sink, is mind boggling.</li>
            <li> Amazing.  </li>
            <li> The charge life is amazing as well.</li>
            <li> Great batterly life with  smooth, close shaves without irritation.  </li>
            <li> No nicks, no pulls, just a great smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I use it with shaving cream and it works amazingly.  </li>
            <li> The rpm&#x27;s are amazing.  </li>
            <li> This electric shaver is AMAZING.      </li>
            <li> This thing is amazing.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic shaver is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> And the HydraClean System is amazing.    </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> battery life on this thing is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This shaver deals with them all nicely.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say...</li>
            <li> It is nice not to have to use shaving cream.</li>
            <li> The self-clean feature is also nice when I&#x27;m done with it</li>
            <li> I kind of use a swirling motion, then horizontal strokes, followed by verticle movement.</li>
            <li> I have read some reviews that say the self cleaning mode is somewhat noisy but honestly can&#x27;t say that we have noticed that problem.</li>
            <li> but its a nice feature and Panasonic does not use an alcohol based cleaner</li>
            <li> He is THRILLED.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled, and so is my fiancé.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> The shave is identical between the two Panasonics (8103/8109) that I own.</li>
            <li> The cleaner is nice and seems to keep the blades sharper.</li>
            <li> My step-son had a Panasonic and liked it, so I decided to purchase it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still loving this shaver.</li>
            <li> The automatic cleaning system is a nice feature but haven&#x27;t used it yet.</li>
            <li> but I liked the fact that it could use lotion and be used in the shower.  </li>
            <li> He loves it and it looks nice sitting on the counter</li>
            <li> he has been using it and loving it evryday..</li>
            <li> but honestly I speak the truth.</li>
            <li> The floating head is probably nice for some people: I don&#x27;t care for it</li>
            <li> , I have bought a really nice shaver for myself that was over 40.00.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shaver that is very versatile.</li>
            <li> the others have a lot of catching up to do.</li>
            <li> Now I have more time in the morning to spend with my kid, and that is a good thing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not wanting to shell out again for another series 7, I settled on this as a cheaper (hopefully almost as effective) alternative... and received it for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With warm water flushed through the shaver head</li>
            <li> The shaver head foams up with the water and soap, and I just rinse it out in running warm water.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shaver about six months ago and waited to see if I still liked it after some use before writing a review.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic ES8109S Men&#x27;s 3 Blade Arc3 Wet/Dry Nanotech Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Vortex Cleaning System - Silver - Liked the product.</li>
            <li> The Vortex container provides a handy, compact and convenient storage recharging station so for that reason alone</li>
            <li> In any case, it really is the best razor I ever bought.  </li>
            <li> In any case, it really is the best razor I ever bought.  </li>
            <li> I noticed my neck was kind of itchy which has since subsided.  </li>
            <li> I have now used the Panasonic every day for a couple of months now and am still thrilled with the purchase.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind of good.&lt;br /&gt;shaving</li>
            <li> : I had hoped that the four blades of the Panasonic ES8243A just might be able to give a superior shave.</li>
            <li> I liked having a cleaning unit, so I decided to give the Panasonic a try.  </li>
            <li> For the negatives:  Honestly, I could swear I&#x27;ve gotten a closer shave with the Panasonic ES4026NC</li>
            <li> Nice, close shave with practically no irritation.</li>
            <li> Takes longer to shave than a blade, but the convenience is nice.</li>
            <li> It takes some time for your skin to get used to this eletric razor, but that really goes for any electric razor...but as soon as your face and neck is used to this razor it is awesome from there!</li>
            <li> nice machine  </li>
            <li> And the shave I get is nice and close.</li>
            <li> It does work as advertised and is a nice addition, but if price was my biggest concern</li>
            <li> As you would expect, takes awhile (weeks) for face to warm up up to using electric razor vs blade.  </li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best shave I ever received from any electric shaver.....</li>
            <li> It is equally effective at a 10 percent remaining charge as it is at 100 percent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I want him to look nice.  </li>
            <li> and I am happy to say I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> The HydraClean system is great for cleaning the unit when I am in a hurry and don&#x27;t want to take the time to clean it by hand.  </li>
            <li> The self clean system works great</li>
            <li> The cost was high (retail) but I found that Amazon had the best price and trust me, I looked everywhere!!  </li>
            <li> Hesitant at first, I told him the reviews were very good and asked him to try it.</li>
            <li> Awesome, I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Very nice, close shave, and still using the original blades.</li>
            <li> The rave reviews were true and the use of this shaver is great.  </li>
            <li> I am VERY pleased with both the shave quality and LOVE the automatic cleaning function   with this razor.</li>
            <li> My new ES8109S is absolutely great!  </li>
            <li> This Nano technology that the New Panasonic Wet/Dry Shaver uses is the best shave that in my 56yrs.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase of a new Panasonic ES8109S razor.</li>
            <li> This new razor is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> After ordering it a Amazon.com I was happy with how quickly it was shipped and at my front door.</li>
            <li> Well let me start by saying I have owned many electical shavers before that I thought were wonderful, but this one unlike the others, really is.    </li>
            <li> I really enjoy the fact you can dunk the head under a warm running faucet and clean it brilliantly.  </li>
            <li> And I can honestly say that this is by far the best shaver that I have ever used.     </li>
            <li> This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used at the most reasonable price for a shaver of the quality of the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> It fit perfectly in my hand, had the closest shave I have experienced so far, was good around the neck, and was comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Amazon return was very easy.</li>
            <li> It is VERY easy.  </li>
            <li> The wet/dry feature makes cleaning very easy.</li>
            <li> Very easy to set up and use</li>
            <li> He seems very happy with it so far!</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean, holds a charge nice, and does a good job shaving.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not knocking the razor, it&#x27;s awesome, just making sure you are realistic in your expectations.    </li>
            <li> Having gone through many electrics in my quest for a decent shave, I believe I can state that this is the best in it&#x27;s class...</li>
            <li> I was pretty happy with that shave, and thought that once my neck, and particularly my adams apple got used to it, this thing would be awesome.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a good looking tool (always important).  </li>
            <li> and this is the best so far).</li>
            <li> but so far so good!!  </li>
            <li> and it is by far the best shaver I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> still get an amazingly close shave and covers the more tricky areas (neck / chin)</li>
            <li> B000VKZMHK Panasonic ES8109S Vortex Wet/Dry Shaver with Nano Technology and HydraClean System]]This is by far the best shaver that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> For an electric shaver, this model was the best by far.  </li>
            <li> Nice to be able to wash/</li>
            <li> So far I am very, very happy.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor about a month ago and it is by far the best razor I&#x27;ve ever come across.</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned, the Panasonic ES8109S Vortex is the best of the lot.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shaver EVER!   </li>
            <li> but it is by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned -- if you&#x27;re judging based on the process of shaving and the end</li>
            <li> My best purchase of 2012 so far.</li>
            <li> OK, so I have decided to stop being a review parasite (I often look to reviews to help me in buying decisions, but don&#x27;t write my own review).  </li>
            <li> Given the results of the shave so far, I am thoroughly impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for over 20 years, both linear and rotary, and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best electric shaver I have used from the quality of shave I get from it.  </li>
            <li> So far so good!!!</li>
            <li> I can honestly say it&#x27;s a better shaver.  </li>
            <li> I read about it being a comfortable good shave.</li>
            <li> the travel shaver from Braun (as close shaving capability) and the best so far from everything I tried.</li>
            <li> The best part is the complete lack of irritation.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best system I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Never been more satisfied with any purchase I have ever made (and am very glad I didn&#x27;t spend $200 plus on a Braun)</li>
            <li> : The integrated trimmer is the best I have seen - it is stronger than the Braun and Norelco and also very well positioned to easily reach your face.</li>
            <li> In a sense, he was right; the shaver got the job done, but I now know that it takes a truly great product to get the job done WELL.  </li>
            <li> great right?</li>
            <li> i am convinced that it delivers a much closer shave while being more comfortable and economical - so its a win / win / win every which way.</li>
            <li> The cutters and head, original to the shaver, were still providing good service.  </li>
            <li> Great shaver, cuts close and easy to keep clean even without the hydraclean system.  </li>
            <li> He looks good, looks clean shaven, and we&#x27;ve heard no complaints.</li>
            <li> The shave is good if the shaver is kept clean.</li>
            <li> I switched from razor blade to this electric razor and experienced no discomfort even the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> Worked great until the cleaner stopped draining after I replaced the cartridge the first time.</li>
            <li> I used it when I shaved my head for the first time and it worked great.    </li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for about 3 months and am pretty happy with the performance.</li>
            <li> As a first time user of an electric razor, I am so happy with my choice.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver, clean it with water, since its wet/dry and it does result in a smooth shave on your skin.</li>
            <li> The charge indicator is now in percent and is very accurate--</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable to shave with gel/cream.</li>
            <li> I like to use some baby powder on the face to help make it a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> He had a very old Norelco that just wasn&#x27;t doing a very good job anymore.</li>
            <li> (I refuse to buy the Braun Pulsonic since they feel very cheap in the hand, in my opinion, and have integrated blades/shaver screens that cannot be cleaned out with a brush.)  </li>
            <li> I also use this to keep my head shaved and it does a very smooth job of that as well.  </li>
            <li> Very smooth shave and ease of use.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the floating head, as it makes it very comfortable and equalizes pressure.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very comfortable razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the end though, a good post shave lotion can take care of that quickly.  </li>
            <li> To be honest it was good for the first 3 months and after that....</li>
            <li> a good quick shave.</li>
            <li> Therefore, it took some really positive reviews and a great Amazon price to tempt me into this one.</li>
            <li> So far the results are very good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far the results are very good.  </li>
            <li> Applying more pressure causes a pain on the skin.</li>
            <li> so I used that brand of shaver for many years.  </li>
            <li> but the point I am making is that you should get the best pre electric shave lotion (not foam) you can (avoid the drug store stuff if possible).  </li>
            <li> About a month ago,I told my wife that I was going to try one more electric razor.</li>
            <li> the electronics companies might hawk as the latest thing might not translate into a better shave.    </li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> so I can so for sure I am a convert.</li>
            <li> I have used many electric shavers over the years, even Braun for my head and face.</li>
            <li> You cannot get any closer than this shaver for a nice smooth shinny head.</li>
            <li> I read reviews, researched and found many men recommend this Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I used it every day for three weeks and the results did not get better.</li>
            <li> After a year, I am reasonably pleased with the performance.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve all heard the claims of a closer shave from so many razor manufactures that it doesn&#x27;t phase us any longer.</li>
            <li> love the self-cleaning system of the razor, and the fact that it also dries the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> because most of the time it takes a degree in engineering to set things up.  </li>
            <li> It also means I can&#x27;t get away with a crappy shave, it makes the Joe Dirt effect much more pronounced.    </li>
            <li> I thought there could be a better way, without lathering up and forgetting to pick up more razors when I run out.    </li>
            <li> Lesson one, use this for one or maybe two days&#x27; growth at most (for me, your mileage may vary).</li>
            <li> This is certainly a more flexible and forgiving arrangement.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been many years since I used an electric shaver, but I can still remember the irritation of the skin that I endured.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor and am totally satisfied with how it shaves.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone who is looking for a great electric shaver at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I use to be able to shave in a couple of mins, now it takes about 10 mins.</li>
            <li> We are both extremely satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d have the winning combo nailed.  </li>
            <li> Still not \\&quot;AS CLOSE AS A BLADE WITHOUT THE IRRITATION!!\\&quot; like so many of these companies claim.      </li>
            <li> Cheaper than buying tons of blades, but more irritation if you aren&#x27;t used to electrics.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco&#x27;s all my life and they&#x27;ve done the job, but I&#x27;ve always thought they could do a bit better.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see how you can do better than this shaver.</li>
            <li> I used to have Braun and Philips Norelco shavers and I decided to upgrade to a better one.</li>
            <li> I am glad to report that it passed the test with flying colors.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with the Panasonic ES8109S Wet/Dry Shaver.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten chafed by having to run the shaver over stubbly areas too  many times; But at the price this unit is more than satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Glad I did.</li>
            <li> The nono technology are phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I feel its better than shaving with a Mach3 .</li>
            <li> However, one has to run the shaver over the neck more than once to reach the contour areas.</li>
            <li> Braun didn&#x27;t even come close, no matter how many passes you made.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now tell me how many shavers can you buy that does all this for under $100 (2007 Dec price on Amazon)</li>
            <li> I bought this razor and have been COMPLETELY satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> I have used this razor for about a month now and it is nothing short of awesome!</li>
            <li> I am totally pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> maybe even more so...</li>
            <li> but I think that is more my fault then</li>
            <li> I love mine, I think you will too.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product.</li>
            <li> This shaver is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Once I got this, I was glad to get rid of them.</li>
            <li> Make sure moisturizer is non-comedogenic.    </li>
            <li> I love this product and would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Like most guys, I don&#x27;t like shaving, but I like a clean-shaven face.</li>
            <li> I love Panasonic shavers, this one is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read many reviews about the Panasonic ES8109S Vortex Wet/Dry Shaver with Nano Technology and HydraClean System and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Most of them I have to get used to.</li>
            <li> Most tellingly, i have not used my fusion razor in two weeks....</li>
            <li> The cleaner cratridges are much better thought out as well, you supply the water and it supplies the cleaner.</li>
            <li> I have tried many electric shavers, but I thought I would try 1 more.</li>
            <li> Although this one did better than any of the others I have had, it still doesn&#x27;t do the neck area</li>
            <li> He told us to \\&quot;get a better razer\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> It does a better job</li>
            <li> I just space out my chargings cleanings a bit more.</li>
            <li> but still a much better job than the Philips (I guess you could say that for most razors).</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better razor.  </li>
            <li> I love the speed and convenience of an electric razor, but love the closer shave of a bladed razor.</li>
            <li> It also seems that every electric razor I buy doesn&#x27;t shave well for more than about a year, despite upkeep and blade/foil replacements.</li>
            <li> After a heart attack he was put on many blood thinners</li>
            <li> He has tried MANY electric shavers over his 71 years.....</li>
            <li> It works OK for me</li>
            <li> The manual blade worked best (as almost anyone would attest), and the two automatic shavers seem to provide the same closeness/comfort.    </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> but this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> They keep getting better, this one being no exception.  </li>
            <li> So, I tried an electric one more time.</li>
            <li> His face is baby&#x27;s bottom smooth!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go more than 7-8 days and it needs a charge &amp; cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Better than I could have hoped.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.</li>
            <li> I did quite a bit of research before purchasing, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shaver a week ago and love it.</li>
            <li> It is so much better than anything I tried under $125 that is belongs in a class by itself.</li>
            <li> and they love it and use it all the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone with the top of the line Braun&#x27;s, Philips Norelco&#x27;s, and</li>
            <li> I love how the charge lasts for days if I&#x27;m traveling.  </li>
            <li> but again, its doing the job for the most part.  </li>
            <li> After reading many reviews, I purchased the Panasonic Vortex.</li>
            <li> I must say that I am quite pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> for my favorite electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can safely say that I have never had a better shave in my life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased as punch with this razor.</li>
            <li> I am mostly a blade guy and have been dissappointed with electrics over the years but decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li> I had more than a bit of skepticism about how it would perform on my face.  </li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for about a month now and am pleased with the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li> I wash my face AFTER shaving to make sure I don&#x27;t get any ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I am extrememly pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is able to trim anything but peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I love Amazon reviews.      </li>
            <li> But after reading I didn&#x27;t think $200 was going to get me any more than $100.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it in the shower since I&#x27;d be sure to lose a sideburn without a mirror.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to get a fogless mirror</li>
            <li> If you have a prominent Adam&#x27;s apple, you may be better off with a blade razor.  </li>
            <li> I have visited many shaving forums and message boards over the years.  </li>
            <li> I have visited many shaving forums and message boards over the years.  </li>
            <li> Having said that, I love this one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for just under a month and love it.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I have had many electric razors throgh the years</li>
            <li> and I really love this one.</li>
            <li> I am totally in love with this.  </li>
            <li> so unless you&#x27;re sure this razor will work for you, I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> But I decided it was time to replace it and bought what I thought would be the latest upgrade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it works if you want to shave in the shower;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many electric razors before.</li>
            <li> The bottom line is that this shaver is the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric shaver - meaningfully closer on my face than even the Bruan.  </li>
            <li> I have owned the a couple Norelcos including their \\&quot;top of the line\\&quot;</li>
            <li> within 3 months I was looking for something better.    </li>
            <li> This thing shaves incredibly close, very sleek and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> This is the best overall electric razor I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> but, they were more concerned about profits in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> To the best of my knowledge, the only way the Braun dries the shaver is with a heating element.  </li>
            <li> The cleaner function looks interesting but I have not used it yet.</li>
            <li> I could write a lot about the razor but let be simplify it to say, it does not irritate my face any more than my Gillette Mach 5 razor and it cuts as close.  </li>
            <li> There is a \\&quot;break in period\\&quot; which I would attribute to learning how to shave with an electric razor more than your face learning how to be shaved.  </li>
            <li> , I thought it might get better after a couple of weeks, but it HASN&#x27;T</li>
            <li> Get this Panasonic and enjoy what shaving is suppose to be like!</li>
            <li> I tried the Braun last year for a week; also a very impressive shaver.  </li>
            <li> Vortex wet/dry are outstanding.</li>
            <li> meh, could be designed better.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a month now and really love it.  </li>
            <li> I have been using electric razors for about 25 years and for many of those years preferred the Norelco triple head razor line as it did not pinch like the foil shaver of those days did.</li>
            <li> This razor is better in every way than it&#x27;s predecessor.</li>
            <li> but I intend to try one more time before returning the it.</li>
            <li> You will love it just like I do.</li>
            <li> (I think it is more efficient than the induction charger).</li>
            <li> and it gave a better shave.  </li>
            <li> So I did what most men do</li>
            <li> Switched from rotary to foil with this razor and am highly satisfied in all regards: speed, closeness, skin comfort, even cleaning.</li>
            <li> When I do use a razor I get razor burn, and that does not happen with this shaver, or most shavers for that matter, and neither do the ingrown whiskers.    </li>
            <li> So I switched, and am glad I did.</li>
            <li> But I have come to love the Panasonic shavers over the years.  </li>
            <li> My $20 airport shaver does a better job.  </li>
            <li> shaves okay</li>
            <li> used panasonic electric razors for many years, this one is more of a toy than a mans grooming tool .  </li>
            <li> I love the quality, and I love the speed in which it was delivered.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for almost 3 years and just thought I would share how much I love it.  </li>
            <li> He said it was better than anything his father had and his dad has one of those top notch Braun razors.</li>
            <li> He said it was perfect around the next and jaw area and there was no pinching or tearing out of the hair.</li>
            <li> There were so many times</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m glad I bought that unit.  </li>
            <li> After many hours of research I thought I wanted another Braun...</li>
            <li> their top of the line Pulsonic model.</li>
            <li> The top of the line Braun can be rinsed under water but not used \\&quot;wet\\&quot; or with creams or lotions.</li>
            <li> I was hoping they could have supplied a better case to hold the cord and shaver for extended trips.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure there will be plenty of room in there for a cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since purchasing, this razor still continues to be my favorite.</li>
            <li> The results are better.</li>
            <li> And to top it off, you&#x27;re looking at a cheaper upkeep than blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for over a month now and am extrememly satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> &quot; that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
            <li> I love the complaints about the noise it makes.  </li>
            <li> So glad I got it.  </li>
            <li> So glad I got it.  </li>
            <li> Too many nitpickers around here complaining about stuff that doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> are gripping it</li>
            <li> But.... in last 2 months, I am getting the best shave ever!</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> Most electric razors cut up my neck</li>
            <li> but this one does awesome especially in the shower,</li>
            <li> Glad I have it.  </li>
            <li> Any suggestions are welcome, as I really don&#x27;t want to return it.</li>
            <li> I am now debating whether to give this shaver one more try by replacing the blades or try a Braun 360 instead.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to get a close shave at all.  </li>
            <li> So I decided to try a foil shaver and see if it worked any better.</li>
            <li> Another great razor from Panasonic -- highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied it.</li>
            <li> I suppose this is proof that shavers cannot \\&quot;lift\\&quot; hairs to cut better.</li>
            <li> I used this rotary-type of shaver for many years during the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I also love being able to shave in the shower again (</li>
            <li> Speaking of charging it does come with one of the fancy smancy self cleaner&#x27;s &#x27;ala&#x27; more profit for Panasonic on accessories(need&#x27;s cartridges).    </li>
            <li> The upside of the ES8109 is that is does to a better job at getting neck hairs, but still has yet to impress me.</li>
            <li> I reinserted the cleaner cartridge to see if I could get more out of it but ran into a couple problems.</li>
            <li> and he is pleased that it does not irritate his face.</li>
            <li> Perhaps any electric shaver would be better than what I was doing.  </li>
            <li> They have the most thorough reviews for these types of products on the web.</li>
            <li> DO I NEED TO SAY MORE?</li>
            <li> did a much better job.  </li>
            <li> I love the close shave I can get with this shaver.</li>
            <li> As is it turned out he tried it for 10 days and it would not make it better.  </li>
            <li> It felt as smooth as a babies face!</li>
            <li> I prefer not to use the pivoting head, so I&#x27;m glad that it can be locked in place.    </li>
            <li> It made an excellent christmas present this year.</li>
            <li> SMOOTH as a baby&#x27;s bottom!   </li>
            <li> I read many reviews on electric razors</li>
            <li> Glad I did.</li>
            <li> For every day use, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Overall Great Buy !</li>
            <li> I can shave for many days in a row without irritation.</li>
            <li> After using Braun shavers for many years, and being satisfied, I just thought I&#x27;d give a Panasonic</li>
            <li> Within about 6wks of buying it, the battery began to not hold a charge more than 5-6 minutes total...and after about 3 more weeks, it just would not come on at all...</li>
            <li> , I love it...</li>
            <li> the hydraclean system :)</li>
            <li> This thing has no problem with longer growth, just takes a couple more minutes.  </li>
            <li> It seems to give me a better shave than the Braun.  </li>
            <li> far I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality of this razor and the comfortable shave it provided.  </li>
            <li> Now one thing that took the longest to get used to was figuring out which way the hair grows out of my face, razors where much more forgiving in that sense</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t think you can get a better shaver for the price.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for the low cost.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am a convert to the electric, I might have to shave more often but the relieve of the pain is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Started using this shaver for over a month and love it.</li>
            <li> and I never could seem to get all the hair no matter how many passes I made.  </li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ll be able to shave every day.  </li>
            <li> You can run it deeper and more if you want to get the closest shave and it will not irritate you.  </li>
            <li> And shaving 2 days in a row is no longer a dreaded experience, it is actually okay.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m saving that 5 stars for a magic wand that I can just wave over my beard and it disappears.</li>
            <li> The shave quality on this Panasonic is WAY better than the Braun.  </li>
            <li> for the most part it does what it should.  </li>
            <li> Also be sure not to pour water in the cleaning unit.</li>
            <li> I shave my head as well as my face, and this linear Panasonic shavers  are a favorite among the cue-ball set.</li>
            <li> And the clippings in the razor or more like dust   than bits of whiskers.</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t always pleased with the finished result of these electric shavers.</li>
            <li> I told myself that someday I would invest the money for a better model.</li>
            <li> I shave every day and shave is definitely better than my Braun model.  </li>
            <li> It does well around my ears and sideburns, and my neck, better than a blade.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with it</li>
            <li> Without exaggeration, it gives me the closest shave ever, and I&#x27;ve been using the top of the line electrics from Norleco and Braun for over 20 years.</li>
            <li> Also, one more tip regarding the cleaning cartridges in the Vortex cleaning system - you DON&#x27;T HAVE TO replace the cleaning solution at the manufacturer recommended interval.</li>
            <li> but I do love the Lithium-Ion battery technology.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dropped more than one slippery shaver in the shower over the years.</li>
            <li> And, of course, it could work in the shower, with my favorite shaving cream, or without.    </li>
            <li> I did NOT buy it because of the money, I was prepared to buy the one advertised and $70 more.  </li>
            <li> I believe you will be pleased.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Panasonic wet/dry shaver user for many years and they keep getting better.</li>
            <li> More like 1 or 2 cleanings</li>
            <li> I do like this better than the Wahl shavers though.  </li>
            <li> After extensive research, looking for \\&quot;the best electric shaver\\&quot; as a gift for my husband, I confidently settled on Panasonic&#x27;s ES8228.</li>
            <li> I bought it after comparing many brands and model #&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> The 8019 is awesome - closer shave, longer lasting battery (almost 2.5 weeks!)</li>
            <li> like I need one more thing to clutter my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I willl never be as satisfied as I was with the blade.</li>
            <li> it was because he was going to ask for it for Christmas :).</li>
            <li> ENJOY!</li>
            <li> and I feel pleased with my decision to go for this.</li>
            <li> It gives nice smooth and close shave&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wet/dry function is nice, I&#x27;ve found that I tend to get really good results by shaving with it in the shower, but the hassle-free ability to pop in and shave with it real quick before going out is also very convenient.     </li>
            <li> I was delighted to hear this as I put a lot of effort in getting him the right product.  </li>
            <li> Loved my first Braun but wasn&#x27;t as impressed with the second.  </li>
            <li> So...I bought this Panasonic ES8109S and after using it a few times to perfect my technique and learning what the shaver can do and how it does it, all I can say is I&#x27;m VERY satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> It gives a nice, clean, close cut.</li>
            <li> First, it feels so good in the hand--built like a tank, stylish, and effortless to hold and manipulate.</li>
            <li> - just clean it yourself with some warm water and rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> It did give me nice clean shave on the sides of the face.</li>
            <li> I figured for the price, it better be pretty darn good - $90 (on sale)</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> The price for the Panasonic has always been fairly high but this is a great deal and</li>
            <li> Very fast, gets neck hairs good and cuts close.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning function works great and keeps the blades in much better condition for like new shaves everytime.  </li>
            <li> Also, the HydraClean System keeps the shaver very clean and hygienic.</li>
            <li> It is now very clean.</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s great to have an indicator light to tell you something is charging, or that it is fully charged, or that there is some kind of problem that requires an action.</li>
            <li> The shavers also work great for normal perpendicular hair.</li>
            <li> Best decision I have made in a long time.</li>
            <li> The cleaning system is pretty good too.  </li>
            <li> I have been a life long electric shaver user like my father and grandfather and can say this is the best one I have owned.  </li>
            <li> and i have to say it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> It even works pretty good on the neck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a first impression and it is a good one.</li>
            <li> I had always thought of trying the Panasonic as they&#x27;re products are usually pretty good from my experience.  </li>
            <li> Battery life is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty good electric razor.  </li>
            <li> The shaver has pretty good battery life, I can get about three shaves before wanting to recharge.  </li>
            <li> To preface, this shaver is the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve used in probably a good decade.</li>
            <li> Good quality item, sent fast by Amazon!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quieter than my old one and works beautifully.  </li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re not climbing Everest for your next vacation and staying away from a power outlet more than 10 days this is a very good shaver.</li>
            <li> A COUPLE DAYS WORTH OF STUBBLE!!</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money!!</li>
            <li> My face experienced zero irritation as a result of switching to this new razor.  </li>
            <li> Despite this shortcoming I keep buying a new one each year because the shave is so great.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning system works great and the shaver looks new every time.  </li>
            <li> but it has worked great and gives a great shave in shorter time than a messy blade and shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> buying a good razor is important and worth the money over the years of service you would expect from the razor....</li>
            <li> Best results on dry face, with the grain.</li>
            <li> Another thing I liked is that the Panosonic charged quickly</li>
            <li> I love the pivoting head that adjusts easily to the countours of my face.</li>
            <li> The Braun does provide a head that does seem to catch more hairs easily, but the sharpness of these blades, and the closeness of the shave, just about make it even in terms of shave time and hairs cut.</li>
            <li> electric shaver works best on a dry face.  </li>
            <li> The battery life isn&#x27;t quite as good as I&#x27;d like, but it&#x27;s good enough for 1.5 weeks on the road.  </li>
            <li> It makes you have a good feeling to receive such a good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to clean up under the faucet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the Braun is a fine razor</li>
            <li> It shaves good, battery life is great, and it does not irritate my face like some of the other ones.  </li>
            <li> It certainly has all the bells and whistles and makes for an excellent gift--I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> , it gives a clean perfect shave than traditional razors.</li>
            <li> Overall a very good electric razor.</li>
            <li> This is my third Panasonic over the years and all have been very good.</li>
            <li> overall a very good shaver.</li>
            <li> My husband is absolutely satisfied with the shavers ability to hold a long charge, its self cleaning performance, as well as the results of using it, as he obtains a very attractive clean shave.   </li>
            <li> Shaves as close as a blade and much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> This went much more smoothly - so things are looking up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver with the intention of getting the most comfortable shaver around.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable and I like being able to shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t change the cleaning cartridge until the light goes on--in contrast to the recommended changing which is much more frequent--and this seems to be working quite well.</li>
            <li> It has been nearly 30 years since I shaved with a foil razor and the technology has improved greatly.  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the purchase and not sorry I switched.</li>
            <li> I was buying them off of Ebay for way cheap and way more.</li>
            <li> Have had this since xmas and so far, it is a great shaver.  </li>
            <li> It is the most comfortable of the three.  </li>
            <li> this is my first electric razor and i am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion it does its best as a wet shaver.</li>
            <li> But what is more important then stability...does it work?</li>
            <li> Great razor even at the retail price but look for it to go on sale which it frequently does.</li>
            <li> Put the Remington blades and cutter (keeping the center blade of the Panasonic) on a Panasonic 13,000 RPM shaver and you would have the World&#x27;s best electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I think it does a great job of shaving closely and taking care of his sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but so far it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the es8109s so far.</li>
            <li> I had tried electric razors early on (15 years ago) and wasn&#x27;t happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> I have learned that using a electric razor it is more important that shave every day instead on leaving my beard over the days I don&#x27;t need to shave.</li>
            <li> With six years of shaving with it,it was becoming useless,so I thought I would try the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I spent $110 dollars and my biggest regret is that i did not return it for the 30 day guarantee (I guess at the time I thought thats the best you can get out of a shaver).</li>
            <li> Not only that, but the replacement foils for the Panasonic wore out with incredible frequency --</li>
            <li> This thing is incredible, no irritation  immediately after shaving and no skin breakouts the next day.  </li>
            <li> The great thing about this razor is I don&#x27;t get near the razor</li>
            <li> It does old charge for a great amount of time</li>
            <li> Replacement blades, screens, and cleaning cartridges are fairly reasonable in price, so that is good.  </li>
            <li> Reasonably priced and does a good job.</li>
            <li> Nice colorful as advertiised?</li>
            <li> Easy to clean as it can be put under running water!  </li>
            <li> The blade design and motor speed make it very easy to shave smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> The price was better than the \\&quot;In store best price\\&quot; at the major retail stores, and the shipping was extremely fast.</li>
            <li> Most important, it is portable, easy to clean and shaves better than all the others I have used.   </li>
            <li> THIS RAZOR IS VERY NICE, AND I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT DEALS2U.COM, THESE PEOPLE ARE VERY CONSIDERATE, AND QUICK TO RESPOND IF THERE IS ANY PROBLEMS</li>
            <li> No I am not a paid endorser, I&#x27;m just excited that I found a better mousetrap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all the other shavers and after 2 months of use I like this one best.</li>
            <li> The best of all, I didn&#x27;t spend a fortune on it like some of the other ones are priced at.  </li>
            <li> I have owned other rechareable razors and this is the best one I have used.</li>
            <li> If my mind changes significantly after more use, I&#x27;ll edit my review.  </li>
            <li> This was COMPLETELY true!</li>
            <li> Shaving with the grain is a quick, easy and painless process however you don&#x27;t get anything resembling a close shave!</li>
            <li> It is rechargeable and the best part is that it can be charged while you are travelling other countries that have 220 volts instead of 110 volts that we have in USA.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> Clinique and Billy Jealousy, as well as Zihr, are all supposed to have great ones that provide excellent razor glide, although they are expensive, and I haven&#x27;t yet tried them.  </li>
            <li> The Hydra Clean feature is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> It works well in water and cleans easily.</li>
            <li> I ordered the shaver and received it very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> My husband bleeds easily.  </li>
            <li> he says that it gives a close shave &amp; is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> the cleaning was easy.</li>
            <li> easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I love the LED feature that tells you how charged it is, when you need to clean it, etc.     </li>
            <li> It is easy to use, cuts close, I&#x27;ve not had any razor burn issues.  </li>
            <li> And the Vortex&#x27;s cleaning system allows you to easily clean your shaver and make sure that it stays that way.</li>
            <li> Easy to use....</li>
            <li> the self cleaning system is easy, but you can just as easily run it under the faucet and 3) easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> The recharge is very quick.  </li>
            <li> Easily a five-star product.</li>
            <li> It maintains its charge for a number of shaves and can be easily cleaned manually, if you dont want to use the automated system.  </li>
            <li> The thing even charged very quickly.</li>
            <li> The 2 days of growth allows the shaver to capture the hairs much more easily and the gel helps give a comfortable, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> My preference, clean the shaver under water most days.  </li>
            <li> The razor is easy to use and versatile.  </li>
            <li> The pivoting head is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> but the documentation shows the razor can be easily cleaned with soup and water under the faucet.  </li>
            <li> While it did not provide as close of a shave as I hoped for, it did not irritate my face and cleanup was easy.  </li>
            <li> My husband likes everything that is easy for him</li>
            <li> a clean shave eventually irritated my skin leading to lots of razor bumps and then led to me not being able to shave for one week and having to remove a lot of ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> where easy it&#x27;s just the neck/</li>
            <li> well and cleaning is easy by just lowering it into the sink under water with it running.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to hear about the electric shaver that can shave clean in one pass</li>
            <li> Shaver itself is compact and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> Easy care razor.</li>
            <li> Convenient,  easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> And easy to recharge, too.</li>
            <li> As you can imagine, after 3+ years of using it the shaver itself has build up in places that aren&#x27;t easily able to clean.</li>
            <li> I have even been able to shave daily which makes my wife extremely happy.  </li>
            <li> The razor handles the sensitive neck area very well, and does an excellent job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Charger is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and place and go.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic gives a much better shave, is easy to clean and provides a week of shaving before it need recharging.</li>
            <li> There may be later more advance models offered by Panasonic but this model does a great job.  </li>
            <li> Battery is still going strong.</li>
            <li> Recommend it strongly.</li>
            <li> It has been going strong with no problems.</li>
            <li> Still using it and going strong.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor to men that want a good razor, but don&#x27;t want to spend $200.</li>
            <li> I liked it very much, so decided to get this one.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product if you are looking for a good shaver.</li>
            <li> That and the fact that I love different electronic gadgets and this thing fit the bill and sounded great, so I took the plunge.    </li>
            <li> It seemed to work fine and was easy to use.</li>
            <li> It apparently has and to a great degree!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial</li>
            <li> Liked it so much, I bought my brother one!</li>
            <li> It does a grand job once you&#x27;re used to it, and I can&#x27;t imagine going a full week without shaving again.</li>
            <li> The led that gives the remaining charge in 10% increments is also nice (and puts it in competition with higher priced competitors).  </li>
            <li> For the first month it is shaving quite nicely.</li>
            <li> I like my new razor alot its easy to use goes around the curves of my face easaly and does a good job.  </li>
            <li> It is hands down the best shaver that I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best electric shaver I ever have had.  </li>
            <li> I  used a Braun (the model in the cradle that cleans itself) for many years and liked it as well, but I like this Panasonic better -- and I like its smaller cradle and cleaning mechanism better.</li>
            <li> This razor is AWESOME (as far as electric razors go) and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> One other thing, I&#x27;ve found that the cheap shaving soap available in the grocery store works best.</li>
            <li> For added measure and the price of new blades and foil, I found a really good deal on the ES8228S shaver.</li>
            <li> However, I kept buying new ones because they either broke, shave quality wasn&#x27;t good, etc.  </li>
            <li> Paid $150 to Good as New Electronics for this shaver which died after a year.</li>
            <li> I was comparing the Braun Pulsonic and this particular model and made the right choice as the ES8109 is working great</li>
            <li> Another huge improvement over the Braun system is that if I feel like just charging and not cleaning my razor I can do that easily.  </li>
            <li> I used it for the first time yesterday and was very very happy with how close of a shave that it actually got.  </li>
            <li> It did a fine job on my face.  </li>
            <li> My skin DOES seem to be adjusting, but it seems to be extremely important that you first have the razor cleaned, as the shaving solution also acts as a kind of lubricant, or so it seems.  </li>
            <li> My neck is shaved just fine</li>
            <li> But a friend compelled me try it by arguing that the self cleaning feature made for a better and more consistent shave.  </li>
            <li> just fine.</li>
            <li> The shaver charges quickly, is comfortable to hold, glides easily over your skin and cleaning</li>
            <li> The motor seemed to be performing fine though</li>
            <li> In the shower or out, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> As the title says, the razor is fine, the cleaning system s**ks.</li>
            <li> I use an inexpensive electric pre-shave and that works just fine.</li>
            <li> The shaver is light and easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> The ergonomics are fine for me.  </li>
            <li> It is cordless and the battery works just fine.</li>
            <li> I have no doubt that the Panasonic ES8109S Vortex Wet/Dry Shaver with Nano Technology and HydraClean System is a fine product</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S FINE.  </li>
            <li> Battery life is fine.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to charge, easy to clean,</li>
            <li> He then realized it was working fine</li>
            <li> I just used the cleaner setup tonight and it did a fine job.  </li>
            <li> and I think using this setup just a couple times a week will be fine.    </li>
            <li> Shirt collars don&#x27;t cause discomfort because the skin feels fine.</li>
            <li> Still works fine as a shaver.</li>
            <li> Razor line just fine with that,</li>
            <li> The best part about it is that the cleaning catridges cost about half of what they did for the Braun</li>
            <li> So far, I have been pleasantly surprized by the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I needed a quick razor to get most of the hair before I had to head out to work.    </li>
            <li> Just a super razor for the money!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t very good to begin with and at the time we really couldn&#x27;t afford to put a lot of money into a new quality one.</li>
            <li> I had a really good experience with this seller, he is very professional and i received my item in prompt time</li>
            <li> If you are a simple guy looking for a decent shaver at a good price, you can find just as good or better at a lower price.  </li>
            <li> For as good a job as this thing does, I wouldn&#x27;t care if it was as loud as my lawnmower!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean (with the cleaning solution OR with soap and water).  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;ve had a rather pleasant and refreshing experience with the shaver.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Also, the money you spend trying to find the right kind of pre shave, during the shave, and after shave lotions could add up quickly.    </li>
            <li> (It worked fine out of the box, but replacement blades never seem to be near as good).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this shaver and highly recommend it to anyone shopping for a quality electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Very good quality as expected from Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> This means I have to be clean shaven, but I don&#x27;t want to shower first because I will get sweaty and have to shower anyway, which makes softening the coarse whiskers a dubious process at best because I am drowsy and in a hurry.</li>
            <li> It provides a shave that is far superior to my Norelco rotary but still cannot provide a perfect shave on my neck; I need a little touch up after I am out of the shower in front of the mirror.</li>
            <li> This one does a very average job, at best, providing a close shave.</li>
            <li> Now before you put in a new cartridge I use some dial soap and water in the cleaner chamber to clean it good...</li>
            <li> This is my second panasonic vortex and the smooth shave I receive is great.</li>
            <li> Being able to use it wet is a great feature -</li>
            <li> The LCD display is neat and gives an accurate measurement of the battery life remaining in which I start to charge it around 10%.</li>
            <li> That is so huge.</li>
            <li> The claims are 100% accurate.</li>
            <li> is a huge improvement over the Braun system.  </li>
            <li> Lab Series is great and has very low odor.  </li>
            <li> Remember, God created a few beautiful heads, the rest, he put hair on!</li>
            <li> This razor filled that request and went above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One problem with this unit and the  Panasonic ES8103S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade shaver is that it has a light that flashes after its charged so you cannot keep it plugged in all the time.</li>
            <li> Despite this, my face feels smooth as velvet after use, despite some irritation.  </li>
            <li> After two light passes with it on my neck</li>
            <li> This Panasonic shaver has given me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had, very close and comfortable without having to go over the same area over and over again.  </li>
            <li> Still, I liked it so much I bought another.  </li>
            <li> I use a shave gel and it helps keep my face smooth and soothed after I shave.  </li>
            <li> I shave after I shower and with shaving cream and its a close comfortable shave every time.  </li>
            <li> Easy to maintain and clean.  </li>
            <li> This product is so easy and clean to use.</li>
            <li> and yes, it is extremely comfortable.</li>
            <li> got this Panasonic as a present and it has been great.</li>
            <li> It does require more passes to remove the hair, but well worth it for the comfort.</li>
            <li> Not only do I get dermatitis anymore, I feel great after shaving.</li>
            <li> For detailed cleaning I use the office supply cleaner air can used on the computers and so.</li>
            <li> Now I am happy after going back to electric.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and charge.</li>
            <li> Just the feel of the shaver was fantastic.</li>
            <li> I switched to this shaver after using a cheap $35 shaver for a while (and a manual one before that).    </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic razor.  </li>
            <li> So I looked at electric again figuring the technology had advanced</li>
            <li> It is at a cheap price.</li>
            <li> The cleaning system works great and the trimmer is an extra bonus.</li>
            <li> My shaves are both closer and faster and the shaver is so easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It is incredibly comfortable.</li>
            <li> Shaving has gone from a chore to a genuine pleasure.</li>
            <li> I love how it&#x27;s fun to use.  </li>
            <li> , how smooth my face feels after using it.    </li>
            <li> As mentioned, this is the closest shave currently available (February 2012).</li>
            <li> Sculpted to fit either hand.</li>
            <li> It charges it perfectly, but the Vortex cleaning system is a bit messy</li>
            <li> (I have had it leak) and smells a but sticky and cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so close that my skin is baby smooth</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it worth every penny.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> Shave is not as smooth as the phillips one.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;This shaver has given me the closest shave \\&quot;ever\\&quot; and my face feels so smooth even when feeling against the grain.</li>
            <li> Its comfortable to hold and</li>
            <li> Prior to that, I had a Panasonic that worked great</li>
            <li> Overall it was a great razor until the charger/cleaner died.</li>
            <li> I will probably just break the indicator light.</li>
            <li> Change the cleaning solution monthly, using purified water, not tap, and this shaver will provide months and months of smooth, close shaves.</li>
            <li> smooth face-</li>
            <li> It felt REALLY SMOOTH while shaving, no sensation of burn whatsoever.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on the skin, but cuts close and the cleaning system is nice to have.(I almost didn&#x27;t get</li>
            <li> Smooth, so smooth.</li>
            <li> - You can take it in the shower &amp; its easy to wash and clean.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re an intelligent shopper you&#x27;re doing some research comparing different shavers and brands.  </li>
            <li> Overall a great product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as close as a blade shave, but it&#x27;s mighty darn close.  </li>
            <li> and I have a light to medium beard.  </li>
            <li> It gives a close, smooth and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> If you notice after the cleaning cycle is over, take the foil off and look at the blades in the light.  </li>
            <li> Easy to wash and clean.</li>
            <li> Before this shaver I used  Remington 304&#x27;s for years and was quite happy with them, but their quality and durability seemed to go downhill over the last three of them I wore out.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li> read that the sound can be</li>
            <li> The ability to use it with lather makes it fantastic.  </li>
            <li> - I can feel my skin against the direction of my beard and it feels smooth.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning portion of this system works great but the actual shaver is garbage.  </li>
            <li> Cheap razors were terrable</li>
            <li> I have been happily using it daily for almost 4 years.</li>
            <li> almost enjoy shaving.</li>
            <li> A few passes, perfect.      </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> The detergent packs are cheap ($15 for a set of 3, each one lasts a month), and you need to replace the foil (once a year, with the blades once every two years</li>
            <li> Not annoyingly so,</li>
            <li> The shave is close and smooth.  </li>
            <li> And smooth.  </li>
            <li> It goes through my face hair w/ out shuddering and leaves my face smooth.  </li>
            <li> You can wait till the light comes on and then change it.    </li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a great buy</li>
            <li> a cheap rotary non-cordless Norelco, a Braun 6520 and now this one.  </li>
            <li> I took advantage of free shipping and my shaver arrived sooner than the estimated date.    </li>
            <li> It gave a great shave, held a charge for a couple of weeks, and quietly hummed when operating.  </li>
            <li> I will say that I love using shaving cream again, and it is worth the miniscule difference that may occur in closeness.  </li>
            <li> My face never felt so smooth.  </li>
            <li> I went back to the shave oil again, and voila, another great shave.</li>
            <li> so i couldn&#x27;t really give it a honest review.      </li>
            <li> I have an advanced engineering degree and it still took me an inordinate amount to time to figure out what the hell they were talking about.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t cheap and now I have to go looking for another one. :</li>
            <li> (my job requires a face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s caboose).  </li>
            <li> When I finished, my skin was smooth and I could not feel any stubble at all.  </li>
            <li> It gives a smooth shave too.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Now remember I only bought this to shave my goatee and it did a great job.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s it,this Panasonic shaves as smooth as a Fusion.</li>
            <li> an amazing 13,000rpms which is fast for an electric razor</li>
            <li> Easy to use, clean and store.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this Panasonic.</li>
            <li> The shaver is comfortable to hold and can reach all areas of face and neck.  </li>
            <li> , it wasn&#x27;t cheap</li>
            <li> I can pull off a razor smooth finish on my head and face with this shaver</li>
            <li> It shaves close and smooth.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor as a replacement for another Panasonic model that I was only marginally happy with.  </li>
            <li> and overall think it is a great electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> Ok, so this is my third Panasonic wet/dry shaver in about 5 years and, by far, this one is the best one yet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The head \\&quot;floats\\&quot;, or can be locked in place, similar to a shock absorber - a great feature.  </li>
            <li> We were only going to be there 3 days, however the SeaTac airport snow closure resulted in our being stranded for 9 days before we could fly home.  </li>
            <li> As I shopped around for the best deal, I came across Panasonic&#x27;s ES8109S on Amazon, at a much lower price PLUS an instant rebate PLUS free shipping.</li>
            <li> Buy it and enjoy.</li>
            <li> My husband felt like it would work the same, and if not, well he would be happy to oblige and use it himself.  </li>
            <li> everyone I do shows with want to know how I get such a great shave.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Comfortable shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li> which helps it to move smoothly over your skin.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this razor to be awesome and do what it said it does, but frankly it falls well short.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> After using this for several weeks I&#x27;ve discovered a shaving method that really takes advantage of this wonderful machine.    </li>
            <li> You can super easily clean this in the shower or under the faucet, however - just pull off the top foil and run it under running water.</li>
            <li> So far it seems like he gives him a good shave.  </li>
            <li> I had a Norelco electric shaver back in the 90&#x27;s and wasn&#x27;t really that impressed.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m really surprised how this item have that good reviews...</li>
            <li> The best part is when I am done, I just put it in the cleaner unit and it takes care of getting it ready for my next use.  </li>
            <li> Again the Panasonic clearly beats Braun 2, but the more aptly compared Braun 1 gives it a run for</li>
            <li> It still cannot get all of them and this is the biggest downfall on top of the OK quality shave, really nothing to brag about on this shaver.</li>
            <li> I had been using a Panasonic and LOVED my old razor, but it gave out on me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the process but this has been really good so far.</li>
            <li> but I am delighted with its performance so far.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Braun and norelco and this trimmer is unreal and far superior.  </li>
            <li> The customer comments that were submitted for this product were very positive and were in fact better</li>
            <li> Even though, the shave is still better than what i used to get shaving with Mach 3 - just not as good as the first month of shaving - i am thinking i will try putting a new blade - that may help -</li>
            <li> The original is still fine</li>
            <li> I always just rinse in the sink and it gets clean just fine.</li>
            <li> thanks Panasonic!!!</li>
            <li> Not only as good as using a blade, but much better and more consistent.</li>
            <li> The sideburn trimmer works acceptably, and the % charged display is very useful when anticipating the need to recharge.  </li>
            <li> No tugging at hairs at all, it&#x27;s quiet, and the auto clean works great.</li>
            <li> Just pop the head off under the tap(or in the shower) and presto nice and clean and ready to be used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous electric shavers, including the really excellent high end Braun shavers.</li>
            <li> I love the self cleaning system, it helps to keep the blades sharp and the drying feature is very nice.  </li>
            <li> Great quality, battery life, high speed motor and sharp blades make any Vortex Panasonic a good choice.</li>
            <li> The cleaning system is fantastic - used about every 3-4 days to clean the shaver.</li>
            <li> It really does work pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I have been satisfied with all of them, but buying this Vortex was the first time that purchase price was not my primary consideration.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Charging is quick and easy using the supplied cord.  </li>
            <li> Manual cleaning is quick and easy.     </li>
            <li> At this point I feel comfortable in recommending this razor based off of the shave I was able to get on the first use.</li>
            <li> He was thrilled when he got it, his older shaver was about 6 yrs.</li>
            <li> The razor head bends &amp; moves very easily to shave the curves of your face very well.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for much longer and is very easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> And the best thing also is that it clean&#x27;s itself and does not take a lot of bathroom counter space which is important in small bathrooms.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s the new electric razor guru, the next best thing to God.  </li>
            <li> Very good shaver lasts 2 weeks on a full charge using every other day.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and recharges quickly.  </li>
            <li> This was a good buy, maybe 250 bucks and 3 years later, still going strong.</li>
            <li> so far I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Panasonic did not disappointed me.  </li>
            <li> When it arrived I took it in a started to charge it, and one of the first things I noticed was that the cleaning solution was not combustible like the Braun and that made me feel a bit better.</li>
            <li> the charge lasts for two legs, but mine are short with course hair :^) if you have amazon women legs and</li>
            <li> Never thought I would be so excited over a shaver, but I am indead with this one.</li>
            <li> Well so far I have been very pleased.</li>
            <li> Panasonic is a great brand, and I expect a long life from this one.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Was not disappointed .After</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This product is eco friendly because you don&#x27;t have to keep throwing razors in the trash and wasting plastic etc.     </li>
            <li> It shaved me better than a blade the first time I used it with 5 days of beard.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I just got this thing around 2 months ago, and it was the first time in my life</li>
            <li> I was so excited...</li>
            <li> I read some other reviews that stated this was a good razor for reducing razor-burn, and they were correct!</li>
            <li> All in all I am very pleased with this product so far.</li>
            <li> It shaves more hairs on the first pass, the cream eliminates any friction, and gives me the closest shave yet with an electric (some areas of the face feel like I shaved with a blade).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> my dad is in his fifties and has a beard that can grow almost as long as santa claus, so i was happy for him.    </li>
            <li> The sideburn trimmer does a better job than the Norelco and operates at a higher trimming speed.  </li>
            <li> The unit restores the shaving head unit and screen to their original condition.  </li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric razor that I&#x27;ve purchased and been satisfied with.  </li>
            <li> This is my first foil shaver and after using it for about a month I am enjoying it.  </li>
            <li> Once he read all the instructions and became familiar with the shaver I don&#x27;t believe he would give it up.</li>
            <li> I bought this as my first electric shaver after borrowing and trying many others.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver I have purchased that cost more than $25.  </li>
            <li> have been very pleased with the performance so far.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> The shaver seemed of good quality, but the shave was only fair compared to my old Braun 7526.  </li>
            <li> This is the first razor that I have owned that has not pulled most of my beard out.</li>
            <li> I fell in love the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with my new Panasonic razor, it performs even better than the old one did when it was new.</li>
            <li> about 3 weeks very pleased so far, gives close shave east to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> My son, Jose, who is a Personal Trainer and has to look his best always, is absolutely in love with his new shaver and told me it was the BEST of all his shaves!!; even from his previous old model that was a Panasonic model also.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a clean shave</li>
            <li> I set it to clean</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll just keep it charged ahead of time and will put it in to clean when leaving for work in the AM.</li>
            <li> and it comes with a charging, and cleaning system, or you can clean it and charge it by hand and with the charging cord.</li>
            <li> This means you should always look clean shaven.</li>
            <li> when I send it home to clean up it still says 100%.    </li>
            <li> Clean shave with minimum effort.</li>
            <li> So I decided clean manually instead of using it.  </li>
            <li> My old norelco did this, and even the perfect gilette fusion nicked my neck every now and then at the adams apple, same spot this thing is having issues.  </li>
            <li> Factor in that you can use it dry or in the shower (which you can&#x27;t with a Braun), and the great price,</li>
            <li> Shaving during shower and the clean kit are the plus to the shaver.</li>
            <li> every time I clean the shaver.  </li>
            <li> and I never had to re-rinse or clean off the hairs</li>
            <li> I get an incredibly smoother shave and do it in half the time.</li>
            <li> and I could not get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> I prefer a clean shaved face over any type beard, even a two day weekend stub.</li>
            <li> It took just two passes on my scruffy face to clean it up.  </li>
            <li> Then, clean it with just soap and water every week or so.</li>
            <li> and I no longer could get a clean shave on my neck.</li>
            <li> Even the trimmer shaves you almost as clean as a blade shave.</li>
            <li> I have averaged using the clean system once a week.  </li>
            <li> and it got the shaving done quick and thorough, although it wasn&#x27;t nearly as comfortable as this Panasonic shaver.    </li>
            <li> You can clean it with soap and water, or you can use the cleaning stand.  </li>
            <li> The shave is so good that my face is smooth all throughout the next work day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> The razor comes out clean and recharged.  </li>
            <li> a month even when you don&#x27;t clean the blades every day&lt;</li>
            <li> Smooth quick shave.</li>
            <li> Rinses out so cleanly with just the faucet</li>
            <li> - It has a neat cleaner machine that will thoroughly clean the unit for you.  </li>
            <li> The shave is smooth and quick.</li>
            <li> This thing shaves so much better and closer and faster and quieter than the Braun, it&#x27;s like a completely different kind of product.  </li>
            <li> and I am amazed every time I use it at how clean the razor is when it finishes it&#x27;s cycle.</li>
            <li> The cleaning gets the blades cleaner and they smell soapy clean and not chemically clean.</li>
            <li> He is amazed with the clean shave he gets with his razor.</li>
            <li> Luckily  I realized Braun&#x27;s warranty is 2 years, not 1 as I had thought, so I got Braun 1 repaired for free</li>
            <li> Luckily I find that I get used to the sound</li>
            <li> You could argue it is a gimmic, since you can easily clean the razor under the sink faucet.</li>
            <li> The reviews for this model were so good, I trusted them as I trusted the reviews that were accurate about my last panasonic.</li>
            <li> I have to come in and clean up with a hand razor.</li>
            <li> And this razor does a clean and close shave that rivals the hand razors.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning system does take a while, but again you do not use this to clean every day.  </li>
            <li> I am also impressed with the HydraClean system as it is a big improvement from their old models.</li>
            <li> I decided to clean shave with a blade for a while and give my face a break.</li>
            <li> Now I know why I have not been shaving clean for all those years.</li>
            <li> It is noisy when you clean it, but I do it in the morning and then leave for work.</li>
            <li> I use it to clean up my neck, sideburns, ears, nose, and unruly eyebrows.    </li>
            <li> It is much heavier than it looks and the build quality is great (so far).  </li>
            <li> I can tell you, shaving dry is great.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic gives me a close clean shave.  </li>
            <li> My face feels like the shave was nearly as clean as a razor shave,</li>
            <li> You can use turbo mode to clean but</li>
            <li> I put it on clean and leave when I need the razor again</li>
            <li> But I believe anybody who complains that it doesn&#x27;t shave clean with 1 pass has just never used electric before.</li>
            <li> Even easier to clean and charge.  </li>
            <li> Just remove the foil cap and clean with tap water in between charging cycles.</li>
            <li> Then, when recharging, go through the clean process.</li>
            <li> One thing I always do is clean the unit after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> a month or sooner if needed you have to clean the cleaner.</li>
            <li> You will want to use bleach water it so it is clean and not smelly.</li>
            <li> It delivers a comfortable, clean, and quick shave.  </li>
            <li> This razor has a number of options, a number of ways to clean it, including  the self-cleaning/charging system (doing both at once).  </li>
            <li> This is my fourth Panasonic wet/dry shaver and so far it is the best.  </li>
            <li> The difference is, the Braun always seemed clean after a cleaning while the Panasonic did not.</li>
            <li> but the shaver feels/smells clean every time you run the cleaning</li>
            <li> I do wash it myself and use the stand to dry it, which works great.</li>
            <li> I guess that makes it easier to clean the foil?      </li>
            <li> Use Scrubbing Bubbles to clean the blades once in a while.</li>
            <li> If I need a clean shave I have to go over it with a razor.  </li>
            <li> Honestly I hardly clean it anymore and have NEVER changed the blade inside.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it in the shower or tried to clean it with hand soap........</li>
            <li> Over the years I have had several skin cancers removed from my face and head creating a surface that is none too pleasant to shave with a blade.</li>
            <li> It did give a good shave in some areas but most still felt rough.</li>
            <li> The razor itself is fantastic - close shave, very reasonable noise level, waterproof head assembly, easy to clean, etc.  </li>
            <li> Or, I could take this opportunity to purchase Panasonic&#x27;s latest offering, the Arc IV Nano Men&#x27;s Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaver, which I&#x27;ve scoped out and seen positive reviews of here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> With my very first shave I could tell a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> This is my 2nd Panasonic shaver and it&#x27;s just as good or better than the first.  </li>
            <li> I have always had a Braun shaver, but the Panasonic was much faster, quiet, great side burn trimmer and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The Panisonic Vortex was perfect for me it gives a nice close shave wet or dry and</li>
            <li> So far I have to say that this one is far superior!</li>
            <li> Whatever special shaving angle or cleaning technology</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a  Gillette razor user, but picked up this electric razor on an Amazon special just to give it a shot.    </li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t have anything special going on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll still use blades for touch up or special occasions.</li>
            <li> But, with the special, well, that was the tipping point, though how it worked and</li>
            <li> He was right!  </li>
            <li> He was RIGHT!</li>
            <li> when i finally do get a good shave with this, it is a clean, close shave, but it takes forever.  </li>
            <li> I get a nice clean shave with almost no irritation to my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It may not be the best razor on the market but for the money it&#x27;s hard to beat.</li>
            <li> I love Panasonic&#x27;s shavers because I like being able to shave in the shower with an electric shaver and a little glycerin based shaving foam (Gilette Series foam in the long silver tube works best for me and doesn&#x27;t gum up the shaver like gels do).</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this shaver has been truly amazing since the get-go.  </li>
            <li> My last shaver was the Braun 360, pretty much happy with it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean by holding under hot water from the facet, or by using the stand with a cleansing solution.  </li>
            <li> and it is great but shaving with it takes a while because you have to be careful not to cut yourself.</li>
            <li> The first few strokes and I was impressed with its performance.</li>
            <li> I would skip the higher end models with \\&quot;self cleaning,\\&quot; since this is so easy to clean, but that&#x27;s up to you.</li>
            <li> I would skip the higher end models with \\&quot;self cleaning,\\&quot; since this is so easy to clean, but that&#x27;s up to you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Norelco 8865 XL for several years now, and I was pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> I think it works great although it did not work that will wet.</li>
            <li> I imagine it may reduce the life of some components, but it&#x27;s cool as hell to have</li>
            <li> Lastly, get a really really good soothing after shave balm.  </li>
            <li> but I figured that was good enough for me.</li>
            <li> The ergonomics of this shaver is very well designed and better than my Braun.  </li>
            <li> you should be able to get a really close shave.    </li>
            <li> Never been satisfied with an electric shaver this much before.</li>
            <li> If you like electric razors you will love this one, but I guess I need to buy a straight razor or something.</li>
            <li> This razor cuts as good as any traditional razor.</li>
            <li> That was good enough for me.</li>
            <li> I spray two short burst of air and that&#x27;s good to go another month or two.  </li>
            <li> I saw only good things about it.</li>
            <li> But this was such a good deal that I decided to risk it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and makes a clean cut every time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros - Nice, classy design.  </li>
            <li> I really like this cleaning system better.</li>
            <li> so people in similar circumstances can get an idea of whether it&#x27;d be good for them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The only really good thing I can say is</li>
            <li> The reason for this is because no product ever will be good to use in a vast amount of water.</li>
            <li> Turns out the reviews are true.</li>
            <li> Overall I would say for the price, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> It has held up incredibly well during that time and heavy use, and the battery shows no sign of quitting.</li>
            <li> I have replaced the blades only once, as the cleaning/charging stand keeps the head in good</li>
            <li> Knowing what I know now, I probably wouldn&#x27;t pay full retail for this shaver.</li>
            <li> It got to the point that the batteries wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge and the shaver wasn&#x27;t running at full speed.  </li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to anyone who does not expect a shave as good as a regular blade.  </li>
            <li> When the shaver is at full charge it blinks all the time.  </li>
            <li> That could well be true.  </li>
            <li> So far, after 2 weeks of using it, I&#x27;m thrilled.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall a good product with a moderate price.</li>
            <li> so in my books, this is a true winner</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> and I liked that it had the self-cleaning system like my old Braun.</li>
            <li> My old Braun just had to be plopped into its stand and it figured out what it needed to do on its own.</li>
            <li> I recently started my year-long deployment to Afghanistan and wanted a good shaver that charged and cleaned.  </li>
            <li> It feels good to use and can run over areas several times without any burning,</li>
            <li> To go a step further; my wife even tried it on her legs and was exstatic about how good it done.  </li>
            <li> fast and prompt service had it in time for christmas and he enjoyed the gift  </li>
            <li> A full charge took about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve had 8109S for almost one full year now</li>
            <li> Better than any plastic shaver with 4-5 blades on a very stubborn beard.</li>
            <li> My husband also tried it, and he thought it was superior to any shavers he had used before, so I bought him one next.  </li>
            <li> I think the Norelco 3 blade does a better job, But the Panasonic is twice as fast.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8109S still gives me a good close shave after a year of use, even though I haven&#x27;t yet used the cleaning fluid..</li>
            <li> Their MUCH cheaper battery powered ES4815 is a better design</li>
            <li> Not a bad deal for the money.  </li>
            <li> but right now I&#x27;m happy I bought the razor as long as the noise isn&#x27;t bothering my neighbor.</li>
            <li> Mowed right thru the hair getting most in the first pass</li>
            <li> The clean system is hardly worth the effort - you do just as well holding the razor under a tap to clean it.  </li>
            <li> He insists on a super clean, super close shave.</li>
            <li> I loved my previous Panasonic Wet/Dry, but the ES8109S is substantially better.</li>
            <li> The Braun is an extremely high quality machine, shaves very fast, the battery is amazing,  and the trimmer is better than on this one, but the Panasonic beats it for closest shave (on my beard), and really cuts as close as a manual razor, but without the nicks and irritation of a manual shave.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for your first electric razor or a replacement, I strongly suggest you give this a try.  </li>
            <li> I got this one due to the fact that it&#x27;s a wet/dry shaver and shaving in the shower just seemed like a great idea.</li>
            <li> The shave is pretty good, especially for an electric, but does not compare to the MACH system I was using for quite sometime, or even cheap 3-blade disposable razors for that matter.</li>
            <li> When you first take it out of the box make sure you give it a FULL charge for the first time</li>
            <li> With the HydraClean system, the unit is kept clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Takes maybe 15 seconds and it&#x27;s clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> With the HydraClean system, the unit is kept clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> However when using a gel, it shaves super close, and can rub on the skin, which can lead to skin burns.</li>
            <li> The cleaning system works great though, although its a bit noisy but hey at least i can make it do that while i go to work, so I don&#x27;t have to listen to it :)    </li>
            <li> I logged onto Amazon and reviewed many different electric shavers, concidering many brands and price ranges.   </li>
            <li> So I am replacing an older model of the Panasonic Wet/Dry variety and I am again satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Shaver works super.</li>
            <li> This razor will quickly pay for itself.  </li>
            <li> It should pay for itself quickly, considering I was paying out the rear for replacement Quattro blades for my Schick.</li>
            <li> He was overwhelmed by the programming features (he&#x27;s not a detail person) but he quickly figured it out and plugged it in.  </li>
            <li> And most importantly, I love (and my girlfriend especially loves)</li>
            <li> Best results so far are using it wet with a gel-type shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Charges super quick.</li>
            <li> My guess is that different shavers will suit different beards/faces, and for some the Braun may be best.  </li>
            <li> I also like the clippers that it comes built-in with, allowing me trim my burns in one quick shot.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shaver as replacement of an older Panasonic with linear motor, and I am pleased with the shaver itself.</li>
            <li> The liquid on the blades is lubricant, and it will help tremendously to provide a smoother, closer shave as well as preserve the life of the blades.  </li>
            <li> I have light skin yet a fairly heavy beard, which suggests that this razor would be a great asset to virtually anyone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In conclusion, a great shaver with all the current technology and features offered by the competition at a reasonable asking</li>
            <li> Bottom line, it does the job adequately.</li>
            <li> I really looked forward to receiving this product and trying out simply based on all the great reviews it received.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very quiet, does a great job on the beard and holds a charge very well.  </li>
            <li> It charges quickly and holds a charge well.</li>
            <li> What you lose (for shaving your head) is a bit of width and flatness  that seemed to help make quick work of head-shaving.    </li>
            <li> The latest model is also quieter than the last model and has a more substantial feel to it while holding it.    </li>
            <li> We have tried several different shavers but this is the best one yet and&lt;br /&gt;it has a cleaning attachment.</li>
            <li> I have also used a blade between razor purchases, when the razors needed new parts and on special occasions just because it looks better.    </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for anyone, you will really love it.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this shaver and highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also had it 3 weeks and have not used up the first cleaning cartridge yet, and I clean it daily, so that seems to be good too.</li>
            <li> Once the hair adapts to new type of blade, shave is very smooth.</li>
            <li> I rinse my razor after ever use before I let the machine clean the razor, so my cartridge is pretty clean not tons of hair in the filter of the cartridge</li>
            <li> For the first 2 weeks it was shaving unbelievably smooth, but, the sharpness-smooth aspect has deminished somewhat noticeably.  </li>
            <li> It is more efficient and effective than any other shaver I have ever owned...</li>
            <li> The cleaning solution is pretty cheap on Amazon too (about $10 for a 3 month supply).    </li>
            <li> And the results left my face as smooth as if I had used shaving cream and a good straight razor.</li>
            <li> First off it took about two weeks of using it every day for my neck line to become accustomed to it(some irritation/red bumps) and after that it has been smooth sailing.  </li>
            <li> Some light hair still remained but its just the first shave.</li>
            <li> Panasonics have consistently had the highest motor speed available in any electric shaver.    </li>
            <li> the old fashioned way -- in the shower while my face was nice and wet (believe me you get a good shave that way).    </li>
            <li> The fancy technologies on this shaver are all cool and useful</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be aware that the auto clean feature uses a special cleaning cartridge that must be replaced after 30 cleaning cycles.</li>
            <li> This razor is fast, clean, and irritation free.  </li>
            <li> push a button and the next time you use it is nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Not having to clean it is a huge time saver, and it&#x27;s surprisingly gentle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experimented with other manufacturers&#x27; shavers over the years, including Brauns, Norelcos and Grundig shavers, but I&#x27;ve ultimately found nirvana, ok, not quite nirvana, but a most pleasant shaving experience with Panasonic shavers.  </li>
            <li> What convinced me to take the plunge and buy a new one was the fact that my travel remmington battery powered razor worked better than my Bruan.  </li>
            <li> I really love the new panasonic lineup.</li>
            <li> I just wanted a new, and potentially better, version of what I already had.</li>
            <li> and i learn a new pattern, this is getting better.    </li>
            <li> I will wait and see if it is the razor or the new blades that are doing a better job on my \\&quot;difficult\\&quot; spots.</li>
            <li> My husband told my father how satisfied he was with his new shaver, and loaned it to him to try.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, in spite of all the new bells and whistles, these expense razors don&#x27;t shave any better than their predecessors, regardless of brand.</li>
            <li> I get about 8 shaves from a full charge right now --</li>
            <li> Both the Braun and the Panasonic use a straight vibrating cutter, so switching is easy.</li>
            <li> Fast and easy.</li>
            <li> He wanted a wet/dry shaver but it works so good dry</li>
            <li> The Net makes pretty much everything easy to buy so why not do your research and spend money wisely?  </li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave very quickly.</li>
            <li> When used dry it was as good as a blade.</li>
            <li> It was very well designed, easy to grip and use.</li>
            <li> It takes about 10 minutes (no shaver will give you a first-pass close shave) to get to that good dry shave (with or without pre-electric gels/oils) and you do have to put pressure on to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> The cleaner is nice, although quite loud and pretty cheap-looking.</li>
            <li> Overall though, the performance of the shaver as well as the convenience and versatility make this still a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> I do not have much facial hair, so this model with 3 blades is pretty good to me.</li>
            <li> when used dry as good as any electric.  </li>
            <li> After reading several reviews and seeing that most of you were rating this razor at 4-5 stars, I bought it!</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s used different kinds of electric razors since they first started to be sold \\&quot;way back when\\&quot; and he says this is the best ever.  </li>
            <li> The Braun was a joke, would not cut a beard more than a day old, wouldn&#x27;t cut the long hairs at all, and never did a good job.  </li>
            <li> The only thing magical about 30 days is that you can no longer return it for a refund - what a coincidence!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the new shaver for about two weeks now with Neutrogena shave cream (low foam, great smell)</li>
            <li> Anyhow, after a quick review of the top of the line shavers from various manufacturers currently available (including the new Braun Pulsonic models), I opted to go for the latest offering from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Use shaving gel (not only does it give help the razor glide more easily, it lubricates the blades so that they won&#x27;t get damaged)    </li>
            <li> Weirdly enough, the best shave I&#x27;ve managed to get with this is shaving bone dry.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a few days, but it&#x27;s easily the best shave from an electric that I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I run the clean cycle after every use and the first cartridge is still in use after a month or so.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic is more suitable than other razors</li>
            <li> Instead of a large alcohol filled container you need to replace monthly</li>
            <li> It works great in the shower with a little soap.  </li>
            <li> The best part is that I can get to all the tough spots without accidentally drawing blood.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been very satisfied with any Panasonic products I&#x27;ve owned from phones, DVD players, to TV&#x27;s, so I was pleasantly surprised to see a Panasonic razor in the list of highly reviewed razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Later on I upgraded to a high end norelco shaver XL series and at first it seemed great with its 3 floating heads.</li>
            <li> I look forward to the next improvement on this shaver, but until then I am happy, I got it for less than $100., and if I change in even two years, I got more than my money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> it really gives you a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> This razor is very ergonomic and comfortable in hand.  </li>
            <li> My infection has cleared up, and this shaver is nothing short of amazing.  </li>
            <li> It provides a very close and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> Much like a cheap Reming^0n.  </li>
            <li> I use the cleaning system everyday, and it is great.</li>
            <li> Especially reading all of the amazing reviews on this product.     </li>
            <li> The shave was smooth and very close...not as close as a blade of course but much better than the old Braun i was using before.  </li>
            <li> Smooth as a blade, takes about 4 minutes for whole head.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable with no irritation and gets a very close shave for an electric.  </li>
            <li> but you really need to find out which way the grain is going and then move against it, for that razor smooth finish</li>
            <li> Light weight, shaves very close..</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;d use it very sparingly on my neck, as it wasn&#x27;t as comfortable as the floating triple heads on the Norelco.   </li>
            <li> Recently bought a plasma TV and its amazing as well.</li>
            <li> It gives a very close, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> If you shave everyday, this razor will keep you in great shape.</li>
            <li> Amazon had the best price, and free shipping, how can you go wrong?</li>
            <li> The foam was thick, which I&#x27;m sure gunked up the blades resulting in me having to go over my face and neck more, resulting in more irritation.  </li>
            <li> The razor does a nice enough job on the face, but it murders anything below my jaw line.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> and I believe itis well worth it.    </li>
            <li> For the most comfortable shave, shave in the shower using a shaving gel with glycerine such as gillette Fusion or Noxema Comfort Gel.</li>
            <li> Once I knew what direction to shave on the different parts of my face, I went from a five to six minute shave to a 2.5 to 3 minute shave that is closer and more comfortable  than any blade I have ever used.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s  still cheaper than a couple months worth of blades.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how picky people can be for this item as I am 100% satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I think this shaver is very much worth the price I paid on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The auto cleaner works wonders and although sometimes leaves a couple pieces of hair behind, it is simply amazing how good of a job it does.</li>
            <li> Another thing worth noting is its running cost.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to use and even on the neck</li>
            <li> I figured if I had a quality electric razor I could shave more frequently</li>
            <li> The LCD display works nicely showing the current charge level of the device.  </li>
            <li> It is quite, smooth, has a better cleaning station and the cartridges are cheaper and last longer.  </li>
            <li> Having a heavy beard and sensitive skin, I took the advice of the directions and have used shaving cream every time (best wet/dry product I&#x27;ve ever used).</li>
            <li> Eventually, I just kind of stopped shaving regularly.  </li>
            <li> He got it early to make sure it did not break him out and has not stopped using it.</li>
            <li> the most comfortable to hold of any of the above mentioned shavers.</li>
            <li> Notches on the side provide a solid grip, and a patterned thumb dot on top provides a comfortable place for said digit to rest.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my stepfather who is 91 yrs old ,he loves it reccommended to his brother they both love it...</li>
            <li> I wanted a charging/cleaning station but haven&#x27;t really been able to tell if the cleaning makes much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s totally worth it, for me and for him.</li>
            <li> and it was worth every pennie.</li>
            <li> the wet shave is much better and leaves your face more smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its WELL worth the money.  </li>
            <li> The cleaner is pretty cool too, although it takes an hour to do the job.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth the price of the product</li>
            <li> well worth it.    </li>
            <li> I have tried to use an electric shaver many times over the years but have never really been satisfied with the shave.  </li>
            <li> Using shaving cream, I can say is wow, this is just as close as a razor and so much better than Braun.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> My wife has remarked more than a few times how close my shave is and how effective the product has worked.  </li>
            <li> With the Panasonic coming in at the $95-$105 price range I thought it would be worth a shot.  </li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS WELL WORTH</li>
            <li> This makes the skin kind of roll underneath the shaver, then the 13,000 RPM blades make short work of the hairs.    </li>
            <li> The last model of Panasonic that I had lasted nearly seven years and was a great product.</li>
            <li> second guess yourself, try it out and make your own decision as skin types do vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> only thing I liked about this was the beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> and they just don&#x27;t seem to be worth it.  </li>
            <li> I suspect the cleaning feature will be useful if and when I use it</li>
            <li> They convinced me the 8109 was worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li> I always liked the cleaning system but cleaned and charged my shaver in the cleaner only once a week (every Sunday).  </li>
            <li> This is really frustrating since Panasonic makes wonderful shavers but always appears to have an \\&quot;Achille&#x27;s heel.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> For $104 on Amazon, it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> then helps keep the blades fresh smelling.  </li>
            <li> Love this razor so far.  </li>
            <li> As a direct comparison to my old Braun, the results of the shave are as good as ever.</li>
            <li> Considering that I paid $99 (plus tax), and it shaves as close and comfortably as my old $250 Braun, I don&#x27;t think I could do any better.</li>
            <li> You see for me the most sensitive part to shave has always been the mustache and chin area.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> Rest assured that this product is well worth the investment.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for the Fast FREE Shipping !  </li>
            <li> It is capable of achieving a very close shave in most areas, however I noticed it lacking in my neck and the bottom of my chin.</li>
            <li> All in all, good value for the money spent</li>
            <li> One touch with  a fingertip proves it.    </li>
            <li> My experience so far:  The shaver works better after a couple of uses (in my case I would say after 3 weeks of use).</li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic shaver I&#x27;ve own.  </li>
            <li> My Norelco gave me almost twice that, despite being many years old.  </li>
            <li> My old Panasonic didn&#x27;t have a cleaning station and was easy to clean just running it under the faucet.</li>
            <li> I got this product when it was on sale for about $100, which is probably what it is worth.  </li>
            <li> It was worth every penny I paid, and then some.</li>
            <li> Switched to the old mug soap and top of the line   razors from Mach3 to Fusion, but for me, cuts way to close</li>
            <li> This shaver is faster, closer and easier on the face (multi pivotal head) than Panasonic it replaced (9 yrs old).   </li>
            <li> If I need it, I can lock the head, but have rarely found the need.  </li>
            <li> It was a far better rated razor than what is offered for women.  </li>
            <li> 30days for the skin to get use to the shaver, and so far I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> : so far it has held a charge for 10 or more days while traveling.  </li>
            <li> So far I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> First I trimmed my goatee down a bit with the pop out trimmer on the unit,a great feature in itself.</li>
            <li> It seemed too good to be true, but Panasonic products have never let me down yet.</li>
            <li> The closeness of the shaver is far better than I anticipated, Sharper Image was right giving this thing an award.</li>
            <li> charger looks ridiculously big, but it also comes with a more travel friendly charger.  </li>
            <li> Shaving is fast and clean, my face is smooth and it has cleared up very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a cheapie Norelco years and years ago when I first hit puberty, but I quickly changed to razors.</li>
            <li> The need to clean your shaver will depend in large part on what you shave with (I use a foam, which tends to rinse cleaner than creams and gels).</li>
            <li> When I finish shaving, my face feels totally clean shaven, and I only notice the difference at the end of the day (stubble seems slightly more pronounced).    </li>
            <li> I was most recently using a Norelco shaver (Speed XL I think) with a jet clean unit.  </li>
            <li> I do have to go over the spots twice or three times for the clean shave, but the action is smooth and doesn’t irritate</li>
            <li> I debated a long time on whether to buy an electric shaver again after many years of being a blade boy!  </li>
            <li> Price is good compared to the other one.</li>
            <li> the closest, most comfortable shave possible with this shaver, shave after your stubble has had 2 days to grow and shave with shaving gel/cream and hot water like a blade.  </li>
            <li> Quiet, powerful, recharges quickly, and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the Panasonic is much louder in Db, but it is much more high pitched, almost like a Dentist&#x27;s drill and hair clippers had a baby, and this is it.  </li>
            <li> My face felt super smooth and soft afterward!    </li>
            <li> They were right.    </li>
            <li> I bought this razor as a Gold Box Deal of the day because the price was right</li>
            <li> It just buzzes right on through effortlessly.   </li>
            <li> The price was right</li>
            <li> He could shave right from bed.</li>
            <li> must go the right way there</li>
            <li> I pulled this out of the packaging and tried it out right away.  </li>
            <li> I just drop the shaver in the cleaner, press the selector button to get the right lights to come on, and I let it do its thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you&#x27;d like - the Panasonic cuts right through them.</li>
            <li> Panasonic got it right with this one.</li>
            <li> Takes 15 - 20 minutes to do it right</li>
            <li> Maybe I wasn&#x27;t using it right</li>
            <li> They may actually be right on this one.  </li>
            <li> just* right so as to break off the flip-out trimmer head.</li>
            <li> am amazed that Panasonic can&#x27;t get this detail right</li>
            <li> Right out of the box</li>
            <li> If you hold the shaver just right you will get shaver clippings all over your face, your clothes, your sink, etc.</li>
            <li> Even right out of the box, the Norelco shave quality was marginal, and my face still felt like 100 grit sandpaper after working it over for 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I had never used a Panasonic shaver before, but the price was right</li>
            <li> It just cruises right through the thickest parts with no signs of struggle.</li>
            <li> However, with my job and the amount of travel I do, overnight flights, right into meetings and so on</li>
            <li> I have not gotten irritation, though I moisturize right after shaving.      </li>
            <li> Lets get right to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Provides a great shave even after the first few times.</li>
            <li> Of course it&#x27;s not loud and is inaudible probably more than 4 feet away in a quite room, but still, sounds like cheap parts to me.    </li>
            <li> Just to review, my first Panasonic wet/dry was great and served me well for about 3 years, but when the Panasonic models came out a few years ago with the Vortex cleaning systems, I just had to have one, so I moved on to the model ES8078 wet/dry shaver.</li>
            <li> While I believe it was clean (most of the time), it just didn&#x27;t seem as clean, and when the cleaning fluid was near the end of its life, it wasn&#x27;t clean.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic razor works well; it cuts smoothly (closer than the Norelco) but it is particular about which way you draw the razor across your face.  </li>
            <li> It is quick, relatively quiet, smooth on the skin and leaves said skin just about as smooth as the proverbial baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> Its also very esy to clean</li>
            <li> I shave first thing every morning just to have it behind me and this shaver does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> The only difference between the two is the ES8228S adds a zippered vinyl travel case (vs cloth bag with draw strings) and the head has independent floating foil (each of the 3 foils is on their own suspension to track the curves of the face better).th draw strings) and the head has independent floating foil (each of the 3 foils is on their own suspension to track the curves of the face better).</li>
            <li> I look forward to the next improvement on this shaver, but until then I am happy, I got it for less than $100., and if I change in even two years, I got more than my money&#x27;s worth!by that time upgrade it.</li>
            <li> I have had an assortment of electric razors over the past 30 years and by far this is the best one yet.  </li>
            <li> , I wanted a way to clean up a bit, and fairly fast.  </li>
            <li> Works perfectly in the shower and is very easy to clean without using the base -</li>
            <li> The Panasonic family is best for beards where the hair grows parallel to the face where the hairs lay down.</li>
            <li> No other electric shaver I used was able to do this.</li>
            <li> It has a nice pivot and the very finely crafted foil glides across the face, at least my face.    </li>
            <li> This works great, takes up little space, has a nice easy to read display, charges fast, and unless I run into serious problems (although with a 2 year parts and labor warranty I am not worried) in the next year or more, I am sure it can be handled</li>
            <li> I found the shaver screen got hot pretty quickly, even when using it wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery life of the shaver is more than adequate, it should last for between five and seven shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of like the ink cartridge for the printer, except in this case everyone DOES have soap lying around--Panasonic could have easily made this an environmentally friendly mechanism whereby one uses common household soap to refill the cleaning machine;</li>
            <li> It is very nice, but the display died after a few months.&lt;br /&gt;After one year it shaves me every morning as it was the first</li>
            <li> It still works fine today, but I thought that I should retire it after 22 years and try a new Panasonic.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s apparent most people swear by it and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor every day for the past month, and it works great.  </li>
            <li> My first electric razor in 25 years for whatever that&#x27;s worth when checking this review.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic razor gives me a close shave without the irritation experienced in the past.</li>
            <li> Just $20 more than the bare bones shaver.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the actual size of the razor, this isn&#x27;t a lightweight cheap feeling product, it has some mass to it and fits nicely in your hand.  </li>
            <li> Excellent overall shaver -- works very well as a wet shaver in the shower.</li>
            <li> Recently the fusion disposables (which are great) have been racking up a bill and its kind of a slow process in the morning.</li>
            <li> The whole cleaning thing is a bit much, i just wash it once a week with liquid soap, and after every shave with water and it works fine.</li>
            <li> While it took time for my face to adjust to the new shaver, over a couple of weeks I noticed that I was able to get a closer and closer shave with this razor until it was pretty much shaving as close as a non-electric razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably use that latter method the large majority of the time, and the \\&quot;cleaning fluid\\&quot; once in a while to ensure it&#x27;s nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shave obviously is not as close as a razor, but it is very good - if you take the time to feel for rough spots.</li>
            <li> For other first time users, it will take a while to get a good shave the first time around.</li>
            <li> and I really feel I got good value for the money spent.</li>
            <li> The closest shave and most comfortable occurs when wet</li>
            <li> It is super fast, and doesn&#x27;t pull or irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> I had a rotary and replaced blades religiously but the ES8109S is far superior.  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the bottom line: sometimes it is worth paying more money than you are accustomed to, and this is definitely one of those times.</li>
            <li> Good if you don&#x27;t mind replacing every 12 months or less.</li>
            <li> The foil system is very similar to the Braun, and its easy to clean either with the cleaning unit or under water.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is much better and gives a much closer shave than my old Norelco.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, not messy like the Norelco one, and it even dries the razor.  </li>
            <li> Just a few more sentences and better organized layout,  </li>
            <li> Its well thought out, well built, easy to clean and has a lot of potential.</li>
            <li> I got good, close shaves from the start and noted it was about half the size of my Braun.  </li>
            <li> I just decided to try traditional DE razor blades instead because I prefer simplicity and the ability to easily keep my shaver clean.  </li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re looking for a close, quick shave this Panasonic can very well be the answer for a fraction of its competitors.</li>
            <li> I have not tried the auto clean feature yet, but CR reviews spoke highly of that too.</li>
            <li> It produced a clean smooth shave every time, right up to the final shave.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean and the little screen lets you know the battery level,very cool!</li>
            <li> It was the right decision because this razor works better then both of the brands mentioned above and is cheaper.</li>
            <li> So, if you are going to buy this for a present make sure that if you don&#x27;t like return it right away</li>
            <li> You can tell right away it does a better job overall</li>
            <li> THEN MY OLDER ONE!!</li>
            <li> Bonus feature, the unit is very very light.&lt;br /&gt;2-The flexibility to use dry/wet is a plus.</li>
            <li> This is one close shaving machine and very fast.</li>
            <li> I like the percentage of charge left indicator rather than a light that indicates when recharging is necessary - much more accurate.</li>
            <li> The cutters on this Panasonic oscillates very fast, against the foil.  </li>
            <li> If you want very fast speed and use an electric shaver, expect abit of noise.</li>
            <li> I bought it for a friend who likes it very much.</li>
            <li> I very much like the charge indicator.  </li>
            <li> This is a very smooth razor that is also very quiet.</li>
            <li> Other than being loud, this is a great product.  </li>
            <li> I have never used a wet/dry version before, but so far I am enjoying the ability to use it in the shower, it works much better than a dry shave.    </li>
            <li> Due to that I learned to shave never going against the grain with a razor and that has let me shave my face twice a week problem free, if I shaved more than twice... skin irritation.    </li>
            <li> and I much prefer the reminder on the Braun models however this shaver is way superior in every other.</li>
            <li> Charging is pretty fast, for a quick shave just few minutes should be good.    </li>
            <li> I was hoping this new shaver would be significantly improved over the Braun Model 7526</li>
            <li> I always run the razor under running water to partially clean it so the solution lasts a bit longer (not that cheap just can&#x27;t find it locally).</li>
            <li> It almost started bleeding after so many tries but I could not get a clean shave on the neck at all.   </li>
            <li> The 2nd time around was so quick and easy.</li>
            <li> And I also feel that the poor craftsman blames his tools, and this tool will allow a very good shave when used correctly.  </li>
            <li> (learned that the hard way lol.)    </li>
            <li> After discounts, the new unit was only ~$40 more -- so upgrade time!  </li>
            <li> /charge/dry my razor and it came out sparkling new and shiny clean.  </li>
            <li> First off, it wound up taking longer than a manual razor.  </li>
            <li> this thing really works!  </li>
            <li> The Vortex ended up being exactly what I thought it would be...</li>
            <li> About the sound of somebody&#x27;s loud vibrating cell on a glass table.    </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve all tried many different types and styles to get that close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li> I use Gillette Shave Gel with Glycerin when I shave in the hot shower.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m generally pretty hairy.</li>
            <li> This is my first review EVER</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find how smooth a shave it gave.</li>
            <li> Either way ya go, this Panosonic does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> This is the first wet/dry electric razor I have owned</li>
            <li> last was 18 months, but most of them died within 12 months.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, It took me a while to get use too and took me about an hour to shave my beard off.</li>
            <li> I have gotten some pretty damn close shaves with this thing.    </li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver</li>
            <li> that the comments for some of the higher priced selections.   </li>
            <li> (he is not shy about speaking his mind if he is not).</li>
            <li> It just isn&#x27;t as consistent as a blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many electric shavers during my 64 years and until now they all left a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li> Boy am I glad that I purchased the Panasonic over the Braun, there is no comparison to the shave quality not to mention the noise level being reduce and the overall cost.     </li>
            <li> Make sure you buy an extra set of replacement blades.</li>
            <li> First one was a ES8066 and it lasted about 7 years or so.</li>
            <li> With the Norelco it did not seem to matter because of the circular blade action; with the Panasonic it is important to draw the razor against the direction in which my beard grows.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and have normally bought the 3 head shavers, mostly Norelcos.  </li>
            <li> I bought a series 7 Braun which gave a close shave for the first year.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning/charging dock does very well on cleaning!</li>
            <li> 2) Turn on hot tap water.  </li>
            <li> Turn on shaver, rinse in hot water while it&#x27;s on, then start shaving    </li>
            <li> Periodically dip the (running) shaver under the hot water.  </li>
            <li> You will be rewarded with a pleasurable, close and comfortable shave that compares to going to the barber shop for a hot towel/straight razor professional shave.  </li>
            <li> Got this as my first electric.</li>
            <li> My facial hair grows in softer, and I am able to shave every day if need be (unlike every 2 to 3 days with the Mach 3).  </li>
            <li> for the noise, this shaver is actually quieter than most electrics I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> changes that don&#x27;t make either the blades or the cleaning system better but do keep you from having extra parts if</li>
            <li> However, I have stored the elaborate cleaner and charger (overkill) under my bathroom sink, and I use the simpler charging and cleaning methods that the instructions offer as equally acceptable options.</li>
            <li> I first go over the face and neck with the shaver.  </li>
            <li> first impressions are \\&quot;WOW!\\&quot; and \\&quot;AMAZING!\\&quot; and \\&quot;UNBELIEVABLE\\&quot; so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It shaves pretty close.  </li>
            <li> + on this if I had tried it out in a store first.</li>
            <li> That is exactly what i was trying to replace.</li>
            <li> The only problem when in the shower is not being able to see what your doing.  </li>
            <li> After using them item he gets a much smoother shave and rarely an ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> The shaver works well on the face, but it never once got my neck clear and smooth like I like it.</li>
            <li> Upon the first time I used the Vortex, I felt like I was using a shaver I had already been using for six months.  </li>
            <li> A razor system should last more than a year...</li>
            <li> Additionally, and this is a big con, I break out much, MUCH more when I use this often.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver in 6 years that I have tried.</li>
            <li> You really do have to try this shaver!  </li>
            <li> I am a consistent user of this product.  </li>
            <li> I purchased lectric shave and even followed the advice of some users to take a hot shower, apply the alcohol based solution to my skin, and then shave.</li>
            <li> It takes me many swipes in different directions to shave an area acceptably.</li>
            <li> You can get the same quality of shave in many cheaper razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have only had this razor for a couple of days, so I will update my review as time passes and try more of the functions.</li>
            <li> First a liitle background, I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in 10 years and always shaved with a razor.  </li>
            <li> Shaves pretty close.</li>
            <li> Overall pleased.</li>
            <li> Absolutely!</li>
            <li> Takes time to retrain to an electric but results are promising!   </li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews, which were stellar.</li>
            <li> i have to make several passes, it doesn&#x27;t cut most of the hairs, and i have to adjust the angles ad infinitum.  </li>
            <li> I believe this issue is more personal and wouldn&#x27;t let it affect the review.    </li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a foil</li>
            <li> The first was the ES8066 and if I used shaving cream it would shave so close</li>
            <li> This is my first razor with a cleaning station</li>
            <li> It shaves my face better than a regular razor.  </li>
            <li> Turning on this razor for the first time summoned a response akin to what an aviation engineer must have felt when he heard a jet engine for the first time...</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with a foil shaver</li>
            <li> However, that soon passed after my first shave.  </li>
            <li> After I shaved with it the first time I could not stop running my hands over my face in amazement, and I still can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare it to some of the higher end competition, but I can say I couldn&#x27;t imagine getting a closer shave than this</li>
            <li> The first time around for me, it looked like I was attacked by my girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, my regular razor gave me a better closer shave.</li>
            <li> It shaves closer and cuts more hair on the first pass, eliminating a 3rd or 4th pass.</li>
            <li> I have now started using it \\&quot;wet\\&quot; by warming my face with hot water, then applying a Neutragena shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Despite the cleaning problem, I was willing to buy the $200+ Braun shaver since I like their foil system.  </li>
            <li> My first shaver lasted about four years and had one blade/screen replacement.  </li>
            <li> Ok, after using the &#x27;cheaper&#x27; offerings in the Norelco brand of shavers for the last 20+ years I wanted to upgrade.</li>
            <li> After the first two or three uses</li>
            <li> That now allows for a smoother feeling and I look better til my next shave.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t give any updates as to charging time/battery life or the cleaner as I haven&#x27;t had to use either yet, but I&#x27;m sure they are as solid as the shaver itself is.</li>
            <li> It gives a pretty close shave around the mustache and goatee chin area.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning system takes about an hour and is pretty</li>
            <li> First, it is cheaper than Braun&#x27;s with comparable features, and I was intrigued by the ability to shave using shaving cream again.  </li>
            <li> It was a 4000 series (I don&#x27;t remember the exact number, but I still have Braun 2, which is model 5770).      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never shaved better in my life, and plan on sticking with Panasonic shavers in the future.</li>
            <li> This shaver is even better if that is possible.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver and observe that not only do I get a closer shave, which surprised me, but a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> First thing I did was go to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Panasonic needs to hire some better technical writers.</li>
            <li> and I think they could sell more units, especially if people download the manual before they buy a product.</li>
            <li> My Panasonic wet/dry that I purchased more than ten years ago</li>
            <li> Please read the reviews for the higher end Panasonic razors.  </li>
            <li> This is my First Electric Razor..</li>
            <li> The more you use it, the longer it should last (what?)</li>
            <li> This is my first electric/ cordless shaver</li>
            <li> If the noise bothers you, either use a blade or perhaps listen to music while you&#x27;re shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I did not spend extra money for the model with the self cleaning business.</li>
            <li> My 5 o&#x27;clock shadow looks likes most peoples 3rd day without shaving.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s how the first try went and</li>
            <li> Then I took a hot shower to soften up the hair.</li>
            <li> I fill the sink with HOT water and lube up my face with King Of Shaves Gel.</li>
            <li> I generally use shaving gel and it works real well and is convenient being able to shave in the shower.  </li>
            <li> This is my first Panasonic Razor.</li>
            <li> Since it is on the small side  you actually get a good grip of it in your hand which is cool because the razor is under total control with a good grip.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with my first purchase of a Panasonic Electric Razor........</li>
            <li> best of all is the price $$$  compared to expensive Brauns and Norelcos....</li>
            <li> My first was a rotory.</li>
            <li> on more than one occasion I tried repeated to get these areas with the shaver only to end up getting nicks and razor-burn.</li>
            <li> Just died on me and only used like once a month as razers were better and faster.</li>
            <li> The first I dropped and broke.  </li>
            <li> Have owned three electric shavers before this purchase, with my most recent two being Braun&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I first opened the box</li>
            <li> , I just charged the razor with the cord the first time.  </li>
            <li> I just rinsed the shaving cream off of the head with hot water and held the power button until the razor went into it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor.  </li>
            <li> but I have since quit using it because I mainly use the shaver in the shower now so a quick pull apart and rinse gets it cleaner than the stand.  </li>
            <li> Ok, here are my initial thoughts after four days of use.  </li>
            <li> In the ensuing four days, it has only gotten better.  </li>
            <li> After I finish, it feels in most areas as close as a blade although truth be told, it&#x27;s not quite because the five o&#x27;clock shadow creeps in a bit earlier in the day</li>
            <li> and I think I could shave more then once a day if needbe, something I never thought would be possible.    </li>
            <li> This is the first shaver that I purchased with a cleaning unit</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a \\&quot;zing\\&quot; as opposed to the old  \\&quot;chopping\\&quot; sound.</li>
            <li> He told me the exact model and brand</li>
            <li> So, I recommend it and can truly say paying more is not necessary.</li>
            <li> Be aware that an electric razor may cut hair that it is not visible in your face (example, the area below your eyes); so I would recommend to use a mirror in order to see what you are shaving.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted me eleven years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase and could summarize the difference between my old shaver and this one as smaller, sleeker, quieter and faster.  </li>
            <li> i just can&#x27;t imagine how it would be possible for another razor to be better than this.   </li>
            <li> After reading reviews on here, I decided to go out for the first time in my life and buy shaving cream to try out with this razor.</li>
            <li> This is my first Panasonic brand electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> I have just ordered the first replacemt foil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it since last November and love it.  </li>
            <li> I first picked it up at a Sam&#x27;s Club 5 years ago.</li>
            <li> That is more than 1300 shaves total!</li>
            <li> Thanks Panasonic!  </li>
            <li> I too have tried many different brands over the years.</li>
            <li> which is something that I&#x27;ve only been able to do with blades.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve had, but I read reviews before buying this one.  </li>
            <li> It is my first electric razor.  </li>
            <li> Being able to shave in the shower in the morning gives me an extra 5 minutes of sleep time.</li>
            <li> first purchase was a Norelco Arcitec.  </li>
            <li> (thanks Amazon for your return policy!)  </li>
            <li> He has pretty course hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the cleaning system twice and actually found that I do a better job of cleaning it by hand</li>
            <li> This product is my first electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good electric shaver for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I think this unit is good for someone who needs to shave everyday.</li>
            <li> It will take a few weeks for it to go a really good job on your face.</li>
            <li> , I knew that she bought it and had not shaved for 3 days, I have a heavy beard and thought that this would be a good test for it.  </li>
            <li> I did a good bit of research and was looking at another razor which has commercials being aired all day long.  </li>
            <li> These Panasonic models will give you a good shave if you plan to use them for just a few months and them throw them away.</li>
            <li> The shave is every bit as good as the Braun, and the Panasonic is about $100 to $150 LESS!  </li>
            <li> This new one is better and shaves closer then the old one.  </li>
            <li> Super fast recharge and very efficient cleaning cycle.  </li>
            <li> I received the razor after just three days, using the free Super Saver shipping and used it the following day.    </li>
            <li> With the Panasonic, I can shave twice daily quickly and smoothly.</li>
            <li> the Mach 3 Turbo razor or even the Gillette Fusion blade razor leaves my face less than perfectly smooth as I would expect with that many blades.</li>
            <li> the unit is easy to clean, including a mode where you rinse it and then just put it in the cradle and select the dry option.  </li>
            <li> One tip I have about cleaning the razor - I shave and rinse clean my shaver every day, and I only clean it in the Vortex when it needs charging which, for me, is about once every two weeks.</li>
            <li> Not as good as blades, but very close and with less irritation and no danger of cuts.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, the shave is even better--- the sound alone tells  you this is a very \\&quot;fine\\&quot; cut.</li>
            <li> I have researched online to find the right product that doesn&#x27;t have too much maintenance and spare parts to purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too bad, but on days that I have important meetings/interviews, I do have to go over my neck with a regular razor just to make sure everything is perfect.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend this razor and didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars simply because I couldn&#x27;t compare it with others to be sure it absolutely deserved a top rating.</li>
            <li> To my understanding it shaves as good or better then high end Brauns or Nokias, but it has half initial and ongoing costs.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this one based on many positive reviews from users &amp; a positive fan following over here.</li>
            <li> Like every new shaving method, it takes about a month for the beard to adjust, and the first shave wasn&#x27;t entirely pleasant (as I recall from my previous foray with electrics a decade ago).     </li>
            <li> My 3 year old Norelco shaves closer even with the original blades.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to those who are sensitive to standard shaving razors, and want more than full value for their money.</li>
            <li> The flat design of the foil is a better design than the \\&quot;Arc</li>
            <li> Also the first cartridge didn&#x27;t even last the whole month, and this was after hearing someone being able to use it twice over.</li>
            <li> The same quality that I found with the original razor was easily rediscovered with the new unit.  </li>
            <li> If I had to do it again, I might not get model with Hydraclean system, just double clicking on button drives motor to higher rpm, stick it under faucet and its clean!</li>
            <li> Hands down the slickest most soothing gel ever created!</li>
            <li> This is a great razor!nafter the initial 2-3 weeks of your skin getting used to the new type of shaving (if you&#x27;re switching from a traditional razor)</li>
            <li> A huge bonus to it is that it&#x27;s able to work through a few days&#x27; growth.</li>
            <li> In the world of electric razors this might be one of the best, but why would you spend $100 for a product that eats up an outlet and counter space, and offers a worse shave than a $10 blade would offer?    </li>
            <li> I am a professional, explains to be clean shaven every day..  </li>
            <li> You can put some soft soap into the heads &amp; let them clean themselves because water can&#x27;t hurt this shaver, unlike the Braun.   </li>
            <li> Third, it shaves my testicles OK, but the the shaver really stings the seam between them.    </li>
            <li> Despite this flaw, I&#x27;m giving the razor 4 stars to reflect its superior performance with short facial hair.</li>
            <li> Panasonic shaves better than the old Braun and the old Norelco.  </li>
            <li> In that time I have had at least 6 different models and have found them all to be excellent.  </li>
            <li> The self-cleaning system is definitely worth it -- very convenient and doesn&#x27;t clog often, although you really do have to replace the cleaning carterage every month.</li>
            <li> its charger works well and the razor holds a long charge, but considering one needs to stroke an area many times to shave it in the first place</li>
            <li> It has not been able to shave nearly as close as my 8 year old Norelco and this shaver has a design flaw.</li>
            <li> No having to take a not so good product back, no having to buy a different shaver over and over before I get one that works as the product description says.</li>
            <li> In conclusion, I&#x27;d say the number 1 reason I like this shaver so much, is because after 30 years of hating shaving and the irritation I knew I was going to feel, I actually don&#x27;t mind shaving any more.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this shaver and its much quieter than some of the prior models.</li>
            <li> The battery held the charge the entire time, and worked well - good thing, since I left the charger at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact, since its electric, I&#x27;m also able to go against the grain which gives me a much smoother shave than a traditional razor blade.  </li>
            <li> now I am pretty pleased and will definitely recommend this product to those looking for a good and long lasting electric shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for anyone who&#x27;s looking at an electric shaver and is pondering whether it&#x27;s worth the ~$100 investment.</li>
            <li> The new unit is faster, charges quicker, and runs quieter (great with 2 small kids).  </li>
            <li> In fact, I think that the fourth blade in the middle actually interferes with a better shave and these two middle blades are not as good as the primary cutters.</li>
            <li> The first shave I got was very good, it did miss a few hair on the neck as they were long</li>
            <li> I just cannot understand the 200+ positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> Purchased based on positive reviews from amazon.</li>
            <li> After a week, I have to say, I&#x27;m convinced the positive reviews of this product are spot on.  </li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews here I thought I&#x27;d give this one a try.</li>
            <li> But after going through the positive reviews on Amazon I thought of taking a chance.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, these new Panasonic \\&quot;Arc Foil\\&quot; shavers have the foil curving AWAY from your face at the ends of the foil, further decreasing exposure to the blades and requiring many more passes to cover the same area.</li>
            <li> This shaver is amazing, it provides a very smooth close shave, with less effort, and is not loud.  </li>
            <li> Frankly speaking, this is how long it took for me to realize the full potential of this amazing shaver.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with a wet/dry razor, and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a Norelco for as long as I can remember and was satisfied with it</li>
            <li> and I like it as much as I did the first day</li>
            <li> Really well designed and consistent.  </li>
            <li> I pretty much keep it in the shower and shave without soap, recharging/cleaning about once a week.</li>
            <li> It works, others have left stray hairs and stubble, The first shave took longer than the average 3 minutes, but produced a great shaving experience.</li>
            <li> This pretty much wraps it up.  </li>
            <li> But it is pretty fast, I think.  </li>
            <li> The first being that yes, the cartridge was really used up, after it was done &#x27;cleaning&#x27; quite a bit of hairs were still around the razor.</li>
            <li> It would do a sorta ok job on the face and cheeks although no semblance of being as close as a blade but refused to cut the long hairs in the neck.  </li>
            <li> if you have a light beard, especially in the upper lip area, they are OK.</li>
            <li> and it has some lube in the cleaner to keep the blades nice and sharp and ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;Sounds</li>
            <li> It is cheaper than the Braun and the arcitec and rates just as good (if not better).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how true those claims are, but here is my experience so far:    </li>
            <li> I get incredibly close, it is amazing, though it takes a long time; and, occasionally it will leave my neck a bit rough and red.  </li>
            <li> I gave it a three because of the hydra clean system and ease to clean, dry and charge.</li>
            <li> For the positives:  Very fast smooth motor, much more comfortable shave overall compared to the $30 shavers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> After nine months and a set of fresh  blades I sold the shaver and switched to the new Gillette 5 blade power system &amp; their pro glide shave gel.</li>
            <li> the razor doesn&#x27;t seem to hold a charge for very long, so don&#x27;t travel any more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say the shave is very nearly if not as close as I&#x27;ve been able to get with a blade.  </li>
            <li> After shaving Friday morning, I usually don&#x27;t shave again until Monday morning, after which I get an amazing shave that puts a smile on my face and prepares me to face the challenges of the work week.  </li>
            <li> This razor set up with ease and I could understand the easy instructions; in English.</li>
            <li> I have not had a closer shave with an electric razor than this and even my girlfriend commented that my face was more smooth than usual.  </li>
            <li> I concluded that it is better as a dry shaver.     </li>
            <li> For me this shaver shaves better dry.</li>
            <li> using shave cream but using it dry is more than acceptable.</li>
            <li> I sometimes don&#x27;t clean the shaver for a few days and the cleaner works just as good then as when I do it daily.  </li>
            <li> I like the % battery charge left feature and also how easy it cleans up.</li>
            <li> I love how it can be used dry</li>
            <li> I LOVE how one can use it in the shower or on dry skin.</li>
            <li> It is quiet, well balanced and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Its considerable power makes shaving quick and as close as I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> and I was amazed that it better than dry.</li>
            <li> As for the self cleaning stand, I&#x27;m less enthusiastic.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t plan on using mine in the shower as I seem to get better results dry anyway and want to avoid the problems of leaking some</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve noticed as time passed on the &amp;#34;Cleaning&amp;#34; function on the dock became less effective.</li>
            <li> I know for certain it&#x27;s the charger, since I tested it with a multimeter.  </li>
            <li> It certainly isn&#x27;t nosier than my television.  </li>
            <li> It certainly isn&#x27;t nosier than my television.  </li>
            <li> As it turns out, the large four-blade surface is like trying to keep the end of a 2x4 on your face.</li>
            <li> A NEW MODEL FEELS LIKE!!</li>
            <li> Back in the day my first shaver was a cheap $40 panasonic which shaved very well but could not shave around the neck area.</li>
            <li> It also gets very hot during your shave which the old versions never did.</li>
            <li> Panasonic is a joy to use - wet or dry</li>
            <li> Works great wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Wet shaves are great but even dry</li>
            <li> This razor works great, in wet or dry.</li>
            <li> At a better price than the Braun and about the same as the Norelco the Panosonic gives a better shave hands down.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this razor less than one year after buying a Norelco (as a replacement for a good Norelco that gave up the ghost after nearly 10 years).  </li>
            <li> This one is far superior to the previous one.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I give the Panasonic 5 stars because it is reasonably priced, gives a great shave, holds it&#x27;s charge for a long time and isn&#x27;t unreasonably loud.  </li>
            <li> It cuts really close (even when dry it is comparable to a disposable manual razor) and is much quicker than my safety razor (though I will probably still use my Merkur on weekends when I have more time).</li>
            <li> 1st, in my opinion, based on using two rotary electric razors (Norelco), 2 foil razors (Braun), and now a 3rd foil razor, none give as close of a shave as a razor blade, but if you give your face about a month to adapt you can generally get a good shave from the better (more expensive) electrics.  </li>
            <li> Not only is the razor noticeably lighter, it is skinnier, with a contoured shape for easy gripping, and a rubberized handle to reduce slipping.  </li>
            <li> My last one did not shave closely and would not cut some of the fine hair on my neck under my chin.  </li>
            <li> It worked fine the day before and was charged a day prior</li>
            <li> This shaver actually works fine.  </li>
            <li> : Overall, on the cheeks, the product works fine.  </li>
            <li> The first use resulted in a decent shave but nothing that would pass inspection.  </li>
            <li> I thought my Braun&#x27;s run of almost 5 years was pretty decent.</li>
            <li> The cleaning system is its strong suit and I&#x27;ve used this poorly designed razor for over a year because I liked the cleaning system so much.</li>
            <li> Very highly recommended to all who are hesitant to move from blades to electric.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a very high frequency pulsating noise (that you won&#x27;t notice in about 30 seconds into the shave),</li>
            <li> If it does turn on it will fill the chamber holding the razor with the cleaner and run on a very high speed to get the hairs to fall out.</li>
            <li> A nice close shave with little to no irritation.  </li>
            <li> Your cleaning cartridges will last longer because the shaver is already pretty clean when you start the cycle.    </li>
            <li> Also since this is a wet/dry model I can clean my shaver under running tap water first and use hydraclean only once a week.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it can be used wet or dry, I typically use it in the shower and it does a pretty close shave not quite as good as the razor</li>
            <li> I feel that foil shavers rinse cleaner than do rotary ones, and it is probably purely because the blades are more straight on these, whereas the old rotary shavers I had contained slightly curved blades, and could never seem to get fully clean.    </li>
            <li> It does OK on short stubbly stuff but tends to miss stuff that&#x27;s longer or not stiff.  </li>
            <li> My first real electric shaver and it works amazingly, that whole 30 days to adjust is true so tough it out.</li>
            <li> It probably works even better than the old one when it was new, and it weighs less, costs less (made in China), and looks more stylish.</li>
            <li> After a few days of using this razor my face was smooth and free of nicks or bumps.  </li>
            <li> Personally, i desire a shaver that&#x27;s comfortable, thorough, and fast (as in completing a shave).</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s HUGE different between the two.</li>
            <li> At least it can perform the most important functions.</li>
            <li> Ordered and received the  shaver in a very timely manner from Amazon.com and plugged it in for a charge.</li>
            <li> That is how much I like this.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but I figured the cleaning/drying cycle would take like 20mins tops.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is absolute trash.</li>
            <li> I have coarse whiskers densely arrayed around my chin, with a light sprinkling elsewhere.</li>
            <li> The package arrived, I had everything out and ready to go and charged up in no time.    </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have a light beard and still it requires sevreral passes over the same spot.</li>
            <li> Anyway I get a really close shave with the ES8109S and</li>
            <li> They shave your face very evenly and do not tear up your neck like the Norelco ones.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this shaver!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t feel it on my skin until after the shave when I notice how much smoother my face is compared to when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> It is NOT as thorough as a razor in my opinion, nor is it as fast.  </li>
            <li> After much research, I purchased this shaver to replace my dying Norelco wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t think of any at all.</li>
            <li> Whole kit cost just $100.</li>
            <li> I can say that it shaves my head much better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I will absolutely buy another Panasonic when time necessitates it.</li>
            <li> I switched to an electric because of the amount of irritation I get from a straight razor.</li>
            <li> So I suggest that you don&#x27;t replace the blades, just replace the whole shaver.  </li>
            <li> While happy, I was tired of spending 20 bucks on a pack of blades.  </li>
            <li> Now I need to test it with lather in the shower to see what it can really do.</li>
            <li> It is incredibly fast and provides the closest shave that I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is well worth it to have such a reliable, fast, and powerful shaver.</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> It provides me with a much closer shave than I get with my Braun Synchro electric razor.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used the cleaning system, so</li>
            <li> The HydraClean system works really well.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> He reports that he is very satifisfied</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t feel much of a burn because it isn&#x27;t shaving.</li>
            <li> I often notice that it misses some hairs (ones that are not sticking straight up in the air) no matter how often I go over that area.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic shaver shaves very close to the skin, but it does not damage the skin.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that the ac adapter now is noticeably cheaper and makes a buzzing sound.  </li>
            <li> I used to use a Philips rotary shaver - all I can say is that this unit shaves much closer.</li>
            <li> I have very sesitive skin</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this shaver to anyone who wants a close shave.</li>
            <li> Not objectionable to me but much louder than my Norelco.    </li>
            <li> Not to mention it was at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Panasonic and Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It holds a charge very well.  </li>
            <li> It lists on here that it shaves in \\&quot;1\\&quot; pass, not so much.</li>
            <li> I did get a smokin&#x27; deal on here though and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Really like the battery indicator</li>
            <li> For $100 I expected so much more from the Vortex.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if I have a faulty product, but I really don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> He comments every day about how much he loves it and has never had an electric shaver that worked so well.  </li>
            <li> To my surprise (and his) he absolutely loves it and has been using it ever since.  </li>
            <li> Does very well shaving on the jawline and under the chin.</li>
            <li> The ES8109S has really exceeded my expectations in every way.  </li>
            <li> But I still expected more.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with a blade for over 30 years and have not had much experience with electric shavers.</li>
            <li> Shaving in the shower softens your beard, and creams really lubricated and soften the blow of scraping steel across your face.</li>
            <li> I thought the Gillette MACH Fusion Power ad of $1 a week as too much, so I bought this for $69 at Circuit City days, just before they went out of biz.  </li>
            <li> Maybe $1 a week is not too much after all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the absolute closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Its very helpful to know how much charge the razor has,</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this razor!</li>
            <li> I really like the razor and the cleaning/charging station rocks.</li>
            <li> This is a real time saver.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried electric before and not been happy but the newer multi-blade razors were irritating me</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really close.</li>
            <li> Razor is fast, gives a close shave.</li>
            <li> I really like the cleaning system that comes with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job very well.  </li>
            <li> This is a wet/dry razor which I hadn&#x27;t really thought about.  </li>
            <li> thanks so much</li>
            <li> And no, I do not have the courage to try a straight razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While the razor can be cleaned with tap water and soap, I really do recommend the use of the cleaning stand.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic wet-dry shavers are very versatile.</li>
            <li> I would have kept the Braun had the automatic cleaner part of it not broken.</li>
            <li> whatever Panasonic is doing, it works REALLY well</li>
            <li> and I really like the self cleaning feature.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t believe it really does much cleaning of the head at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the shave is very close and does not irritate your skin.  </li>
            <li> I do like the waterproof design of the Panasonic shavers, but not the fact that you have to use them wet to get the most out of them.    </li>
            <li> I bought my husband this shaver after seeing how much time and money he was spending on the Mach 3 blades.</li>
            <li> just turn it on the fast mode and hold it under running water.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not as close a shave as my father&#x27;s straight razor, but then again I would sever my jugular if I used a straight razor.  </li>
            <li> I tried a rotary and it didnt work very well</li>
            <li> I use it with shaving cream, and now I can shave my whole face.</li>
            <li> Braun&#x27;s foil is straight, with a flexible head.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic&#x27;s head is also flexible, but has a convex foil, which makes shaving under the neck much easier.  </li>
            <li> For the price you pay for those I would have expected more.</li>
            <li> Some customers complain of the cleaning unit being very load.  </li>
            <li> and it all works very well.</li>
            <li> It shaves close and fast, with no irritation....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now had this for almost a month and it works really well and gets almost as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li> I am on my third 8109 shaver and they all shave me close and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect such an advanced device with a built-in electric dryer etc.</li>
            <li> This product truly did change my whole perspective.    </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve shaved with a rotary your whole life, you will not believe the difference in performance this foil razor gives.  </li>
            <li> Charges fast.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll really like the cleaning system.  </li>
            <li> THANKS AGAIN</li>
            <li> I really do get a shave as close as a razor</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor!</li>
            <li> I get a very close shave</li>
            <li> and my wife expresses how much she loves it every time.    </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really a fan of this shaver.</li>
            <li> Someone suggested a foil shaver and, after much hesitation, I purchased the Braun.</li>
            <li> Braun has hit the snooze button and no longer wants to get up in the morning with me.</li>
            <li> I got the whole thing with another coupon for $75.  </li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s why I like it so much.  </li>
            <li> I got the whole thing with another coupon for $75.  </li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s why I like it so much.  </li>
            <li> The wet shave option on the Panasonic is better than my blade.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think that it would be any more liable to wake someone up in an adjacent room.    </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say this is a miracle razor, because it isn&#x27;t, but it allows me to shave my face against the grain for a much closer shave than I was getting with my razor with the grain.</li>
            <li> This is what really disappoints me about this product.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping for a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> Its really neat.</li>
            <li> i just can understand why a razor costs so much</li>
            <li> love that it can be used wet.</li>
            <li> (This is as close as a barber&#x27;s straight blade.)    </li>
            <li> Panasonic&#x27;s shavers convinced me that shaving with an electric could come very close to the quality of a blade.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning cycle is noisy, but it does not need to run very often, so it doesn&#x27;t bother.  </li>
            <li> I understand that electric shavers don&#x27;t get quite as close as a real razor.</li>
            <li> This 3-blade shaver gives a very close shave, with some work.</li>
            <li> As a result, closeness of the shave is better and time spent is shorter.</li>
            <li> It does have a much wider trimmer and longer battery life between charges, though.    </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worked very well.</li>
            <li> Movie advertising really does work.</li>
            <li> I still use the blade occasionally when I want a smooth shave.     </li>
            <li> Thanks a lot Norelco.</li>
            <li> Highly reccommended!</li>
            <li> Much faster and closer than the norelco(and</li>
            <li> When he used it the 1st time it didn&#x27;t shave around the adams apple very well.  </li>
            <li> The pop-up trimmer works really well too.</li>
            <li> A real gem.</li>
            <li> Very close shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Gilette Fusion man,a wet shaver who needs more lubrication than Joan Rivers on date night.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m ready.</li>
            <li> IS WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW</li>
            <li> It did my cheeks really well</li>
            <li> i dont have too much hair in my face</li>
            <li> Thanks for the Deal of the Day price.</li>
            <li> Shaves very well and leaves his skin smoooooooth.    </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Shaves as close and as fast, and cleans as efficiently.   </li>
            <li> It gives you a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> The re-charging cleaning system is a pain, not so much the cost</li>
            <li> really haven&#x27;t found any at this time.  </li>
            <li> It seems to me that I will spend just as much time cleaning the cleaning/charge station as I would just cleaning my razor by hand after each use, but I&#x27;ll give it a shot and see if I like using</li>
            <li> it also does this very neatly in the sense that I don&#x27;t have any hair to sweep up after I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave for an electric... not as close as a blade, of course, but the closest of any electric shaver I have used.</li>
            <li> Wonder how much I paid for it?</li>
            <li> and I really hope the noise is not bleeding thru.  </li>
            <li> And I also have always used a foil type shaver, currently a Remingtom Titanium and earlier a cheaper Braun, because I couldn&#x27;t use the 8865 to square off my sideburns with a nice straight line, or get a couple spots under my nose and lower lip.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t feel a difference on my neck where I did and didn&#x27;t use the razor.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know much about it since I don&#x27;t use it, it was for my husband&#x27;s Father&#x27;s Day.  </li>
            <li> Anything over $85 for a razor is too much (my opinion).</li>
            <li> This razor is light and smaller than what it appears on the pics.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t wake her up when I&#x27;m getting ready in morning.  </li>
            <li> It does not work very well in the shower.</li>
            <li> I like this shaver, it cuts close and fast.</li>
            <li> In fact I wish it didn&#x27;t glow at all, which only adds to power drain and light pollution in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> This foil razor really can claim to shave as close as a blade.</li>
            <li> It actually shaves my neck smooth</li>
            <li> and I like a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> It handled the neck better than I expected</li>
            <li> , the cheeks and side burns come out much smoother than I though an electric razor could get.  </li>
            <li> I really like the cleaning system.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real champ.</li>
            <li> He was also pleased that he didn&#x27;t get any nicks or irritation, which he expected as part of the getting-used-to-a-new-shaver experience.    </li>
            <li> This shaver works really well.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I dont really care about/use the Hydraclean system,</li>
            <li> so I got the shaver all ready for him to use</li>
            <li> It looks like I went to the ole time parlor and got a straight razor shave</li>
            <li> Perhaps it works better wet?</li>
            <li> I travel A LOT with this razor and one thing that really sticks out for me</li>
            <li> He has very sensitvie skin</li>
            <li> Very convenient to shave in shower.  </li>
            <li> Close shave, nice battery state indicator, relatively quiet, trimmer only runs when it&#x27;s in the up position</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun electric shavers religiously for the last 20+ years once I determined that they were far superior to the competitors at that time -- Norelco and Remington.  </li>
            <li> I have owned several electric shavers over the years, but so far this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still loving it and using it everyday.</li>
            <li> I can go two days after shaving with a blade with only the mustache / goatee area looking kind of scraggly on the second day.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic discussion: Panasonic had developed an outstanding shaver line some ten years ago.</li>
            <li> All in all on the clean/charge station, I honestly think its a waste of a plug and money on cartridges.</li>
            <li> You get a much better shave with this shaver and so far no defects after several months use.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic parallel blades just did not cut many hairs on each pass, requiring a far longer shave.  </li>
            <li> I have always had extremely sensitive skin and was only able to tolerate shaving with a razor once a week.  </li>
            <li> It works well in the most sensitive areas, such as bikini lines, underarms etc.  </li>
            <li> shaves later - first dry, then with a little shaving gel, I am very happy with this shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor based mainly on the positive reviews I read here.  </li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s mostly a gimmick to get you to continuously buy the associated replacement parts, and in any case I was able to clean my last razor simply by using the little brush that came with it.</li>
            <li> The idea of a wet dry electric shaver appealed to me and the reviews of the Panasonic were on balance pretty good</li>
            <li> &quot; So far that&#x27;s held true and it has given him a better shave then his Braun electric foil razor he previously used.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyone that isn&#x27;t happy with this razor either isn&#x27;t using it right, has a defective unit, or holds unrealistic expectations.</li>
            <li> Did a great job on the neck as well although the hair was not too long to begin with as I had shaved the previous day.  </li>
            <li> its pretty quick once the hair is short.</li>
            <li> The sound is pretty average for eletric razors...not too loud, not too quiet...pretty decent sound.</li>
            <li> If you are like me, and are &#x27;ok&#x27; with the cheaper models offered at the local box stores, I highly suggest putting a few more dollars into this razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a very quick shaver doesn&#x27;t take long at all to shave.</li>
            <li> Well I have to say, much to my surprise that this Panasonic electric razor shaves my face about 99% as close as the Fusion razor and that is impressive to me since I don&#x27;t have to keep buying those expensive Fushion blades!  </li>
            <li> was using an older model Panasonic ES8066 that is still working, but I wanted an update and took all the time needed to make a decision that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;A concern that I did have with these shavers was the large looking docking/cleaning stations.  </li>
            <li> Where it cut, it cut closer then the rotary but left huge gaps, particularly on the neck</li>
            <li> Even if I don&#x27;t shave for a few days, it takes off everything clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Give it a try as it sure beats using a styptic pencil or that old stand by toilet paper.  </li>
            <li> My razor was always clean and ready to use the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My razor was always clean and ready to use the next morning.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cinch to clean, and since I don&#x27;t travel much, working only uncorded does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li> Maybe the three floating heads of other brands may be better at covering all the spots.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands (typically more bulking than the Panasonic), but the size, feel and cut of this shaver</li>
            <li> the battery inside wore out before the replacement blades did (I go through a normal razor in a week!)</li>
            <li> The hot, wet blades melt the gel on your skin and help you to get a really close and comfortable shave.    </li>
            <li> I am not an engineer, but I suspect the Panasonic has a greater need for lubrication than most other foil razors due to its faster speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shaver itself is probably a bit better than any other I&#x27;ve tried (Norelco, Braun, Grundig).  </li>
            <li> but when it came in I was too excited and had to have him open it!</li>
            <li> The Norelco may or may not have done a better job on my neck due to the rotary heads</li>
            <li> There are better models out there, just do your due diligence.  </li>
            <li> I continued to read reviews, mostly on Amazon, but also other places</li>
            <li> I purchased this Panasonic razor after reading the reviews thoroughly for the Panasonic and most other razors offered by Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I still get a much better shave than with any other electric razor even if I&#x27;m in a hurry.  </li>
            <li> This Panasonic from day one worked better than my other brand ever did.  </li>
            <li> Another downside I found was that contrary to most other men reviewing here on Amazon, the electric shaver took LONGER for me to shave.  </li>
            <li> I have used it shaving dry and wet and had good results both ways but the wet yields the closest shave which I tend to use the most.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought the cleaning system was a little over the top, as rinsing and tapping usually work just as well to clean out a razor, but I have to admit that the HydraClean system is really cool and seems to improve the blade life!</li>
            <li> Although the old one was getting weaker for several reasons, I was pleasantly surprised at how easily and quickly the new one went over my face.  </li>
            <li> Then I recieved this bad boy as a Father&#x27;s day gift and now after a couple of months usage I have to say I&#x27;m pretty impressed</li>
            <li> Out of habit I still manually clean this razor every day, and so have only used the HydraClean system once.</li>
            <li> I let it clean the shaver every third day.</li>
            <li> Have not yet tried the deep clean in the cleaner yet.  </li>
            <li> I literally have to go over my face in all directions multiple times to get a clean shave</li>
            <li> Also, my cleaning unit will only clean if I unplug it and plug it in again.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning system works very well; only caveat there is that the full cycle takes about two hours to run.  </li>
            <li> Also, reviews stated that the shave is such a close clean shave that you need one pass...</li>
            <li> Actully mostly just trimming around a full beard because shaving with a blade every day is painfull, at least for me.</li>
            <li> Now my goatee has alot of gray in it and it really makes me look older than I&#x27;d like to.</li>
            <li> I eventually had to pull my regular andis shaver and clean the areas that the Vortex couldn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and the product looks decent.</li>
            <li> I expect that the auto clean feature will be equally effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only nit is that the foil pops out of the top too easily, this happened a few times before I caught on what I was pushing (those 2 balck tabs).  </li>
            <li> It has different modes so that I can set it to charge and clean or just charge.  </li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve used Braun and Remington electric razors (cheap ones in the $25-$35 range) but have mainly used blades, in recent years the rather effective Mach3.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned to use it effectively, though, so it is only a minor inconvenience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes a little longer than the traditional route, but it&#x27;s quite nice to be able to shave and watch TV at the same time.</li>
            <li> Either way, it will be nice to be able to thoroughly clean it and not have to rely on the dumb little brushes.    </li>
            <li> I dare you to compare the 2 razors back to back and honestly say the Braun is worth double the price.</li>
            <li> He really loves it and comes with high recommendations.</li>
            <li> This is not due to the craftsmanship of the shaver; it is due to my own clumsiness.  </li>
            <li> I figured the money would be better spent buying a new razor.  </li>
            <li> I am used to Gillette Mach3 for last 5 years or so and wanted to try something new that is maintainence free.</li>
            <li> Even though the new Brauns cost $100 more than the Panasonics, their motors are still slower, and you still can&#x27;t shave with &#x27;em wet.</li>
            <li> I am very please with this product, after purchasing so many women&#x27;s electric wet dry razors, and have them \\&quot;crap\\&quot; out after a few months, it is exciting to use something with this many nice features to keep the blades lubricated and sharp.  </li>
            <li> Amazon was having a special deal, so the product with the charger/cleaning system was only around $80.</li>
            <li> To my surprise this razor is still rated really high and doesn&#x27;t seem like their are to many other razors that compare.    </li>
            <li> it gives a nice close shave with very little skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I swear, this unbeatable combination (i.e., shower steam, Panasonic wet/dry shaver and Gilette Series foam) shaves me closer than even the best blades that Gilette offers (at present, the Gilette Fusion) with far less irritation and with no annoying little cuts in conspicuous locations around my face and/or neck.    </li>
            <li> and I get a comfortable, quick and dead close shave (</li>
            <li> The dry shave option is nice later in the day as well if he has something to do in the evening</li>
            <li> Either wet or dry, this shaver didn&#x27;t do a good job for me.  </li>
            <li> Its dry wet option is good as well.  </li>
            <li> wise I&#x27;d give it a solid four and a half stars.    </li>
            <li> I have only tried to dry shave and was thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> Gives a better shave with far less irritation  Rotary shaver had difficulty with certain spots (jawline, above adams apple) that this one gets just fine  </li>
            <li> He can use it wet or dry which was a great option before he left the hospital and in his first days home recovering.</li>
            <li> well and easy to Maintenance also price is not high.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a long time, cuts close and smooth, and never irritates my skin.  </li>
            <li> , even back when I used a Norelco it was a cool skin model</li>
            <li> but this guy almost always gets everything - and if it doesn&#x27;t, the handy trimmer can usually get the tricky spots.  </li>
            <li> I have run the full clean+dry+charge cycle only 3-4 times (once a month) since i got the shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far this has worked pretty well but not as well as a razor.  </li>
            <li> First there is no skin adjustment period as with old electric razors.  </li>
            <li> my opinion)&lt;br /&gt;the razor is pretty loud</li>
            <li> then that I do love this razor for being my first electric razor, I hope this last me a long time.</li>
            <li> If you run out of charge, 10 minutes in the charger will do enough to give a full shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with this for about a month now and while I won&#x27;t go so far as to say that this product has changed my life, it is exactly what I was looking for-</li>
            <li> Panasonic, hire some good American English technical writers.</li>
            <li> have let my beard grow for most of the last 20 years and only shaved when I absolutely couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore...</li>
            <li> My next venture was with the Philips Norelco Advantage and then the updated Cool Skin.  </li>
            <li> I orginally bought this razor for my son, who has a thick beard, and he has been very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> I, like many others here, have used all major brands, but Panasonic has set a new standard....</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s great razor and being $75 to $80 less than the new Brau that replaced my 15-year old one.</li>
            <li> It seems to take a long time and is very noisy as it goes through its cycles, but i don&#x27;t clean it all the time and just wait until everyone is up or out of the house when I do use that mode.  </li>
            <li> Last one is 8 years old and still works fine.</li>
            <li> After a normal run through, I&#x27;d have to go back 3 or 4 times all at differing angles to clean up the neck hair--and even then it doesn&#x27;t catch them all.  </li>
            <li> I have owned about half a dozen electric razors over the past 25 years and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Shaves as close as my old Brau razor; however, the foil gets a little warm against my face.</li>
            <li> Even on the cheeks, after a good shave, I&#x27;d see little hairs poking out that I&#x27;d have to go back to.  </li>
            <li> I was LUCKY to get it on super duper mark down</li>
            <li> During the first few weeks, it left several marks on my skin that I wasn&#x27;t happy about.</li>
            <li> Other brands like Braun use a liquid detergent pack, which is easy to spill, and takes up WAY to much room in a closet or drawer.</li>
            <li> The reviews were positive, it scored slightly higher than the one being advertised, it was said to handle the neck very well, that it was quiet, held a charge, plus it also had the self cleaning device, if one wanted to use it.  </li>
            <li> I have to make a few extra passes at the neck area - but other than that - excellent performance on rest of face.</li>
            <li> recommend this shaving system to anyone who wants to try a new electric razor.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this shaving system to anyone who wants to try a new electric razor.  </li>
            <li> I just decided to get the whole new razor as it was ~2X</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t make much sense to keep buying parts for that one compared to a new one, so I upgraded to the ES8109 and will craigslist the ES8162 (hopefully).      </li>
            <li> Since I am not planning to use it (cleaning by hand may be less fun for some people, but it seems to be more effective and it definitely costs less effort, time, and energy), I could probably have saved a considerable amount of money by selecting one of the Pansonic shavers that come without the cleaning device.</li>
            <li> I have always enjoyed Panasonic products and noticed this razor at half the asking price of the Braun.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic does a better job in less time.  </li>
            <li> The power button certainly is in an odd place where I suspect most men put their thumb when shaving</li>
            <li> What amazes me is the battery, which is much better than my previous model of Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic E8109s costs twice as much as my older shavers, but you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> I had been leery of buying an electric razor for several years, after using Brauns for many years, then switching back to a blade because no electric razor shaves as close as a blade...    </li>
            <li> I use it mainly with shaving cream</li>
            <li> In this day and age when most products are mediocre performers, and  only last for a year at most this Panasonic has performed outstandingly since I have owned it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different shavers, and this is the only one I can recommend.</li>
            <li> My above review was somewhat a rant, but I still feel it adequately reflects my feelings for this razor.</li>
            <li> In order for this to do half-way decent</li>
            <li> After a while, when I noticed people started assuming I was about ten years older than I actually am, I decided I better start shaving again.  </li>
            <li> It takes a lot longer to shave compared to my older phillips shaver with 3 circular heads.</li>
            <li> was to get a decent shave.</li>
            <li> It looked to be the only well rated one around $100 which was probably because its not Panasonic&#x27;s most recent model.    </li>
            <li> I bought this product based on my experience with older Panasonic models.  </li>
            <li> and still this thing misses a decent amount of hair.  </li>
            <li> It was a gift as I gave up on getting a decent shave with a electric razor years ago.  </li>
            <li> &quot;  does a decent job on the face, routinely misses neck hairs, leaves stray hairs on the neck.  </li>
            <li> I tried a shaving oil for the last three days, American Crew, and it is even better than shaving gel.</li>
            <li> They are affordable and work better then the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> The main thing about it is that it does not tug and scrape on my face</li>
            <li> I had an older Panasonic shaver that I got about 6 years ago that I decided to replace with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I HAD A OLDER MODEL OF THE VORTEX AND JUST THOUGHT I WOULD SEE WHAT</li>
            <li> Have been using it for six months now and have no serious complaints.    </li>
            <li> Works exceptionally well to shave the head - wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> I have not burned my neck since I began using it, and it stays much cleaner than my old razor, thanks to the HydraClean System and even the ease of cleaning with running under a faucet.</li>
            <li> I am sure it will out last my LAST Brauns 90 day life span.</li>
            <li> Ok, this is only my second electric razor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect these types of electronics to last forever, but I do expect them to last more than 13 months.  </li>
            <li> Has to go over same spot many times to only get 3/4.</li>
            <li> I miss the charging stand that came with my older Panasonic shaver.  </li>
            <li> With the Panasonic I found that you can go over the same spot 2-3 times and from different directions to make sure you don&#x27;t miss anything.  </li>
            <li> and I would blow through razors like they where going out of style so mainly I just used a beard trimmer to keep it stubbly/short and said to hell with razors</li>
            <li> With this razor I mainly use it</li>
            <li> by the end of the week my face hurts and this is the main reason I did not shave on my time off.  </li>
            <li> The razor is quieter than the older linear models, which will be a   relief to some.    </li>
            <li> It gives you a close and quick shave if you lack time in the morning to do a proper shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The very first shave was done completely dry and did better than I expected.</li>
            <li> It seems like no matter what I do, whether it&#x27;s using special shaving cream, hot wash cloths on my face, the finest disposable razors, etc, that I get nicks, ingrown hairs, and general irritation if I use a regular disposable razor.  </li>
            <li> On the positive side, you can connect the charging cord directly to the shaver, bypassing the cleaning</li>
            <li> Very smooth and very minimal skin irritation,that&#x27;s saying a lot since I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although this product is touted as suitable for wet use, I found that the shave quality suffers greatly unless you rinse off the shaver and your face every couple</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more, and this is definitely my favorite attribute; with the method above there&#x27;s so little irritation (only on the outskirts underneath my chin)</li>
            <li> It did a little better job around the neck area but after every shave my neck would be red and severely sensitive with some light hair still there.</li>
            <li> Good luck to the thick bearded!</li>
            <li> I bought a high end Remington to leave at the gym</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> So, I would highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> Travel charger cord makes it possible to take it with you even for longer trips but generally one full charge is good at least 10 shaves.  </li>
            <li> The high speed shaving is the difference.</li>
            <li> I will highly recommend the clients to get this model.</li>
            <li> Give it about a week so that your skin gets used to the high power blades before you comment on the quality of the shave.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anybody.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a quality shaver, I highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations with this razor.</li>
            <li> I generally try to alternate every other day with razor/electric shaves; however, when I&#x27;m traveling and use this more often, I get a significant amount of ingrown hairs/pimple looking bumps.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recomend buying this razor.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>

            <li> I would highly recommend this shaver for those who want an electric option for head shaving.  </li>
            <li> I will highly recommend this shaver...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> And this wasn&#x27;t just for the Panasonic foil I bought, which was the ES8109S, but all of the Panasonics were getting consistently high reviews.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Unlike some reviewers, I am not bothered by the hum or high pitched noise it makes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Everything feels like it was made from quality materials with high standards of construction.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a proven, reliable, charger.</li>
            <li> This product has high RPM</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone that swears by electrics, as it is smooth, comfortable, can work wet or dry, and leaves you with the smoothest shave you can have from an electric.</li>
            <li> The clean shaver icon takes to long to come on</li>
            <li> I was sad to see my older razer go since it had the great induction charging that was the halmark of older Panasonic razors.  </li>
            <li> I also have noticed that I can shave my face more frequently as well, every other day bringing it to 3 times a week instead of the 2 before hand.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s only one significant drawback, it&#x27;s LOUD.  </li>
            <li> the setup is good as far as being useable wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> My beard doesn&#x27;t grow fast, and it&#x27;s not very thick</li>
            <li> I really love this little beauty.</li>
            <li> Hesitantly i decided to try this Panasonic shaver after reading the reviews here - WOW !!  </li>
            <li> I was a little reluctant making the change to a foil, and I&#x27;m glad I switched.</li>
            <li> I have found that squirting a little hand soap on top of the blades and running the razor about 20 seconds every now and</li>
            <li> A little better then</li>
            <li> Then I only use the complete clean cycle once a week or so which should extend the life of the cleaner cartridges.</li>
            <li> (    The trimmer and self-cleaning features are good but main functionality is broken, so doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> I was excited as a kid on christmas when this thing got to my house, and made the mistake of attempting to shave with it dry, since I didn&#x27;t have time for a shower.  </li>
            <li> I can easily shave with this, put on my uniform and go in for a shift; something I would have never considered with other electrics.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too many nitpickers around here complaining about stuff that doesn&#x27;t matter.t live in cities near other people and stuff</li>
            <li> At times i find my self really impressed on how close of a shave I get from this bad boy.</li>
            <li> I have found both to be much quieter than my old braun.</li>
            <li> I also enjoy using this electric shaver wet (i.e., with shaving gel).</li>
            <li> I use my shaver dry and it is perfectly clean.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;service\\&quot; department requires that you send in the whole system for a remedy, and hangs up on you when you question the wisdom of that course of action.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t really see a clear winner.</li>
            <li> The vortex cleaner is sweet,you can charge and dry this baby when you&#x27;re done and clean it every week or two.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot of foam or cream, just a light wet coat to give your face</li>
            <li> This one works very well and shaves me as close if not closer than my old rotary shaver.  </li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews, but I tend to benefit from them and this gadget blew me away.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first because of all of the good reviews that it had.  </li>
            <li> but you know, normally.)</li>
            <li> Not a complaint but just a word of caution.  </li>
            <li> I still use lather/foam to shave with this shaver and the shave is so close that the 5 O clock shadow always shows up late :) by as much as a whole day !</li>
            <li> Although admittedly it gets a closer cut, I don&#x27;t see it being worth the extra 25 minutes it takes to shave.</li>
            <li> I will be looking for their newer and better products in the coming few days to replace this workhorse.</li>
            <li> No irritation or razor burn or nicks ( normally caused by Gillette Mach3)</li>
            <li> I will try it for a few more days and then will decide whether its a keeper.   </li>
            <li> The Panasonic trimmers are so narrow, on all of these models, that you will not be able to trim sideburns with one attempt.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, many hundreds of dollars later, I decided to try one of the Panasonic linear wet/dry shavers I had seen advertised for so long.</li>
            <li> Well worth the extra couple of bucks.  </li>
            <li> So this was well worth the money though if I could go back I would save some money and just buy the shaver by itself.</li>
            <li> because it&#x27;s pretty much the only place I could find it and</li>
            <li> PS: For the last few years I have been buying panasonic products and have been very very pleased.</li>
            <li> I had to shave several times a day - and it just wasn&#x27;t worth</li>
            <li> I mentioned this thing can get as close as a normal razor does.  </li>
            <li> It works great and is a little bit quieter than the previous model.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned about cleaning frequency but the once every few weeks when the battery gets run down seems to work just great for me.</li>
            <li> I have a very tough, fast-growing (and increasingly grey) beard and this shaver does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic shaver is great, used wet or dry, and the battery lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> The combination of the swivel head that contours over your face with the high RPMs of the blade that capture even the toughest hairs make for an extremely close, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> Most times i just rinse the blades under the tap and leave the head open to dry.</li>
            <li> ; Its powerful, very close shave even on dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is about half as loud and the HydraClean system has more pluses to it than the Braun&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> The 8103 is the same razor without the fancy charging and cleaning system and frankly if I was reading this and couldn&#x27;t afford this one and needed/wanted it RIGHT</li>
            <li> Very shiek and nice but sucks biggest waist of my money!</li>
            <li> The result is a perfectly clean shaver; and I mean just-out-of-the-box clean.  </li>
            <li> I have tried it in the shower with and without shaving cream, and my face looks fine til I get out of the shower and notice several missed hairs, especially on my neck.</li>
            <li> It shave very clean but does have trouble getting the area below his nose.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it exclusively for several months and despite my best efforts it still gives a pretty bad shave.</li>
            <li> The only benefit to that is that it doesn&#x27;t take as long per shave if you use it more frequently.</li>
            <li> So as to not be long winded, the moral of the story is: Close, comfortable, convenient shave at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic has options for a few different modes, but I&#x27;m not sure which is the best method yet.</li>
            <li> Used to take 15-20 minutes to shave with the Braun and now it takes a little over 10 minutes for the same kind of shave.  </li>
            <li> As far as performance goes, it is just as good as the blade I was using for the past several years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shaved with the new ES8109S shaver for a few days now, and my first impression after the very first shave was that I got a very close shave (consistent with the performance of my prior Panasonics) and, try to understand this</li>
            <li> am \\&quot; scared \\&quot; away from new things</li>
            <li> and I needed a new shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this new shaver for a week, and I&#x27;ve used it three times.  </li>
            <li> and I decided to buy a new model.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like brand new</li>
            <li> I decided to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> I researched new razors and saw a lot of favorable comments connected to the Panasonic Vortex, so I decided to try it.    </li>
            <li> There is no way to replace the batteries so you just have to throw the shaver away and get a new one.</li>
            <li> I decided to try using Edge shave gel with my new razor.</li>
            <li> In fact I look forward to using my new Panasonic every morning.</li>
            <li> When I used the honey&#x27;s new razor I had NO razor burn, NO pulling,</li>
            <li> Had I known the differences were so slim, I would have gone ahead and bought new blades and screen for my 8103.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind the Norelcos, but was at the point of needing new blades.  </li>
            <li> Given the cost of the new blades</li>
            <li> I decided to try something new and bought this razer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once you feel the razor tugging, it&#x27;s time for a new blade.  </li>
            <li> I tried it for 30 days (as you&#x27;re supposed to do with any new shaving treatment before judging) and it never got better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> where I live the cost of water would make that a luxury I don&#x27;t chose to afford so haven&#x27;t tried that.    </li>
            <li> - The cleaner unit requires $10-13 &#x27;recharge&#x27; units every three months or so, which are basically new soap cartridges.  </li>
            <li> Even a new blade doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to give it 30 days as your face adjusts to the new shaving technique.  </li>
            <li> My husband loves his new shaver.  </li>
            <li> Still runs but needs a new set of blades.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had to buy a new cartridge.    </li>
            <li> Where do you live, in an isolation chamber?  </li>
            <li> I started my search for a new shaver and came across this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Since the Braun needed a new screen and blades</li>
            <li> I have had it for a couple of years and still performs like new.</li>
            <li> I just replaced foils and blades, its like new again.</li>
            <li> but it went downhill from there and didn&#x27;t improve with new cutter and screen.</li>
            <li> I have a set nearly new cutters and foil and two spare cleaning cartridges and no shaver.  </li>
            <li> In the instructions it says \\&quot;Give your beard 30 days to adjust to the new razor and it will grow out softer and easier to shave.\\</li>
            <li> they sent me a new Panasonic ES-LA-93 three head shaver.  </li>
            <li> the price of a new head.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li> My husband loves his new Panasonic ES8109S.  </li>
            <li> I live in a condo with my bathroom wall facing another unit</li>
            <li> Compared to a brand new, out of the box blade, the blade will shave closer.  </li>
            <li> These new blades are *</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this shaver to anyone in the market for a new one.</li>
            <li> Heck, maybe it&#x27;s the new curved blade and foil assembly that reduces irritation or something.</li>
            <li> it works like new.  </li>
            <li> Time to teach an old dog new tricks!</li>
            <li> : After 3 months of daily use, i feel that i dont get a shave as smooth as i initially got when the blades on this were new</li>
            <li> I only used it for a few weeks, I liked the Braun as well as the Panasonic when it was new</li>
            <li> The wet dry option makes it even better, and I seem to get a closer (straight razor close) shave using it in the shower with a shaving gel.</li>
            <li> Also the side-burn push acctuator is less than easy to put-in-play.</li>
            <li> It shaves way closer than the Remington and more comfortably (and less messily) than my Mach 3.  </li>
            <li> It shaves very close and it is not as loud as my old one.  </li>
            <li> It looks like shaving with a Norelco again is not in my future as it never cut as good as this Panosonic does either wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> However, it is only comfortable because it doesn&#x27;t actually shave.</li>
            <li> My roomate was so kind to let me use his Panasonic because the Mach 3 would have caused some serious damage.  </li>
            <li> If you are like me and not too sure about it cutting as close as a razor,well let me fill ya in, i was using a Gillette Fusion Razor,and this thing cuts better</li>
            <li> The facial shave seems to be quite good either on wet or dry shave</li>
            <li> It simply does not shave close enough to make my neck feel smooth like a blade.  </li>
            <li> The first thing you will notice is the weight and the comfortable handle (I have small hands).  </li>
            <li> additional features are water based cleaning base (cheaper refills), super accurate sideburn trimmer, and nice display.  </li>
            <li> It has worked decent for me so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be adding more after a wet shave and a longer period of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s more quiet than I expected.  </li>
            <li> He gets a clean shave in less time than the straight edge.</li>
            <li> it charges fast and cleans easily, and i really like the drying mechanism (though it is a bit noisy and slow).  </li>
            <li> There really did not appear to be a major difference between the rotary and foil products.</li>
            <li> My face is very sensitive and this one never irritates it.</li>
            <li> Very gentle and quiet.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item for my husband who has very sensitive skin and boy</li>
            <li> My husband has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive, but this razor does not irritate the skin at all.  </li>
            <li> Both the cleaning cycle and the shaver itself are VERY loud.</li>
            <li> In summary, I highly recommend the Panasonic ES8109S shaver to persons like me with sensitive skin that is prone to irritation</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive neck</li>
            <li> His old electric left his face feeling whiskery even right after he shaved.</li>
            <li> just right with out slipping and taking to much</li>
            <li> The cleaning system also works fine and there are no major technical downfalls.&lt;br</li>
            <li> if it was a little quieter and didn&#x27;t need so many passes over the same problem areas I would give it 5 stars because it really does shave close.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver because you can use it both wet or dry and shaves extremely close</li>
            <li> Initially, I bought this (1) due to my previous experience with a Panasonic shaver; and (2) the great price on Amazon.     </li>
            <li> I will most likely go back to dry shaving very soon.  </li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> And, best of all, no concern about cutting my neck!</li>
            <li> The first one was the ES8103 (same model as this</li>
            <li> For most of my shaving life I have used blades but have have also used a couple of Norelco electric shavers in the past.  </li>
            <li> When this one was the same as the first I started looking and found the Panosonic wet/dry.</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> This was my first shaver, I got it after extensive research on which shavers to get.    </li>
            <li> More often than not the others that I&#x27;ve tried in the past would leave me with ingrown hairs and razor bumps.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it shaves as close   as a regular razor, but it shaves pretty damn close -- if you&#x27;re in a hurry, you can take the thing with you and shave in the  car.      </li>
            <li> /&gt;Writing back after over a year of using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Still holding up pretty well.</li>
            <li> The Braun ones have it it all in one which causes larger packaging and higher cost in the end.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m willing to give that up for a razor and cleaner that actually works.</li>
            <li> I even developed dermatitis from time to time!</li>
            <li> If you get 3yrs out of it its worth it in the long run plus it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin at all.  </li>
            <li> I did not seea big improvement from the first day to</li>
            <li> Actually bought this one as a gift for my son, but I have one exactly like it.  </li>
            <li> My first was a Braun Syncro 7526 (with a cleaning stand), which I bought back in January of 2001.  </li>
            <li> Wow!-</li>
            <li> I have owned my first and last Panasonic shaver.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning station is pretty quite; however, do not start the cleaning cycle and leave the room while your wife is sleeping in the next room.  </li>
            <li> I bought my first Panasonic almost ten years ago.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> is no small drop in the bucket for me when it comes to this stuff.    </li>
            <li> It is my second electric razor, first being a Braun that lasted me 7 years.  </li>
            <li> Initially I was planning on getting another higher priced Braun, but was pulled to the Panasonic by a couple of points.  </li>
            <li> I read somewhere that blade shaving looks closer at first because it causes the skin to swell, but that wears off after a short period of time.  </li>
            <li> It feels better than the Panasonic I used for the past four years.</li>
            <li> Loud!  </li>
            <li> Loud!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Panasonic electric shaver with nano blade technology (ES8228 or ES8109S) for the past 2 months and love it.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I shave with an eletric razor that I feel it can get as close as a traditional razor.  </li>
            <li> I just shaved with a blade for the first time in a year and was amazed at how short it took me.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I am not giving it a 5 star rating is because they always make a couple of small changes that keep the replacement blades and hydra clean system from one model from fitting the next model....</li>
            <li> I use it every morning and only clean &amp; charge it when the battery gets low.  </li>
            <li> This unit has exceptional quality and the charging/cleaning base outstanding.  </li>
            <li> My reasons for doing so were just about the reasons of everyone who prefers razors: My beard grows thick and quick, and within a week I&#x27;ve usually got a good \\&quot;crumb catcher\\&quot; going.</li>
            <li> But compared to a blade that is a couple of days old, this is at least equal, and compared to a four day old blade, the Panasonic is superior.  </li>
            <li> the clean cycle simply doesn&#x27;t do a very good job and the controls for selecting what you want the base to do</li>
            <li> so I cannot comment about how loud it is or how big it is, although it was bigger then i originally.  </li>
            <li> From the other popular brands and more expensive price tags, this shaver is an under rated sleeper.     </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to buy a new foil for my 7 year old braun and just start using that again.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been bothering me since Christmas for a new shaver, so I let him get an early start for Father&#x27;s day.</li>
            <li> My old ES8067 still shaves closer than this new \\&quot;NANO Technology\\&quot;- a misnomer (marketing gimmick).</li>
            <li> I replaced an old panasonic with this new one.</li>
            <li> I go by the sound of the head to judge how long or short the whiskers are.</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t use  the autoclean function very often(too long and noisy).  </li>
            <li> My 3+ year old Braun 7526 Syncro with Clean and Charge finally had enough.</li>
            <li> With this model, I simply have to very lightly run it back and forth along the grain (as per the instructions) and it is able to cut down my beard millimeter by millimeter, much less hassle than using a razor.    </li>
            <li> Provides a close shave, trimmer works fine, battery requires little charging.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable in my hand and much like shaving with a big bladed conventional razor.    </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have yet to find a Target, Wal-Mart or similar discount store that stocks replacement foils and blades or cleaning solution for the HydraClean system, but that is no major problem since these items are readily available at good prices via Amazon.    </li>
            <li> until there&#x27;s no more gel on your face, then give it one last good rinse before setting it in for a daily cleaning/charge.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to see so many average ratings and discovered from several written reviews that Gillette had purchased Braun.  </li>
            <li> My old and worn Panasonic Vortex shaver battery died and instead of sending it to California to be fixed, I decided to get a new one.  </li>
            <li> This commercial claims that it really gets the neck very well and the new design allows for an overall new electric razor experience.    </li>
            <li> Panasonic exceed my expectations, and glad I chose one with wet and dry capabilities.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried electric shavers that were half this price, and I&#x27;ve tried electric shavers that were more than double this price.  </li>
            <li> I have always used a dry shave, and the Panasonic gave me a smooth shave in the same amount of time.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK as a dry razor but one would think that using it wet would give a close shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The plastic casing on this model is thinner than previous models which will most likely equate to easier</li>
            <li> He has tried it both wet and dry and, either way, was quite pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is still a perfectly adequate razor and I will be using it for the next fifteen years in all likelihood.</li>
            <li> He actually admits that there has been tremendous progress in electric shavers in the last 20 years!</li>
            <li> It performed well, but the replacement blades started to go down in quality significantly.</li>
            <li> , i live the different settings on the charger, if i want to charge, clean, or dry.  </li>
            <li> but it lasts a long time and works better than any other pre electric shave lotion I&#x27;ve tried.    </li>
            <li> but I have tried a golf club grip a few times which worked fine but will take some getting used to.    </li>
            <li> Also, I like the large digital display of the power level ...</li>
            <li> So, I researched the razor described above, from the commercial, and while its overall rating was quite good, the negatives were real and very concise, especially about its lack of quality in the neck area, the very thing it was selling so hard.    </li>
            <li> Of course it&#x27;s not completely gone, but after a few weeks of use, this razor is performing better than my standard disposable razors: I&#x27;m able to shave 5-days/week with minimal irritation!    </li>
            <li> This razor does the best job with those weird little hairs on my neck and has yet to give me an ingrown</li>
            <li> As for noise, cheap feel, and so on I agree with other negative reviews, but honestly I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it were twice as loud and felt like a toy, so long as it could shave my face.  </li>
            <li> I prefered a dry shave, as I didn&#x27;t think it would stay very clean if it were getting wet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few years since I last tried an electric (rotary) shaver but the new foils like this really have come a long way in a few years and give an amazing, quick shave.  </li>
            <li> When I need it later it is dry and clean, even on the inside.</li>
            <li> this shaver is a clear \\&quot;Buy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I was put on antibiotics to clear up this infection.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it was an improvement over the old shaver, in spite of the old one having a 5 year old foil/cutter assembly.  </li>
            <li> I can read it clearly without my glasses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Panasonic is a clear winner here as well.  </li>
            <li> The instructions made it clear that it might take 30 days for your beard to get used to it, so don&#x27;t give up.  </li>
            <li> Im a daily shaver, and this thing saved me so much time every morning.</li>
            <li> old and have shaved with a blade ever since I began to shave.</li>
            <li> You may have sensitive skin or may not take well to an electric, but that&#x27;s not the razor&#x27;s fault.  </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s a bit loud if you have it near your bed</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the closeness of this razor.</li>
            <li> It smells like old school aftershave and supposedly stands your whiskers up for the shave.</li>
            <li> Ultimately, I bought this razor to save money on fusion blades, which are costing me a reasonable chunk of cash.  </li>
            <li> I have to go over my face a few times but it gives a close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t find it loud, as one reviewer mentioned.  </li>
            <li> The pop up trimmer makes this razor a complete grooming tool.  </li>
            <li> Item is completely as described.</li>
            <li> The skin feels soft after a shave.</li>
            <li> but my old Braun out performs the Panasonic in this arena as well.  </li>
            <li> a 2-year warranty, March 2013 isn&#x27;t too far off.</li>
            <li> I will use Dermologica Professional Shave</li>
            <li> I was very upset to finally use it and to realize that it isn&#x27;t doing anything.</li>
            <li> I knew it could never get near the closeness of a blade, but I had hopes it would get the job done.</li>
            <li> No noticeable reduction in performance or ability to hold charge and it has been used nearly every day for 2 years.     </li>
            <li> It is quiet, fast and gives you a close shave.</li>
            <li> Throughout my adult life I have alternated between electric and bladed razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent the last two months trying what I could, replenishing cartridges, using it daily, changing the water more often.......</li>
            <li> I have a beard like wire and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have gotten the &#x27;bumps&#x27; from Norelco style razors.</li>
            <li> Whole system is simple to use including changing out cleaning</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons - Cleaning system and shaver are a bit loud.  </li>
            <li> so I gave it to him early.  </li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> He says it gives him a close shave, and does not have any problems with it giving him sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> As far as how well itworks.  </li>
            <li> It seems to do the job; however does not seem to shave as close as my old electric (cheaper Remington) shaver.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the closet electric shave I have found so far.</li>
            <li> by far.</li>
            <li> old father.</li>
            <li> I have only had it for a week or so at the time of writing this review and it works really, really well.  </li>
            <li> The shave actually is close, the operation is smooth, and it is quiet enough that you can hear it cut the hairs!</li>
            <li> Takes 4-5 times for a complete shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m done with panasonic shaver, back to the blades, much quicker.</li>
            <li> which it also holds a charge very well; for several days, maybe even a week.</li>
            <li> It is very well built it will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> my old 20.00 electric shaver i had to have a cord connected to the power company just to use it.    </li>
            <li> The shave I get really is as close as my regular razor.  </li>
            <li> No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> and it is ready to go when I need my next shave.  </li>
            <li> I use it in the shower with shave gel and get nearly as close a shave as I would with a blade with NONE of the irritation.</li>
            <li> And the skin is always sensitive.  </li>
            <li> my old electrics</li>
            <li> but it charges fast enough</li>
            <li> If it works like my Braun that has a year old blade does, then I will be unsatisfied.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Panasonic wet/dry shaving system for nearly twenty years.  </li>
            <li> I am never going back to a regular razor blade ever again, this razor left my face soo smooth, and I don&#x27;t get the razor burn from it either</li>
            <li> the cleansing system is loud too so you must remember to start it in the morning before going to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought this razor hoping for a solution to my irritable and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old Norelco circular-blade razor with this one from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace my 10yr(+/-) old Panasonic Linear shaver.  </li>
            <li> His old shaver had run it&#x27;s course a while ago and he had gotten used to using the disposable blades.</li>
            <li> works well with his sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It shaves close, and doesn&#x27;t pinch like my old rotary shaver, and it shaves faster and closer</li>
            <li> Very please with my purchase and would definitely buy another as a replacement.     </li>
            <li> I tried to give the unit to my brother who, after testing it, thanked me for the generosity but insisted on sticking with old school razors.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic not only dries your shaver with heat, but also a fan to really air it out.  </li>
            <li> In the end, I not only saved money, but got my hands on a real gem of a shaver:  </li>
            <li> Not only do they not shave very well</li>
            <li> While this razor still works, it is loaded with mildew in the cracks and creavases which the old razor wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Went from 6 year old Braun to this and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li> My old Braun pouch will work with this razor and power supply though...</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try an electric because recently my face has been getting very irritated and breaking out after shaving with a blade.  </li>
            <li> When the unit is charging the shaver, it is loud.</li>
            <li> wow.  </li>
            <li> HOW MUCH CHARGE IS LEFT.</li>
            <li> I love it, since I shave him at least once a week.</li>
            <li> I found that you don&#x27;t have to use the station all the time as you can plug the station&#x27;s electrical cord directly into the shaver for charging purposes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> loud-</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement to a four or five year old Panasonic wet-dry.  </li>
            <li> in operation it is a tad loud.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a blade since I was 18 years old.  </li>
            <li> and I would still be using it if I were not concerned about how much longer the battery would last.  </li>
            <li> one tip that will save you some money - dont use the Vortex cleaning system as frequently as the manual says.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver to replace my existing 6 year old Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> As far as electric razors go, this one is up there in terms of efficiency and comfort.  </li>
            <li> Loud to the point where you worry about waking people up if you use it early in the morning.</li>
            <li> This is, however, the loudest (and it is loud) of all shavers and there are no bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any deterioration of the blades so far, unlike the Norelco that seemed to fade after 4-5 months</li>
            <li> i did not realize how worn out my old shaver was until i used this one.  </li>
            <li> He loves it and comments frequently about how well it works.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and had an issue of ingrown hairs, but now I get none.</li>
            <li> Drop it into the cleaner/charger and it&#x27;s ready to go the next day</li>
            <li> so it explains that I did not want to try one because of the sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> In places where it did shave, my skin felt sensitive and inflamed afterwards.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely important to allow a few weeks for your skin to adapt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit loud</li>
            <li> old Norelco 9160XL</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get nearly as close a shave.  </li>
            <li> This will be my first impressions rather than a long term quality review.  </li>
            <li> I consider my skin to be relatively sensitive.  </li>
            <li> You can actually hear how fast the blades are moving...</li>
            <li> My stubble isnt very stubborn and that possibly helps.    </li>
            <li> and this is by far the closest, smoothest shave</li>
            <li> but so far I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> It completely died on me in February 2011.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that my wife wants me to shave more often than once a week.[[ASIN:B000VKZMHK Panasonic ES8109S Vortex Wet/Dry Shaver with Nano Technology and HydraClean System]]</li>
            <li> Bought because my husband needed to replace the heads in his old shaver.  </li>
            <li> For the cleaning station, I dont have much to say about it yet as I have only used it about 3 times.  </li>
            <li> I could not tell how much reserve was left.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a snap to wash the heads out under the faucet and charge with the direct, plug in charger.  </li>
            <li> So far my face and neck do not hurt and no bleeding from the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is be far the loudest shaver I have used, louder then the Braun and way louder then the Norelco rotary.  </li>
            <li> I do get a few nicks from this each day, but none are enough to need to do anything to staunch the bleeding or otherwise address the issue (which is more than I can say for a 3 day old blade).  </li>
            <li> old</li>
            <li> but the 9595 needed replacing and naturally I started reading reviews of the newer Brauns.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use it and post updates but from what I have seen so far</li>
            <li> Razor is much louder than the Norelco, enough that I have to shave in the guest bathroom</li>
            <li> maybe too early to tell,</li>
            <li> Much rather use a regular razor.</li>
            <li> Also, the docking station is loud if that&#x27;s something your conscious about, I can hear it from across the house in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I bought the Panasonic ES8109S Vortex Wet/Dry Shaver with Nano Technology and HydraClean System, at age 50 (still young in my book).  </li>
            <li> The noise from operation is fairly quiet, and very tolerable.  </li>
            <li> recommend this razor for the person who prefers a blade, but wants to try something different.  </li>
            <li> It does not drain completely.  </li>
            <li> I have used a blade razor all my adult life.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t need much water and you only replace it when you replace the cleaning catridge.  </li>
            <li> I still use my old Panasonic ES8068 from years ago.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t necessarily like keeping a beard, but I disliked shaving even more, so I just stopped.  </li>
            <li> it will definitely miss more than a few hairs.  </li>
            <li> So keep it cool and the shaver foil and blade should last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I just wanted to use it for a few more months and switch back to blades.</li>
            <li> The last 3 Panasonic shavers I have purchased each lasted at least 2 years, so I decided to purchase the 8109S with the handy shaver cleaner/charger.  </li>
            <li> Overall pleased, but a few of my observations have been:  Pros:  </li>
            <li> If you like an electric shaver, this is a good (though a bit expensive) choice.</li>
            <li> 2nd Shave: WOW!!!</li>
            <li> I have had to switch back to blades many times because other electric shavers couldn&#x27;t shave close enough.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for many years, and it has always been uncomfortable to shave more than every other day whether I used a blade or shaver.</li>
            <li> He said most shavers he has used in the past has always tugged on his hairs and this one doesn&#x27;t do that at all!</li>
            <li> It took me less than half the time, under 3 minutes, to get a shave that was far better than what the Spectra will ever be capable of, and that&#x27;s coming from a foil \\&quot;virgin\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Why take up extra counter space with something to put this in, at extra cost, when this is so simple to clean my six year old grandson could do it?</li>
            <li> Now, this doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close as he can get with a traditional sharp razor but it truly does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> The dry shave was closer than the shave with shaving cream the first couple of days, but it seems to be shaving closer as I continue using shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> Based upon other reviewers, I was expecting it to sound like a lawn mower, but it is just an occasional buzzing noise as it cleans.</li>
            <li> After not shave for a week, I shaved dry for the first use.  </li>
            <li> This shaver did well the first time I used it with just a dry face.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this system to anyone interested in a quality shave and long lasting equipment.</li>
            <li> I clean the shaver head with a little liquid soap in the palm of my hand.</li>
            <li> but I think the clean bucket of little use.</li>
            <li> Completely recommended, no down side yet 2 months out.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was broken, but when I changed the cleaning cartridge it worked fine again.</li>
            <li> it glides very smoothly but doesn&#x27;t seem to shave any closer than dry, and using it wet takes extra time fussing with lather and cleanup</li>
            <li> I got this shaver and tried it for about four weeks, wet and dry, many different configurations.  </li>
            <li> Cartridges\\&quot; every few months (assuming you clean your shaver using the HydraClean system)...lame.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is much less expensive than the top-end Braun, which I haven&#x27;t tried, but I&#x27;m glad I bought this one as I don&#x27;t see how an electric shaver could perform much better.</li>
            <li> I used slight pressure and a smooth long motion like you would normally use, but I did this in 3 directions.  </li>
            <li> With extra effort I could get a decent shave.    </li>
            <li> A solid razor with a self contained cleaning unit for a decent price.    </li>
            <li> Have used many different razors in the past.</li>
            <li> First shave is the most difficult.</li>
            <li> It was obviously translated by someone who&#x27;s first language was definitely not English.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why exactly, maybe it was simply because I feel that it actually works, but I even have \\&quot;fun\\&quot; using it.      </li>
            <li> Panasonic&#x27;s cleaning detergent is small, simple, and safe.</li>
            <li> However, since it&#x27;s only a hair or two, once in a while, I simply pull out a regular disposable razor and do a quick clean-up with no problems.    </li>
            <li> use electric razors because my beard requires hot steam treatment prior to shaving with a regular razor.  </li>
            <li> and you will definitely be better off in the long run when you compare to buying shaving cream and triple blade razor heads every few weeks.</li>
            <li> You had to make several passes to get a decent shave.</li>
            <li> Overall decent product for the price.</li>
            <li> I end up using the machine up,down, down up, to left, right, right left.  </li>
            <li> My favorite method, I&#x27;ve found, is dry shaving at the end of the day/beginning when your face isn&#x27;t so sensitive, and just running the blades under some cold water now and then (both to clean them momentarily, lubricate your skin just a tad, and keep them cool - the blades do get hot) while simultaneously moving it in small circles over the area you want shaved (almost like brushing your teeth).    </li>
            <li> And it is a cool little toy that does work well</li>
            <li> After going through the gauntlet with pretty much every other high and low end electric shaver out there, I decided to try this Panasonic (a decision I made from reading these reviews on Amazon actually).  </li>
            <li> Other times I just clean the shaver with my hands under running water using regular hand soap.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would highly recommend this razor.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend use of lather for the closest possible shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using this shaver with a glycerin-based shaving gel, such as those by Gilette or Nivea with MicroTec.  </li>
            <li> Overall I highly recommend this shaver and am planning on getting another one for my father for Christmas.</li>
            <li> As far as other reviews stating that it can be loud, this is true, but after using in the morning, I am on my way out the door, so I am not generally there to notice.  </li>
            <li> They would just vibrate in a strange manner, not enough to actually cut (no, it wasn&#x27;t the turbo clean mode).  </li>
            <li> I developed new areas of razor burn on my face (even in the fourth week)</li>
            <li> Knowing that Panasonic shavers were available for using wet with lotion, and having tried one dry (</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how smooth my skin was after shaving with this model, dry or wet</li>
            <li> The wet dry feature is fantastic as well.</li>
            <li> Also, its nice that when you put it into the base you can select from various modes, charge, clean, dry, or combinations of those, so if you just want to clean it, but not charge, you have those options.</li>
            <li> What I used to do with the other two is within the week use the electric razor and during the weekend/going out with girlfriend or special events use the regular razor(mach 3).  </li>
            <li> , you get compact hard soap filled catridges that last much longer.  </li>
            <li> long as the shaver shaves I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Not dead silent, but so much quieter than the Braun I had before it; especially the cleaning cycle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no issues with the gel, as I&#x27;ve read others complained of it becoming \\&quot;gummy\\&quot; or clogged after use.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hold a charge as long, didn&#x27;t have the cleaning system, didn&#x27;t shave as well and was much louder.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic also has several different selectable functions (clean, dry, charge, etc.)</li>
            <li> I unfolded a metal paper clip so that it is a long straight piece of metal.  </li>
            <li> Using a shaving brush, I whipped up some foam on a mug, wet my face with hot water, and lathered it on.  </li>
            <li> Last but not least, neck hairs seem to be a problem for it requiring mulitple passes.  </li>
            <li> With a full beard, I just trim it my upper checks and around and under my neck every other day or so.    </li>
            <li> So I would use that as a first shave and then touch up the rough spots in the shower with a blade.  </li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m patient and go over the same section enough I do feel like I&#x27;ve shaved with a normal razor, but I normally don&#x27;t have the patience.  </li>
            <li> The shaving is very smooth with far less irritation than my previous shavers.</li>
            <li> I think a long term usage review is more useful to know if your hard earned money is being well spent.</li>
            <li> You will notice that without lubricant the blades actually give off a slight grinding, abrasive sound barely noticeable to the ear.  </li>
            <li> Except for the automatic cleaning/charging station, I&#x27;m not sure that this shaver was worth the high price.</li>
            <li> The new motor is far less noisy than the older models--you do not need ear protection anymore!    </li>
            <li> I will probably come back to this review later to update it, but for now all I can say is that the performance of the shaver is EXTREMELY important to me, over aesthetics, cleaning systems, and all that other stuff.  </li>
            <li> The cartridges are better than the Braun because they are dry and simply have a hard soap, vs the Braun that has alcohol and is bulky and costs five times as much.</li>
            <li> This new Panasonic Vortex is a totally different story.</li>
            <li> I have been using the new shaver for several weeks now</li>
            <li> Another future problem with the 4-blade system is that you&#x27;ll want to buy a new shaver when your blades and foil need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco razors since 1968 my last new one I bought in 2005.</li>
            <li> Well, the next time I shaved, I lathered up and went to town with my new razor.</li>
            <li> Not only was it a new unit, but also the updated model (ES8109S).</li>
            <li> it is cleaned and dry ready to go.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, he loves the auto-cleaning and the fact that he can use it in the shower or dry if he wants.  </li>
            <li> With a blade I can only shave about once every 3 or 4 days because shaving short stubble for some reason really irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> However, it was giving me a very close shave until, I believe, the battery finally lost enough power.  </li>
            <li> The one wide foil is not well suited to shaving a round skull and it takes a lot more passes to run the razor closely over all areas.  </li>
            <li> These items are best not completed while sleeping in the room next to the recharging/cleaning base.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but then again I never found a razor that could shave my thick beard perfectly.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts well between charges and maintains strong motor power throughout the discharge cycle, rather than fading slowly as the battery discharges.    </li>
            <li> This one wasn&#x27;t as good as the second, but not as bad as the first.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if mine are standing up any more than usual, but it provides a lubricating quality to your skin which prevents razor burn when you have to go over the same spot several times, which you will be doing if you get any electric shaver.</li>
            <li> The irritation is a major issue though on the neck and adams apple.  </li>
            <li> I did the original charge for the recommended time and usually charged it once a week thereafter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had numerous shavers in the past,this is by the far the closest shave!</li>
            <li> I still have a hard time with the neck area, but otherwise it&#x27;s a fine tool.</li>
            <li> And almost all of them have been Panasonic, because they carry a broad line of wet/dry shavers.</li>
            <li> When the faucet appears on the readout to indicate a self-cleaning is due, I just remove the foil and run the blades under hot water.</li>
            <li> Have had two wet/dry shavers, the only reason I bought this one several years ago is I left the first one in a hotel room.</li>
            <li> After I read the reviews, and looked at the distribution of ratings, it appeared that the Panasonic foil product line was getting consistently higher reviews vs other foils and the rotaries.</li>
            <li> Apparently they did some work since I tried one of these 20 years ago!  </li>
            <li> My husband likes this razor, he says he has a pretty close shave compared to other electric razors.</li>
            <li> Having no other choice</li>
            <li> I can say that it was enough for a very long first shave.  </li>
            <li> Granted the previous 2 were rougly $50 or $60, so you can&#x27;t expect anything more than average from them.  </li>
            <li> The first test was dry, and then the next cut</li>
            <li> Okay, so, let me preface this buy saying that my Dad has been a thick, coarse bearded dude his entire adult life.</li>
            <li> overall i think i might go back to using a braun or an older model panasonic if i can find one .</li>
            <li> The Remington gave a decent shave, but it would actually draw tiny dots of blood around the edges of my mouth, which is a bit too close for comfort.</li>
            <li> It does charge quickly, you have the option to shave dry or wet.</li>
            <li> This was my first attempt to use an electric shaver after about 10 years of conventional shaving.</li>
            <li> Fast forward to a few weeks ago, I purchased this shaver based on the high reviews on Amazon.     </li>
            <li> Also, much like the prior models, the little pop up trimmer on the side of the new shaver is great not only for trimming sideburns (which I actually never use it for), but also for capturing those awkward little hairs that lie flat or may be becoming ingrown.</li>
            <li> This razor gave me a shave equal to or better than any shave I&#x27;ve gotten without using a regular blade (even a somewhat dull blade).    </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that is easily irritated by shaving with blades, and  I was told by quite a few people that this shaver got closer than any other electric out there.    </li>
            <li> But this razor is able to get a very close shave with very little, usually none, irritation.</li>
            <li> My Facial Background: I have very sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve never been able to shave more than once a week due to skin irritation because I would get those water pimples that would make the area painful if I shaved against the grain with a razor or by using those electric razors from the 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I was given this shaver as a Christmas gift, and I generally like it.  </li>
            <li> I generally like it.  </li>
            <li> But, particularly with regard to charging, there is absolutely no reason to have it flash, and since people typically leave their razor in the bathroom, where they may need to go in the middle of the night, a flashing light is actually an annoyance as it tends to wake one up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve returned merchandise before because the instructions in English consisted of two to three words and complete sentences in Spanish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> To add insult to injury, some days I have to be up fairly early for physical training.</li>
            <li> the only problem is the dock is loud and takes forever...</li>
            <li> I have tried salves, electric, manual, and just about everything else, this shaver however, has reduced the red marks and bumps on my neck almost completely.    </li>
            <li> I tried manual razors which took too much \\&quot;prep work\\&quot; and had that rough feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> Now... it still doesn&#x27;t shave and barely cuts hair when i shave against the flow of the hair.</li>
            <li> and yet there is still no need to change the blades, and I have only used one cleaning cartridge so far.</li>
            <li> Once your skin adapts to the shaver you don&#x27;t have to be as gentle and skin irritation is minimal.  </li>
            <li> It seems that 13,000 RPMs does apparently make a difference.  </li>
            <li> Only con to the razor is it is rather loud.</li>
            <li> but I would have to shave the same area on my face for about 4-5 times to get a complete shave</li>
            <li> It does a decent job dry as well.</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t yet had the occasion to use the wet shave feature, I feel that the shaver will perform very well when used in that mode.</li>
            <li> The old shave should be banded from stores.</li>
            <li> All of them have been wet/dry, because shaving with a wet beard gives a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> When it was time to replace my old shaver I wanted to try something that did not require ongoing purchases of cleaning cartridges which were adding up with the Braun after several years.  </li>
            <li> My next shaver will have rotary action.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this shaver for 2 weeks so far</li>
            <li> The Vortex is easy to clean under the faucet, but it also comes with a charging/cleaning base, which works very well.</li>
            <li> He had an old chargeable razor for years and it finally broke.</li>
            <li> I was really suprised how well the shaver works wet.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like I have my old shaver back.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8109S 3-blade - barely.</li>
            <li> but I just find for the price this shaver sells at, far exceeds what it can actually do.</li>
            <li> Prior to this I was a Norelco user for nearly 25 years.  </li>
            <li> Replace that word with \\&quot;sequence\\&quot; and use some other American English words in some other instances and the manual will be more readable.</li>
            <li> apparently the lower ratings were not for the shaving effectiveness at all.  </li>
            <li> Compared to my father&#x27;s old shaver I recall, this is very, very quiet.</li>
            <li> that can be used individually or together for a complete refresh of the unit.</li>
            <li> As in, loud enough that it WILL wake up someone if you shave in a nearby room.</li>
            <li> Also because of my sensitive skin by using the blade, I had to skip shaving the next day.  </li>
            <li> Had my old shaver for about a decade, but the battery finally died.  </li>
            <li> The Vortex quietly cleans, lubricates and even fully recharges your shaver for you (alternatively, you can just plug the power cable for the Vortex directly into the shaver to recharge it).</li>
            <li> The designers apparently thought I needed a mini lightshow in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> First, even when I have skipped a couple of days of of shaving, and my beard is really rough, this shaver does its job smoothly, quietly, and effortlessly.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a good idea to wet my face and use a thin cream to lube my mug for the big event.</li>
            <li> I have shaved with a regular razor and a rotary razor and this is by far the most comfortable and least irritating shaving device I have used.  </li>
            <li> I take blood thinners and got tired of running to the emergency room every time I nicked myself  :) .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit messy, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> usually takes around 2 1/2hrs to FULL Charge.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Remington no longer makes the kind of razor I wanted.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little time to get it just right, but I&#x27;m in the shower and don&#x27;t mind having the water pouring over me as I get my shave on.  </li>
            <li> , I mean if you add up how much it will cost you to use disposable razors or whatever you use you will realize that this price equals out to about the same cost as a years worth of disposable razors.     </li>
            <li> First, what is it supposed to do...clean your razor and then air dry it while charging it back up for the next use</li>
            <li> (plus i only paid $70 in total for a brand new set from amazon).  </li>
            <li> I have tried shaving with this thing many different ways: bone dry, wet in the shower, in the shower with soap on my face, in the shower with regular shaving cream, with a shaving gel, and dry but with Afta pre-electric lotion.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well dry, so you have to spend extra time in the shower in the morning and buy gel for a close shave.  </li>
            <li> Another big difference between Braun &amp; Panasonic cleaning, Braun uses alcohol based liquids which dry up fast no matter</li>
            <li> Like I said, I haven&#x27;t used it a ton yet, and never have I had multiple days&#x27; stubble to shave off, but this shaver is worth every penny (I paid less than $80 for it with the $30 code thru March 31st).  </li>
            <li> I have studied and restudied and restudied the instructions, but still don&#x27;t know how much fluid to put into the reservoir tank initially and how to know when it needs a refill; there is no apparent line on the device marking the limit beyond which the instructions say one must not fill, on penalty of ruining the whole device.    </li>
            <li> Now I can live with the noise as long as the shaver gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Putting in a new cartridge every month for the cleaning system is a minor nag  </li>
            <li> Since you can&#x27;t buy a replacement cleaner, you are forced to buy a new whole new kit.</li>
            <li> However right out of the box I used the panasonic and went over the neck few times and no burn at all.</li>
            <li> This one seems to work better and costs less than half!  </li>
            <li> It has a higher pitch than my previous shavers, but that is not a problem.</li>
            <li> The cleaning units us a dry detergent pack with normal tap water.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this electric shaver my face looked like I was slapped by my wife about half a dozen times.  </li>
            <li> It is slower, more expensive and doesn&#x27;t give a decent shave unless you go over your beard several times.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is due to my face adjusting, me learning better technique, or what.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a top of the line Braun in the past, which extremely   irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li> If you have really thick hair I would save your money till you can buy a more expensive electric razor that may actually cut through your manly beard :)</li>
            <li> This is a shaver and not a magic wand, so it does require several passes to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> I had bought in the past some other shavers but didn&#x27;t work out as it says, but this Panasonic ES8109S Vortex Wet/Dry did so far a great job, I have really hard facial hair</li>
            <li> As for irritation, i did not get to much of that other</li>
            <li> cleaning mode works very well, and again it is quieter than any other self-cleaning shaver I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic wet-dry shavers are very versatile.er foil razors due to its faster speed.      </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t find it much louded than any other electric that I have used.</li>
            <li> The shave is very close and does not irritate my skin like other electric razors.  </li>
            <li> I finally decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the risk of replacing the blades with that shaver so far past the waranty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took me about three times as long as shaving with a normal razor, despite the fact that when I shave with a normal razor I have to get wet, wash my face, use shaving gel and after shave, etc.      </li>
            <li> Needless to say, it didn&#x27;t take long before I was ready to shell out some cash for a better razor.      </li>
            <li> For those of us that live in cities near other people and stuff, I don&#x27;t think this is noisy.  </li>
            <li> I began bleeding and was left with a big red smile looking mark from one side of my neck to the other.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver a year ago, and while I have traditionally preferred blades, I thought I&#x27;d give this one a try due to the positive reviews.      </li>
            <li> My only complaint about it is the cheap travel bag.  </li>
            <li> Also, with all the passes needed to actually cut the hairs, shaving with this razor took me FAR longer than with a blade, so back to blades</li>
            <li> If you keep going over the same spot gently (not baby gently</li>
            <li> and I find myself not having to go over the same spot several times as I was doing with my old razor.  </li>
            <li> but i would consider myself hairy for a young Asian male).</li>
            <li> however I seem to be one of these people who can only get a proper shave using the old low-tech razor.</li>
            <li> The only feature of the shaver that should be improved is the fold-out trimmer, which is even smaller than its predecessor and doesn&#x27;t look and feel as if it has been designed for frequent use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shipped it back and gone back to my old blade razor.</li>
            <li> :       For the actual shave; this thing shaves as close as any straight wet razor.  </li>
            <li> Shaving (the actual act of removing hair) takes a few minutes longer, but it is well worth it</li>
            <li> For this reason I decided to buy replacement screens, but in Amazon&#x27;s many pages of Panasonic razor stuff I find screens for dozens of different razors, but alas, none for this model.</li>
            <li> The most important thing this cleaning base does to your shaver is LUBRICATE.  </li>
            <li> Oh, one more thing, the ES8109S comes with Panasonic&#x27;s latest iteration of its Vortex Cleaning and charging base, which is slightly different from its prior models, but appears to use the same cleaning cartridge.</li>
            <li> Simply stated it shaves like no other razor I have used.  </li>
            <li> Just keep in mind, if this is the first electric shaver for you, it is NOT as close as a razor shave, not even a little bit.</li>
            <li> First, a little background on my shaving history.  </li>
            <li> Recently, I was at a major club/warehouse store and saw this shaver on sale for $99.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s grey so less is better and it is noticeably less with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> The only reason the old unit was retired was that I was due for a new razor/foil set (approx $30).  </li>
            <li> Using the little brush has never really gotten a shaver completely clean and it&#x27;s 5 minutes of time</li>
            <li> only complaint about the shaver is that the location and angle of the trimmer is somewhat awkward for trimming a moustache, though it is perfect for sideburns.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much to add to the other reviews about the actual function of the razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to the real razor, and this one will be used for other areas.</li>
            <li> and I will never go back to a straight razor or any other electric.  </li>
            <li> We both worked on his shaving and decided to get a standard razor to do the hard work and use this razor to clean up the stubble.</li>
            <li> As long as you use soap (nearly any soap will do)</li>
            <li> oddly enough he barely uses it.</li>
            <li> After 6 months, I can barely get an acceptable shave at all, having to go over and over the same area and still not get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> The first few days I was not convinced, and even the product literature will tell you to stick with it.</li>
            <li> The shaver is cool and has all these gadgets but sucks.</li>
            <li> However, it was also messy and probably wasteful of hot water.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully on Amazon, it&#x27;s discounted pretty heavily.</li>
            <li> For the first couple of months I thought I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I did not enjoy the first, so I switched to a Gillet.    </li>
            <li> First of all I have a fairly heavy beard coming from a Welsh background.  </li>
            <li> I shave in the shower so the fancy cleaning system is pretty much a waste of space</li>
            <li> I assume this is from the base not being able to clean it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money - go buy ST2 Sensitive for Men 12 ct for $6.58 at WalMart!!!!</li>
            <li> With a traditional blade, even with my thick hair, I&#x27;d have the initial shaving with little pulses until the area is clean and follow up with a new lather and new shave.  </li>
            <li> several shaves to get used to a new razor and so, takes a little extra time to get close; after only a few minutes of shaving, my face was smooth (almost as close as a blade).</li>
            <li> Instead, I decided to purchase the Panasonic for roughly half the price of the Braun, based on the very high ratings it had received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you hate wasting your money and want to have a good shaver that will last a reasonable amount of time, then buy a different brand.</li>
            <li> but the save was actually closer than a blade (hard to believe I know but true).</li>
            <li> Because the blade and foil are very sharp and have a high RPM, you get cuts periodically...just like a blade!  </li>
            <li> It also has an annoying indicator light that flashes frantically when it is fully charged, as though I should be excited about that information and take some action.</li>
            <li> but did you all notice that your old style blade was not as sharp just prior to the introduction of a new more expensive blade.</li>
            <li> Like any product of this nature getting a new one every 3-5 years is expected.  </li>
            <li> What kind of an idiot is going to spend 80% of the cost of a new shaver just to get a set of new cutter blades and foil?</li>
            <li> This electric razor gives me a much closer shave than the previous name brand I&#x27;d been using.</li>
            <li> I get much closer shaves than my previous rotary razor.  </li>
            <li> and as others have said, doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin as much or leave that \\&quot;slight burn\\</li>
            <li> Generally, cartidges seem to last about a month with daily use, although I now manage quite a bit longer cartridge life by opening the shave head and rinsing off the bulk of the stubble in the sink before sticking it into the unit to be cleaned.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my aging Braun 8500 series razor, which performed consistently well but managed to destroy its foils every 2-3 months recently.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m willing to spend a few extra bucks if it makes a difference.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to be as close shaved as I used to and have been lazy about shaving I thought an electric would get me to trim back the stubble a little more.  </li>
            <li> The hair on my neck really lays down and I must make several passes sometimes when I haven&#x27;t shaved in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> With shaving every other day the battery normally depletes to about 50-60% in a weeks period.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I have is it, like all other electric razors I have used, doesn&#x27;t do very well with the thick stubble right under my chin.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that I could just pick up and shave with -- it would have to be fast and it would have to work both wet and dry.    </li>
            <li> It provides a very close shave either wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> So far I have only used it dry with some pre-shave lotion and it gave me as close a shave as a blade, but without the trauma.</li>
            <li> Very close shave wet or dry</li>
            <li> Really likes the wet or dry feature.</li>
            <li> In this respect, the new ES8109S actually outperforms Panasonic&#x27;s prior top of the line offering (the ES8078) and actually causes even less shaving irritation than that model (which itself wasn&#x27;t all that irritating to begin with).</li>
            <li> Just helps a little, especially if there are a large number of reviews.    </li>
            <li> Remington has the ideal blades (that Panasonic used to make) and it shows in closer cutting and less time spent doing so.</li>
            <li> I have only used it as a dry shave so far, and I definitely plan on using it in the shower soon with a recommended menthol based shaving cream.</li>
            <li> It is a good as a my former Braun and the replacement parts (blades/foils) are less expensive.</li>
            <li> After numerous attempts to buy electra shavers manufactured by Remington (cheap, but should be labeled as a self-torture device for those that want to destroy their faces slowly and painfully) and Noelco (they work OK until it&#x27;s time to clean them--then it takes a PHd in rocket science to put them back together again--</li>
            <li> It shaves very close with little or no irritation.</li>
            <li> The upfront cost is a little pricey, but not when you factor in how much you would pay for disposable blades.</li>
            <li> Plus he can used this wet (for a real close shave) or dry!</li>
            <li> I think after 2-3 shaves I&#x27;ll have a pattern down that works for my particular beard</li>
            <li> Self cleans like a champ and the little sideburn trimer on the back is high powered too!</li>
            <li> It took a while to get my routine down, but get a decent enough shave now.</li>
            <li> Speaking of the cutters and the screens, they become quite warm before I am finished shaving which leads me to believe that there is friction and that the very thin screens are not likely to last very long.</li>
            <li> It also was much less expensive due to a great Amazon sale.  </li>
            <li> Rather than hit every good and bad point about this product I&#x27;m going to give some info on me</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I figured $100 wasn&#x27;t a bad price for supposedly such a good razor (and cleaning system).</li>
            <li> To put it simply it does not shave at all, leaving behind huge patches of hair on my neck, underside of my head and also on my face.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Panasonic&#x27;s shaver did not provide a particularly close or quick shave when compared to the Braun Series 7 shaver.  </li>
            <li> I guess I can&#x27;t give a full review of this thing until a few months down the road when I see how the blades hold up.  </li>
            <li> It may sound a little odd, but you know how your face feels sensitive to the touch after you typically shave?</li>
            <li> It takes a little longer for me to shave now (5 minutes instead of 3), but it&#x27;s a lot closer than before, and the cleaning kit keeps it fresh and sharp.  </li>
            <li> I shaved in, my face was always left raw in certain places.  </li>
            <li> After the third foil cost me about half a new razor, I decided enough was enough and sprung for the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> Cons: takes just a little longer to get a close shave and works better if I move the shaver slowly over stretched skin.  </li>
            <li> He is an Italian, with course, thick facial hair that grows very fast.</li>
            <li> The shave is very nice, but the cleaner is worthless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an electric in the past for occasional rare quick jobs, but never more than a few times a year.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin; therefore, I needed to have a wet/dry shaver that would protect my skin and still offer an extremely close shave.</li>
            <li> Also, one of the other reviews said it was really loud</li>
            <li> if you drop it even on a soft surface the possibilities of damage are endless.</li>
            <li> The induction charger of the old model has been replaced by a more ordinary one with a small plug, which consumes less space and weight in my suitcase, and which probably saves production costs as well as energy costs</li>
            <li> This model with the cleaning unit is bulky and the cleaning unit is unnecessary since it comes with a brush plus since it is wet/dry shaver you can clean it by just using soap and water on the blade area.</li>
            <li> The cleaner doesn&#x27;t use any irritating alcohol to clean the shaver just soap and water.</li>
            <li> This model is much quiter then other Panasonic models and way cleaner then Braun or other brands.  </li>
            <li> Braun, with its interceptor blades, convinced me that shaving electrically was quicker, less bloody, and more comfortable than my blades, along with an acceptable shave.    </li>
            <li> And the last one (I&#x27;m too lazy to look up that number) was a step backwards and never shaved very close.    </li>
            <li> few shaves I did get were sub par at best...not very close, and made my face burn, especially when dry...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Charge lasts at least a week with daily use, I cleaned it and recharged it the first week I owned it</li>
            <li> Electric razors have come a long ways, last time I tried an electric Norelco and it wasn&#x27;t anything to write about, it left my skin irritated and didn&#x27;t come anywhere close to the shave this Panasonic gives.     </li>
            <li> The only area this thing has left to surprise me in is how long it lasts without being recharged as I haven&#x27;t had any extended trips, but I don&#x27;t see it failing me there</li>
            <li> so I am not sure exactly how long it will go</li>
            <li> Had it long enough now to rate it, and I have gone back to my blade.</li>
            <li> but after the novelty wore off in a few days I put it in the lock position so that it would stay steady.</li>
            <li> However, as I said I mainly use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Anything new to you takes a little getting used to and the ES8109s was no different.  </li>
            <li> The only drawbacks I have encountered is being that my wife and I are on opposite schedules it seems a little on the loud side and forget about using the cleaning mode if you want to keep it quiet.  </li>
            <li> Not a perfect shave, but over time, will be far more economical than buying two expensive blades a week.  </li>
            <li> My dad only uses it for dry shaving only, and he does not have any issues.  </li>
            <li> As the title mentions spending higher than average on a product doesn&#x27;t always mean you will get a higher than average product.</li>
            <li> As far as cutting goes, I would rate the razor as very good, not excellent.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the cleaning system that comes with the Panasonic, as the base is more square, and takes up less room than the rounded Braun base, and more importantly it has rubber feet that keep it in place when the razor is being cleaned.  </li>
            <li> They generally don&#x27;t tolerate too many drops to the tub floor before they fail!</li>
            <li> I have never had much luck in the past with electric razors</li>
            <li> Would recommend this razor to the person who wants a close shave, but don&#x27;t have time to waste!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not sure it really needs the cleaning system</li>
            <li> Long story short, it works.  </li>
            <li> I am a long time blade user that finally made the change to electric.</li>
            <li> I waited several days to shave again, so when I did, I had a lot of long stubble.</li>
            <li> I have wanted a wet/dry electric for a long time and had been using a basic Braun model before.  </li>
            <li> Battery lasted just long enough for the guarantee period to run out.</li>
            <li> On my neck the beard hairs tend to grow flat, instead of outward.  </li>
            <li> the battery lasts long enough to do about 4 or 5 days of shaving with it.    </li>
            <li> and of course neck hairs tend to lay flat.  </li>
            <li> Took too long, left stubble - would not recommend to buy.</li>
            <li> The cleaning cartridges don&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> so you con only use it so long.  </li>
            <li> I will also add in that I hardly used a razor before mainly because it was very time consuming and at points messy and constantly having to buy blades.  </li>
            <li> My chin and neck normally need retouching, so I use cold water to clean out the shaver.  </li>
            <li> Apparently with a brush, rubbing alcohol, a dry cloth, and a dry place to store your razor you can extend the blade life by two to three times</li>
            <li> For the uninitiated, higher motor speed &#x3D; faster moving blades &#x3D; less friction &#x3D; less irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an older gentleman with a grey semi-heavy beard who has to shave everyday.</li>
            <li> The other problem is the little screen that indicates how much charge is left.</li>
            <li> the only real drawback is that the straight cutting surface (as opposed to the floating heads of the norelco) means that you have to make a lot of passes over curved surfaces like the head, and it can be kind of harsh on thin skin.  </li>
            <li> If you work nights or early mornings, you might want to look for something more quiet, as the noise on this shaver has made it difficult for me to shave in my usual habits.     </li>
            <li> For a couple of decades now I had mainly used Norelco rotaries including a high end Speed-XL for the past few years.  </li>
            <li> I use them in the shower every morning and find I get a closer shave than with any other shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried every major brand of electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> At that point I began reading reviews of the other major brands.</li>
            <li> This product went above and beyond my expectation and now I&#x27;m kicking myself for waiting so darn long to buy one!</li>
            <li> I gave the offering from Braun a hard look, but already knowing what kind of quality to expect from Panasonic for half the price, I decided shelling out crazy money for the Pulsonic just wasn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li> Initially i was excited about the shaver and its advanced technologies, but when i received the shaver, i was actually a little bit disappointed.    </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t owned it very long, but I am hoping that using this system regularly will prolong its life.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the feeling it would last very long.     </li>
            <li> Second, DON&#x27;T use this thing dry if you have issues with electrics beating up your neck.  </li>
            <li> Unlike Braun, this shaver gives the flexibility to shave in the shower, with a gel or dry shave whereby giving the end user total flexibility and convenience.</li>
            <li> In regards to shave closeness, I think my old Braun has a slight edge.  </li>
            <li> I can actually shave dry with this razor which is something I could never do with the Philips rotary.</li>
            <li> and I get far less razor burn and zero cuts with this Panasonic.</li>
            <li> The fan in the dry cycle is actually very quiet.  </li>
            <li> For the same reason dry shaving never worked for me.</li>
            <li> I know I sound like a fake commercial</li>
            <li> After only six months the recharger completely failed, remaining filled with water with the operating lights going out permanently.  </li>
            <li> -For daily shaves, use a pre-shave solution and shave dry.  </li>
            <li> Rinse the blades and let them dry, then put the foil back on and turn on the shaver to listen to the blades.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line: If you like electric shavers, don&#x27;t mind a fast motor slight humming noise, like a close shave with options of wet or dry shaving, and don&#x27;t want to worry anymore about razor burn or bumps or not getting a close shave</li>
            <li> I would never get a razor that&#x27;s dry only.</li>
            <li> I use the shaver dry and the shave is the same I was getting from a blade.</li>
            <li> Works well but only use dry.  </li>
            <li> , This stuff is a super slick clear lube that you apply just a drop or 2 to your wet face and it makes your skin slick as ice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I got mine for $108, minus a $30 instant rebate so it only cost $78.</li>
            <li> but the unit might actually not turn on and the next day you still have a wet razor to use...</li>
            <li> It might not turn on and now the next morning you have not only a wet razor but a musty smelly razor to boot...</li>
            <li> I tried Baun after the Norelco, not happy with the shave closeness and speed, the heads wearing out rather quickly.</li>
            <li> The cleaning base stand works very well and keeps the shaver in tip top order.  </li>
            <li> Improvement over the old one, but not sure if its due to the shaver or just new blades.  </li>
            <li> Well, that sensation, at least for me, was far less apparent after shaving with the new Panasonic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: If you like electric shavers, don&#x27;t mind a fast motor slight humming noise, like a close shave with options of wet or dry shaving, and don&#x27;t want to worry anymore about razor burn or bumps or not getting a close shave, then this is the shaver for you!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s this particular model, or all of this type, but I found this shave much less through than my old Phillips shaver with three circular heads.  </li>
            <li> and I am sorry to say that it fell far short of the performance of my first Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if my face is actually getting used to the new way of shaving, like they say, or if maybe I&#x27;m just learning how to use it.  </li>
            <li> The shaver itself is not very loud in my opinion however the cleaning process is a noisy one.</li>
            <li> It does the job even though it takes longer then a standard razor, but will save you a lot of money in the long run!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about replacing my old razor, but the old one was ten years old.  </li>
            <li> if you follow the directions you will have a shaving system that will last ya a very long time!</li>
            <li> Like one other reviewer, I have to go over the same spot several times to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> The models here are no better than any of the other higher quality shavers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> The Nokia always left my skin irritated due to constant running of the razor on one spot to get all the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - You cannot use it while charging it at the same time (sorry, for those of you who forget to charge until the last minute...although it does charge fairly quickly).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually review products here on Amazon, but I do when I find them particularly noteworthy</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, it did shave my sensitive face well and with little irritation.</li>
            <li> if i have this much trouble getting a clean shave on a long, smooth, taut area of my leg (such as the area right next to my shin bone), i would hate to see how poorly it performs on the curves of a man&#x27;s face or the underside of the neck/chin.    </li>
            <li> The shaver is unable to give me a clean shave especially around the curvy area just below the chin.</li>
            <li> Some areas take several passes -- not sure if that is me getting used to a new razor or a characteristic of the razor.  </li>
            <li> Then, a few weeks ago, I looked on Ebay to buy more Quattro blades and found no good deals, so I bought this Panasonic!</li>
            <li> Spending this much money, for something, is always a hard decision when all you have to go on is the words of others.  </li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t have to worry about razor burn as long as your not pressing hard.  </li>
            <li> Next I&#x27;ll probably try philips or go back to conventional:</li>
            <li> It is very soft to the touch and has a high enough rpm motor that it doesn&#x27;t slow down to cut hair like some other brands.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m looking at at least 20, and the quality of the shave is absolutely pitiful.     </li>
            <li> Might sound silly</li>
            <li> It still always took at least 6 minutes for the Spectra to do a reasonable job.</li>
            <li> I never liked using blades much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had nothing but Braun razors for the past 12 years, the last one is four year old 8000 series.  </li>
            <li> We shave everyday, and the old saying goes \\&quot;a</li>
            <li> A 100% charge would appear to last for a while, I&#x27;ve not really tested it.</li>
            <li> It worked, so I thought, quite well until a year ago when I noticed the rechargable battery was not holding as long a charge.</li>
            <li> like i did with a traditional wet shaver.     </li>
            <li> then it pulling my hair once or twice while it was long.    </li>
            <li> I had an electric shaver a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using it as a wet shaver in my bathroom wash basin</li>
            <li> i have been using shaving foam and it helps reduce skin irritation considerably after shaves.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and it has no problems with longer stubble - like a 3-4 day growth (2 mm to 3 mm long). would possibly need to make a few extra passes to catch a few sneaky last ones here and</li>
            <li> have&#x27;nt had any problems with it - holds charge for a long time still.</li>
            <li> Battery holds the charge long.</li>
            <li> , went through the reviews a few times before purchase this one, but believe me no regret so far.   </li>
            <li> It takes 2-3 times as long to shave with this razor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve pulled and stretched my skin out trying to get a close shave</li>
            <li> Strange</li>
            <li> - i have an extensive growth, and always shave wet with lather.</li>
            <li> i used this shaver for almost 2 months, twice as long as panasonic recommended for your face to \\&quot;get used to it.\\</li>
            <li> Long Handled Safety Razor]]</li>
            <li> I spent several days reading reviews on razors</li>
            <li> : 1) it holds a charge for a long time 2)</li>
            <li> Wish I hadn&#x27;t put off this purchase for so long.  </li>
            <li> and believe me when i say that my leg hairs are not nearly as dense at those on a man&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues with any leaking that a couple reviewers have noted; maybe they&#x27;re just not completely seating the tank or detergent</li>
            <li> My face is fairly sensitive and I&#x27;ve always had trouble in the summer.  </li>
            <li> Razor burn is almost non-existant unless you grind away in an area for too long a time (come back to the area 15 minutes later helps), ingrown hairs are 98% cured, and it shaved closer than a rotory with only a few passes.</li>
            <li> I have not had any trouble with it accidentally changing modes so far, but the manual does warn that the cleaning modeis not designed for shaving.    </li>
            <li> ; electric razors have come a long way.</li>
            <li> Positives are that it cleans well and a charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> One of the reasons I got the shaver was to save money in the long run on blades.  </li>
            <li> However, the cleaning cartridge doesn&#x27;t have a long life and would have cost me as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Foil just won&#x27;t cut rogue hairs a few days old.  </li>
            <li> I still have trouble shaving my neck and the far sides of my jaw.  </li>
            <li> Skipping the minor details...</li>
            <li> I finally tried it wet</li>
            <li> I hope it lasts as long as my Braun.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a couple of moments to devour the hair that has grown in roughly a 24 hour period</li>
            <li> you never use it..tedious cleaning process that takes too long, just rinse the thing under your tap and brush it off.  </li>
            <li> recently retired from military service and started to grow a goatee (its like mandatory for retirees)</li>
            <li> Things I want to try is a wet shave in the shower and to skip a day and see how it handles the extra growth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying from Amazon for a long time now</li>
            <li> I only had to pay for the one-way shipping to the service center.  </li>
            <li> I have used this system so long</li>
            <li> long before this razor dies</li>
            <li> I know it hasn&#x27;t been long, but I can tell already, this is a winner.  </li>
            <li> He is a very hairy man and has a thick beard/stuble.</li>
            <li> The base itself fits in a corner, is fairly compact (about the size of one of those scented candles in a jar), and does its job well.</li>
            <li> A very close shave and it never gets \\&quot;bogged\\&quot; down by a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> I could go upwards of three days before having to use a trimmer to bring the hair down to short enough pieces for this shaver to do its job efficiently.  </li>
            <li> Even after I&#x27;ve spent several minutes dry or wet, i still have to touch up spots with a standard razor.</li>
            <li> The dock itself easily gets dirty, especially if you have it around your sink.</li>
            <li> Smaller, easier to handle, wet &amp; dry shave</li>
            <li> He uses it dry, but has also used it wet on occasion and it works equally well.</li>
            <li> I only use it for dry shaving because when using it wet it doesn&#x27;t seem to get as close to my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several electric-razors over the years, but typically resort to a standard disposable razor to do the job.</li>
            <li> I have only shaved dry and probably won&#x27;t use it wet, with or without lather.  </li>
            <li> Took me no less than a month to get used to the shaver as I only used razors in the past.</li>
            <li> Took me no less than a month to get used to the shaver as I only used razors in the past.  </li>
            <li> My curent model, Panasonic ES8109S Vortex Wet/Dry,  arrived just a few weeks ago and it has so far given me the same level of satisfaction as all the other models I have used.  </li>
            <li> It requires 4 to 5 passes over the same area to clear these thick, flat laying hairs.  </li>
            <li> Also, if I am not pleased with something, if it doesn&#x27;t live up to its advertising, I will return it (always politely, but return none-the-less).    </li>
            <li> You have to be very careful and not get the actual unit wet on the outside because the unit is not water resistant and you will ruin</li>
            <li> To start with the shave that they give is good using a gel in the shower, but it quickly goes off after a few months and the shaver appears to be susceptible to water getting into the electronics which is completely useless for an advertised wet shaver - don&#x27;t waste your money on this expensive Chinese made rubbish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of the value in the Vortex Cleaning System which seems a bit complex for something I could otherwise clean off with running water, but maybe I&#x27;ll change my thinking over time.</li>
            <li> On the negative side, the whine is a bit high pitched, and I cannot find replacement heads or cleaning solution at local stores, so will have to order it online - probably cheaper, but certainly not as convenient.  </li>
            <li> However, if I let my beard grow out too much (more than 4 or 5 days for me), this shaver will painfully tear out my long facial hair.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint (the reason for the 1 star loss) is how loud and how long the cleaning process was.  </li>
            <li> I use this one and my teenage son uses the other.  </li>
            <li> So I went looking for slicker, longer lasting shave gels and other things to help set my beard up, leading me to shave 3.    </li>
            <li> star since this shaver did manage to cut a white-head due to the middle blade.</li>
            <li> With some of the other electric razors I&#x27;ve used, I always had to go over my face with a regular blade</li>
            <li> There are two ways to charge the shaver, one is the HydraClean device and the other is a standard AC recharger.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> I will have to start considering other Panasonic products in the future.</li>
            <li> cleaning station seems a little gimmicky, but regardless of how it seems, it really works -</li>
            <li> Have used several other shavers that seem betterr than this model.  </li>
            <li> I bought this wet/dry shaver, and I&#x27;ve never had such a close shave with any other tool.  </li>
            <li> When it came time to buy another I went several other brands including Braun and Norelco.</li>
            <li> this shaver is without pulling and takes little effort for a shave second only to a blade.</li>
            <li> This shaver will compliment your other shavers but definitely will not be a replacement.</li>
            <li> This shaver simply does not get those areas well on some people, and if that&#x27;s a problem for you, you may want to look at other shavers, or keep a spare blade around (which is what I do).</li>
            <li> Of course, it doesn&#x27;t do miracles, but it can be used in the car or in other situations when the traditional foam and razor can not be used.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember how long!</li>
            <li> I had to switch methods due to medical issue (cancer).  </li>
            <li> LONG TERM UPDATE!</li>
            <li> I did with my other electric razors, so I can go over the same section over and over if I feel like it.  </li>
            <li> (yes, it is completely waterproof) and with shaving cream and all sorts of lubricants, but for my thick beard I found that it just didn&#x27;t get close enough and took too long with all the water and creams.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to dry shaving with one of those other shavers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting the closest shave I have had in a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I have been a very long time user of a Remington.  </li>
            <li> I had a Braun that I used once in a very long while, but the Panasonic excels in comparison.  </li>
            <li> I use no shave cream or pre shave and shave dry.</li>
            <li> I traded from a dry shave Braun electric rechargeable unit to this.  </li>
            <li> Its clean and the additional cartages not so expensive too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Broke again 08-07-12 (water remained in cleaning basin and wouldn&#x27;t dry or recharge); sent this time to McAllen Texas for repair or replacement or whatever they do in Texas.  </li>
            <li> although I have used it dry.</li>
            <li> I shave dry while sitting in front of the tv or pc.</li>
            <li> You can use dry or in the shower.  </li>
            <li> dry capability - can be used in the shower and with shaving cream</li>
            <li> I found it difficult to get the shaver really clean when using a shave cream.  </li>
            <li> does it shave dry?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Better to just run water over the head from the faucet, dry it with a towel and call it a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My shaver is bone dry once the drying cycle is over.  </li>
            <li> even when using it dry.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend using this shaver dry.  </li>
            <li> The one or two times I have used it dry</li>
            <li> However, I wish I hadn&#x27;t purchased the cleaning station as it is an expensive way to clean it when liquid detergent would have worked as well.  </li>
            <li> I would call this a tie in the dry shave category.  </li>
            <li> even dry.</li>
            <li> It gives me a close shave when I use it dry.</li>
            <li> I like a dry razor in the morning.</li>
            <li> Dry shaving will also give you a close shave.  </li>
            <li> now I have used it in the dry mode.  </li>
            <li> I have to run the dry cycle twice to evaporate all the water/cleaning solution out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it strictly dry.</li>
            <li> and I thought my skin was too dry.</li>
            <li> I guess the bigger concern is the extra water wasted if you shave in the shower.    </li>
            <li> I must be getting old because a vibrating safety razor with half a dozen blades that costs as much as car payment is not attractive to me.</li>
            <li> /Dry mode: If you are a lifelong electric user, wet shaving will open your eyes.</li>
            <li> The shaves now are VERY close with no stragglers left behind.  </li>
            <li> It was just not worth the extra effort to achieve a minor improvement in closeness.  </li>
            <li> I turn it on and make a few practice swipes above my face to get the feel of the razor and the proper angles.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver a few weeks ago when the Braun I had been using for several years finally died.</li>
            <li> I am a 22 year old Pakistani-American and have thick facial</li>
            <li> Finally, I&#x27;ve never seen those cleaning cartridges for sale anywhere, which is kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> The wash is a good feature however the solution is expensive and unnecessary.</li>
            <li> The thing that locks the cover over the blades became loose and sometimes the cover would pop off in the middle of shaving, and other times it literally cut</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mainly a blade guy and have tried other electric shavers in the past.</li>
            <li> I have never owned any other electric razors and don&#x27;t see the need to either because this gets the job down for the fraction of the price of more expensive brands like Braun and Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s hard to tell that he didn&#x27;t use his normal disposable manual razor.</li>
            <li> but I noticed it misses single whiskers.</li>
            <li> I purchased an Braun series 400 from walmart and the thing was not right, so I took it back and got another one.</li>
            <li> I have not had a single problem with it since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Also the shaver lasts about 5 days on a single charge.</li>
            <li> I researched for months and read every single review for this Panasonic Razor and decided to buy it.</li>
            <li> but I still can not shave every single day because I will get irritated.</li>
            <li> I would say the only downside of the razor (and probably most/all electric razors), is that it doesn&#x27;t always get the odd hairs that grow in strange directions.</li>
            <li> What you might do before buying is to consider why over 30 people disliked it so much that they left a negative review.      </li>
            <li> and I was never completely satisfied with the shave I received from my Braun, instead of spending money on my old razor</li>
            <li> I spent a long time looking up reviews and this one met all of my expectations.  </li>
            <li> One of the blade-holders   broke loose.</li>
            <li> Secondly, the station will not let you select the clean option once it recognizes a dirty cartridge.</li>
            <li> I have a very coarse beard and it doesn&#x27;t seem to bog down this shaver at all.</li>
            <li> After a lot of research, I threw down on this razor based on several reviews and Panasonic&#x27;s description (13,000 rpm wet/dry razor?!?).</li>
            <li> This product is a massive let down.</li>
            <li> The next model down was $79 with no rebate, so</li>
            <li> This new Panasonic is very loud (to the point where you wonder if you are damaging your hearing) as well as uncomfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> Sad since I only used the cleaning cycle about a half dozen times in the time I have owned it, due to how long it took to clean.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a firm believer in the art of wet shaving and would NEVER drag a dry razor across my face</li>
            <li> Feels odd to find a single whisker just above your lip or on your cheek.</li>
            <li> The cleaner is a bit bulky and noisey and there&#x27;s really nothing slick about it; in fact its kind of ugly, but it works well!  </li>
            <li> The Remington MS2-390 has the blades that thePanasonics should have (and did have years ago): flat foil area (not \\&quot;Arc Foiled\\&quot;), good length (25% longer) and ultra thin cutting blades.</li>
            <li> Reports of razor burn might come from those who are too impatient, pressing too hard or too long in one place while shaving, especially in the first few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I tried both dry and wet modes but couldn&#x27;t get it to do my job.</li>
            <li> Previously I used Braun razors, but when my Braun finally broke (battery stopped taking a charge), I switched to Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> The instruction pamphlet (the English version at least) was apparently written by a people who were intent on documenting everything they knew about the product, but had no sense of the probable buyer&#x27;s need to understand how to use the product.  </li>
            <li> I tried it wet, dry, gels, creams, in the shower, nothing worked to improve the shave.</li>
            <li> I looked at all the electric razors and what brought me to this one was that it was wet and dry.</li>
            <li> After shaving with razors for a decade and a half, and going with the shaver, I found some things counterproductive and breaking basic shaving rules.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still under warranty, but for warranty service they require me to send the *entire shaver* away for 3-4 weeks (possibly the HydraClean too, but I&#x27;m not sure).  </li>
            <li> Wet or dry</li>
            <li> I started with the typical shaving gel and found that the Mach 3 shave was only marginally smoother than the Braun Syncro&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> , I tried it both dry shave and wet shave and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;you can use it dry or wet when shaving&lt;br /&gt;has</li>
            <li> the cartridges are not cheap but they seem to last a long time because they are not alcohol based.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second one of these now - the first failed after about nine months when the indicator started to lose segments as if it had water in it, (I always shave in the shower).</li>
            <li> While occasionally I may return to razors if I need that ultra-smooth shave (black tie events), this thing is now my bread and butter.</li>
            <li> Looks like I&#x27;ll probably buy another one these even if it does last less than 3 years again.</li>
            <li> The wet dry feature was also a selling point.</li>
            <li> The dry and wet functions performs well.</li>
            <li> This one I have to lay out to dry or put it in the Cleaning System still wet.  </li>
            <li> Like that it can be used either wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> Wet or dry</li>
            <li> I just got a text from a former cast mate of my previous show asking me which razor</li>
            <li> When the unit is wet, you can set the dry option in the charger to remove the water in it..</li>
            <li> I used a rotary electric from 13 to 15 and then went back to a blade until last week, a little less than two months from my 22nd birthday, and my face is having a tougher time.  </li>
            <li> I am shaving more often, and less grudgingly.</li>
            <li> This means more surface area on the newer blades and that means less cutting.</li>
            <li> I went over the same areas dozens of times, making my skin practically raw, and it failed to provide a clean shave.</li>
            <li> There are a few spots that are still slightly stubbly, but those same spots give me fits with a blade anyway, so it&#x27;s no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suspect it was due to pushing too hard or maybe my face just needed to get used to the new razor.  </li>
            <li> so this is a little different.</li>
            <li> Once in a while open the head of the unit and blowing on razor pieces a little does the job.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Vortex solves both of these problems with a little bit of difficulty on the later.</li>
            <li> I had 30 days to try it, so I thought I had nothing to lose except a little shipping charge back if it was a dud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does a take a little getting used to, especially for someone who had never used one of these before.</li>
            <li> I have only had the shaver for a little over a month</li>
            <li> My intention was to replace it with a similar Braun shaver, but I was a little taken aback by the pricing.</li>
            <li> My husband has quite a heavy whisker growth, but due to medication is no longer advised to wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;Despite rave reviews, we ended up returning the shaver as it would barely cut through the whiskers.</li>
            <li> I am dead serious, this product is absolute junk!</li>
            <li> Not sure how it will do with water, but  I&#x27;ve had this for several years and other than occasionally replacing the blade (as expected)</li>
            <li> i bought it because i get razor-burn very badly when i shave my legs with a traditional razor, and i wanted something that was durable and effective and would give me a close shave wet or dry without leaving my skin in tatters.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The next day with minimal growth I shaved again, but this time I washed my face with liquid soap and reapplied a little soap and shaved with it.</li>
            <li> While they also wear out quicker then I hoped, they do last longer then a year and cost half as much as other brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reluctant to try one of the new Panasonic Arc IV&#x27;s because of the ridiculous cost of replacement cutters.  </li>
            <li> not that bad- hums more than buzzes.  </li>
            <li> Well, this news came to him as a huge problem and disappointment.</li>
            <li> I had bad acne as a teenager and its been back again in recent years though at least slightly better.  </li>
            <li> After purchasing cheap shavers that didn&#x27;t work and pulled hair like crazy, I decided I would never try to buy one again and just continued to use a blade.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is that when the self cleaning function is on it makes enough noise to keep me awake, but being the genius</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s had several different types of electric and rechargeable razors over the years and his chief complaint is that after a week or two, they no longer provide him with a close shave.</li>
            <li> The batteries last at least 9-10 shaves, and I only need to charge once ever 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I use it in the wet mode and lather up with shaving creme just like I was going to use a blade.  </li>
            <li> I am in the military.</li>
            <li> Used wet there is no skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> I used it wet with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> So after carefully skimming through the write ups, I picked this model.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the batteries will only last about a year and then the shaver goes dead.  </li>
            <li> My sister and I carefully researched Wet/Dry Shavers in a quest to find one that our dad would like.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s a lot quieter than I expected,</li>
            <li> then i expected.</li>
            <li> I must admit, partially because of the price</li>
            <li> While expensive, it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Still, I used it for a few weeks, because sometimes your skin just has to get used to it before it works properly.</li>
            <li> After I spent 2 hours stopping the bleeding a couple of times I asked his doctor to ease up on the blood thinners.  </li>
            <li> but i couldnt take the splotchy rough shave.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it wet yet.  </li>
            <li> Upkeep is minimal and it keeps a charge forever.</li>
            <li> Shaves everyday and has always used a traditional razor.</li>
            <li> He can touch up without the hassle of a wet face, razor, and shave cream....</li>
            <li> I expect that to go up by a few over time as I get faster at shaving with this different type of razor.    </li>
            <li> Have not tried shaving wet or the cleaning station -- I just pop the foil head off and blow and brush the hairs out.  </li>
            <li> he&#x27;s never even used it wet.  </li>
            <li> Using this razor wet eliminated my breakouts imediately.  </li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve bought worse items before, but they&#x27;re much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Wash face, leave wet.  </li>
            <li> The shaver never really gives me a close shave along the side of my face, but it will, however, around my lips...go figure.    </li>
            <li> The Panasonic also allows wet shaving, which cannot be understated</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t use it wet, so forget it.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have spent $120</li>
            <li> I am in the military and close shaves are a must.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m concerned about dropping when wet)  </li>
            <li> Even if it doesn&#x27;t work as well wet, this unit is one I can recommend 100%.</li>
            <li> The size of the head makes the trimmer harder to see then</li>
            <li> That worked well enough for every day shaves, but once I replaced the foil a few times, I decided to return to razor shaving.</li>
            <li> I just wet my hand and feel around.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Braun owner for the last 15 years and finally had enough with their poor quality (cleaning bases dying every 8 months at $60 a pop, side burn trimmers breaking, etc.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention they are harsh and can actually burn your skin or remove the coating on your sink.</li>
            <li> I have used a few electric razor, but always found my way back to Fusion, Mach 3etc.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve spent my life in uniform;</li>
            <li> It left a few stragglers on my neck.  </li>
            <li> I never really wanted to spend.  </li>
            <li> That is to be expected to some degree because that happens with all electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor at the sink with a wet face, wet razor, and Edge shaving gel.</li>
            <li> I do not use the charging station and have no real need for the cleaning function.  </li>
            <li> : Take their dad&#x27;s advice and continue on a path of a daily ritual of mediocrity and indifference.  </li>
            <li> You know the ones that cost roughly $300.</li>
            <li> jump back a few years and share my history...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers for a few years, and prior to that Norelco.  </li>
            <li> It only took a few days for my skin to get used to the electric razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this shaver a few times since I bought it here</li>
            <li> Never really used the cleaning kit, just hose off in the sink.</li>
            <li> Shaves very closely without irritating the skin.</li>
            <li> Used wet with lather</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t hesitate to get another one in a few years when this one inevitably dies.</li>
            <li> so the wet feature appealed to me.</li>
            <li> I continue on keeping the razor wet as well as my face.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately last week I hopped in the shower to shave and the shaver was dead.  </li>
            <li> The time I spent trying to get</li>
            <li> Performs as expected.</li>
            <li> I had to return it to the Panasonic repair center in Texas.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent 20+ years dreading my morning shave.  </li>
            <li> After 24 years of shaving with a blade I switched to a electric razor, this  was not really my choice as I received one for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> theses were removed on next few</li>
            <li> I use it wet with shaving cream, but not in the shower, since I have no place to put it in the shower when I&#x27;m not shaving.  </li>
            <li> I never really looked at it anyway</li>
            <li> Even when face is wet, doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well.  </li>
            <li> but after the water inside dried out it came back on.  </li>
            <li> I use it strictly in wet mode and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and does it well.  </li>
            <li> I could not get a close shave as I expected.</li>
            <li> He swore by this razor and said that even though it was expensive it&#x27;d be worth it.</li>
            <li> This is much better than having to unplug the charging cable from the base to plug directly into the razor if I didn&#x27;t want to go through the cleaning cycle and waste the cleaning cartridge.  </li>
            <li> Thin is important though, as a thick gel will clog the razor.</li>
            <li> These instances are few and far in between, and for everyday use though, this is the tool to shave with.</li>
            <li> Overall, I love the base, it cleans it, charges it, and drys it.</li>
            <li> the cleaning base also has its own \\&quot;drying\\&quot; option.</li>
            <li> The shaver has all the bells and whistles - the fancy base unit, nano technology blades and the nice sturdy shaver etc.</li>
            <li> , center blades knock down the long stuff.  </li>
            <li> In fact, if you press to hard and shave too fast, you can get very small cuts (relatively harmless, but they do bleed).</li>
            <li> What I mean by no miracle razor, is that if you have sensitive skin, it isn&#x27;t going to cure it.</li>
            <li> It certainly is not up to the task of shaving my face/neck.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like it is the cleaning system broke down less than a year after I started to use it.</li>
            <li> The shave quality is exactly the same as the other less expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I have only used rotary shavers before this one, and always seemed to get burned by them, and my neck would always get ripped up and blotchy red spots, which is really annoying when you have to shave to look clean for work, parties, events, etc.    </li>
            <li> After a year, the original blades that came with the unit are still cutting well.</li>
            <li> I spend like 30 minutes with a beard just long enough to curl into my face and make it hard to get.</li>
            <li> My beard isn&#x27;t super thick, but it&#x27;s definitely thick enough to ware down Gilette Fusion blades by the third shave, and after the fourth the blade is useless.  </li>
            <li> And like a typical electric razor, you can use it dry.  </li>
            <li> I got tired of not getting even one decent shave from G......</li>
            <li> It was slow and battery did not last long.</li>
            <li> However, if you get a little lazy and some decent growth, you may need a razor to tighten up a few areas.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;ve let your beard get a little long (talking a couple of days here)</li>
            <li> The only razors that I found got close enough to my skin, had expensive cartridges that needed to be replaced way too often because of how fast my thick stubble dulled them.  </li>
            <li> I shaved with an old dull Gillette razor on half my face and this thing on the other.  </li>
            <li> The razor has a little difficulty under my chin on my upper neck, so I normally wet shave this area, which seems to always have a few hairs that escape the Vortex, about once every three days.</li>
            <li> This shaver is way easier on my skin than shaving with blades, and allows me to shave twice daily with very little if any irritation.</li>
            <li> after a few tests using this razor dry I decided to grow out my bread and try it wet.</li>
            <li> The charging/cleaning base is a bit large, but not too large.  </li>
            <li> For the last several years, I&#x27;ve been using a straight razor because all electric razors I&#x27;ve tried would irritate my skin really bad.</li>
            <li> On a side note, NEVER order from Panasonic website direct, because they are incompetent and they even charged me an item that i didn&#x27;t order on my credit card.</li>
            <li> I had to continue to use the safety razor if I didn&#x27;t want the areas around the beard to be scruffier than the other parts of my face.    </li>
            <li> The Panasonic products I&#x27;ve owned in the past have worked well, so I was open to the idea of a Panasonic shaver.    </li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, it worked on parts of my face well but not others.  </li>
            <li> In other words it won&#x27;t just glide across my skin without the use of the shaving gel.     </li>
            <li> They provided customer service after I was persistent about the other shaver (now discontinued).</li>
            <li> Also gives the fastest shave; taking fewer passes over my beard than any other electric I ever had.</li>
            <li> From experience with other electric shavers, this one blows away the competition.</li>
            <li> My Braun died due to age and use.  </li>
            <li> I have not tried any other shavers by panasonic or competing brands - so I can not say it is the \\&quot;best\\&quot; shaver out there -</li>
            <li> Having used a braun electric razor for the past 6 years, I was hesitant to try something different.</li>
            <li> so had some experience with other which at the end</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is because I am not using it properly or what...</li>
            <li> No more going over the same spot over and over again.</li>
            <li> I would always return to a blade razor due to neck irritation and the lack of a close shave.</li>
            <li> It does away with all the blowing and brushing he had to do with other shavers he&#x27;s used.</li>
            <li> Immediately, I noticed the difference between this and all the other razors I tried.  </li>
            <li> The shave is extremely close.  </li>
            <li> Although I have no experience with any other brand of electric shavers, this Panasonic model has not disapointed.  </li>
            <li> but as above, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s needed.</li>
            <li> Never had a razor burn or other.  </li>
            <li> I have tried and tried to see what other \\&quot;Reviewers\\</li>
            <li> And if you don&#x27;t like it, atleast you didn&#x27;t drop $200 - $300 on one of the other brands.</li>
            <li> After reading most of the amazon reviews, I decided to buy this razor and was rather disappointed.</li>
            <li> Other shavers I&#x27;ve owned are Remington and Norelco which worked well but not as close as this one and cleaning those shavers was a pain.</li>
            <li> I gave the other one to my son.</li>
            <li> The ingrown hairs are 99% gone (I have had only one this past week).</li>
            <li> Read other reviews about the Panasonic being almost like a razor</li>
            <li> I have read a lot about the noise from this and other panasonics.  </li>
            <li> I believe, I felt like it was time to try electrics once again since shaving every other day</li>
            <li> The cleaning system for the Braun always irritated me, due to the evaporation of the solution.  </li>
            <li> From other reviews I have read you don&#x27;t have to change the water once a month.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic was never able to properly shave my chin.</li>
            <li> Other than that, Ive had no problems with it yet, and the charge lasts a while.</li>
            <li> I was going to buy the Braun Pulsonic until I read the reviews here and on other Web providers.  </li>
            <li> However, there were other things that I disliked:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Reviews from a lot of other web sites are basically copy and pasted from Amazon.</li>
            <li> The instruction manual is pretty useless in this regard as well.     </li>
            <li> The Braun&#x27;s solution could last for 3 months usually.     </li>
            <li> Have always used Norelco for over 35 years, but was not satisfied with the current one I had, the one that dispenses Nivea shave cream.</li>
            <li> The point is, even on multiple passes, I did not get the usual skin irritation.</li>
            <li> No shaving prep needed (lotions, gel, or any other lubricants).  </li>
            <li> At first I thought that was weird after using a Nokia Series 7 with rotary blades.  </li>
            <li> So if I traveled, I either had to take 2 shavers along or try to make due with the Norelco.</li>
            <li> The Nano-line is definitely an evolutionary improvement compared to   the Panasonic Linear units of the past couple of years.     </li>
            <li> sharp</li>
            <li> Other thoughts:  </li>
            <li> Slick charging station, such that I do not need to use two hands to plug any cords in.</li>
            <li> Just a note: For long battery life, do not charge it everyday.</li>
            <li> Already recommending it to my brothers and other guys.</li>
            <li> (You can read its virtues in other reviews.)</li>
            <li> with one of them it didn&#x27;t matter, and the other one had no way to remind me it was time to change.</li>
            <li> From the start, my husband was amazed at the unbelievably close shave, which, according to him, is equal to that of a blade razor.</li>
            <li> Considering the price and the other reviews, this shaver did not meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> But if you push the dent out from the back side with an ink pen clicker or something small and with rounded sides before you turn it on, it will prevent this from happening.</li>
            <li> My two other shavers also had battery and charging problems.</li>
            <li> My husband says that this razor has ruined him for any other saver.</li>
            <li> While the performance falls off a little when dry shaving...</li>
            <li> but that was also a messy endeavor which left little hair clippings everywhere.  </li>
            <li> Close shave with very few swipes to the same area.</li>
            <li> FYI, I don&#x27;t have a very heavy beard, but enough to frighten the cat in the morning.</li>
            <li> The Braun Series 5 8995 tries hard (you can hear noticeable slowing when necessary pressure is applied, like a lawn mower when it reaches thicker grass), but it doesn&#x27;t get quite as close as the Panasonics or Remington without leaving a stronger burning sensation after the shave.</li>
            <li> The new Norelco had zero battery life and shaved poorly despite its cost of over $100.  </li>
            <li> My neck hairs are very tight and lay very flat.</li>
            <li> The previous unit did not provide a close shave and was not very efficient.  </li>
            <li> The next was a bit difficult cause it is hard to get the exact direction my hair is going.     </li>
            <li> Made the purchase after reading positive reviews and after my need to substitute my expensive razor cartridges (Gillette)  </li>
            <li> Made the purchase after reading positive reviews and after my need to substitute my expensive razor cartridges (Gillette)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have very dark and coarse facial hair, and electrics have never cut it well (especially the neck!).</li>
            <li> The price of this is very decent, some may think it is expensive..</li>
            <li> Lesson two, don&#x27;t try to get fancy and use conventional shaving preparation methods.</li>
            <li> I decided to dump my conventional non-electric razor and try this electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Additionally, because of the circular blades, it is somewhat difficult to target certain spots for cleanup.</li>
            <li> And as a funny little side note, the adapter plug does make an annoying high pitched squealy noise.</li>
            <li> As I said, I have a tough beard and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The larger heads of the electric razors might make it hard to maneuver around your Adam&#x27;s apple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Any electric requires multiple passes along with pressing hard in some spots and pulling skin taught underneath, just goes with the territory for some.  </li>
            <li> After a shave I remove the foil and rinse the foil and cutting head under running water and then put the razor back in the charging stand and use the dry function to dry it for the next use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m such a sucker.  </li>
            <li> Number of shaves between recharge is about average</li>
            <li> only complaint?  </li>
            <li> no success.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money</li>
            <li> I have owned all brands of shavers/razors, and I have to say Braun is NOT worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had at least 4 different Braun shavers in that time including a AA battery powered travel shaver and the Braun series 7.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> have always broken out with razor burn and ingrown hairs on my neck for as long as I started growing facial hair.</li>
            <li> Reading some of these reviews, I was prepared to find your average electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have an average beard and have been using electric shavers (foils and rotaries) over 30 years.</li>
            <li> I am 71 and was finding it increasingly difficult to shave with a razor as beard was not only grayish white but harder to cut.  </li>
            <li> With a regular razor you make 1-2 passes and move on, otherwise you risk razor burn (at least for me).  </li>
            <li> 3.5/5 -Average shave, have not used its self-cleaning methods.</li>
            <li> Proper technique avoids this problem - just go slow and trim your beard before you shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my friend who has a thick beard because of his middle eastern roots and this razor just didn&#x27;t do the trick.</li>
            <li> This is annoying because it makes me feel the razor is now just that much more lacking.</li>
            <li> Not terrible, but if your wife is trying to sleep and your bathroom is joined to your bedroom it may be annoying for her.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I will try to update as I have time behind this electric, but for now, for those wanting to try an electric, I think you will be pleasantly surprised how close you can shave without any burn.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would not recommend this product to men with thick facial hair (especially if you have thick neck hair).  </li>
            <li> He shaves in half the time and no more bloody toilet paper patches stuck to his face! :-)  </li>
            <li> I only use it dry shaving, but it gets through tough patches of beard and it feels like I used a blade and cream.  </li>
            <li> To make matters worse, that pre-shave scrub only seemed to dry my skin out, which coupled with some razor bite and an alcohol</li>
            <li> my face is usually broken out to some extent and alternately greasy or dry.  </li>
            <li> until I wore down the razores a a bit).  </li>
            <li> The fact is that this electric shaver beats the razors hands down and it does it without burning my face.</li>
            <li> Hands down</li>
            <li> For the years before that, it was a hand me down Norelco rotary from my dad.  </li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s down to maybe four.  </li>
            <li> (you hold the power button down for 5 seconds for this) cleaning cycle.  </li>
            <li> Let it run down to a 10% charge and then recharge.</li>
            <li> Then you put it in the cachine heads down and hit the button to turn it on...</li>
            <li> Every couple of months I have to use a tooth pick to get down in the cracks and ridges to get the hair out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give this product 4.5 stars but have not been given that option so I am rounding down.    </li>
            <li> This cuts down on the usage of the cleaning cartridge.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s suppose to mean, has brought my attention back to this review</li>
            <li> A total waste of money!!</li>
            <li> I defintely recommend giving this razor a try, especially if you tried electrics in the past and thought they were garbage, times have changed my friends!</li>
            <li> but this razor will give you the same quality if not better then those brands !  </li>
            <li> that doesn&#x27;t mean I have to like the prices, especially of their replacement blades and foils.  </li>
            <li> but I got sick of the shave bugging my skin after about 8-10 shaves you need to replace the blade and those replacement blades ain&#x27;t cheap for the Mach razors.  </li>
            <li> My experience - Usually when I have not used an electric shaver for a while my skin goes crazy red and hurts for the first few shaves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s become slightly less efficient at capturing the few hairs on my cheeks that tend to lie flat, so it&#x27;s about time for the annual changing of the foil, which I know (based on past experience with Panasonics)</li>
            <li> A single charge usually lasts me for about 2 weeks, so I have no complaints there.     </li>
            <li> It tends to leave the shaver with an unpleasant smell and the second unit came with an insert that recommended just a drop of dishwashing soap inside the head, put the head back on and run it briefly in turbo mode and rinse.  </li>
            <li> It is a little louder than the Braun or at least a different pitch</li>
            <li> They seemed to struggle with my coarse beard, and would get dull after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a female, with pale skin and thick dark hair, and I suffer from folliculitis which means when I shave</li>
            <li> My old Braun had to be slowly and gingerly moved around my chin hair or else it would struggle, and this happened even with a brand new cutting block and foil.</li>
            <li> I purchased the prior model of this shaver, then the battery went bad, I contacted the Panasonic service department, and the representative was very helpful and provided the details and instructions to send my razor in for repairs as it was still under warranty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for two and a half weeks</li>
            <li> This shaver is next to useless for trimming, it really only works if you&#x27;re trying to shave off a slightly-more-than-a-5-o-clock-shadow.</li>
            <li> That said, after just a shower and either of the previously mentioned shave creams(neutrogena or edge advantage)</li>
            <li> I previously owned two Bruans and a remmington before that.  </li>
            <li> Previously had a Panasonic and decided to give this a shot versus the Braun.  </li>
            <li> I previously owned a Norelco with the 3 rotating heads.</li>
            <li> , Norelco&#x27;s don&#x27;t provide a close enough shave, and Braun&#x27;s don&#x27;t last and are too expensive.  </li>
            <li> It shaves closer than my previous two Norelco (lift &amp; cut)</li>
            <li> Give me a closer shave with less effort than what I&#x27;ve found with a tri-head shave.  </li>
            <li> B003V37ZDS Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver, Black]].</li>
            <li> My face is definitely less irritated than with a blade.    </li>
            <li> I previously had a Panasonic wet/dry shaver that was almost identical to this one.  </li>
            <li> My newest electric shaver, the Panasonic ES8109S, is the subject of this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike my previous electric razors, this one can be used \\&quot;wet\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> For it&#x27;s price, this shaver is a bargin and a half.  </li>
            <li> Easiest way for me to tell is at the end of the workday, less 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  </li>
            <li> I typically pay $60 for an electric razor but the reviews on this and Panasonic&#x27;s reputation prompted me to go \\&quot;upscale.\\</li>
            <li> Easier, cheaper, faster and less bulky than the factory cleaning system.</li>
            <li> I had a previous version of this shaver, but after 3 years of shaving exclusively under the shower, it seemed that there was a leak in the electronics and</li>
            <li> Closer shave, less irritation.  </li>
            <li> The cartridges are a lot less expense to boot.  </li>
            <li> Its no longer cutting my skin - but it takes around 30 minutes (not exaggerating) to shave your entire face compared to my old Norelco shaver from Walgreens which took around 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> The two shavers are every bit equals, with the exception of the Panasonic being less than half</li>
            <li> So I typically cleaned my electrics infrequently.  </li>
            <li> but it is faster and costs less to operate.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the replacement is showing the same problem after about the same time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my two previous Braun razors would start to smell a bit musty.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I never suffered from Razor burn or Ingrowns.</li>
            <li> and my face feeling smoother than my previous method,</li>
            <li> Bought this to upgrade a previous panasonic wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that i have less shadow at teh end of the day, suggesting that I am getting a closer shave than baldes.  </li>
            <li> Odd</li>
            <li> It cleans itself well and he charges it less than once a week.</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for a year and half now.</li>
            <li> And that means less effort on my part, which I appreciate.    </li>
            <li> Less ingrown hairs than with his previous razors.  </li>
            <li> I recall a previous reviewers advice,\\&quot; Keep the razor moving \\&quot;</li>
            <li> and I typically get 3 shaves per charge.  </li>
            <li> This is slightly less convenient, but much less to throw away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to agree with a previous reviewer however regarding noise.</li>
            <li> It all started about two weeks ago when I noticed that it was holding less of a charge between chargings, i.e., I could get progressively less and less shaves per charge.</li>
            <li> Yesterday my shaver died after less than one year.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that it does not seem to hold the charge as well as other razors I have had in the past.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena&#x27;s isn&#x27;t bad, but it doesn&#x27;t cool.  </li>
            <li> I use it wet, usually with King of Shaves shaving oil on my face.</li>
            <li> At first before I ordered, I was afraid that the shaver would pull on his skin, like some reviews say.  </li>
            <li> (my usual method) or wet as well (in the shower</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the instructions at first, but thankfully I didn&#x27;t ruin the thing with my stupidity.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think that was normal, but a lot of people seem unable to *shop</li>
            <li> not a good shaver, back to the blade for this face.</li>
            <li> My initial experience was not good</li>
            <li> To avoid that from happening a minor change in how you holdthe razor is required which is to shift the thumb closer to the head where at least Panasonic thinks your thumb should be.  </li>
            <li> When he first used it, he didn&#x27;t think it was working because he couldn&#x27;t feel the shaver cutting his beard.</li>
            <li> I like to shave in the shower to prevent a mess in the sink with hair debris.  </li>
            <li> The battery lasts long once it is fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;5)Last but not the least it comes with a cleaning</li>
            <li> the motor never bogs down in the heavy sections of my beard.</li>
            <li> but I guess it is to late and get a full refund, says I will receive a partial refund and will have to pay for shipping etc, actually I hate this product so much I am going to send it back along with a picture of my jaws all red......to make a point I am mad as hell</li>
            <li> My neck and face were mildly irritated but nothing bad.</li>
            <li> Particularly above the chin, I can barely tell it&#x27;s cutting the hairs, and don&#x27;t feel bothered even during the process.     </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible over the long run it would pay for itself since razor blades are so expensive; but by the look and feel of it if you drop it on anything but a well padded surface it would be destroyed.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic is much less harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping that after a few weeks when my face gets used to this method of shaving, that those spots will become less of an issue.</li>
            <li> but overall I recall it giving me an average to poor shave even after replacing the heads.  </li>
            <li> I found that pretty annoying in the middle of the night if I happened to have the bathroom door</li>
            <li> Previously, I had to use the trimmers on electric shavers if I&#x27;d forgotten to shave for a few days.</li>
            <li> Very please with the product, the only person disappointed would be my husband, since this one is a keeper for me.</li>
            <li> The powerless, old blade won hands down.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and a thin build, so it is hard for an electric razor to shave my chin and neck.    </li>
            <li> It is a little noisy but appears to do a satisfactory job.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it is a little pricey, but you get what you pay for..</li>
            <li> taking a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> the self-cleaning system works with little effort on my part.</li>
            <li> It can also be cleaned under running water with a little liquid soap.  </li>
            <li> I have had the shaver for little over a month now</li>
            <li> The 5 o&#x27;clock shadow seems to come a little sooner....</li>
            <li> I paid a little over 100</li>
            <li> Cleaning system is a little bulky</li>
            <li> Sometimes it irritates my skin a little, but nothing like the before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little noisier than then Norelco, but</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, the cleaning cycle is a little noisy.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little longer than shaving to get all the areas done</li>
            <li> The Remington shaved a little closer than the Panasonic and provided a faster shave.</li>
            <li> This razor is on the small side compared to other Brands like Braun and Norelco.</li>
            <li> I turned the razor off added a little hand soap to the screen and repeat the cleaning process.  </li>
            <li> I would give this shaver 5 stars, but the battery life is a little shorter than my Norelco</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a noisy little water pump and an air blower.  </li>
            <li> I use the ES8109S in the shower with a little bit of soapy lather</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s a little over a year-and-a-half since I purchased this shaver, and it has died on me.</li>
            <li> I usually run the cleaning cycle every other shave.  </li>
            <li> bought this item on March 17th, 2011 for $59.99 and have been using it for a little over a year now.  </li>
            <li> We only tried dry shaving, as, at the time, he was unable to shower.</li>
            <li> The bad, but not that bad: an annoying operating sound (as a huge mosquito) and pretty noisy cleaning.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, but the base works fine.</li>
            <li> I found that I have to run the shaver over my face very slow, make 4 to 5 passes over the same area and press the shaver to my face with a lot of force.</li>
            <li> I never believed that any electric shaver would come close to the comfort and closeness of using a blade, since i have a very thick and extensive beard growth.</li>
            <li> ; I used to get maybe up to 10 decent shaves from a blade, but now the blade quality is so bad, to me, that even the first blade shave is uncomfortable; nicks, scrapes, etc..  </li>
            <li> My facial hair is so thick that I always have a hard time finding a razor that lasts, but I&#x27;ve been using this for 7 months now and haven&#x27;t had any problems.  </li>
            <li> Four months ago I had carotid surgery that left the left side of my neck numb, making use of a blade razor a bit touchy.  </li>
            <li> Of course I have tried an electric razor a few times,but they never got anywhere close as a blade.</li>
            <li> This look would be accentuated after a few hours of growth.  </li>
            <li> I run it through a cleaning cycle everyday after shaving.</li>
            <li> I will not bellyache about a few bucks for a detergent cartridge once in a while, butthat&#x27;s me.</li>
            <li> Thirdly, use a thin shaving cream or gel that stays slippery.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it everyday for three months</li>
            <li> but they go dead in a year.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few of them,</li>
            <li> This shaver takes a few days for your face to adjust.  </li>
            <li> none has ever made the cut (pun intended), not even close, always were a waste of money......</li>
            <li> This has taken a few times to \\&quot;re-learn\\&quot; how to shave</li>
            <li> I got the shaver a few days ago and had my forst shave today.</li>
            <li> I can understand it takes a few days to get used to a razor and that eventually razor burns go away.</li>
            <li> The decision was mostly based on the fact that I hated how time consuming a task I found shaving to be.  </li>
            <li> He uses it everyday and it does not break him out.</li>
            <li> I got tired of the constant nicks, cuts and razor burn, so I was on the lookout for an electric.</li>
            <li> The Braun has had its set of foil and cutter replaced a few times over the years.  </li>
            <li> And there are some people who will always have trouble shaving, no matter the system they choose.  </li>
            <li> And there are some people who will always have trouble shaving, no matter the system they choose.  </li>
            <li> I just had bought two others to replace my Remington that I had for a few years.  </li>
            <li> Stopped using these a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Sometimes there are a few errant hairs on my neck; that&#x27;s the toughest place to shave for me, but no razor burn and a baby</li>
            <li> I finally got tired of messing around with safety razors and splurged on an electric razor.   </li>
            <li> I usually shave 3 times per week on average.  </li>
            <li> ANY electric will struggle with neck hairs under your chin, but this one will get them with a few passes.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the series 7 died via force majeure mishap (5 year old boy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All three of my shavers have lost their battery charge display withing a few months.</li>
            <li> Not a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Almost bought one based on a few blogs on the web.</li>
            <li> Yes it misses a few hairs under the chin, but I have never owned an electric that didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I used Mach 3 then switched to one of the 5 blade razors a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> Another one went dead after a year (and had the reputation for doing that too).  </li>
            <li> I need to shave everyday and</li>
            <li> This increases the probability that you will get an uneven sideburn.    </li>
            <li> Finally , a few weeks ago my Spectra battery died.</li>
            <li> I reserched a TON of electric razors as I did a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I tried switching to a blade just to save a few bucks, but I could find no combination of products or techniques that did not result in severe irritation on my neck.     </li>
            <li> My beard is medium heavy, although I am no Geico Caveman or Robin Williams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I just received the Panasonic ES8109s Vortex a few hour ago.</li>
            <li> I will probably add to this comment in a few months to let you know how it stood the test of time.  </li>
            <li> so I read a few reviews and found this Panasonic.</li>
            <li> dead...</li>
            <li> A few years</li>
            <li> I will try it out for a few weeks and provide another update.  </li>
            <li> As far as the shave, this razor does not get a close shave and it is difficult to get all the beard growth shaven.  </li>
            <li> A few months after 2 years owning this shaver</li>
            <li> Remember, you have to shave everyday when using an electric to see optimal results.    </li>
            <li> I tend to use them until the service light on the Vortex base turns on, then I change the cleaning cartridge and water in the Vortex</li>
            <li> Still using it after a few years, and still working well.</li>
            <li> star for dead cleaner.</li>
            <li> Also the charging and cleaning base is simple to use and works very well.  </li>
            <li> I just drop it in it&#x27;s base, and it&#x27;s ready to go the next day.</li>
            <li> Not a huge surprise.  </li>
            <li> Not a huge difference, but perhaps something to consider.    </li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s actually kinda funny because I was so preoccupied with ensuring the safekeeping of that little shaver ever since I brought it home, chiding my poor wife for even looking at it wrong, and then my dumb arse drops the dang thing in the shower.</li>
            <li> Being lazy, I never sit down and write product reviews.</li>
            <li> As for the noise that other reviewer&#x27;s mention, yeah it makes a little noise but I am shaving in the bathroom and not concerned the least bit with the amount of noise it makes.  </li>
            <li> Very little razor burn and the time it takes for me to shave has been cut in half, even when shaving after a week or 10 days.  </li>
            <li> (I think this is due to the exceptionally fast rate the blades move at), but if you use it in the shower the noise isn&#x27;t as bad as you&#x27;d think.  </li>
            <li> Now, I suppose if you buy this razor thinking it&#x27;s going to cure diseases, fix your car, or get you that long sought-after menage a trois, then your expectations are too high and you&#x27;re going to be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Clean up is a snap using the base unit and cartridges.  </li>
            <li> Very odd design.  </li>
            <li> Approximately the same size as a small blade-style  coffee grinder.  </li>
            <li> have tried to clean out the drain hole at the bottom of the base.  </li>
            <li> The dryer doesn&#x27;t heat (it just blows), it buzzes when plugged in, and after its done cycling through a clean and charge it causes the lights on both the shaver and the base to flicker.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately panasonics customer service was abysmal and nothing got resolved so I&#x27;m stuck with it.</li>
            <li> cleaning function of the base works well, but it is very noisy and takes a long time.  </li>
            <li> That slick little cleaning station?  </li>
            <li> I have to admit I thought it would&#x27;ve lasted me a little longer than it did as past Panasonics I&#x27;ve owned have lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I switched over to this model of electric shaver last week because I was sick and tired of spending 15 dollars on 4 gilette fusion razor blades that were only lasting me 4 shaves before destroying my face.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, especially around my mustache, goatee, and neck, and I hate shaving.</li>
            <li> I have a very tough beard at several odd angles.  </li>
            <li> Firstly, I saw some bad reviews but everywhere I looked</li>
            <li> After those two weeks, the shave was still as bad as the first day.</li>
            <li> only real complaint is about the owner&#x27;s manual.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long that will last as these companies are cutting costs everywhere.....</li>
            <li> This is a poor excuse for a razor</li>
            <li> The thing stays on a long time unnecessarily</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a thick beard, just an average one.    </li>
            <li> considering the price of \\&quot;next-best option\\&quot; Gillette Fusion blades, was far less expensive, and less irritating, over time than shaving with blades.</li>
            <li> The cleaner does not use alcohol to clean, but a detergent solution that uses water housed in a small tank also in the base.    </li>
            <li> Since it is lithium powered, it holds the power all the way down, unlike Ni-Cad which starts losing power as the battery loses charge.</li>
            <li> and I mean distant past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a weird beard in that the hairs are on the wire y side but not dense and they grow in all different directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a electric razor for years due to the ridiculous cost of replacement blades.</li>
            <li> I had to Redgrave over my areas in order to get it done, then it was just raw by that point.</li>
            <li> In fact, it is so unpleasant to use either the shaver or the beard trimmer function of this razor to shave long facial hair that I need to use my Braun Synchro.  </li>
            <li> It whines like a little jet engine!  </li>
            <li> the show required us to shave every day and I have very sensitive face and neck skin that breaks out like crazy</li>
            <li> It cuts very awkwardly and I had a really hard time getting a clean shave with it.. not to mention my face was redder than ever before.</li>
            <li> Shaving the neck becomes a slow process as you must pull the skin tight and hold the razor at a variety of angles in order to get it all.    </li>
            <li> I think the reason is that Panasonic&#x27;s older models came with cutting blades with the individual blades having been about half the width of all of Panasonic&#x27;s newer cutting blades (including replacements).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean less irritation than the other 2, I mean NONE!</li>
            <li> I felt really bad paying so much for it yet completing the job with the razor.    </li>
            <li> It is a bit louder than the electrics I&#x27;ve had in the past</li>
            <li> compared to my past electric razors.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used razors, usually a variation of the Sensor.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s crazy loud</li>
            <li> I have a friend who&#x27;s been shaving for the past 8 years with a braun syncro and has no issues with it, and gets close.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s usual life.  </li>
            <li> a few swear at it!  </li>
            <li> And, I don&#x27;t get the ingrown hairs and irritation that others have given me in the past.</li>
            <li> I used to wet shave for years but got tired of paying for blades.</li>
            <li> Usually it takes your face</li>
            <li> No more ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> I was sadly disappointed upon my first shave.  </li>
            <li> an option he did not have in the past.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I have used Panasonic electric razors in past, like 10+ years ago.  </li>
            <li> With a blade it took no more than 10 minutes for a shower and a shave.</li>
            <li> I am not sure that I can continue using this after 69 weeks to save money.</li>
            <li> I have owned electric shavers for the past 20 years.  </li>
            <li> that its usually always at 100% anyway.  </li>
            <li> , what has been the closest shave of the past eight years?  </li>
            <li> When I use this, it&#x27;s usually grown in by the end of the day</li>
            <li> and I have been using a Norelco wet/dry shaver in the shower for the past three years.  </li>
            <li> (if i used till 0%, i usually recharge at 20% or so)    </li>
            <li> no more LED lights that tell you nothing.  </li>
            <li> I have been wet shaving for the past 25 years, and have only tried two electric razors, which were very uncomfortable for my face.</li>
            <li> The razor will alert you when it needs cleaning or charging with a small screen.</li>
            <li> Maybe my skin is changing with age, not sure.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I ever will.  </li>
            <li> Well, I set aside my favorite blade (Mach 3 Turbo for me) and prepared for the worst.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after only 3 months, I already felt that the blades needed to be replaced.  </li>
            <li> so I usually just pick it up and shave without water.</li>
            <li> all the wet/dry shavers I&#x27;ve used in the past died in 1-2 years, hopefully not this one).  </li>
            <li> For the past couple months the LCD display started to go out</li>
            <li> I usually buy Brauns.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these shavers several months ago, and was not impressed.</li>
            <li> a slick feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll keep there or not.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why, but this shaver does not irritate my neck area at all.</li>
            <li> Now my first choice for everything is panasonic because have never been disappointed yet.</li>
            <li> I felt the need to stop being lazy and give a review of this purchase.  </li>
            <li> For years, I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers, but usually I just use the cheaper types that you can buy at Wally World.</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied with this razor at all.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I&#x27;ll do when we have guests.  </li>
            <li> does - along with the money you&#x27;ll spend on their big, expensive refills.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning is done by using the \\&quot;cleaning fluid\\&quot; in the charger, which works well, or by putting a small amount of liquid soap on the razor and letting it run until it \\&quot;foams\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m still not sure of the difference between the two.)    </li>
            <li> and it actually wasn&#x27;t that expensive (under one hundred dollars).</li>
            <li> I usually do it once a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d usually have to supplement shaving my neck with a razor blade.  </li>
            <li> I do not have a very tough beard, but just went back to one I used 12 years ago</li>
            <li> The charging/cleaning base is something unnecessary, since the shaver is waterproof and can be cleaned easily under a faucet, but it&#x27;s included.  </li>
            <li> My husband wanted an electric shaver for years, put none shaved close enough, and they were awkward in tight places.  </li>
            <li> I have a very heavy beard.</li>
            <li> , the cleaning tank of this unit is very gimmicky and I don&#x27;t use it at all.</li>
            <li> Bleeding is even worse now due to medication.</li>
            <li> cleaning cartridges are much smaller than the Braun cartridges, but this is because you have to manually add water to a small tank on that back of the charging base.</li>
            <li> The cleaning system&#x27;s base unit is a little bulky especially if your space is limited in your bathroom counter and takes some work to prepare with solutions and so on.</li>
            <li> You have to give your skin at least 2-3 weeks for it to adjust to the shaver so don&#x27;t be disappointed if you first shave doesn&#x27;t get close.</li>
            <li> His face is so soft after using it, before getting him this shaver he always had stuble that would scratch my face when he would kiss me and it was very uncomfortable for me.</li>
            <li> The razor will periodically pulse which while it is not loud it is rather disturbing to hear (or so I am told).</li>
            <li> It does give off a higher pitch &#x60;whine&#x27;, while shaving, that is somewhat annoying, but is not what I would consider noisy.</li>
            <li> It has shaved my face at least 5 times a week, every week, for the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> The cartridges are less expensive than the Braun, as well (about 11 bucks with the subscribe-and-save program with Amazon), and they are less messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes cutting in the areas where you don&#x27;t have a lot of skin area (chin, jaw line, upper lip, base of sideburns, etc) more difficult.</li>
            <li> You probably read all of the bad reviews of the new Norelco shavers, and now you&#x27;re probably between two shavers:  the Panasonic ES8109S, and the Braun Pulsonic 7 series.    </li>
            <li> Cleaning unit uses soap, not alcohol; suppose that&#x27;d be less irritating.  </li>
            <li> less irritation), the Remington was so noisy and irritating</li>
            <li> but unfortunately, it takes me at least 5X as long to shave my legs with this shaver, because it just doesn&#x27;t get the job done efficiently.  </li>
            <li> My beard is probably average; not too thick, not too thin.  </li>
            <li> I was so obsessed with closeness that I used to shave with a badger brush and shaving soap using a Hoffritz single blade.</li>
            <li> I used that long thin metal rod to poke into the drain hole at the bottom of the base to try to clear it of any obstruction, but this didn&#x27;t improve anything.  </li>
            <li> My previous experience with electric razors left me with bad impressions of razor burn and skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> When shaving dry, take the foil off and rinse out all the hairs before putting it back into the cleaning base.  </li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin which means shaving is basically a means of tearing my face apart several times a week, the summer is the worst.  </li>
            <li> like I had used a dull razor blade.     </li>
            <li> Hard to imagine being happier.</li>
            <li> I hardly get any irritation from using this thing.</li>
            <li> Hard to beat now that it&#x27;s $99.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been skeptical about electric shavers due to the fact that all of the ones I&#x27;ve had in the past were unreliable and didn&#x27;t give a close shave.</li>
            <li> The razor&#x27;s got dull</li>
            <li> That close shave is hard to pass up...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a wet/dry shaver that works well</li>
            <li> They hardly lasted a week.</li>
            <li> It says you can use tap water, but if you have hard water I would recommend distilled/purified.  </li>
            <li> The time it takes to completely clean,dry and charge is 1 1/2 to 2 hours, not too bad.  </li>
            <li> When it comes to negative thoughts?</li>
            <li> One negative feature is the inability to shave when the unit is being charged.</li>
            <li> I believe it was a combination of shaver, cutting technique, post shave product and moisturizer that was necessary to solve my problem.     </li>
            <li> but I have not heard that complaint nor have I heard the razor making noise from his bathroom.</li>
            <li> I suffer from Neuropathy and I could no longer use a regular safety razor without cutting myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found I need to shave at least once a day with this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all of the negative comments about the noise at all.</li>
            <li> At least I&#x27;m not nicking myself and bleeding profusely.</li>
            <li> I thought people that complained about the noise were overreacting, but the cleaning cycle is noisy.  </li>
            <li> Its self-cleaning function is quite confusing.</li>
            <li> He had complained about ingrown hairs he would get from shaving with his razor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t anticipate needing to shave for at least another twenty four hours.  </li>
            <li> I have not travelled with it yet but expect you could get at least 5 days of use without a recharge probably 7 or 8 days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a MUST using the cleaner at least once each couple of weeks and changing the soap cartdrige</li>
            <li> each 3 months at least.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is the cleaner/charger itself.</li>
            <li> I gave it a try, knowing I could try it for 30 days and send it back if unhappy.</li>
            <li> There are still a few trouble spots underneath my chin and on my neck that are difficult to get without stretching my skin quite a bit, but they were problem areas even when I was using a razor.     </li>
            <li> This is not acceptable since (it seems to me at least)</li>
            <li> The cleaning unit has a complex cycle that whirs and clicks for over an hour, but it cleans the shaver well.</li>
            <li> Now the big disappointment with the razor has been the quality of the shave.  </li>
            <li> However, it does not provide as close a shave as a razor blade and unless you go over at least three times you will have stubble when done.</li>
            <li> That is why I&#x27;m cutting back on my rating a bit.  </li>
            <li> will restore the shaver to its fullest hair capturing &amp; cutting potential.</li>
            <li> This absolutely sucks.</li>
            <li> The cleaning modes do take forever to run their cycle, but hey, at least you don&#x27;t have to be around for it to do its job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product works well, however the instruction manual is poor, despite being a techie person had never had so much trouble understanding their functions.</li>
            <li> Do you really need the charging/cleaning base?</li>
            <li> I have rather thick hair on my face and head</li>
            <li> Having a base is a real plus.</li>
            <li> but you must move slowly across your face and exert some pressure to get a &#x27;close&#x27; shave.</li>
            <li> Even after doing this my beard (slow growing) has a stubble at the end of the day which I&#x27;ve never had before.</li>
            <li> I bought another razor after about a year (only the razor, since I have a base) and the razors sold seperately don&#x27;t include the connections to charge and clean from the cleaning base.</li>
            <li> and I have a pic of of my jaw all RED and bloody due to to the machine.....</li>
            <li> ONCE OVER, THEY MEAN IT.</li>
            <li> The difference is unbelievable!</li>
            <li> I probably spend at least 15 minutes solely on the shave which is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> The first few ultrasonics I had had terrible batteries.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t hear it down the stairs or anything, but if you&#x27;re in the next room and this buzzing keeps coming up, it&#x27;s the base and the shaver cleaning itself.     </li>
            <li> I mean, seriously?  </li>
            <li> Initially I was very skeptical to switch over the brand.  </li>
            <li> When I get a new razor both of these and the base are in the trash.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s ridiculous and impractical, so</li>
            <li> Well, this razor causes such awful ingrowns my legs have constant scabs because I need to dig the hairs out from underneath my skin.</li>
            <li> This is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I use electric shavers to shave both my face and my head, so I put some serious wear and tear on them.  </li>
            <li> If you are serious about getting a bang for your buck, go with the Braun series instead.</li>
            <li> Too bad for them because half of my house appliances and electronics are Panasonic but if this is the customer service that they offer it is not worth it.</li>
            <li> A little difficult getting around my neck line, but tolerable.  </li>
            <li> Plus to put it as simply as possible, I have bad skin.  </li>
            <li> The ES8078 served me well for a year-and-a-half - until I dropped that bad boy in the shower earlier this week! &#x27;</li>
            <li> Panasonic customer care is completely useless, and the firm to which they had me ship the unit for repair is unreachable.  </li>
            <li> And trust me, when you start sweating in the Florida weather and your underarms have razor burn, well, it&#x27;s no good.</li>
            <li> the cleaning mode is extremely loud and annoying .i&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> I hated shaving because of the constant mess of using creams, blades, and cuts.  </li>
            <li> Not pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I never use it in my shower and never will because you will have to replace it after at least 6 months, not because its made poorly because its not made poorly but because it is electronic.    </li>
            <li> My hair was long so it wasn&#x27;t to bad</li>
            <li> In fact, I was lsft with some pretty nasty stubble.  </li>
            <li> The hair on my face grows in one general direction, the ones at the base of my neck go in all directions of the compass.</li>
            <li> A coworker sang its praises but he doesn&#x27;t grow facial hair :(</li>
            <li> Citan would be late for work if he did this in the mornings!.  </li>
            <li> and it totally sucks!  </li>
            <li> , my adam&#x27;s apple is tough though, and the razor burn on both afterwards exceeds my face.  </li>
            <li> Anything over 5 days its tough to cut.</li>
            <li> My beard is tough, medium density; it grows rapidly</li>
            <li> It even worked well the tough spots (like on the neck).  </li>
            <li> The shaves were always close, but I have always found my neck and mustache area to be tough to shave closely without abit of razor burn or a nick.</li>
            <li> It has a very delicate feel on the face, but don&#x27;t be fooled.  </li>
            <li> I have a very thick beard, and it shaves so close</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to go with the new Panasonic, but this time without the Vortex cleaning base as this was the 2nd Panasonic shaver I&#x27;ve owned (one of which I dropped) that I am now stuck with a useless Vortex cleaning base.</li>
            <li> I was a little afraid of waking up the wife during either use</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this razor so badly because i had spent $100</li>
            <li> My face comes out as smoothe as a baby&#x27;s behind.</li>
            <li> The concept and the name behind a thing does not make it an improvement.  </li>
            <li> Also, to get even this poor quality of shave, I&#x27;d have to go over and over all areas of my face.  </li>
            <li> I use it with either Williams Lectric Shave or Shave Secret shaving oil.</li>
            <li> If I get tired of doing that, then I can get analog and run it under tap water.</li>
            <li> than a couple of days without the charge cord (the same cord that powers the cleaning/recharging base will also charge the razor itself...</li>
            <li> /&gt;January 1, 2012 - I was wrong at least as it relates to my beard &amp; face shaving with the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> so I know when to charge again, nothing worse than getting 1/2 way done</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a plastic tub in the back of the base that you take out to add the water.</li>
            <li> The device doesn&#x27;t have 3 blades and it works poorly.</li>
            <li> Regardless of razor, shaving cream/gel, technique, or schedule the irritation of shaving just made things worse.  </li>
            <li> I have been shaving with a razor for 4 years now, and problems on my face have been getting worse and worse.  </li>
            <li> I hate hair on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> , I got tired of razor</li>
            <li> in fact its gotten even worse...    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stand behind this again and again.</li>
            <li> The performance was way worse than even my trimmer.</li>
            <li> The cleaning station isn&#x27;t poorly made, just unnecessary.</li>
            <li> I prefer the foil razors, as they seem to me to shave closer, and it is easier to maneuver them around the ears and nose without leaving behind hairs.  </li>
            <li> After using this shaver, I still feel like I have approximately a noon shadow.</li>
            <li> However, the difficulty in cleaning, noise and lack of a charging base tipped me to the Panasonic as the final choice.    </li>
            <li> All in all: the ES8243A 4-blade is a poor value.    </li>
            <li> Remington did a poor job with the details.    </li>
            <li> I never was crazy about the shave it gave me, and the cleaning unit was messy and eventually stopped working.  </li>
            <li> The display started going wonky, showing random characters that made no sense.  </li>
            <li> According to the manual, the shaver can be cleaned under cold running water and air dried if you opt to buy the shaver only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cleaning/lubricating solution in the Vortex consists of a slender cartridge containing a detergent based solid that becomes \\&quot;activated\\&quot; when it mixes with water in the Vortex base.</li>
            <li> You actually fill the base with water yourself and then it mixes the soap and water whenever you run it through the cleaning cycle.  </li>
            <li> If you have thin hair, then perhaps this would work.  </li>
            <li> On my cheeks and face, it&#x27;s almost impossible to tell between the razor and Panasonic&#x27;s little beauty.</li>
            <li> All of these went bad in less then a year</li>
            <li> and it has made the morning routine a lot less painful.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco was doing a terrible job on my beard.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first about the cleaning system since I hate spending money on crap that I don&#x27;t need.  </li>
            <li> base on the other hand came defective.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this razor is TERRIBLE for my sensitive skin.    </li>
            <li> However, I am little disappointed with the results.     </li>
            <li> This trimmer gets even closer than the Braun, and I have had very little razor burn (the Braun was bad).  </li>
            <li> and you had press very hard to get even a marginal shave!    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very weak on that.</li>
            <li> and at times would leave me in a bloody mess.    </li>
            <li> -The cleaning base is also a little noisy.</li>
            <li> The saddest part of all this is that this is the highest reviewed shaver on amazon, I have lost all hope for electric shavers don&#x27;t waste your money on this worthless piece of junk.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is close to useless, IMHO, but that isn&#x27;t why I bought it anyway.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried and failed over the years to find an electric shaver that could do the job as well as a razor.</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;ve grown proficient in the use of tweezers, the process grew tiresome.</li>
            <li> Wrong.  </li>
            <li> Edge advantage seems to no longer be in production, which is unfortunate.  </li>
            <li> As for the cleaner, I read a review on here that said it was difficult to use...</li>
            <li> It is unfortunate it is prone to poop out</li>
            <li> Overall, don&#x27;t fall for it for its comfort, because I would rather deal with a horrible burn than something that does not shave at all.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s why I was so skeptical when order a shaver</li>
            <li> Bought the shaver after reading the reviews not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> However, after about a year, the charger began to sporadically fail.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention the fact that the replacement blades for the Mach 3 were somewhat expensive.  </li>
            <li> One thing i am worried about, was the beard trimmer, i was using it once, and i must have opened it the wrong way because it detached from the moving mechanizer thingy.</li>
            <li> I always told myself I would never buy a electric razor because they are soo expensive,</li>
            <li> This unfortunately isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> An electric razor is useless after about a week unless it&#x27;s disassembled and thoroughly cleaned.  </li>
            <li> it inflames the skin and becomes uncomfortable for the rest of the morning.</li>
            <li> So I have always been skeptical of electric razors.</li>
            <li> + shaver is practically useless when it comes to my type of hair.  </li>
            <li> Signs this is happeing to you include weird display issues.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had this panasonic shaver for a few years now, and i hate the darn thing.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong.</li>
            <li> so expensive.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s motor failed after a year of operation</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this shaver has an under-powered motor and the floating head that cannot be locked.    </li>
            <li> It is noisy (angry bee hive)</li>
            <li> needs a razor blade to get remaining stubble to a cleaner shave and side burn trimmer is useless.  </li>
            <li> NOT GOOD!!!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about another electric razor.  </li>
            <li> So I was skeptical of spending $100+ on another electric.     </li>
            <li> but the jaw line, throat and neck all failed.</li>
            <li> Since it was rather expensive, I was concerned how he would like it.  </li>
            <li> Sorry Panasonic...</li>
            <li> Waste of money to buy the cleaning base.</li>
            <li> The cleaner is a bit expensive a $3 or 4 dollar expense a month.</li>
            <li> The biggest problem I have about it is that because there&#x27;s a lot of moving parts to the setup, it can be tedious to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Vortex system is an expensive joke.</li>
            <li> I came from a Braun system and was not impressed, but kept with it for about 3 years until it broke.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning &#x27;soap&#x27; seems expensive (according to enclosed brochure)</li>
            <li> The pop up beard trimmer on this razor is virtually useless, I would recommend buying a dedicated trimmer if you need one.  </li>
            <li> I have a very tough beard.  </li>
            <li> Very frustrating.  </li>
            <li> Its just absolutely terrible, I&#x27;ve tried using it in water, dry, with soap, with shaving cream, etc.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the cleaning function in the base, I only use the base for charging.</li>
            <li> If you hate shaving and hate the irritation that goes along with using a regular blade (even the Mach 3)</li>
            <li> I hate shaving and my wife hates stubble - not a good combination.</li>
            <li> , it does NOT get all the hairs, it has an especially hard time on the adams apple.</li>
            <li> a machine do my dirty work for me.</li>
            <li> How crazy is that?</li>
            <li> Crazy  </li>
            <li> Bottom line, this thing stinks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my boyfriend who needs to shave often but was always cutting himself.</li>
            <li> just crazy</li>
            <li> Panasonic also claims that the foil and cutting block should be replaced every 12 months.</li>
            <li> so I have to order them from Amazon which is inconvenient.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t even feel it cutting.  </li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve used very expensive Norelco&#x27;s and they don&#x27;t even compare...</li>
            <li> I got this after my very expensive name brand razor turned into what I would consider to be an epilator and not a shaver.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the base isn&#x27;t up to spec -</li>
            <li> But if I had to shave 2 days in a row, it was a very uncomfortable experience, with a lot of irritation on my neck.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it fell and broke a part of the base.</li>
            <li> Some very expensive Brauns, Remington and others.</li>
            <li> I mean, they are AWFUL and to be avoided at all costs.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was physically impossible.</li>
            <li> All products will get corrosion and it&#x27;s impossible to say it wont.</li>
            <li> This thing is seriously the worst</li>
            <li> The biggest thing was that it was nearly impossible to shave evenly.</li>
            <li> I intentionality grew my beard out (1 week of hair) to test its cutting ability and I was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> - My worst qualm of all is this: my beard hair is bristly and each hair very thick.  </li>
            <li> are downright bad.  </li>
            <li> After about five minutes, the shave does not look bad.  </li>
            <li> So between treatments and bad genes</li>
            <li> when i say, this shaver will CUT your SKIN BADLY.</li>
            <li> it causes me a lot of irritations, leaves a lot of hair which i ended up using my razor, and it does a really really bad job around the nick.</li>
            <li> really bad everytime</li>
            <li> Like I said it isn&#x27;t all bad but at the end of the day I rate this shaver as  \\&quot;It&#x27;s OK\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> On a bad day, probably 75%.  </li>
            <li> There were times I had to rinse it off in the sink because it smelled bad after a &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I am still shocked how well it works.  </li>
            <li> I tried Norelco previously, it irritating my neck horribly.</li>
            <li> I dabbled a bit with blade shaving but found it to be impractical and often painful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked at how close a shave</li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> Try it, I do not think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> but it wont (call me stupid).</li>
            <li> How can I make up for all the time I lost using the stupid Spectra ?</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t need to travel with the somewhat bulky base if you don&#x27;t want to).  </li>
            <li> hate shaving to begin with</li>
            <li> I still (after two months of shaving with the razor) have no idea of when to do what with the control buttons on the base.</li>
            <li> The base and cleaning system though, after about 7 months, was/is always leaving water on the counter, which smells.</li>
            <li> suggest throwing away the charging base.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy the razor by itself instead of getting the base with it</li>
            <li> tip, read the instructions before using the cleaning thing on the base.</li>
            <li> the cleaning base after EVERY shave.  </li>
            <li> By rinsing after shaving and then putting your shaver in the cleaning base, you will prolong the life of the cleaning cartridges.  </li>
            <li> This is NOT a shaving mode, but a cleaning mode to use when you don&#x27;t have the base.</li>
            <li> but I do like the base for charging and to have somewhere to put the razor when not in use.  </li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I hate electric razors.</li>
            <li> I absolutley hate shaving and will let my hair grow for 3-4 days.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning/charging base was neat in the beginning</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get the base cleaner...</li>
            <li> I REALLY HATE</li>
            <li> Cleaning base is nice,not a gimick.</li>
            <li> I am having problems with the base, the part that holds the shaver.  </li>
            <li> There is water or cleaning solution pooling at the bottom of the base, which means the shaver head sits in the water/cleaning solution over night.  </li>
            <li> cleaning base has died.  </li>
            <li> -I did not want to upgrade that bad!</li>
            <li> This razor needs a redesign badly!</li>
            <li> So I tried a rotary and hated it,</li>
            <li> I know you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I am very very disappointed and upset with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It is especially bad on the neck.</li>
            <li> No matter what I have tried I just could not get them to go away, the in-grown hairs were horrible.</li>
            <li> I have NOT been disappointed!!  </li>
            <li> I used to hate shaving!</li>
            <li> I have always had a horrible time shaving my underarms.</li>
            <li> awful razor burn under my arms.</li>
            <li> This is, without a doubt, one of my worst purchases ever.</li>
            <li> This is a pathetic shaver.</li>
            <li> This has got to be the worst razor I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> I wish Panasonic hadn&#x27;t jumped on the bandwagon to include these cleaning stations for their high-end razors, just reduce the price and leave that crap out!  </li>
            <li> This is a horrible horrible product.</li>
            <li> This morning it basically cut me up real bad</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Im a daily shaver, and this thing saved me so much time every morning. Self cleaning base is a great feature. change filter regularly. Best results on dry face, with the grain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for two and a half weeks and I&#x27;m returning it.  I shave my entire head, except for a goatee, and my testicles.  I was hoping for a quicker shave than I get with a regular 3-blade manual safety razor.      First off, it wound up taking longer than a manual razor.  The one wide foil is not well suited to shaving a round skull and it takes a lot more passes to run the razor closely over all areas.  Maybe the three floating heads of other brands may be better at covering all the spots.    Second, the edger doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as the blades, so to shape my beard I had to continue to use the safety razor if I didn&#x27;t want the areas around the beard to be scruffier than the other parts of my face.    Third, it shaves my testicles OK, but the the shaver really stings the seam between them.    With extra effort I could get a decent shave.    It gets an extra star for the liberal Panasonic return policy.</li>
            <li> This was my first attempt to use an electric shaver after about 10 years of conventional shaving. The shaver is unable to give me a clean shave especially around the curvy area just below the chin. I tried both dry and wet modes but couldn&#x27;t get it to do my job. Applying more pressure causes a pain on the skin. If you are looking for a clean shave this is not the one. Next I&#x27;ll probably try philips or go back to conventional:(    The trimmer and self-cleaning features are good but main functionality is broken, so doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> I have been using an elecric razor since I was sixteen and I&#x27;m well itno my fourty&#x27;s now.  My father was a big Remington fan so I used that brand of shaver for many years.  Then we got him a Norelco (Rotary) for Christmas one year and he loved it, so I switched to Norelco too.  I had problems with both shavers in terms of skin irriatation but they did the job on my sensitve skin. Well, my last Norelco started losing power so I thought I would upgrade.  I always wanted one of those fancy Braun&#x27;s with the automatic cleaning/lubrication system but they are well over $200 -I did not want to upgrade that bad! In searchng Amazon for an alternative, I saw the Panasonic.  The Panasonic products I&#x27;ve owned in the past have worked well, so I was open to the idea of a Panasonic shaver.    Ordered and received the  shaver in a very timely manner from Amazon.com and plugged it in for a charge. Gave it a try the next morning and I was immediately impressed. I like the weighty and substantial feel this razor has in my hand.  It&#x27;s also a good looking tool (always important).  After a few days of using this razor my face was smooth and free of nicks or bumps.  WOW!  this thing really works!  My face experienced zero irritation as a result of switching to this new razor.  The micro fiol from Remington and the rotaries always chewed up my face until I got used used to them (translation:  until I wore down the razores a a bit).  but I had no irritation at all with the Panasonic.      The cleaner is a bit bulky and noisey and there&#x27;s really nothing slick about it; in fact its kind of ugly, but it works well!  I set it to clean/charge/dry my razor and it came out sparkling new and shiny clean.  Replacement blades, screens, and cleaning cartridges are fairly reasonable in price, so that is good.  I also shaved using shaving foam but the results were not so good when I did.  The foam gobed up the razor so it did not cut as closely as it could have.  In fact, I was lsft with some pretty nasty stubble.  I then began using Lab Series pre shave and once again I was extrememly impressed. I know that&#x27;s another review but the point I am making is that you should get the best pre electric shave lotion (not foam) you can (avoid the drug store stuff if possible).  Lab Series is great and has very low odor.  It&#x27;s about [...] a pop but it lasts a long time and works better than any other pre electric shave lotion I&#x27;ve tried.    I am completely happy with this shaver and highyl recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.I am 60 yrs. old and have shaved with a blade ever since I began to shave.Of course I have tried an electric razor a few times,but they never got anywhere close as a blade.Over the years I have had several skin cancers removed from my face and head creating a surface that is none too pleasant to shave with a blade.About a month ago,I told my wife that I was going to try one more electric razor.After reading up on different razors and looking at the reviews,I decided to try the Panasonic.Best decision I have made in a long time.I use it in the wet mode and lather up with shaving creme just like I was going to use a blade.  My face comes out as smoothe as a baby&#x27;s behind.All I can say is try it,you will love it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Razor give a close shave and it only took it a month to train my beard to be cut.  Great Shaver.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I need to spend a ton of time giving this the lauds and laurels it deserves, but it does deserve them.  This was my first experience with a wet/dry razor, and it works very well.  It is a bit louder than the electrics I&#x27;ve had in the past (I think this is due to the exceptionally fast rate the blades move at), but if you use it in the shower the noise isn&#x27;t as bad as you&#x27;d think.  I guess the bigger concern is the extra water wasted if you shave in the shower.    Back on track, almost as smoother as with a regular razor, but without all the extra irritation on the neck.  Best electric I&#x27;ve used (I&#x27;ve had braun and norelco models in this similar quality/price range and this is the best so far).</li>
            <li> I have a very tough beard.  Usually, I have to shave with an electric razor first and then use a blade to finish it up.  I have been trying different razors of all brands and costs for years, and nothing ever worked.  Until now.  This razor is incredbile.  Even if I don&#x27;t shave for a few days, it takes off everything clean and smooth.  And I don&#x27;t need to touch up with a blade afterwards.  I am still shocked how well it works.  In fact, this is the only review I have ever written on anything I purchased.  That is how much I like this.</li>
            <li> It is a solid product.  Close shave.  Quiet compared to my past electric razors.  The cleaning process takes about 45 minutes after each use.  No complaints after using it for about 30 days.</li>
            <li> What I find remarkable is that over 200 people gave this a favorable review.    What you might do before buying is to consider why over 30 people disliked it so much that they left a negative review.      I&#x27;m such a sucker.  I read so VERY MANY reviews, on this site and others, and I looked into all the \\&quot;technology\\&quot; that goes into the shavers.  The concept and the name behind a thing does not make it an improvement.  Whatever special shaving angle or cleaning technology the electronics companies might hawk as the latest thing might not translate into a better shave.    In my case, I&#x27;m coming from using a regular non-electric razor.  I wanted something that I could just pick up and shave with -- it would have to be fast and it would have to work both wet and dry.    I got this shaver and tried it for about four weeks, wet and dry, many different configurations.  It never worked for me.  As other reviewers have said, it worked on parts of my face well but not others.  I developed new areas of razor burn on my face (even in the fourth week) that I never had before.  Also, I didn&#x27;t like having some places on my face being shaved so close that it seemed like I shaved UP with a razor, while others seemed not fully shaved.  So immediately after the shave I&#x27;d look sort of hacked up.  This look would be accentuated after a few hours of growth.  Also, to get even this poor quality of shave, I&#x27;d have to go over and over all areas of my face.  It took me about three times as long as shaving with a normal razor, despite the fact that when I shave with a normal razor I have to get wet, wash my face, use shaving gel and after shave, etc.      I just cannot understand the 200+ positive reviews.  This thing actually works for some people??  Incredible.      Well, my plan was to try it for 30 days and return it if it didn&#x27;t work, and that&#x27;s what I did.  Amazon return was very easy. (My reason for return: \\&quot;Does not work as advertised.\\&quot;)    As for noise, cheap feel, and so on I agree with other negative reviews, but honestly I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it were twice as loud and felt like a toy, so long as it could shave my face.  Using a razor takes a fraction of the time and my face looks evenly and closely shaved every time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor specifically for the purpose of shaving my head and I have to say that I am glad I did!  I have been using it for about 4 month&#x27;s now and it works great.  If you like the bald look but do not like using a regular razor on your head, then give this a try.  I use it with either Williams Lectric Shave or Shave Secret shaving oil.</li>
            <li> The Vortex ended up being exactly what I thought it would be... A solid razor with a self contained cleaning unit for a decent price.    I don&#x27;t have much to add to the other reviews about the actual function of the razor.  Long story short, it works.  You may have sensitive skin or may not take well to an electric, but that&#x27;s not the razor&#x27;s fault.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues yet.    My only complaint (the reason for the 1 star loss) is how loud and how long the cleaning process was.  I&#x27;ve never had a self cleaning unit, so I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but I figured the cleaning/drying cycle would take like 20mins tops.  It was well over that, pushing about an hour.  Also, it&#x27;s a bit loud if you have it near your bed (mine&#x27;s on the bottom shelf of my nightstand) or anywhere you wouldn&#x27;t want to hear it.  About the sound of somebody&#x27;s loud vibrating cell on a glass table.    Anyway, certainly not enough for me to make a return, I&#x27;ll just keep it charged ahead of time and will put it in to clean when leaving for work in the AM.</li>
            <li> I finally switched from blades. I love this thing. I have been using it for 4 months so I can so for sure I am a convert. I can shave faster and get a great shave. I bought a high end Remington to leave at the gym and it is a joke compared to the Panasonic. I thought the self cleaning was a gimmick, but it it great.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a good shaver for my head and face for years. I shave my head bald, and my beautiful face, lol. I have used many electric shavers over the years, even Braun for my head and face. This Panasonic ES8109S saves my head  as close a razor blade. You cannot get any closer than this shaver for a nice smooth shinny head. I read reviews, researched and found many men recommend this Panasonic. Amazon had the best price, and free shipping, how can you go wrong? Excellent shaver, and it comes with a charging, and cleaning system, or you can clean it and charge it by hand and with the charging cord. You want the best shaver for you head, and face, get this shaver. Remember, God created a few beautiful heads, the rest, he put hair on!</li>
            <li> This shaver is absolute trash. To put it simply it does not shave at all, leaving behind huge patches of hair on my neck, underside of my head and also on my face. The only part of my face that it will actually shave well is my mustache or about 10% of the total area of skin I need to shave. I used it every day for three weeks and the results did not get better. The saddest part of all this is that this is the highest reviewed shaver on amazon, I have lost all hope for electric shavers don&#x27;t waste your money on this worthless piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver a year ago, and while I have traditionally preferred blades, I thought I&#x27;d give this one a try due to the positive reviews.      After a year, I am reasonably pleased with the performance.  I use it in a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; fashion, and the shave quality is good.  Not as good as blades, but very close and with less irritation and no danger of cuts.  The trimmer is close to useless, IMHO, but that isn&#x27;t why I bought it anyway.  Clean up is a snap using the base unit and cartridges.  Generally, cartidges seem to last about a month with daily use, although I now manage quite a bit longer cartridge life by opening the shave head and rinsing off the bulk of the stubble in the sink before sticking it into the unit to be cleaned.  After a year, the original blades that came with the unit are still cutting well.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve all heard the claims of a closer shave from so many razor manufactures that it doesn&#x27;t phase us any longer. We&#x27;ve all tried many different types and styles to get that close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look no further. I was surprised at the closeness of this razor. I used the Fusion razor in the shower to shave my head and under my chin for a close shave.  I wanted to have something that if I was in a hurry and didn&#x27;t have time to shower and shave; would give me the same results.  This razor filled that request and went above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the self-cleaning system of the razor, and the fact that it also dries the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am \\&quot; scared \\&quot; away from new things because most of the time it takes a degree in engineering to set things up.  This razor set up with ease and I could understand the easy instructions; in English. I&#x27;ve returned merchandise before because the instructions in English consisted of two to three words and complete sentences in Spanish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit looks impressive and I realized that I had just purchased the best electric razor in my life, after several purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and surprise yourself.</li>
            <li> Closest shave I have ever had with an electric.  Quiet, powerful, recharges quickly, and easy to clean.  I use it every day!</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews, but I tend to benefit from them and this gadget blew me away. I&#x27;ve tried and failed over the years to find an electric shaver that could do the job as well as a razor. I thought it was physically impossible. Not so, as I came to find out. I am in the military. We shave everyday, and the old saying goes \\&quot;a good soldier never needs a shave/haircut). This means you should always look clean shaven. I have coarse whiskers densely arrayed around my chin, with a light sprinkling elsewhere. This gives the appearance of someone attempting to start a goatee when the five o&#x27;clock shadow comes in. Like Joe Dirt, it&#x27;s genetics. It also means I can&#x27;t get away with a crappy shave, it makes the Joe Dirt effect much more pronounced.    I&#x27;ve always used razors, usually a variation of the Sensor. I must be getting old because a vibrating safety razor with half a dozen blades that costs as much as car payment is not attractive to me. Said razors did the job well, but at a price. There is always a tradeoff. I tried different strokes and techniques but the end result was always the same - I would get razor bumps. To add insult to injury, some days I have to be up fairly early for physical training. This means I have to be clean shaven, but I don&#x27;t want to shower first because I will get sweaty and have to shower anyway, which makes softening the coarse whiskers a dubious process at best because I am drowsy and in a hurry. This means shaving nicks in addition to ingrown hairs. Though I&#x27;ve grown proficient in the use of tweezers, the process grew tiresome. I thought there could be a better way, without lathering up and forgetting to pick up more razors when I run out.    The hair on my face grows in one general direction, the ones at the base of my neck go in all directions of the compass. This shaver deals with them all nicely. The package arrived, I had everything out and ready to go and charged up in no time.    I understood that this was a wet/dry shaverand I thought it would be a good idea to wet my face and use a thin cream to lube my mug for the big event. I turned it on and pressed it to my face and felt some pain with hairs pulling. I had a three day growth. Lesson one, use this for one or maybe two days&#x27; growth at most (for me, your mileage may vary). Lesson two, don&#x27;t try to get fancy and use conventional shaving preparation methods. I used to mock this product, but get some Lectric Shave. It smells like old school aftershave and supposedly stands your whiskers up for the shave. I don&#x27;t know if mine are standing up any more than usual, but it provides a lubricating quality to your skin which prevents razor burn when you have to go over the same spot several times, which you will be doing if you get any electric shaver. It works. I no longer deal with ingrown hairs, razor burn or nicks. Shaving (the actual act of removing hair) takes a few minutes longer, but it is well worth it and you don&#x27;t have to do all the prep work, so in the end I would guess that this is actually quicker. After shaving I can bathe and wash my face and there is no burn where I shaved, even with soap on the same area. This is certainly a more flexible and forgiving arrangement. I&#x27;ve had this product for three weeks. The first few days I was not convinced, and even the product literature will tell you to stick with it. They were right.    A 100% charge would appear to last for a while, I&#x27;ve not really tested it. When I begin it says 100%, when I send it home to clean up it still says 100%.    On to the self contained cleaning system. I run it through a cleaning cycle everyday after shaving. I imagine it may reduce the life of some components, but it&#x27;s cool as hell to have a machine do my dirty work for me. I shave, slap the shaver into the cleaning/charging unit and walk away. When I need it later it is dry and clean, even on the inside. I&#x27;ve checked. I will not bellyache about a few bucks for a detergent cartridge once in a while, butthat&#x27;s me. If I get tired of doing that, then I can get analog and run it under tap water. Both will do the job.    In summation, if you have similar grooming issues to deal with, you can buy this with confidence. No I am not a paid endorser, I&#x27;m just excited that I found a better mousetrap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been many years since I used an electric shaver, but I can still remember the irritation of the skin that I endured. Four months ago I had carotid surgery that left the left side of my neck numb, making use of a blade razor a bit touchy.  I bought this razor and am totally satisfied with how it shaves.  No irritation. Clean shave with minimum effort. And, best of all, no concern about cutting my neck!</li>
            <li> I bought this razor as a Gold Box Deal of the day because the price was right and I needed a new shaver. I was a bit skeptical at first because of all of the good reviews that it had.  I used it for the first time yesterday and was very very happy with how close of a shave that it actually got.  I have not had a closer shave with an electric razor than this and even my girlfriend commented that my face was more smooth than usual.  The cleaning system is pretty good too.  I would recommend this for anyone who is looking for a great electric shaver at a reasonable price.  Good purchase indeed!</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews here on Amazon I was hoping to get a shaver that would not give me razor burn and help me save money on razor blades. I was also hoping my wife could even use it.    My wife tried to use it twice. I can&#x27;t tell  you what my wife said about this product on here.    I found that I have to run the shaver over my face very slow, make 4 to 5 passes over the same area and press the shaver to my face with a lot of force. It is especially bad on the neck. I use to be able to shave in a couple of mins, now it takes about 10 mins. It does shave as close as a razor but I noticed it misses single whiskers. Feels odd to find a single whisker just above your lip or on your cheek. LOL.    I would have returned this product but when I checked the shipping and restocking fee, it would have been even a bigger lose than keeping it.    I use Gillette Shave Gel with Glycerin when I shave in the hot shower. Not using it causes the shaver to stick to my face. In other words it won&#x27;t just glide across my skin without the use of the shaving gel.     After shaving I noticed I had several nicks on my face, like I had used a dull razor blade.     Very disappointing. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have never used an electric razer before so this was a change of pace for me... I got this one due to the fact that it&#x27;s a wet/dry shaver and shaving in the shower just seemed like a great idea. the only problem is the dock is loud and takes forever... i know everyone already mentions that but yeah it&#x27;s crazy loud</li>
            <li> Panasonic sent me this razor (factory refurbished) to replace (under warranty) another razor that didn&#x27;t shave either my legs or my husband&#x27;s beard.  They provided customer service after I was persistent about the other shaver (now discontinued).</li>
            <li> This is the closest shave I have ever gotten from an electric razor.  Other than being loud, this is a great product.  I switched from razor blade to this electric razor and experienced no discomfort even the first time I used it.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have coarse hair and i&#x27;m generally pretty hairy. This shaver is next to useless for trimming, it really only works if you&#x27;re trying to shave off a slightly-more-than-a-5-o-clock-shadow. So unless I shave every 2 days, this shaver isn&#x27;t that great. I have to run through 5-6 times for a close enough shave (this is NOT a close shaver) and it sometimes burns.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he loves it.  Best razor he has ever owned.  It shave very clean but does have trouble getting the area below his nose.  Likes that it is self cleaning.</li>
            <li> This shaver work fantastically and waterproof. I would say shaving is easier with this product than using razors.   Note that I do not use the Hydraclean, because it may be gross to use the same liquid for cleaning without changing to in 30 days. So I decided clean manually instead of using it.  You may consider buying the version without hydraclean system.</li>
            <li> Get the Panasonic ES8103S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade shaver instead. This model with the cleaning unit is bulky and the cleaning unit is unnecessary since it comes with a brush plus since it is wet/dry shaver you can clean it by just using soap and water on the blade area. One problem with this unit and the  Panasonic ES8103S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade shaver is that it has a light that flashes after its charged so you cannot keep it plugged in all the time. No electric shaver is going to shave as close as a blade and will require several passes to get the job done. I have a light beard and still it requires sevreral passes over the same spot. I thought I&#x27;d like the floating pivoting head but after the novelty wore off in a few days I put it in the lock position so that it would stay steady. It is a good as a my former Braun and the replacement parts (blades/foils) are less expensive.</li>
            <li> This is my first review EVER so you know I must be ecstatic about this shaver !!! I would give it 5 stars but to me that is just something one strives for. Anyway I get a really close shave with the ES8109S and the cleaning system is awesome.</li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic electric razor I&#x27;ve purchased.  The first one was the ES8103 (same model as this but without the charger/cleaner).  I use this one and my teenage son uses the other.  We are both extremely satisfied.  Previously I used Braun razors, but when my Braun finally broke (battery stopped taking a charge), I switched to Panasonic.  The shave is every bit as good as the Braun, and the Panasonic is about $100 to $150 LESS!  Both the Braun and the Panasonic use a straight vibrating cutter, so switching is easy.</li>
            <li> I used Norelco shavers + Braun shavers for 15 years. None even compare to the Panasonic Vortex shavers. These simly are the best. They shave your face very evenly and do not tear up your neck like the Norelco ones. My face is very sensitive and this one never irritates it. I use no shave cream or pre shave and shave dry. It is great for on-the-go shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this shaver!</li>
            <li> I switched over to this model of electric shaver last week because I was sick and tired of spending 15 dollars on 4 gilette fusion razor blades that were only lasting me 4 shaves before destroying my face.  Knowing that Panasonic shavers were available for using wet with lotion, and having tried one dry (which I was decently impressed by) I decided to take the plunge and order this thing for 100 dollars.    1st Shave:  Ouch.  I was excited as a kid on christmas when this thing got to my house, and made the mistake of attempting to shave with it dry, since I didn&#x27;t have time for a shower.  It did a fine job on my face.  My neck looked like somebody had tried to lynch me, and it took about 4 days for the cuts and the razor burn to heal.  My fault though, even back when I used a Norelco it was a cool skin model and I didn&#x27;t use it unless I had just showered.  That left me with razor burn too.  Disappointed, I figured I&#x27;d wait it out to see what happened.    2nd Shave: WOW!!! Well, after waiting three days for my face to heal up, I showered, splashed on some lectric shave, and mixed some Edge Advantage Revitalizing Cream with an even amount of Neutrogena razor defense shave cream and had at it.  Face was WAY smoother in a short period of time.  The neck still burned, but this time I was prepared with post shave lotion and that helped out greatly.  Also, allowing the lectric shave 30 -45 seconds on the neck and face before applying the cream helped me get a LOT closer on the sides of the neck, under the jaw, and on the face.  I was pretty happy with that shave, and thought that once my neck, and particularly my adams apple got used to it, this thing would be awesome.  So I went looking for slicker, longer lasting shave gels and other things to help set my beard up, leading me to shave 3.    3rd Shave:  This one wasn&#x27;t as good as the second, but not as bad as the first.  After buying some neutrogena razor defense face scrub (for use before shaving) and some Nivea For MenHI-PERFORMANCE X-TREME shaving gel I figured I&#x27;d have the winning combo nailed.  Wrong.  The foam was thick, which I&#x27;m sure gunked up the blades resulting in me having to go over my face and neck more, resulting in more irritation.  To make matters worse, that pre-shave scrub only seemed to dry my skin out, which coupled with some razor bite and an alcohol based pre shave did not end well.  I did, however, notice that despite how my neck FELT, it looks like it&#x27;s improving with every shave in terms of adapting to the irritation.  Still not \\&quot;AS CLOSE AS A BLADE WITHOUT THE IRRITATION!!\\&quot; like so many of these companies claim.      I will probably come back to this review later to update it, but for now all I can say is that the performance of the shaver is EXTREMELY important to me, over aesthetics, cleaning systems, and all that other stuff.  My beard isn&#x27;t super thick, but it&#x27;s definitely thick enough to ware down Gilette Fusion blades by the third shave, and after the fourth the blade is useless.  That said, after just a shower and either of the previously mentioned shave creams(neutrogena or edge advantage) I was getting the most absolutely perfect shave you could think of or envision.    In comparison, I am still letting my skin get used to this.  I&#x27;ve had this new shaver for a week, and I&#x27;ve used it three times.  My skin DOES seem to be adjusting, but it seems to be extremely important that you first have the razor cleaned, as the shaving solution also acts as a kind of lubricant, or so it seems.  Second, DON&#x27;T use this thing dry if you have issues with electrics beating up your neck.  My old norelco did this, and even the perfect gilette fusion nicked my neck every now and then at the adams apple, same spot this thing is having issues.  Thirdly, use a thin shaving cream or gel that stays slippery.  Clinique and Billy Jealousy, as well as Zihr, are all supposed to have great ones that provide excellent razor glide, although they are expensive, and I haven&#x27;t yet tried them.  Edge advantage seems to no longer be in production, which is unfortunate.  Neutrogena razor defense cream has worked well for me though.  Thin is important though, as a thick gel will clog the razor. Fourth, a pre-electric solution like Lectric Shave, Afta, or any of the others out there seems to make a difference.  I can&#x27;t feel it on my skin until after the shave when I notice how much smoother my face is compared to when I don&#x27;t use it. Lastly, get a really really good soothing after shave balm.  Neutrogena&#x27;s isn&#x27;t bad, but it doesn&#x27;t cool.  Nivea is supposed to have a good cooling one, and again Billy Jealousy is supposed to have good after shave balm as well.  If you feel like spending 22 dollars on it, I have heard rave reviews for the clinique post shave healer.      Ultimately, I bought this razor to save money on fusion blades, which are costing me a reasonable chunk of cash.  That and the fact that I love different electronic gadgets and this thing fit the bill and sounded great, so I took the plunge.    It is NOT as thorough as a razor in my opinion, nor is it as fast.  That said, I have still only had it for 6 days, and have only used it three times.  Stubble seems to grow back quicker, which would infer the shave isn&#x27;t as close.  Despite this, my face feels smooth as velvet after use, despite some irritation.  The irritation is a major issue though on the neck and adams apple.  My neck is shaved just fine, my adam&#x27;s apple is tough though, and the razor burn on both afterwards exceeds my face.  In the end though, a good post shave lotion can take care of that quickly.  Cheaper than buying tons of blades, but more irritation if you aren&#x27;t used to electrics.  Also, the money you spend trying to find the right kind of pre shave, during the shave, and after shave lotions could add up quickly.    These are my opinions, everybody has a different beard type, different skin type, etc.  I have a friend who&#x27;s been shaving for the past 8 years with a braun syncro and has no issues with it, and gets close.  He started using it at 14 though and hasn&#x27;t stopped, so I imagine he&#x27;s used to it.  I used a rotary electric from 13 to 15 and then went back to a blade until last week, a little less than two months from my 22nd birthday, and my face is having a tougher time.  But, amazon does give you time to return this thing, so if you want to, try it.  If it doesn&#x27;t work, back it goes, if it does, then you&#x27;re set, so you don&#x27;t have anything to lose.      EDIT:  After the fourth shave I&#x27;ve had enough.  The razor does a nice enough job on the face, but it murders anything below my jaw line.  After two light passes with it on my neck I began bleeding and was left with a big red smile looking mark from one side of my neck to the other.  Again.  Also, with all the passes needed to actually cut the hairs, shaving with this razor took me FAR longer than with a blade, so back to blades I go.  Apparently with a brush, rubbing alcohol, a dry cloth, and a dry place to store your razor you can extend the blade life by two to three times it&#x27;s usual life.  Sounds like that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll be doing from now on.  I really wanted this razor to be awesome and do what it said it does, but frankly it falls well short.  I don&#x27;t know who Panasonic is kidding when they talk about \\&quot;one pass shaving\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> After much research, I purchased this shaver to replace my dying Norelco wet/dry shaver.  I&#x27;ve used Norelco&#x27;s all my life and they&#x27;ve done the job, but I&#x27;ve always thought they could do a bit better.  This Panasonic shaver has given me the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had, very close and comfortable without having to go over the same area over and over again.  Factor in that you can use it dry or in the shower (which you can&#x27;t with a Braun), and the great price, and I don&#x27;t see how you can do better than this shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned 2 of these razors.  The first gave me the best shave ever - then died after 2 years.  Still, I liked it so much I bought another.  This one, however, started acting up and not shaving properly after 6 months.  Panasonic customer care is completely useless, and the firm to which they had me ship the unit for repair is unreachable.  I&#x27;m going back to Braun...</li>
            <li> I used to have Braun and Philips Norelco shavers and I decided to upgrade to a better one. The Panasonic E8109s costs twice as much as my older shavers, but you get what you paid for. I have been using it everyday for three months so far I am very satisfied with it. The shaving is very smooth with far less irritation than my previous shavers. Shaving during shower and the clean kit are the plus to the shaver.</li>
            <li> This razor was purchased for an uncle with vision limitations - never saw him respond with such pleasure - another resident who saw his had to have one which led to my second purchase within a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I was using Panasonic linear shaver for years, but finally the battery would not hold the charge and I decided to buy a new model.  My new ES8109S is absolutely great!  It shaves very close and it is not as loud as my old one.  The Hydra Clean feature is fantastic!  It&#x27;s like brand new every time I clean the shaver.  Panasonic did not disappointed me.  Great product. Would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> For most of my shaving life I have used blades but have have also used a couple of Norelco electric shavers in the past.  The idea of a wet dry electric shaver appealed to me and the reviews of the Panasonic were on balance pretty good so I decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;m happy with it. I have to go over my face a few times but it gives a close comfortable shave. I use it wet, usually with King of Shaves shaving oil on my face. Used wet there is no skin irritation.  Although the shaver did not indicate a need for it, I used the Hydraclean system. It is a little noisy but appears to do a satisfactory job.    It&#x27;s possible over the long run it would pay for itself since razor blades are so expensive; but by the look and feel of it if you drop it on anything but a well padded surface it would be destroyed.</li>
            <li> I have used this razor now for three months. Hard to imagine being happier. I have owned about half a dozen electric razors over the past 25 years and this one is by far the best. It gives the closest shave I have ever had. Also gives the fastest shave; taking fewer passes over my beard than any other electric I ever had. The battery is good for well over a week. The handle is a pleasure to hold. Out of habit I still manually clean this razor every day, and so have only used the HydraClean system once. It seemed to work fine and was easy to use. I literally have no complaints about this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Norelco for as long as I can remember and was satisfied with it thinking that this was as good as it gets with an electric. It was never as good as a blade but I figured that was good enough for me. Well when my last Norelco died after only a year I decided to try another. I purchased an Braun series 400 from walmart and the thing was not right, so I took it back and got another one. When this one was the same as the first I started looking and found the Panosonic wet/dry. All of the reviews were very good so I decided to order one from Amazon. When it arrived I took it in a started to charge it, and one of the first things I noticed was that the cleaning solution was not combustible like the Braun and that made me feel a bit better. Another thing I liked is that the Panosonic charged quickly and I could leave plugged in unlike the Braun which should only be plugged in when charging.  Now it was time to test the Panosonic in the critical shave test. I am glad to report that it passed the test with flying colors. I was surprised to find how smooth a shave it gave. The first test was dry, and then the next cut I used it wet with shaving cream. Either way ya go, this Panosonic does exactly what it says it will do. I shave twice a day and it is great being able to use it in the shower.   I have been using it for about a month now and I like it as much as I did the first day I got it. It looks like shaving with a Norelco again is not in my future as it never cut as good as this Panosonic does either wet or dry.  The only negative is that when the self cleaning function is on it makes enough noise to keep me awake, but being the genius I am it only took me two times to just close the bathroom door so I could not hear it in the bathroom.  At a better price than the Braun and about the same as the Norelco the Panosonic gives a better shave hands down.  After ordering it a Amazon.com I was happy with how quickly it was shipped and at my front door.</li>
            <li> Well let me start by saying I have owned many electical shavers before that I thought were wonderful, but this one unlike the others, really is.    For years I have had issues with severe razor bumps. No matter what I have tried I just could not get them to go away, the in-grown hairs were horrible. I have tried salves, electric, manual, and just about everything else, this shaver however, has reduced the red marks and bumps on my neck almost completely.    When it comes to negative thoughts? I really can&#x27;t think of any at all.</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for a month and it has worked excellent. I really enjoy the fact you can dunk the head under a warm running faucet and clean it brilliantly.  I use the cleaning bath once a week.  It use to take me 4-5 minutes to shave now it takes just under 2 minutes.  Whole kit cost just $100. I have been a life long electric shaver user like my father and grandfather and can say this is the best one I have owned.  I previously owned two Bruans and a remmington before that.  My last shaver was a Bruan 7600 series I purchase 5 or 6 years ago from Amazon for $45.  It worked, so I thought, quite well until a year ago when I noticed the rechargable battery was not holding as long a charge. What convinced me to take the plunge and buy a new one was the fact that my travel remmington battery powered razor worked better than my Bruan.  So after carefully skimming through the write ups, I picked this model. Foils are also cheaper than Braun.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> I debated a long time on whether to buy an electric shaver again after many years of being a blade boy!  I got tired of not getting even one decent shave from G......e blades; I used to get maybe up to 10 decent shaves from a blade, but now the blade quality is so bad, to me, that even the first blade shave is uncomfortable; nicks, scrapes, etc..  So...I bought this Panasonic ES8109S and after using it a few times to perfect my technique and learning what the shaver can do and how it does it, all I can say is I&#x27;m VERY satisfied with it.  I use a shave gel and it helps keep my face smooth and soothed after I shave.  It&#x27;s great this shaver can be used in the bath/shower or with water at the sink!  The cleaner/dryer/charger it comes with I&#x27;m very happy with too, it does a good job and I don&#x27;t find it loud, as one reviewer mentioned.  Reading the reviews it&#x27;s apparent most people swear by it and a few swear at it!  To each their own I guess!  Not all things work well for all people...(Personally, I recommend it!)</li>
            <li> Great shaver, cuts close and easy to keep clean even without the hydraclean system.  I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with the Panasonic ES8109S Wet/Dry Shaver.  It provides a very close shave either wet or dry.  I shave my head so the shaver has been challenged.  I can say that it shaves my head much better than I expected.  It is truly as close as a razor.  It is easy to clean and recharges quickly.  I get about 6 head/face shaves with each charge.  The pop up trimmer makes this razor a complete grooming tool.  The HydraClean system is great for cleaning the unit when I am in a hurry and don&#x27;t want to take the time to clean it by hand.  The versatility of the charger/cleaner is a plus.  This is a great product and I highly recommend it.  Especially to the men that also shave their heads.</li>
            <li> Item is completely as described. It works well in water and cleans easily. I havent set up and used the cleaning/charging stand. I have simply kept the shaver plugged into the wall. It is the best electric razor I have owned but I havent yet tried the Braun unit to compare. I have gotten chafed by having to run the shaver over stubbly areas too  many times; But at the price this unit is more than satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this shaver.  The cleaning is an added bonus.  Previously had a Panasonic and decided to give this a shot versus the Braun.  Glad I did.</li>
            <li> So I was a skeptic about the high-end shavers.  But a friend compelled me try it by arguing that the self cleaning feature made for a better and more consistent shave.  He was right!  I&#x27;ve tried other brands (typically more bulking than the Panasonic), but the size, feel and cut of this shaver is surprisingly awesome.  Really well designed and consistent.  Worth every penny.  Get one and see for yourself.</li>
            <li> From experience with other electric shavers, this one blows away the competition.Listed below are the advantages&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- Overall the contour shape of the shaver fits in the contour of your hand.This gives an excellent grip. Bonus feature, the unit is very very light.&lt;br /&gt;2-The flexibility to use dry/wet is a plus. Unlike Braun, this shaver gives the flexibility to shave in the shower, with a gel or dry shave whereby giving the end user total flexibility and convenience. However when using a gel, it shaves super close, and can rub on the skin, which can lead to skin burns. Dry/wet is good enough.&lt;br /&gt;3- The nono technology are phenomenal. I feel its better than shaving with a Mach3 . The skin feels soft after a shave. However, one has to run the shaver over the neck more than once to reach the contour areas. It gets them. Braun didn&#x27;t even come close, no matter how many passes you made.&lt;br /&gt;4- The indicator shows a tap sign when the trimmer needs to be cleaned. Just run it under the tap and whola in 20 secs, the shaver is clean.&lt;br /&gt;5- One negative feature is the inability to shave when the unit is being charged. I guess this is a safety feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall...A++ for closeness of shave, as good as a blade.&lt;br /&gt;Practical , flexible, looks nice and blows away the competition. Now tell me how many shavers can you buy that does all this for under $100 (2007 Dec price on Amazon)</li>
            <li> I have been a Braun customer for YEARS.....it came time to replace the foil on my razor and I was never completely satisfied with the shave I received from my Braun, instead of spending money on my old razor I decided to buy a new one.  I researched new razors and saw a lot of favorable comments connected to the Panasonic Vortex, so I decided to try it.    I bought this razor and have been COMPLETELY satisfied with it.  I only wish I would have changed from Braun to Panasonic years ago.  This is the first wet/dry electric razor I have owned and I must say that the closeness of the shave with shaving cream is incredible.  I will absolutely buy another Panasonic when time necessitates it.</li>
            <li> I switched to an electric because of the amount of irritation I get from a straight razor. I have used this razor for about a month now and it is nothing short of awesome! I hardly get any irritation from using this thing. I am totally pleased with my purchase. Good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a few days, but it&#x27;s easily the best shave from an electric that I&#x27;ve ever had. Hard to beat now that it&#x27;s $99. Goodbye Braun Activator...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic shavers for 10 years.  I use them in the shower every morning and find I get a closer shave than with any other shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried every major brand of electric shaver.  As long as you use soap (nearly any soap will do) you will get an incredibly close shave that lasts all day.  It even beats the 5-blade razors.  The only complaint I have is that the batteries will only last about a year and then the shaver goes dead.  There is no way to replace the batteries so you just have to throw the shaver away and get a new one. The longest I ever had a Panassonic shaver last was 18 months, but most of them died within 12 months.  I replaced the blades and shaving head once after a year thinking I could keep using the shaver for another year, but it died.  So I suggest that you don&#x27;t replace the blades, just replace the whole shaver.  Despite this shortcoming I keep buying a new one each year because the shave is so great.  Oh, in case you think I wasn&#x27;t charging the shaver correctly I was.  I did the original charge for the recommended time and usually charged it once a week thereafter.  I&#x27;ve had friends use the Panasonic shavers with the same results...close shaves but they go dead in a year.</li>
            <li> My sister and I carefully researched Wet/Dry Shavers in a quest to find one that our dad would like. He&#x27;s had several different types of electric and rechargeable razors over the years and his chief complaint is that after a week or two, they no longer provide him with a close shave. So, we read good reviews about the Panasonic shaver and decided to purchase one as a Father&#x27;s Day gift for him. Turns out he loves the shaver! He said it is giving him the best shaves he&#x27;s had in years! And now he&#x27;s actually had it for over a month and still loves it! So, I would highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> I have been on and off electric shavers over the years (almost exclusively Norelco).  For about the last 5 years, I&#x27;ve been shaving with the Gillette Fusion razor (or variants thereof).  While happy, I was tired of spending 20 bucks on a pack of blades.  I wanted a wet/dry electric shaver and was looking at the Braun and Panasonic.  I just couldn&#x27;t see spending the $200 plus for the Braun so, after reading several reviews here, decided on the Panasonic.  I have NOT been disappointed!!  I&#x27;m sure the Braun is a fine razor but all I can say about the Panasonic is...WOW!  It shaves every bit as close as a blade...maybe even more so...and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I don&#x27;t ever remember my Norelco razors giving me this close of a shave.  As for the cleaner, I read a review on here that said it was difficult to use...HUH?  It is VERY easy.  Just fill the container with water and shove a detergent cartridge in.  DONE!  The ONLY downside I can think of is the razor doesn&#x27;t seem to hold a charge for very long, so don&#x27;t travel any more than a couple of days without the charge cord (the same cord that powers the cleaning/recharging base will also charge the razor itself...so you don&#x27;t need to travel with the somewhat bulky base if you don&#x27;t want to).  Hope this review helps...I know you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I traded from a dry shave Braun electric rechargeable unit to this.  My Braun died due to age and use.  In regards to shave closeness, I think my old Braun has a slight edge.  The ergonomics of this shaver is very well designed and better than my Braun.  The hydraclean system, self cleaning, is a nicety but is not a critical need in my opinion and is probably why it is priced the way it is.  Number of shaves between recharge is about average but my old Braun out performs the Panasonic in this arena as well.  If you are a simple guy looking for a decent shaver at a good price, you can find just as good or better at a lower price.  I classify this product as one that the wife would probably buy as a gift for your father-in-law....beats getting another neck tie I suppose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Remington for the last 6 years and finally upgraded to this at the recommendation of family who also have it.  It takes a little longer for me to shave now (5 minutes instead of 3), but it&#x27;s a lot closer than before, and the cleaning kit keeps it fresh and sharp.  Also, it&#x27;s a lot quieter than I expected, a plus!  I don&#x27;t like that the cleaning kit requires refills every 6 months, but that&#x27;s the nature of the beast.</li>
            <li> This was my first shaver, I got it after extensive research on which shavers to get.    The first time I tried it, It took me a while to get use too and took me about an hour to shave my beard off. My hair was long so it wasn&#x27;t to bad and I never had to re-rinse or clean off the hairs like i did with a traditional wet shaver.     Keeping it short is a different story when it come to speed. its pretty quick once the hair is short. The next was a bit difficult cause it is hard to get the exact direction my hair is going.     As for irritation, i did not get to much of that other then it pulling my hair once or twice while it was long.    Also don&#x27;t force it on your face to get a closer shave unless you want a burn mark on your neck (learned that the hard way lol.)    If you keep going over the same spot gently (not baby gently but you know, normally.) you should be able to get a really close shave.    At times i find my self really impressed on how close of a shave I get from this bad boy. but they are off days where I guess i don&#x27;t put in the effort for a close shave and i keep a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow after shaving. I am unsure why i get different results even now but I think that is more my fault then the item cause I have gotten some pretty damn close shaves with this thing.    after a few tests using this razor dry I decided to grow out my bread and try it wet. Granted i did not have a mirror in the shower but it did not work as well as i hoped it too. It did shave my bread off after a while but it took a lot longer then i expected. I concluded that it is better as a dry shaver.     The cleaning system works great though, although its a bit noisy but hey at least i can make it do that while i go to work, so I don&#x27;t have to listen to it :)    This is my first electric shaver so I cannot comment about how loud it is or how big it is, although it was bigger then i originally.  thought.    I got this product in June, and I am really happy with the purchase and I believe itis well worth it.    4/5 stars.</li>
            <li> i use it on my legs and i have to say it&#x27;s pretty good. the charge lasts for two legs, but mine are short with course hair :^) if you have amazon women legs and your hair is course you may have to charge it once more(takes about a ten to fifteen minutes to recharge). i am very happy with the purchase- it really gives you a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> This shaver has been giving me the closest shaves I have ever gotten with an electric.  Amazing.  Now I need to test it with lather in the shower to see what it can really do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been skeptical about electric shavers due to the fact that all of the ones I&#x27;ve had in the past were unreliable and didn&#x27;t give a close shave. More often than not the others that I&#x27;ve tried in the past would leave me with ingrown hairs and razor bumps. They seemed to struggle with my coarse beard, and would get dull after just a few uses. Not this one!   This new Panasonic Vortex is a totally different story. It is hands down the best shaver that I&#x27;ve ever owned. It is incredibly fast and provides the closest shave that I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric shaver. And, I don&#x27;t get the ingrown hairs and irritation that others have given me in the past. This is one close shaving machine and very fast. The charge life is amazing as well. After shaving my face and head, it still had 80% charge remaining. Its speed makes it noticeably faster because one or two passes and you have a razor blade close shave without pulling and tugging on your beard. I have a very coarse beard and it doesn&#x27;t seem to bog down this shaver at all. It just buzzes right on through effortlessly.   As I mentioned, I use it on my scalp too. It is awesome in that aspect too as it gives an incredibly close shave with no irritation. The wet dry option makes it even better, and I seem to get a closer (straight razor close) shave using it in the shower with a shaving gel. I&#x27;ve been use Nivea Active3 shampoo body wash and shave gel all in one with it with no issues whatsoever.   For the price, this is well worth it to have such a reliable, fast, and powerful shaver. I love mine, I think you will too.</li>
            <li> I have shaved with a regular razor and a rotary razor and this is by far the most comfortable and least irritating shaving device I have used.  I shave after I shower and with shaving cream and its a close comfortable shave every time.  This razor is very ergonomic and comfortable in hand.  Super fast recharge and very efficient cleaning cycle.  I have only had it for a week so I cant say anything about its longevity but so far so good!!  Worth the buy, excellent price for this shaver!</li>
            <li> Best electirc razor I have ever owned.  Great batterly life with  smooth, close shaves without irritation.  Easy to maintain and clean.  Outstanding product.</li>
            <li> Works great best electric razor I have ever had.  Cuts through a couple days growth with no problem.</li>
            <li> I got this after using couple of trimmers.I really like this, it gives a clean perfect shave than traditional razors. Its clean and the additional cartages not so expensive too.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8109S is an excellent wet/dry razor.  For the most comfortable shave, shave in the shower using a shaving gel with glycerine such as gillette Fusion or Noxema Comfort Gel.</li>
            <li> I had an electric shaver a long time ago.  The razor&#x27;s got dull so I stopped using it and started shaving   the old fashioned way -- in the shower while my face was nice and wet (believe me you get a good shave that way).    I tried this Panasonic at my cousin&#x27;s house one morning and had to have one.  I don&#x27;t think it shaves as close   as a regular razor, but it shaves pretty damn close -- if you&#x27;re in a hurry, you can take the thing with you and shave in the  car.      Over all, I like it.  WHAT&#x27;S ALSO GREAT IS YOU CAN SHAVE IN THE SHOWER WITH IT!!</li>
            <li> I used to wet shave for years but got tired of paying for blades. This Panasonic shaver is great, used wet or dry, and the battery lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> I am a long time blade user that finally made the change to electric. I take blood thinners and got tired of running to the emergency room every time I nicked myself  :) . This shaver is fantastic! So far I have only used it dry with some pre-shave lotion and it gave me as close a shave as a blade, but without the trauma. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My husband recently needed to take the prescription cumadin, a blood thinner, and was advised to purchase an exectric shaver.  I logged onto Amazon and reviewed many different electric shavers, concidering many brands and price ranges.   The customer comments that were submitted for this product were very positive and were in fact better that the comments for some of the higher priced selections.   I ordered the shaver and received it very quickly.  My husband is absolutely satisfied with the shavers ability to hold a long charge, its self cleaning performance, as well as the results of using it, as he obtains a very attractive clean shave.   I would reccomend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using razor after razor. Once I got this, I was glad to get rid of them. This product is so easy and clean to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for over a month now and it is by far the best shaver I have ever used.  I have sensitive skin and this shaver has been truly amazing since the get-go.  For years I&#x27;ve used very expensive Norelco&#x27;s and they don&#x27;t even compare...the Panasonic is a great investment.  The closeness of the shaver is far better than I anticipated, Sharper Image was right giving this thing an award.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver because you can use it both wet or dry and shaves extremely close</li>
            <li> The reason I purchased this shaver was to find a solution to the acne or bumps that I have around my mouth. I previously owned a Norelco with the 3 rotating heads. I read that the lift and cut feature of the Norelco contributed to bumps since the hair is now below skin level and would curl and grow under the skin. I tried manual razors which took too much \\&quot;prep work\\&quot; and had that rough feeling afterwards. I tried this linear shaver and it still cuts surprisingly close. The acne continued so I had to experiment and switched to a different moisturizer which helped to improve my skin a lot. I believe it was a combination of shaver, cutting technique, post shave product and moisturizer that was necessary to solve my problem.     1. Use shaving gel (not only does it give help the razor glide more easily, it lubricates the blades so that they won&#x27;t get damaged)    2. Do not stretch the skin. This may contribute to ingrown hairs.    3. Shave against the grain, then with the grain. (this ensures the hair will grow the same way and helps to prevent ingrown hairs)    4. After washing up use after shave even though this is an electric razor.    5. Make sure moisturizer is non-comedogenic.    I rated this -1 star since this shaver did manage to cut a white-head due to the middle blade.</li>
            <li> I love this product and would recommend it to a friend. Shaves as close as a blade and much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I was given this shaver as a Christmas gift, and I generally like it.  It provides me with a much closer shave than I get with my Braun Synchro electric razor.  However, if I let my beard grow out too much (more than 4 or 5 days for me), this shaver will painfully tear out my long facial hair.  In fact, it is so unpleasant to use either the shaver or the beard trimmer function of this razor to shave long facial hair that I need to use my Braun Synchro.  Despite this flaw, I&#x27;m giving the razor 4 stars to reflect its superior performance with short facial hair.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews before purchasing this shaver.  The rave reviews were true and the use of this shaver is great.  It took me a couple or three weeks to learn my whisker growth pattern. Once I knew what direction to shave on the different parts of my face, I went from a five to six minute shave to a 2.5 to 3 minute shave that is closer and more comfortable  than any blade I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a braun self cleaning razor for years and found that after a while it ripped the hair out of my face! (Ouch!)  To be honest it was good for the first 3 months and after that....eh.    The Panasonic ES8109S Vortex rocks!  Smaller, easier to handle, wet &amp; dry shave, closer shave.  I can honestly say...I have switched my brand loyalty.</li>
            <li> This is my second panasonic vortex and the smooth shave I receive is great. I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES8109S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Nanotech Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Vortex Cleaning System, Silver&lt;br /&gt;Started using 03-27-11.  Broke 12-01-11 (red warning lights), sent to San Francisco, back on 01-10-12.  Kept shaver and cord so I could shave because they show you how to use liquid hand soap to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Broke again 08-07-12 (water remained in cleaning basin and wouldn&#x27;t dry or recharge); sent this time to McAllen Texas for repair or replacement or whatever they do in Texas.  This time they wanted everything sent to Texas so I&#x27;m not going to shave until I get the shaver back.&lt;br /&gt;So long as the shaver shaves I really like it.  It is unfortunate it is prone to poop out but of course \\&quot;made in China\\&quot; helps to explain the problems.&lt;br /&gt;With a 2-year warranty, March 2013 isn&#x27;t too far off.</li>
            <li> I had been leery of buying an electric razor for several years, after using Brauns for many years, then switching back to a blade because no electric razor shaves as close as a blade...    Like most guys, I don&#x27;t like shaving, but I like a clean-shaven face. So I started shopping electrics again. I was close to buying a Braun Series 7, when I happened on a review of the Pany ES8109S.    After a lot of research, I threw down on this razor based on several reviews and Panasonic&#x27;s description (13,000 rpm wet/dry razor?!?). I received the razor after just three days, using the free Super Saver shipping and used it the following day.    Usually it takes your face several shaves to get used to a new razor and so, takes a little extra time to get close; after only a few minutes of shaving, my face was smooth (almost as close as a blade). I waited several days to shave again, so when I did, I had a lot of long stubble. I decided to try using Edge shave gel with my new razor. It&#x27;s a bit messy, but well worth it. My face felt super smooth and soft afterward!    This razor is AWESOME (as far as electric razors go) and I highly recommend it. Never been more satisfied with any purchase I have ever made (and am very glad I didn&#x27;t spend $200 plus on a Braun)</li>
            <li> I picked this razor out for my husband. He said this is the best shave he as ever gotten. No nicks, no pulls, just a great smooth shave. Would recommend this to anyone and the price is great as well.</li>
            <li> My facial hair is so thick that I always have a hard time finding a razor that lasts, but I&#x27;ve been using this for 7 months now and haven&#x27;t had any problems.  It has a very delicate feel on the face, but don&#x27;t be fooled.  It&#x27;s a trimmin, choppin&#x27; machine that does provide a great close shave.  With some of the other electric razors I&#x27;ve used, I always had to go over my face with a regular blade but this guy almost always gets everything - and if it doesn&#x27;t, the handy trimmer can usually get the tricky spots.  It even works pretty good on the neck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger looks ridiculously big, but it also comes with a more travel friendly charger.  I haven&#x27;t really used the cleaning system, so if that&#x27;s the selling point for you then you might actually think if you&#x27;ll use it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a little pricey, but you get what you pay for.. and it&#x27;s  still cheaper than a couple months worth of blades.</li>
            <li> I have never had much luck in the past with electric razors and I mean distant past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a weird beard in that the hairs are on the wire y side but not dense and they grow in all different directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate shaving to begin with - so when I saw the ads for these shavers &amp; started reading the reviews, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very first shave was done completely dry and did better than I expected. My neck and face were mildly irritated but nothing bad. I did not apply any soothing after shave balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day with minimal growth I shaved again, but this time I washed my face with liquid soap and reapplied a little soap and shaved with it. This went much more smoothly - so things are looking up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave I will use Dermologica Professional Shave, This stuff is a super slick clear lube that you apply just a drop or 2 to your wet face and it makes your skin slick as ice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking that Panasonic may have answered the shaving conundrum - will keep you posted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;January 1, 2012 - I was wrong at least as it relates to my beard &amp; face shaving with the Panasonic. After nine months and a set of fresh  blades I sold the shaver and switched to the new Gillette 5 blade power system &amp; their pro glide shave gel. I get an incredibly smoother shave and do it in half the time. I gave the Panasonic a fair chance but over all my face felt irritated and I could not get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> I love Panasonic shavers, this one is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros -&lt;br /&gt;1. Close shave.&lt;br /&gt;2. The HydraClean system works really well.&lt;br /&gt;3. There are two ways to charge the shaver, one is the HydraClean device and the other is a standard AC recharger.&lt;br /&gt;4. Sleek look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons -&lt;br /&gt;1. The HydraClean device takes up space.&lt;br /&gt;2. You&#x27;ll have to buy replacement \\&quot;Panasonic HydraClean Shaving System Solution Cartridges\\&quot; every few months (assuming you clean your shaver using the HydraClean system)...lame.  The cartridges have some type of cleaning agent within them.  They work with the HydraClean system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MFDA Rating - That close shave is hard to pass up...this shaver is a clear \\&quot;Buy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> My husband has been very happy with this shaver. It has lasted him about 3 years now. Battery is still going strong.</li>
            <li> Shaving - I have had this product for 3-4 months now. I have only been using it as a wet shaver in my bathroom wash basin and I am very satisfied with the results. I have to make a few extra passes at the neck area - but other than that - excellent performance on rest of face. i have been using shaving foam and it helps reduce skin irritation considerably after shaves.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and it has no problems with longer stubble - like a 3-4 day growth (2 mm to 3 mm long). would possibly need to make a few extra passes to catch a few sneaky last ones here and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning - i dont always use the cleaning station. Most times i just rinse the blades under the tap and leave the head open to dry. the cleaning base also has its own \\&quot;drying\\&quot; option. I use that a lot too. I have run the full clean+dry+charge cycle only 3-4 times (once a month) since i got the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - Good product - value for money. well built and good quality. bottomline - good shaving results. I must qualify that statement, though: I have not tried any other shavers by panasonic or competing brands - so I can not say it is the \\&quot;best\\&quot; shaver out there - but i&#x27;m quite impressed with it for a first shaver - it beats using 3/4/5 blade razors that cost $12-$15 for a 5-pck cartridge - Infact i am convinced that it delivers a much closer shave while being more comfortable and economical - so its a win / win / win every which way. happy shopping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - - - - - -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writing back after over a year of using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Still holding up pretty well. have&#x27;nt had any problems with it - holds charge for a long time still. Have not needed to change blades or anything. still get an amazingly close shave and covers the more tricky areas (neck / chin) just fine. Highly recommend. Never been satisfied with an electric shaver this much before. Changed my opinion about el. shavers for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Panasonic!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my son who prefers electric shavers. He reports that he is very satifisfied (he is not shy about speaking his mind if he is not). He likes the cleaning feature and the trimmer and gets a good close shave. I read that this razor can be noisy but I have not heard that complaint nor have I heard the razor making noise from his bathroom.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how picky people can be for this item as I am 100% satisfied.  I want to add that I have very coarse hair and my beard gros back within a day (I am from the Indian subcontinent).  I hated shaving because of the constant mess of using creams, blades, and cuts.  I remember trying an electric shaver 10 years ago and not being very impressed.  You have to give your skin at least 2-3 weeks for it to adjust to the shaver so don&#x27;t be disappointed if you first shave doesn&#x27;t get close.</li>
            <li> Having used a braun electric razor for the past 6 years, I was hesitant to try something different. I read many reviews about the Panasonic ES8109S Vortex Wet/Dry Shaver with Nano Technology and HydraClean System and decided to give it a try. I must admit, partially because of the price and I wanted to try an occasional shave in the shower. So far, I have been pleasantly surprized by the Panasonic. No more ingrown hairs and it&#x27;s the closest shave I have had in years. I read some comments about the noise of the shaver and cleaner. I have found both to be much quieter than my old braun. I think this shaver is very much worth the price I paid on Amazon.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000VKZMHK Panasonic ES8109S Vortex Wet/Dry Shaver with Nano Technology and HydraClean System]]This is by far the best shaver that I have ever used. I use it mainly with shaving cream although I have used it dry. It shaves very close with little or no irritation. While expensive, it&#x27;s well worth the price. I have charged the shaver only once in two months. I use it almost every day.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver with the intention of getting the most comfortable shaver around. and yes, it is extremely comfortable. However, it is only comfortable because it doesn&#x27;t actually shave. You won&#x27;t feel much of a burn because it isn&#x27;t shaving. I was very upset to finally use it and to realize that it isn&#x27;t doing anything. Still, I used it for a few weeks, because sometimes your skin just has to get used to it before it works properly. Now... it still doesn&#x27;t shave and barely cuts hair when i shave against the flow of the hair. Overall, don&#x27;t fall for it for its comfort, because I would rather deal with a horrible burn than something that does not shave at all.</li>
            <li> The instruction pamphlet (the English version at least) was apparently written by a people who were intent on documenting everything they knew about the product, but had no sense of the probable buyer&#x27;s need to understand how to use the product.  I have studied and restudied and restudied the instructions, but still don&#x27;t know how much fluid to put into the reservoir tank initially and how to know when it needs a refill; there is no apparent line on the device marking the limit beyond which the instructions say one must not fill, on penalty of ruining the whole device.    I still (after two months of shaving with the razor) have no idea of when to do what with the control buttons on the base.</li>
            <li> taking a little getting used to. I shaved with a razor all my life so this is a little different. It is comfortable and I like being able to shave in the shower. I haven&#x27;t realized the closeness of shave I got with the traditional razor. But I&#x27;m happy and still trying.</li>
            <li> I went from a standard razor to electric. So far this has worked pretty well but not as well as a razor.  I often notice that it misses some hairs (ones that are not sticking straight up in the air) no matter how often I go over that area. I&#x27;ve started using Lectric shave. It helps a lot by helping the hairs stand up. I think this razor is as good as any electric razor. It just isn&#x27;t as consistent as a blade. Despite this I&#x27;m stilling using the electric razor.  I guess that says something. It is nice not to have to use shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Never thought I would be so excited over a shaver, but I am indead with this one. Provides a great shave even after the first few times. Most of them I have to get used to. The auto cleaner works wonders and although sometimes leaves a couple pieces of hair behind, it is simply amazing how good of a job it does. Very happy with this shaver and got it at a great deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many electric shavers during my 64 years and until now they all left a lot to be desired. I&#x27;ve never used a Braun so I can&#x27;t make a comparison but this Panasonic beats any Norelco or Remington I have used and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few of them, while no electric will shave as close as a blade this one is as close as you can possibly get. I was amazed at how smooth my skin was after shaving with this model, dry or wet the quality of the shave was the same. The shaver charges quickly, is comfortable to hold, glides easily over your skin and cleaning it is a snap. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this shaver and highly recommend it to anyone shopping for a quality electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I have tried multiple electric razors from norelco and Braun but I always found myself going back to my gillette razors.....until now.  I&#x27;ve had the razor for a couple weeks and been very happy with the performance of this razor ... Especially when using it in the shower.  While the performance falls off a little when dry shaving... It&#x27;s still a good shave.  Most tellingly, i have not used my fusion razor in two weeks....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike some of the reviews, i don&#x27;t find the razor too noisy at all.  Also the charging and cleaning base is simple to use and works very well.  I highly recommend this razor</li>
            <li> Simple and to the point, I used a Braun Activator for years. It performed well, but the replacement blades started to go down in quality significantly. I would put in a replacement and within a month it would be stuck on my beard. The motor seemed to be performing fine though so I could only chalk it up to the blades.&lt;br /&gt;I got this Panasonic as a present and it has been great. A very close shave and it never gets \\&quot;bogged\\&quot; down by a heavy beard. The wet dry feature is fantastic as well. The cleaner cratridges are much better thought out as well, you supply the water and it supplies the cleaner. The Braun ones have it it all in one which causes larger packaging and higher cost in the end. I highly recommend this Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this after having nothing but problems with a Braun.  I went through 2 cleaning bases (and had to pay for the replacement even though it was supposed to still be covered under warranty).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic is a joy to use - wet or dry it gives an excellent shave.  With the Braun, I had to keep a razor in the shower to touch up my neck and jawline.  The Panasonic gets everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint?  I wish the cleaning solution smelled like citrus but I&#x27;m willing to give that up for a razor and cleaner that actually works.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good electric shaver for a few years now. This does the job. Great product.</li>
            <li> Very gentle and quiet.  Easy to handle.  It does require more passes to remove the hair, but well worth it for the comfort.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a electric razor for years due to the ridiculous cost of replacement blades. I have tried many electric shavers, but I thought I would try 1 more. Although this one did better than any of the others I have had, it still doesn&#x27;t do the neck area well. I knew it could never get near the closeness of a blade, but I had hopes it would get the job done. If you like electric razors you will love this one, but I guess I need to buy a straight razor or something.</li>
            <li> I have owned the ES8109s for almost 2 years and I am shocked at how good it has been. In this day and age when most products are mediocre performers, and  only last for a year at most this Panasonic has performed outstandingly since I have owned it. I use it almost daily and yet there is still no need to change the blades, and I have only used one cleaning cartridge so far. However, today I am ordering a 3-pack. My invested time in researching a quality shaver has paid off ten fold. I will have to start considering other Panasonic products in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an older gentleman with a grey semi-heavy beard who has to shave everyday. I prefer a clean shaved face over any type beard, even a two day weekend stub. I&#x27;m on blood thinners so for years I had to give up shaving with a blade and use an electric razor for obvious reasons.     My last shaver was the Braun 360, pretty much happy with it and I was going to purchase another one until I read the reviews on the Panasonic ES81095. Boy am I glad that I purchased the Panasonic over the Braun, there is no comparison to the shave quality not to mention the noise level being reduce and the overall cost.     I like how the shaver fits your hand, your face contours and overall closness of shaving. In fact I look forward to using my new Panasonic every morning.</li>
            <li> I like this shaver works good.  I use it on my face and use it for my head.  It does a good job.  Not as good as a razor but nothing beats razor IMO.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband 2 years ago. Amazon was having a special deal, so the product with the charger/cleaning system was only around $80. I don&#x27;t think I would pay $180 for it, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth at least $120.     He uses it dry, but has also used it wet on occasion and it works equally well. Very nice, close shave, and still using the original blades. Doesn&#x27;t change the cleaning cartridge until the light goes on--in contrast to the recommended changing which is much more frequent--and this seems to be working quite well. No noticeable reduction in performance or ability to hold charge and it has been used nearly every day for 2 years.     At first I thought the cleaning system was a little over the top, as rinsing and tapping usually work just as well to clean out a razor, but I have to admit that the HydraClean system is really cool and seems to improve the blade life! It certainly has all the bells and whistles and makes for an excellent gift--I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> My husband bleeds easily.  After I spent 2 hours stopping the bleeding a couple of times I asked his doctor to ease up on the blood thinners.  He told us to \\&quot;get a better razer\\&quot;.  We did.  This is it and we cannot sing its praises highly enough.</li>
            <li> Gives a great close shave. I use it to shave my head. Fast and easy. Works great! Liked it so much, I bought my brother one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a  Gillette razor user, but picked up this electric razor on an Amazon special just to give it a shot.    Electric razors have come a long ways, last time I tried an electric Norelco and it wasn&#x27;t anything to write about, it left my skin irritated and didn&#x27;t come anywhere close to the shave this Panasonic gives.     I&#x27;ve been using this razor every day for the past month, and it works great.  It&#x27;s nice that it can be used wet or dry, I typically use it in the shower and it does a pretty close shave not quite as good as the razor but you never nick yourself and your not having to change blades every couple weeks.      The self-clean feature is also nice when I&#x27;m done with it I just drop it in it&#x27;s base, and it&#x27;s ready to go the next day.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000VKZMHK Panasonic ES8109S Vortex Wet/Dry Shaver with Nano Technology and HydraClean System]] I suffer from Neuropathy and I could no longer use a regular safety razor without cutting myself. The Panisonic Vortex was perfect for me it gives a nice close shave wet or dry and the self-cleaning system works with little effort on my part. The price was right and I really feel I got good value for the money spent.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor to replace an existing electric razor.  I am very pleased with it.  It does a better job and I find myself not having to go over the same spot several times as I was doing with my old razor.  It also indicates the battery charge so I know when to recharge.  It may not be the best razor on the market but for the money it&#x27;s hard to beat.</li>
            <li> I used to hate shaving! I used to use a razor and shaving gel, and used to get cuts and nicks all the time. I even developed dermatitis from time to time! This Panasonic shaver shaves very close to the skin, but it does not damage the skin. Also, the HydraClean System keeps the shaver very clean and hygienic. I have only used this product for a couple weeks, but I see visible difference in my skin condition.    I also enjoy using this electric shaver wet (i.e., with shaving gel). It&#x27;s very comfortable to shave with gel/cream. Not only do I get dermatitis anymore, I feel great after shaving. Another thing worth noting is its running cost. I used to pay about $5 per month for a pack of 4 razors. Now I only pay about $10 for 3 HydroClean cartridges, which last for over 3 months! You only need to replace the inner blades every two years (that&#x27;s what the manufacturer recommends). A replacement only costs about $15~20.</li>
            <li> So I am replacing an older model of the Panasonic Wet/Dry variety and I am again satisfied.  the battery inside wore out before the replacement blades did (I go through a normal razor in a week!) so this is definitely a solid 2-3 year purchase.    My only gripe is that the ac adapter now is noticeably cheaper and makes a buzzing sound.  I just space out my chargings cleanings a bit more.</li>
            <li> This razor cuts as good as any traditional razor. I was used to the rotary blade razors, but this Panasonic foil shaver surpassed any electric razor that I&#x27;ve ever used. I love the pivoting head that adjusts easily to the countours of my face.</li>
            <li> I used to use a Philips rotary shaver - all I can say is that this unit shaves much closer. I have very sesitive skin and there is virtually no razor burn. I can actually shave dry with this razor which is something I could never do with the Philips rotary. The one drawback is the it doesn&#x27;t seem to do quite as good a job on my neck but still a much better job than the Philips (I guess you could say that for most razors). Make sure you buy an extra set of replacement blades. Overall a very good electric razor.</li>
            <li> Well this is my second Panasonic shaver. First one was a ES8066 and it lasted about 7 years or so. That was good enough for me. After all those years I needed a replacement and got ES8109S. I really like it. It is quiet, fast and gives you a close shave. The cleaning system&#x27;s base unit is a little bulky especially if your space is limited in your bathroom counter and takes some work to prepare with solutions and so on. So I don&#x27;t even use it. Also it seems that cleaning is not that much of a big deal if you&#x27;re not shaving at the same time while you&#x27;re taking a shower.  I use my shaver dry and it is perfectly clean. Once in a while open the head of the unit and blowing on razor pieces a little does the job. For detailed cleaning I use the office supply cleaner air can used on the computers and so. I spray two short burst of air and that&#x27;s good to go another month or two.  Charge level indicator doesn&#x27;t allow you to have a surprise power outage. Battery holds the charge long. Travel charger cord makes it possible to take it with you even for longer trips but generally one full charge is good at least 10 shaves.  So if you&#x27;re not climbing Everest for your next vacation and staying away from a power outlet more than 10 days this is a very good shaver.</li>
            <li> I used to use a rotary years ago, then switched back to the blade. Now I am happy after going back to electric. It took a while to get my routine down, but get a decent enough shave now. I kind of use a swirling motion, then horizontal strokes, followed by verticle movement. Different parts of my face obviously have different hairs requiring the varied directions. I shave dry while sitting in front of the tv or pc. I go by the sound of the head to judge how long or short the whiskers are. I try to dump out the thing, and only put it in the cleaner when the charge gets low for a tune up of the operation. I figured I had 30 days to try it and either keep it or send it back. It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> I have nothing but praise for the seller, but this razor is junk.  I was hoping for an alternative to my mach 3turbo blade razor.  I was sadly disappointed upon my first shave.  It missed spots, broke me out, and didn&#x27;t shave close.  I had an electric about 15 years ago and thought maybe the technology had changed given it has been 15 years.  This is a poor excuse for a razor I used it about three weeks before i went back to my mach 3.  The cleaning cycle took all night, but only wanted to offer the cleaning cycle after I had disconnected the power. I wanted to like this razor so badly because i had spent $100+ on it, but i couldnt take the splotchy rough shave.  I tried it wet, dry, gels, creams, in the shower, nothing worked to improve the shave.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different shavers, and this is the only one I can recommend. I have had to switch back to blades many times because other electric shavers couldn&#x27;t shave close enough. The high speed shaving is the difference. Would recommend this shaver to anyone who wants a close shave.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my dad and he has been very happy with it.  he says that it gives a close shave &amp; is easy to use.  he would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> My Panasonic ES8109S purchased about 1 month ago and used daily is performing satisfactorily. For the first 2 weeks it was shaving unbelievably smooth, but, the sharpness-smooth aspect has deminished somewhat noticeably.  Also the side-burn push acctuator is less than easy to put-in-play.</li>
            <li> This product worked great for me. Close shave with very few swipes to the same area. Has all the bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> I had bought in the past some other shavers but didn&#x27;t work out as it says, but this Panasonic ES8109S Vortex Wet/Dry did so far a great job, I have really hard facial hair and that&#x27;s why I was so skeptical when order a shaver, went through the reviews a few times before purchase this one, but believe me no regret so far.   Best shaver I ever had own, by the way this was the 5th shaver I own, so had some experience with other which at the end I still had to use blades to do the finish job, but not with this Panasonic.</li>
            <li> This shaver takes a few days for your face to adjust.  After that it is great.  Closer than a blade.  Great with lather in the shower.  Easy to clean and charge.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I saw some bad reviews but everywhere I looked I saw only good things about it. The shaver is cool and has all these gadgets but sucks. My 15$ Norelco puts this shaver in its pocket. Does not give a good shave at all. Yes battery life good. Very shiek and nice but sucks biggest waist of my money!</li>
            <li> Have used many different razors in the past. Have used Schick and then Norelco and for several years Braun.  Loved my first Braun but wasn&#x27;t as impressed with the second.  This razor is one of the best I&#x27;ve used. Very fast, gets neck hairs good and cuts close.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better razor.  Haven&#x27;t used it wet yet.  Great buy.  thanks Panasonic!!!</li>
            <li> Throughout my adult life I have alternated between electric and bladed razors. I love the speed and convenience of an electric razor, but love the closer shave of a bladed razor. It also seems that every electric razor I buy doesn&#x27;t shave well for more than about a year, despite upkeep and blade/foil replacements. I&#x27;ve had Braums, Remingtons, Norelcos, etc., and at the price you pay for them they should last well beyond one year. But this was such a good deal that I decided to risk it again. Well so far I have been very pleased. Upkeep is minimal and it keeps a charge forever. Of course I am only shaving around a beard, but still it does well. I pretty much keep it in the shower and shave without soap, recharging/cleaning about once a week. Ergonomics are excellent, but time will tell if this beats the rest.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used just about every shaver on the market.  Remington&#x27;s burn my face, Norelco&#x27;s don&#x27;t provide a close enough shave, and Braun&#x27;s don&#x27;t last and are too expensive.  This shaver provides a close shave that is oddly enough incredibly similar to a blade.  It&#x27;s fun to use and even on the neck doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation.  The only draw back is that the power cord is not spiral so it takes up a lot of space.</li>
            <li> Okay, so, let me preface this buy saying that my Dad has been a thick, coarse bearded dude his entire adult life. Shaves everyday and has always used a traditional razor. The closer the better for him! After a heart attack he was put on many blood thinners and it was suggested that he no longer use a razor as he would probably not clot in the event that he nicked himself. Well, this news came to him as a huge problem and disappointment. He insists on a super clean, super close shave. He has tried MANY electric shavers over his 71 years.....none has ever made the cut (pun intended), not even close, always were a waste of money......until now! This one is a keeper-and not just because he has no choice. He actually loves it. Now, this doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close as he can get with a traditional sharp razor but it truly does a fantastic job. He can use it wet or dry which was a great option before he left the hospital and in his first days home recovering. He could shave right from bed. Now that he is up and around again he uses it every morning and loves it. The dry shave option is nice later in the day as well if he has something to do in the evening (dinner out with Mom or something). He can touch up without the hassle of a wet face, razor, and shave cream....an option he did not have in the past. All in all it has worked out great! And we didn&#x27;t expect it would no matter how well it worked. He looks good, looks clean shaven, and we&#x27;ve heard no complaints. I did buy replacement heads and parts etc., so he should be set for a while. I have read some reviews that say the self cleaning mode is somewhat noisy but honestly can&#x27;t say that we have noticed that problem. Besides which you could just put it in cleaning mode on your way out if it seemed intrusive. We haven&#x27;t had that problem though. I would recommend this razor to others!</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor less than one year after buying a Norelco (as a replacement for a good Norelco that gave up the ghost after nearly 10 years).  The new Norelco had zero battery life and shaved poorly despite its cost of over $100.  It has been nearly 30 years since I shaved with a foil razor and the technology has improved greatly.  Panasonic razor works well; it cuts smoothly (closer than the Norelco) but it is particular about which way you draw the razor across your face.  With the Norelco it did not seem to matter because of the circular blade action; with the Panasonic it is important to draw the razor against the direction in which my beard grows.  This has taken a few times to \\&quot;re-learn\\&quot; how to shave but it is working well now.  According to the manual the battery cannot be overcharged -- something that was a problem from the outset with the Norelco.  I get about 8 shaves from a full charge right now -- I expect that to go up by a few over time as I get faster at shaving with this different type of razor.    It cuts close but I had not had any skin irritation.  Some areas take several passes -- not sure if that is me getting used to a new razor or a characteristic of the razor.  It is finicky about the sides of my neck under my jawbones -- must go the right way there but it clears the beard after a couple of passes.    The trimmer is not great -- if that is an important part for you, you might consider a separate appliance.  It works OK for me but I only use it to trim sideburns.    A caution:  this is a noisy razor.  Not objectionable to me but much louder than my Norelco.    Overall, I like the shape, the moving head, and the closeness of the shave.  It is comfortable in my hand and much like shaving with a big bladed conventional razor.    Have not tried shaving wet or the cleaning station -- I just pop the foil head off and blow and brush the hairs out.  I am very satisfied with the purchase and not sorry I switched.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is because I am not using it properly or what... But I do not always like the shave I get from this device. I never feel it&#x27;s close or even enough!  Again, it could be me not the device...?</li>
            <li> Shaver works super. In the shower or out, it&#x27;s fine. My first electric razor in 25 years for whatever that&#x27;s worth when checking this review. The base and cleaning system though, after about 7 months, was/is always leaving water on the counter, which smells. Not quitle like a cat got up there, but close. I&#x27;ve spent the last two months trying what I could, replenishing cartridges, using it daily, changing the water more often....... no success. I&#x27;m giving it 3 instead of 5 for just this reason. As the title says, the razor is fine, the cleaning system s**ks.</li>
            <li> This electric shaver is awesome.  It shaves good, battery life is great, and it does not irritate my face like some of the other ones.  I would reccomend this to anyone, great product.</li>
            <li> All is good except the noise of the cleaning and drying.  These items are best not completed while sleeping in the room next to the recharging/cleaning base.</li>
            <li> I got the shaver a few days ago and had my forst shave today. it was closest I have ever got from electric shaver (I used 2 panasonics and a norelco before). I used a panasonic 7008 for last 9 yrs and always had to finish shave with a razor. but with this one, didn&#x27;t need a razor  the cleaning was easy. Just the feel of the shaver was fantastic. Good product design.</li>
            <li> I switched to this shaver after using a cheap $35 shaver for a while (and a manual one before that).    The manual blade worked best (as almost anyone would attest), and the two automatic shavers seem to provide the same closeness/comfort.    Except for the automatic cleaning/charging station, I&#x27;m not sure that this shaver was worth the high price.</li>
            <li> Best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had. It&#x27;s quick and makes a clean cut every time. Not to mention it was at a reasonable price. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this item, after a lot of research, and got the best price and information about the brand, in Amazon&#x27;s website.  This model, and the recognition received by 2 of the best consumers auditors of products, caught my attention and I decided to buy it.  And the best thing also is that it clean&#x27;s itself and does not take a lot of bathroom counter space which is important in small bathrooms.  It is also ergonomic and beautiful.  My son, Jose, who is a Personal Trainer and has to look his best always, is absolutely in love with his new shaver and told me it was the BEST of all his shaves!!; even from his previous old model that was a Panasonic model also.  I was delighted to hear this as I put a lot of effort in getting him the right product.  Thanks to Panasonic and Amazon.  I will highly recommend the clients to get this model.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for over a month now and am very happy with it.  It shaves closer than my previous two Norelco (lift &amp; cut) razors ever did.  I use it every morning and only clean &amp; charge it when the battery gets low.  I just blow it out or rinse it out between cleaning/chargings.  I was concerned about cleaning frequency but the once every few weeks when the battery gets run down seems to work just great for me.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic razor.  My husband uses it in the shower.  It shaves so close with never a nick!  EXCELLENT RAZOR.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I have used Panasonic electric razors in past, like 10+ years ago.  I went to the Mach3 razor because the electric stared to iritate my skin but I got sick of the shave bugging my skin after about 8-10 shaves you need to replace the blade and those replacement blades ain&#x27;t cheap for the Mach razors.  So I looked at electric again figuring the technology had advanced and I&#x27;m glad I did.  I like this unit alot.  First there is no skin adjustment period as with old electric razors.  You can use dry or in the shower.  I prefer the shower with shave gel, I have tried different combos but this is my favorite.  I like the charging/cleaning stand too.  You can save by not buying this but its a nice feature and Panasonic does not use an alcohol based cleaner so it lasts longer.  Over all, I&#x27;m very happy with the performance of this razor.  It holds a charge very well.  I can get between 7 and 9 days per charge then place in in cradle and it cleans, dries and charges for me. I like the foil razors over the rotary blade shavers and this is a good buy for the $$.  If you get 3yrs out of it its worth it in the long run plus it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin at all.  Buy it!!</li>
            <li> In my mind one of the best electric razors out there.  I have stopped using a blade for touch ups.</li>
            <li> This is the best shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced from an electric shaver.  I use it with shaving cream and it works amazingly.  Give it about a week so that your skin gets used to the high power blades before you comment on the quality of the shave.  Once your skin adapts to the shaver you don&#x27;t have to be as gentle and skin irritation is minimal.  I would reccomend this to anyone in a heartbeat.  Self cleans like a champ and the little sideburn trimer on the back is high powered too!</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my fiancé for Christmas. He is an Italian, with course, thick facial hair that grows very fast. The man has a five-o&#x27;clock shadow by noon. He also has problem with razor burn and ingrown hairs on his neck. He had mentioned wanting to give an electric razor a try, so after a lot of research I bought the Panasonic. He is THRILLED. Having never used an electric razor, he was concerned that he would not get a close shave. Honestly, it&#x27;s hard to tell that he didn&#x27;t use his normal disposable manual razor. So, I figured I would try it for myself... I have always had a horrible time shaving my underarms. No matter what razor, shaving cream, or lotions I used I would end up with awful razor burn under my arms. And trust me, when you start sweating in the Florida weather and your underarms have razor burn, well, it&#x27;s no good. When I used the honey&#x27;s new razor I had NO razor burn, NO pulling, NO cuts, NO ingrown hairs. I love it! I&#x27;ve used it on my legs as well. It takes a little longer than the traditional route, but it&#x27;s quite nice to be able to shave and watch TV at the same time. The cleaner is another added bonus. The upfront cost is a little pricey, but not when you factor in how much you would pay for disposable blades. This razor will quickly pay for itself.  All in all, I would definitely recommend this product. I am thrilled, and so is my fiancé. The only problem is, now I think I may have to order me one as well!</li>
            <li> For me this shaver shaves better dry. I have tried it in the shower with and without shaving cream, and my face looks fine til I get out of the shower and notice several missed hairs, especially on my neck. It lists on here that it shaves in \\&quot;1\\&quot; pass, not so much.It takes 2-3 times as long to shave with this razor then it does with a standard razor. On the flip side, it does shave to the skin once I make several passes and I get far less razor burn and zero cuts with this Panasonic. I did get a smokin&#x27; deal on here though and shipping was fast. It should pay for itself quickly, considering I was paying out the rear for replacement Quattro blades for my Schick. I don&#x27;t see how manufactures can charge around twenty bucks for a 4 pack of Quattro type blades for a standard razor. I was buying them off of Ebay for way cheap and way more. Then, a few weeks ago, I looked on Ebay to buy more Quattro blades and found no good deals, so I bought this Panasonic! After reading several reviews and seeing that most of you were rating this razor at 4-5 stars, I bought it! It does the job even though it takes longer then a standard razor, but will save you a lot of money in the long run!!</li>
            <li> This is the best electric shaver that is sold. I recommend this to all. It is at a cheap price. Excellent!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hubby for Christmas and he loves it.  No more going over the same spot over and over again.</li>
            <li> This razor rules.  Simply stated it shaves like no other razor I have used.  I use to prefer a Braun because of the quality and feel, but defineatly am impressed with the features this razor has to offer.  Really like the battery indicator so I know when to charge again, nothing worse than getting 1/2 way done and it dies.  I would highly recommend this product for anyone, you will really love it.</li>
            <li> This is my third Panasonic Razor.  They keep getting better, this one being no exception.  From what I&#x27;ve read, this model is discontinued. My last Panasonic model provided almost seven years of one to two shaves per day.  I replaced it because the battery would hold a charge for only a couple of days of shaves.  The cutters and head, original to the shaver, were still providing good service.  I tried Norelco previously, it irritating my neck horribly. I tried Baun after the Norelco, not happy with the shave closeness and speed, the heads wearing out rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiance for Christmas and he LOVES it!  He wanted a wet/dry shaver but it works so good dry he&#x27;s never even used it wet.  He shaves in half the time and no more bloody toilet paper patches stuck to his face! :-)  He would definitley recommend this shaver!</li>
            <li> I did a lot of homework before I bought this electric shaver.  I have been using electric razors for 12 years and I have had problems with breaking out since I started shaving.  Using this razor wet eliminated my breakouts imediately.  It is great.</li>
            <li> Never used electric razor until now. Panasonic exceed my expectations, and glad I chose one with wet and dry capabilities. First shave is the most difficult. Once the hair adapts to new type of blade, shave is very smooth. Superb performance.</li>
            <li> I have used Braun shavers since 1955, with brief exceptions for a Phillips (didn&#x27;t shave) and a Remington (loud and rough). Therefore, it took some really positive reviews and a great Amazon price to tempt me into this one. I have now used it for a month. It is quick, relatively quiet, smooth on the skin and leaves said skin just about as smooth as the proverbial baby&#x27;s bottom. I am thrilled with it. The HydraClean system is not as good as Braun&#x27;s, but hey: by then you are shaved.</li>
            <li> I really love this little beauty. I have been shaving for many years, and it has always been uncomfortable to shave more than every other day whether I used a blade or shaver. With the Panasonic, I can shave twice daily quickly and smoothly.</li>
            <li> This is, without a doubt, one of my worst purchases ever. Well, I&#x27;ve bought worse items before, but they&#x27;re much cheaper. For $100 I expected so much more from the Vortex. I hate shaving and my wife hates stubble - not a good combination. With a blade I can only shave about once every 3 or 4 days because shaving short stubble for some reason really irritates my skin. I figured if I had a quality electric razor I could shave more frequently and my wife would be happier. Enter the Vortex.    I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 weeks and have used it maybe 10 times. My beard doesn&#x27;t grow fast, and it&#x27;s not very thick so daily shaving isn&#x27;t needed. I have tried shaving with this thing many different ways: bone dry, wet in the shower, in the shower with soap on my face, in the shower with regular shaving cream, with a shaving gel, and dry but with Afta pre-electric lotion. I also tried holding the razor at various angles, with varying pressures, and running it across my face at different speeds. I&#x27;ve pulled and stretched my skin out trying to get a close shave and it just doesn&#x27;t happen. Weirdly enough, the best shave I&#x27;ve managed to get with this is shaving bone dry.    Every time I use the razor I later find patches that just didn&#x27;t get cut, so I have to go BACK to the bathroom to touch it up...and sometimes even then it doesn&#x27;t shave closely. I probably spend at least 15 minutes solely on the shave which is ridiculous. With a blade it took no more than 10 minutes for a shower and a shave. Now I&#x27;m looking at at least 20, and the quality of the shave is absolutely pitiful.     Considering the great reviews this gets I&#x27;m wondering if I have a faulty product, but I really don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s it. In the world of electric razors this might be one of the best, but why would you spend $100 for a product that eats up an outlet and counter space, and offers a worse shave than a $10 blade would offer?    I gave this two stars because the areas that it does manage to cut are just as closely shaven as my razor (Gillette Fusion). I just have difficulty getting it to shave my entire face.    *EDIT: March 18, 2011  The below comment, which I have no idea what the heck it&#x27;s suppose to mean, has brought my attention back to this review so I&#x27;m giving an update. My above review was somewhat a rant, but I still feel it adequately reflects my feelings for this razor. I&#x27;ve been using it exclusively for several months and despite my best efforts it still gives a pretty bad shave. Before having an electric razor I shaved maybe twice a week with a blade. In order for this to do half-way decent I&#x27;ve found I need to shave at least once a day with this. The only benefit to that is that it doesn&#x27;t take as long per shave if you use it more frequently. I bumped my rating up to three stars because I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s designed to be used daily, not 2-3 times a week, so I&#x27;m rating it based on that now.    The lone \\&quot;pro\\&quot; for this razor is that it&#x27;s sideburn trimmer is great. It gives a nice, clean, close cut.</li>
            <li> I like my new razor alot its easy to use goes around the curves of my face easaly and does a good job.  Its also very esy to clean</li>
            <li> If I did not have Parkinson Disease, I would have given it a 5 star.</li>
            <li> Worked great until the cleaner stopped draining after I replaced the cartridge the first time. The shave is very nice, but the cleaner is worthless. I have no idea what to do with this thing now. Before it stopped working, I would have given it 5 stars.  Edit* I&#x27;m putting this back up to 5 stars because I got it working again. I guess anything that involves a drain and shave trimmings is going to get clogged once in a while. Just remember that if you buy this, you&#x27;re eventually going to have to use a toothpick to unclog that drain.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I have tried a number of different electric shavers foils, rotary, and wet/dry. I would always return to a blade razor due to neck irritation and the lack of a close shave. I have a beard like wire and sensitive skin. This combination kept the styptic pencil people in business. Bleeding is even worse now due to medication. I had to do something about the nicking. So, I tried an electric one more time. This Panasonic razor gives me a close shave without the irritation experienced in the past. The closest shave and most comfortable occurs when wet using shave cream but using it dry is more than acceptable. Give it a try as it sure beats using a styptic pencil or that old stand by toilet paper.  Maybe it is just me but did you all notice that your old style blade was not as sharp just prior to the introduction of a new more expensive blade.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic family is best for beards where the hair grows parallel to the face where the hairs lay down. The shavers also work great for normal perpendicular hair. The 8109 vibrates faster than the 8103 and battery lasts forever. The shave is identical between the two Panasonics (8103/8109) that I own. Had I known the differences were so slim, I would have gone ahead and bought new blades and screen for my 8103. The cleaner is nice and seems to keep the blades sharper. I have sensitive skin and have gotten the &#x27;bumps&#x27; from Norelco style razors. The Panasonic is much less harsh on my skin. The hair on my neck really lays down and I must make several passes sometimes when I haven&#x27;t shaved in a couple of days. Even with multiple passes the Panasonic does not irritate my skin. I would recommend the 8109S without worry. Just remember that blades and screen should be replaced yearly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband.  He comments every day about how much he loves it and has never had an electric shaver that worked so well.  His face is baby&#x27;s bottom smooth!</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and have normally bought the 3 head shavers, mostly Norelcos.  I didn&#x27;t mind the Norelcos, but was at the point of needing new blades.  Given the cost of the new blades and I had had the shaver for 3 years I decided to try something new and bought this razer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - Nice, classy design.  Give me a closer shave with less effort than what I&#x27;ve found with a tri-head shave.  Recharging station works great and cleans the shaver perfectly every time.  I sometimes don&#x27;t clean the shaver for a few days and the cleaner works just as good then as when I do it daily.  The LCD display works nicely showing the current charge level of the device.  With shaving every other day the battery normally depletes to about 50-60% in a weeks period.  Sits well in my hand as I use it.  Whole system is simple to use including changing out cleaning fluid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - Cleaning system and shaver are a bit loud.  I was a little afraid of waking up the wife during either use but it hasn&#x27;t been an issue yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall good, product at a great price.</li>
            <li> It was a great buy! Works very good and it has been the closest shave I have ever had! The self cleaning is a plus</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband for Christmas but then found out he was looking online to buy one so I gave it to him early.  He was overwhelmed by the programming features (he&#x27;s not a detail person) but he quickly figured it out and plugged it in.  To my surprise (and his) he absolutely loves it and has been using it ever since.  He shaves both his face and head every morning and now he only uses this and he said it&#x27;s better than he could have imagined!  He is utterly amazed at the way this razor shaves his face and bumpy head!  I am buying one for my legs!!!</li>
            <li> I was a devoted Braun user for the last 30 years.  I bought a series 7 Braun which gave a close shave for the first year.  The trimmer mechanism broke but was still usable.  It ate up cleaning cartridges.  It was as noisy as all hell.  I thought about replace it but who need to spend another 200 buck.  I tried a Panasonic Vortex for $79.00, with the cleaning station.  It is quite, smooth, has a better cleaning station and the cartridges are cheaper and last longer.  It can also be cleaned under running water with a little liquid soap.  I will never go back to the overpriced Braun shavers.  Good going for Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I decided to dump my conventional non-electric razor and try this electric shaver. I can understand it takes a few days to get used to a razor and that eventually razor burns go away. However, this electric shaver could not pick hair as cleanly at a regular gillette fusion blade. It&#x27;s performance is inconsistent. I had to return the shaver. That said, the cleaning system is awesome.</li>
            <li> I got this after my very expensive name brand razor turned into what I would consider to be an epilator and not a shaver.  I would actually fear shaving with it if I had missed a day.  I pulled this out of the packaging and tried it out right away.  I hadn&#x27;t shaved in two days and the shave was great.  It is very soft to the touch and has a high enough rpm motor that it doesn&#x27;t slow down to cut hair like some other brands.  It took just two passes on my scruffy face to clean it up.  The wet/dry feature makes cleaning very easy. I really love the new panasonic lineup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had numerous shavers in the past,this is by the far the closest shave! It&#x27;s also a very quick shaver doesn&#x27;t take long at all to shave. Very smooth and very minimal skin irritation,that&#x27;s saying a lot since I have sensitive skin. Does very well shaving on the jawline and under the chin. Easy to clean and the little screen lets you know the battery level,very cool! The cleaning/charging dock does very well on cleaning! You can charge it without the dock. If you shave every day it will last about 7 to 10 days. Would definitely recommend this shaver!</li>
            <li> This electric shaver is the best of the many I&#x27;ve had through the years.  It is super fast, and doesn&#x27;t pull or irritate my skin.  It&#x27;s easy to clean by holding under hot water from the facet, or by using the stand with a cleansing solution.  I have owned electric shavers, including almost all brands, for over sixty years, and I recommend this one for its ease of use, being solidly built, and for doing as advertised.</li>
            <li> The ES8109S has really exceeded my expectations in every way.  It is a beautiful piece of hardware, well balanced with perfect fit and finish.  I have a very thick beard, and it shaves so close my face is like baby skin, and with no irritation.    After using this for several weeks I&#x27;ve discovered a shaving method that really takes advantage of this wonderful machine.    1) Wash face, leave wet.  Apply shaving cream (I use Edge Gel).    2) Turn on hot tap water.  Turn on shaver, rinse in hot water while it&#x27;s on, then start shaving    3) Periodically dip the (running) shaver under the hot water.  The hot, wet blades melt the gel on your skin and help you to get a really close and comfortable shave.    4) Repeat step 3 until there&#x27;s no more gel on your face, then give it one last good rinse before setting it in for a daily cleaning/charge.  Your cleaning cartridges will last longer because the shaver is already pretty clean when you start the cycle.    You will be rewarded with a pleasurable, close and comfortable shave that compares to going to the barber shop for a hot towel/straight razor professional shave.  You will never get that with the \\&quot;architec\\&quot; or \\&quot;pulsonic\\&quot; shavers.</li>
            <li> I have had the shaver for little over a month now and I am not that impressed.      The shaver never really gives me a close shave along the side of my face, but it will, however, around my lips...go figure.    The battery life leaves a lot to be desired.  I can&#x27;t go more than 7-8 days and it needs a charge &amp; cleaning.  My last panasonic would last up to two weeks between charges &amp; cleaning.    Not a bad deal for the money.  But I still expected more.</li>
            <li> Ive always used manual shavers. Got this as my first electric. I was worried about the closeness of the shave when I purchased it. But I cannot even tell a difference in the smoothness of my skin. The cleaning system works great and the trimmer is an extra bonus. Better than I could have hoped.</li>
            <li> I have had problems shaving since I hit puberty. My skin is extremely sensitive. Ingrown hairs and infections have become a mainstay in my life.  The only product that worked was the Mach 3 razor...on its best day, it did not give me the best shave.  Last week on a clinical rotation, I had one of the doctors look at my neck.  \\&quot;Sychosis barbae\\&quot; is what he diagnosed. I was put on antibiotics to clear up this infection.  That was my last straw.  My roomate was so kind to let me use his Panasonic because the Mach 3 would have caused some serious damage.  I have never had a shave like that in my life.  I immediately ordered this model and have been a happy customer for 5 days.  My infection has cleared up, and this shaver is nothing short of amazing.  My facial hair grows in softer, and I am able to shave every day if need be (unlike every 2 to 3 days with the Mach 3).  I would highly recommend this product to anybody.  Having the HydraClean is great too.  If you are on the fence about purchasing this shaver...buy it without hesitation!</li>
            <li> This is a great razor. I have not had a single problem with it since I started using it. I highly recommend this razor to men that want a good razor, but don&#x27;t want to spend $200.</li>
            <li> I have used a razor blade type shaver (two &amp; four blade) for over forty years and thought I was getting a good shave. The fact is that this electric shaver beats the razors hands down and it does it without burning my face. The automatic cleaning cycle is very nice as well. I let it clean the shaver every third day. I use an inexpensive electric pre-shave and that works just fine. I do not shave with this electric shave in the shower, but could if I wanted to do so.</li>
            <li> This Nano technology that the New Panasonic Wet/Dry Shaver uses is the best shave that in my 56yrs. I have ever gotten. Great Job :Panasonic! Keep up the great techology Develpoement.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver. This is my 2nd one.  Like any product of this nature getting a new one every 3-5 years is expected.  I don&#x27;t use the cleaning system anymore.  I like to use some baby powder on the face to help make it a very smooth shave. Then, clean it with just soap and water every week or so.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin; therefore, I needed to have a wet/dry shaver that would protect my skin and still offer an extremely close shave. Well, this is the product.  I did quite a bit of research before purchasing, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the Panasonic ES8109S.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Panasonic razor based on Amazon&#x27;s recommendation. For several years, I&#x27;ve used only Norelco. But, my shaves kept getting slower and slower and I no longer could get a clean shave on my neck. My step-son had a Panasonic and liked it, so I decided to purchase it. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. My shaves are both closer and faster and the shaver is so easy to clean. I am extremely happy with this shaver.</li>
            <li> I got this for my dad 2 years ago.  It is still running great.  At first before I ordered, I was afraid that the shaver would pull on his skin, like some reviews say.  My dad only uses it for dry shaving only, and he does not have any issues.  He says it gives him a close shave, and does not have any problems with it giving him sensitive skin.  We are very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver a week ago and love it. I have a very tough, fast-growing (and increasingly grey) beard and this shaver does an excellent job. It is a replacement for a Braun 8585, which performed well, but was not as good as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the noise, this shaver is actually quieter than most electrics I&#x27;ve owned. I don&#x27;t understand all of the negative comments about the noise at all. It has a higher pitch than my previous shavers, but that is not a problem. An electric shaver is going to make some noise, period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning mode works very well, and again it is quieter than any other self-cleaning shaver I&#x27;ve owned. The cartridges are less expensive than the Braun, as well (about 11 bucks with the subscribe-and-save program with Amazon), and they are less messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shape of this shaver is very different from the Brauns, but it took only a day or two to get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real complaint is about the owner&#x27;s manual. It was obviously translated by someone who&#x27;s first language was definitely not English. I&#x27;m an engineer by trade, and I can make neither heads nor tails of the chart that explains the cleaning/drying/charging cycles. I just drop the shaver in the cleaner, press the selector button to get the right lights to come on, and I let it do its thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this shaver. Panasonic is a great brand, and I expect a long life from this one.</li>
            <li> This is perhaps the best product of any kind that I have purchased in years! After numerous attempts to buy electra shavers manufactured by Remington (cheap, but should be labeled as a self-torture device for those that want to destroy their faces slowly and painfully) and Noelco (they work OK until it&#x27;s time to clean them--then it takes a PHd in rocket science to put them back together again--I mean, they are AWFUL and to be avoided at all costs.  And then I splurged on this Panasonic. I could not believe what I was feeling, what I was seeing, and how well this product is manufacture. It&#x27;s the Mercedes-Benz or Porsche of shavers! First, it feels so good in the hand--built like a tank, stylish, and effortless to hold and manipulate. Having a heavy beard and sensitive skin, I took the advice of the directions and have used shaving cream every time (best wet/dry product I&#x27;ve ever used). It is incredibly comfortable. And then, what a great job it does! Not only as good as using a blade, but much better and more consistent. Shaving has gone from a chore to a genuine pleasure. I can&#x27;t rave about this product enough. It is so much better than anything I tried under $125 that is belongs in a class by itself. Buying anything else is a mistake.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift and they love it and use it all the time. He says it shaves great and stays charged.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver as a gift for my Dad&#x27;s 90th birthday.  He thinks it is terrific!  He&#x27;s used different kinds of electric razors since they first started to be sold \\&quot;way back when\\&quot; and he says this is the best ever.  He says it&#x27;s a well designed system. He actually likes the cleaning feature. Although you have to periodically change the cleaner, it&#x27;s very simple. It does away with all the blowing and brushing he had to do with other shavers he&#x27;s used.</li>
            <li> Best electric razor I have ever had!!!  I used it when I shaved my head for the first time and it worked great.    I like the % battery charge left feature and also how easy it cleans up.</li>
            <li> This is my third Panasonic over the years and all have been very good. The only reason I am not giving it a 5 star rating is because they always make a couple of small changes that keep the replacement blades and hydra clean system from one model from fitting the next model....changes that don&#x27;t make either the blades or the cleaning system better but do keep you from having extra parts if and when you might need them. ll in all a very good razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all.  I&#x27;ve tried electric shavers that were half this price, and I&#x27;ve tried electric shavers that were more than double this price.  I&#x27;ve gone with the top of the line Braun&#x27;s, Philips Norelco&#x27;s, and Remington&#x27;s.  I had to return all of them.  For an electric shaver, this model was the best by far.  It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean (with the cleaning solution OR with soap and water).  I love how it can be used dry (my usual method) or wet as well (in the shower if I&#x27;m in a hurry).  I love how the charge lasts for days if I&#x27;m traveling.  I love how it&#x27;s fun to use.  And most importantly, I love (and my girlfriend especially loves), how smooth my face feels after using it.    I had used regular razors for years before deciding to give electrics a try.  The decision was mostly based on the fact that I hated how time consuming a task I found shaving to be.  The only razors that I found got close enough to my skin, had expensive cartridges that needed to be replaced way too often because of how fast my thick stubble dulled them.  Eventually, I just kind of stopped shaving regularly.  I didn&#x27;t necessarily like keeping a beard, but I disliked shaving even more, so I just stopped.  After a while, when I noticed people started assuming I was about ten years older than I actually am, I decided I better start shaving again.  And so this time, I decided to try the electric route.      After going through the gauntlet with pretty much every other high and low end electric shaver out there, I decided to try this Panasonic (a decision I made from reading these reviews on Amazon actually).  That was a great decision.  Immediately, I noticed the difference between this and all the other razors I tried.  It seems that 13,000 RPMs does apparently make a difference.  It gave me a cleaner, faster shave than any of the others.  I don&#x27;t know why exactly, maybe it was simply because I feel that it actually works, but I even have \\&quot;fun\\&quot; using it.      As far as how well itworks.  On my face, it definitely gives the closest shaves I&#x27;ve ever had.  It hands-down beats every electric shaver AND regular razor that I&#x27;ve ever used.  On the neck however, it does seem to continually miss some spots, and just can&#x27;t quite adapt to the topography of my Adam&#x27;s apple.  It&#x27;s not too bad, but on days that I have important meetings/interviews, I do have to go over my neck with a regular razor just to make sure everything is perfect.  These instances are few and far in between, and for everyday use though, this is the tool to shave with.</li>
            <li> It seems to do the job; however does not seem to shave as close as my old electric (cheaper Remington) shaver.  The 5 o&#x27;clock shadow seems to come a little sooner....but again, its doing the job for the most part.  Probably just stick with cheaper shavers in the future.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my husband who has very sensitive skin and boy does he love it!!! I looked at all the electric razors and what brought me to this one was that it was wet and dry. He got it early to make sure it did not break him out and has not stopped using it. He uses it everyday and it does not break him out. The cleaning unit isn&#x27;t that bulky as some others. This one is the best buy out of all</li>
            <li> This shaver is great. I bought it for my partner and he loves it.  The way it shaves in the shower is great for him.  The cost was high (retail) but I found that Amazon had the best price and trust me, I looked everywhere!!  I think the cleaning solution cartridges are a bit overpriced and he may not use them all the time but the shaver is a dream.  It&#x27;s hard to find a wet/dry shaver that works well but this one is great!</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with a blade for over 30 years and have not had much experience with electric shavers. I recently went on blood thinners and was advised to stop using a blade and switch to an electric for fear of &#x27;bleeding out&#x27;. After reading many reviews, I purchased the Panasonic Vortex. I must say that I am quite pleased with the results. Best results so far are using it wet with a gel-type shaving cream.</li>
            <li> A solid shaver, in continus competition with my [[ASIN:B003YJAZZ4 Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Silver]] for my favorite electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the closet electric shave I have found so far. I have used this, the above mentioned Braun, and the [[ASIN:B003V37ZDS Philips Norelco 1250x/40 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver, Black]]. In fact, if you press to hard and shave too fast, you can get very small cuts (relatively harmless, but they do bleed). Proper technique avoids this problem - just go slow and trim your beard before you shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave quality: Just about on par with the Braun, which is very, very good. As mentioned, this is the closest shave currently available (February 2012). The Braun does provide a head that does seem to catch more hairs easily, but the sharpness of these blades, and the closeness of the shave, just about make it even in terms of shave time and hairs cut. The Panasonic also allows wet shaving, which cannot be understated (see below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomics: The best of the breed. the most comfortable to hold of any of the above mentioned shavers. Sculpted to fit either hand. The shave heads are angled perfectly. Notches on the side provide a solid grip, and a patterned thumb dot on top provides a comfortable place for said digit to rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet/Dry mode: If you are a lifelong electric user, wet shaving will open your eyes. You can take this shaver in the shower with no problem, and you can use any shaving cream or foam you&#x27;d like - the Panasonic cuts right through them. Shaving in the shower softens your beard, and creams really lubricated and soften the blow of scraping steel across your face. This is an awesome feature and one you will (or should) use often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer: The integrated trimmer is the best I have seen - it is stronger than the Braun and Norelco and also very well positioned to easily reach your face. However, it will not replace a stand alone trimmer - this will only work for a day or two of stubble (depending on your beard hairs thickness).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest throwing away the charging base. It charges it perfectly, but the Vortex cleaning system is a bit messy (I have had it leak) and smells a but sticky and cheap. You can super easily clean this in the shower or under the faucet, however - just pull off the top foil and run it under running water. This is the easiest shaver to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Super close shave&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomic design&lt;br /&gt;Wet/dry capability - can be used in the shower and with shaving cream&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Well priced&lt;br /&gt;Strong trimmer, and well angled to reach your face - though you will still need a stand-alone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Vortex cleaning system leaks a bit, and is sticky, not the best scent</li>
            <li> Compared to this wonderful device, I had been shaving with the equivalents of garden rakes all my life! Closest shave ever, nice feel, and great cleaning system. I am shaving more often, and less grudgingly. Having gone through many electrics in my quest for a decent shave, I believe I can state that this is the best in it&#x27;s class...by far.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my stepfather who is 91 yrs old ,he loves it reccommended to his brother they both love it...</li>
            <li> If you are like me and not too sure about it cutting as close as a razor,well let me fill ya in, i was using a Gillette Fusion Razor,and this thing cuts better then it does! if you follow the directions you will have a shaving system that will last ya a very long time! Great Job Panasonic!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my aging Braun 8500 series razor, which performed consistently well but managed to destroy its foils every 2-3 months recently.  After the third foil cost me about half a new razor, I decided enough was enough and sprung for the Panasonic.  The razor itself is fantastic - close shave, very reasonable noise level, waterproof head assembly, easy to clean, etc.  The battery life isn&#x27;t quite as good as I&#x27;d like, but it&#x27;s good enough for 1.5 weeks on the road.  Unfortunately, the base isn&#x27;t up to spec - the clean cycle simply doesn&#x27;t do a very good job and the controls for selecting what you want the base to do are downright bad.  I&#x27;d buy the razor by itself instead of getting the base with it - just clean it yourself with some warm water and rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> I got a very good deal on the ES8109S Vortex, which makes it easier to appreciate. It&#x27;s not perfect, but then again I never found a razor that could shave my thick beard perfectly. I still have a hard time with the neck area, but otherwise it&#x27;s a fine tool. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8109S provides me with an excellent shave.  I rate it 4.5 stars.  However, I have stored the elaborate cleaner and charger (overkill) under my bathroom sink, and I use the simpler charging and cleaning methods that the instructions offer as equally acceptable options.</li>
            <li> I thought the Gillette MACH Fusion Power ad of $1 a week as too much, so I bought this for $69 at Circuit City days, just before they went out of biz.  I only shave once a week to every three days.  My skin has gotten use to the shaver in about two months, but I still get some cuts around my neck and throat.  After shaving with razors for a decade and a half, and going with the shaver, I found some things counterproductive and breaking basic shaving rules.  I first go over the face and neck with the shaver.  My chin and neck normally need retouching, so I use cold water to clean out the shaver.  Strange huh?  Then I still have some stragglers in those areas.  I end up using the machine up,down, down up, to left, right, right left.  I never did that with a razor; downward strikes only, every 1/4-1/2 of an inch was my routine.  After about five minutes, the shave does not look bad.  I still use a balm after it is all done.  Maybe $1 a week is not too much after all.  I am not sure that I can continue using this after 69 weeks to save money.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Amazon and I just received it today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impressions are \\&quot;WOW!\\&quot; and \\&quot;AMAZING!\\&quot; and \\&quot;UNBELIEVABLE\\&quot; so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the absolute closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric shaver. It&#x27;s so close that my skin is baby smooth just like after I shave with a blade. There are a few spots that are still slightly stubbly, but those same spots give me fits with a blade anyway, so it&#x27;s no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping that after a few weeks when my face gets used to this method of shaving, that those spots will become less of an issue. If not, no biggie. At least I&#x27;m not nicking myself and bleeding profusely. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try to remember to update the review as time goes on, to give further impressions later on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the Braun Series 7 790 CC before I saw this one on Amazon, but I&#x27;m not even going to try that one. You can&#x27;t use it wet, so forget it. Since I can&#x27;t return it to Amazon, I&#x27;ll have to sell it on Craigslist at a loss, or something... oh well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Update 3/25/09 **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still loving this shaver. I have no complaints at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip, read the instructions before using the cleaning thing on the base. You HAVE to add water to it. There&#x27;s a plastic tub in the back of the base that you take out to add the water. I didn&#x27;t read the instructions at first, but thankfully I didn&#x27;t ruin the thing with my stupidity. ;)</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for about 3 months and am pretty happy with the performance. It provides a shave that is far superior to my Norelco rotary but still cannot provide a perfect shave on my neck; I need a little touch up after I am out of the shower in front of the mirror. I am very satisfied with the cleaning/charging functions and the number of shaves per charge. Overall, I would recommend this razor to a friend.</li>
            <li> Im very happy with it, I used it on week ends, great to have , love the product</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this Panasonic Vortex shaver, I used a Braun shaver with cleaning system.  This Panasonic shaver cuts closer and smoother than the more expensive Braun shaver.  Also, you can use it in the shower unlike the Braun one.  The shaver is light and easy to hold.  If you&#x27;re looking for a quality shaver, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am a head shaver and razors were killing me in price. This has been great if you shave every 3-4 days you will love it. Anything over 5 days its tough to cut. Glad I bought it worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have been using the new shaver for several weeks now and I can safely say that I have never had a better shave in my life. My last Panasonic was a present given to me by my Son for my birthday in 1988. It still works fine today, but I thought that I should retire it after 22 years and try a new Panasonic. I&#x27;m glad I did!!!</li>
            <li> This is for my 86yr. old father. He had a very old Norelco that just wasn&#x27;t doing a very good job anymore. So far it seems like he gives him a good shave.  Nice to be able to wash/rinse it under running water. Don&#x27;t like the fact that you have to purchase the separate cleaning cartridges for the Hydraclean. Have not yet tried the deep clean in the cleaner yet.  He seems very happy with it so far!</li>
            <li> This is the closest shave I&#x27;ve experienced with an electric razor. My last razor was a Braun 5000s with the charging/cleaning station. It worked fairly well, but always irritated my neck.    This razor is softer, smoother, quieter, and I&#x27;ve had no neck irritation. The foil is on a set of springs and gives in a bit so it&#x27;s a softer touch and a closer shave. I&#x27;d recommend it. I love the LED feature that tells you how charged it is, when you need to clean it, etc.     I&#x27;m pleased as punch with this razor.</li>
            <li> Took me no less than a month to get used to the shaver as I only used razors in the past. Made the purchase after reading positive reviews and after my need to substitute my expensive razor cartridges (Gillette)  So far the results are very good. My skin is now used to it and the shaver is a pleasure to use. With the HydraClean system, the unit is kept clean and fresh. I highly reccommend this shaver. Saludos!</li>
            <li> I have only had it for a week or so at the time of writing this review and it works really, really well.  I&#x27;m getting the closest shave I have had in a very long time.  I move from a Braun to this Panasonic.  So far I am very, very happy.</li>
            <li> I am mostly a blade guy and have been dissappointed with electrics over the years but decided to give this one a try. The shave actually is close, the operation is smooth, and it is quiet enough that you can hear it cut the hairs!</li>
            <li> The device doesn&#x27;t have 3 blades and it works poorly. Takes 4-5 times for a complete shave. Couldn&#x27;t see the proud nanotechnology. I&#x27;m done with panasonic shaver, back to the blades, much quicker.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor about a month ago and it is by far the best razor I&#x27;ve ever come across. For the last several years, I&#x27;ve been using a straight razor because all electric razors I&#x27;ve tried would irritate my skin really bad. But this razor is able to get a very close shave with very little, usually none, irritation. The automatic cleaning system is a nice feature but haven&#x27;t used it yet. Its very helpful to know how much charge the razor has, which it also holds a charge very well; for several days, maybe even a week. The razor head bends &amp; moves very easily to shave the curves of your face very well. Would highly recommend this razor! Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Owned for over a year and still working great. Provides a close shave, trimmer works fine, battery requires little charging. Best electric razor I have owned.Only con to the razor is it is rather loud.</li>
            <li> Purchased based on positive reviews from amazon.Was not disappointed .After three weeks off use my shaves are as good  As my Schick quatro and are consisitant.the blade is good for two days but begins to fade after that.The cleaner charger works   great.The cartridge only lasted 22 days so will likely be more expensive to maintain than advertised</li>
            <li> I really like the razor and the cleaning/charging station rocks. I always run the razor under running water to partially clean it so the solution lasts a bit longer (not that cheap just can&#x27;t find it locally). The only issue I have is it, like all other electric razors I have used, doesn&#x27;t do very well with the thick stubble right under my chin. By the time I get it all it often irritates that area.</li>
            <li> Shaves as close as my old Brau razor; however, the foil gets a little warm against my face. I really like this cleaning system better. Overall it&#x27;s great razor and being $75 to $80 less than the new Brau that replaced my 15-year old one.</li>
            <li> This shaver is as good as the 320.00 Braun shaver. I only paid 106.00 i believe. The motor sounds like an Indy car at 13000 rpm. The rpm&#x27;s are amazing.  I have a very heavy beard. I&#x27;ve been spotted for sasquatch several times by my home after i didnt shave for 2 days. It shaves pretty close.  Even the trimmer shaves you almost as clean as a blade shave. It is very well built it will last a lifetime. The battery lasts about 3 weeks!!! my old 20.00 electric shaver i had to have a cord connected to the power company just to use it.    You get what you pay for here don&#x27;t buy cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a real time saver.  Shave is amazingly good and no irritation.  I&#x27;ve tried electric before and not been happy but the newer multi-blade razors were irritating me so I decided to give electric another try.  This razor is fast, clean, and irritation free.  I&#x27;m really impressed how close of a shave I get.  It&#x27;s not as close as a razor but it&#x27;s really close.</li>
            <li> I got this electric shaver to shave the back of my neck.  I had more than a bit of skepticism about how it would perform on my face.  I had a Norelco electric shaver back in the 90&#x27;s and wasn&#x27;t really that impressed.  This electric shaver is AMAZING.      It&#x27;s been over a month now and I literally have not picked up a regular razor since getting this thing.  The shave I get really is as close as my regular razor.  The best part is that I can get to all the tough spots without accidentally drawing blood.     I would highly recommend this shaver</li>
            <li> I have owned electric shavers for the past 20 years.  I prefer the wet/dry ones and have owned Panasonics and Norelcos.  I would occasionally switch back to a blade because I couldn&#x27;t find an electric that even came close to a blade but I would always switch back to an electric for the convenience.  My last  Norelco Advantage died last week after 7 years of use.  It never quite gave a great shave but I liked the fact that it could use lotion and be used in the shower.  After looking at the reviews on Amazon, I ordered the Panasonic ES8109S.     After using it for one day, I can tell you that it shaves as close as a blade.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it and the fact that I can use shaving cream is great.  It feels very solidly built and I like the lcd screen that tells you the charge level.      Not a complaint but just a word of caution.  This thing is alot louder than my norelco Advantage.  I get up earlier than my wife and if I didn&#x27;t use a separate bathroom, I can guarantee that she would wake up after I start it up.  If you are use to a foil razor, it may not be much louder but compared to a round bladed razor, it is a wake up call.      The cleaning/charging station feels very solid as well and the cleaning/dry cycle is not really that loud.  The fan in the dry cycle is actually very quiet.  The cleaning uses a detergent cartridge with water from the tap instead of an alcohol solution.  One cartridge will last for 30 cleanings.  Amazon sells them in a 3 pack for about $11.    Overall, I would highly recommend this razor.  Panasonic got it right with this one.</li>
            <li> I got this for hubby and he can not stop talking about it! He loves it. He said he has never got a closer shave even with a blade. And no nicks at all. We are very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Bought the shaver after reading the reviews not impressed at all. It takes a lot longer to shave compared to my older phillips shaver with 3 circular heads. Shave is not as smooth as the phillips one.   Not worth the money</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for about a month now and am pleased with the closeness of the shave. Also the shaver lasts about 5 days on a single charge. The cleaner doesn&#x27;t use any irritating alcohol to clean the shaver just soap and water. No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> I am a recent convert from Gillette Mach 3, which i have been using for over a decade. I never believed that any electric shaver would come close to the comfort and closeness of using a blade, since i have a very thick and extensive beard growth. For the same reason dry shaving never worked for me. My problem with blades was that i always ended up getting a 5&#x27;O Clock shadow.  Hesitantly i decided to try this Panasonic shaver after reading the reviews here - WOW !!  what a difference!  I still use lather/foam to shave with this shaver and the shave is so close that the 5 O clock shadow always shows up late :) by as much as a whole day !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver has given me the closest shave \\&quot;ever\\&quot; and my face feels so smooth even when feeling against the grain. Very highly recommended to all who are hesitant to move from blades to electric. I would highly recommend use of lather for the closest possible shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: After 3 months of daily use, i feel that i dont get a shave as smooth as i initially got when the blades on this were new - i have an extensive growth, and always shave wet with lather. Even though, the shave is still better than what i used to get shaving with Mach 3 - just not as good as the first month of shaving - i am thinking i will try putting a new blade - that may help - but then this will be a more expensive a proposition to use as a blade system.</li>
            <li> Razor is fast, gives a close shave. It holds a charge for a hold week of shaves. The HydraClean System does an excellent job of cleaning. I have averaged using the clean system once a week.  Would recommend this razor to the person who wants a close shave, but don&#x27;t have time to waste!</li>
            <li> I chose to buy this shaver after reading a lot of online reviews and receiving a discount program with Panasonic. Initially i was excited about the shaver and its advanced technologies, but when i received the shaver, i was actually a little bit disappointed.    Personally, i desire a shaver that&#x27;s comfortable, thorough, and fast (as in completing a shave). This shaver only covers the comfort part for me. My facial hair grows rather quickly in various places on my face (i&#x27;m not a caveman but i would consider myself hairy for a young Asian male). I used to have a Phillips/Noreco shaver and it got the shaving done quick and thorough, although it wasn&#x27;t nearly as comfortable as this Panasonic shaver.    The fancy technologies on this shaver are all cool and useful but I would have to shave the same area on my face for about 4-5 times to get a complete shave (keep in mind electronic shavers aren&#x27;t as thorough as regular shavers). I wouldn&#x27;t have spent $120+ on this if I had tried it out in a store first. On a side note, NEVER order from Panasonic website direct, because they are incompetent and they even charged me an item that i didn&#x27;t order on my credit card. How crazy is that?</li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic shaver I have owned.  This one is far superior to the previous one.  The shave is extremely close.  I really like the cleaning system that comes with this shaver.  I just rinse it off when I am done, put it in the charger/cleaner and it is ready to go when I need my next shave.  A couple of notes.  If you have not used an electric shaver before or in awhile it will take your face awhile to get use to it.  I have also found that this shaver shaves so close I wash my face AFTER shaving to make sure I don&#x27;t get any ingrown hairs.  Might sound silly but this shave is that close.  I also reccomend that you don&#x27;t use shave cream with this shaver.  I use Williams Lectric shave before shaving.  I found it difficult to get the shaver really clean when using a shave cream.  One great feature is that you dont have to use the cleaner if you don&#x27;t want to or can&#x27;t.  An example would be if you are on vacation.  Just rinse it off when you are done!</li>
            <li> My wife bought this razor for me for my birthday. I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 months now and I love it. I am in the military and close shaves are a must. Unfortunately, I have very dark and coarse facial hair, and electrics have never cut it well (especially the neck!). I used to use a Mach 3 because that was the only was to get a decent shave. I got tired of the constant nicks, cuts and razor burn, so I was on the lookout for an electric. I looked at the top-of-the-line models from Braun and Norelco before I came across this razor. Thank goodness! The price is excellent for the quality of the razor. Plus, you get the cleaning system which is very nice as well. The best feature of this razor is the wet/dry capability. I use it in the shower with shave gel and get nearly as close a shave as I would with a blade with NONE of the irritation. It does a decent job dry as well. I am extrememly pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Since the 1950s, I&#x27;ve used several different brands and models of electric shavers in addition to blade razors. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, the Panasonic ES8109S Vortex is the best of the lot. Although I haven&#x27;t yet had the occasion to use the wet shave feature, I feel that the shaver will perform very well when used in that mode. This is the only electric shaver that I&#x27;ve used that gives me a shave as close as my blade razors have. I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;Before, I gave this product five stars, but since then it has proven to be less-than-durable and become unreliable and started to give my skin bumps and irritation. The thing that locks the cover over the blades became loose and sometimes the cover would pop off in the middle of shaving, and other times it literally cut me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since switched back to a regular razor.</li>
            <li> After a week, I have to say, I&#x27;m convinced the positive reviews of this product are spot on.  This product performs it&#x27;s job very well.  It provides a very close and comfortable shave.  I had a rotary and replaced blades religiously but the ES8109S is far superior.  It is noisy-er as others have written, but not overly so.  Much like a cheap Reming^0n.  I admit I have not taken it to the shower yet.  (I&#x27;m concerned about dropping when wet)  Even if it doesn&#x27;t work as well wet, this unit is one I can recommend 100%.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the shave I get, and the HydraClean system is convenient.  However, after about a year, the charger began to sporadically fail.  I know for certain it&#x27;s the charger, since I tested it with a multimeter.  It&#x27;s still under warranty, but for warranty service they require me to send the *entire shaver* away for 3-4 weeks (possibly the HydraClean too, but I&#x27;m not sure).  That&#x27;s ridiculous and impractical, so now I have to pay an extra $30 for a replacement charger which should have been covered under warranty.</li>
            <li> This product is a massive let down. I don&#x27;t think it is able to trim anything but peach fuzz. It certainly is not up to the task of shaving my face/neck. it is quite laborious trying to do so. Even after I&#x27;ve spent several minutes dry or wet, i still have to touch up spots with a standard razor. That is exactly what i was trying to replace. I should have known it was not going to work well. A coworker sang its praises but he doesn&#x27;t grow facial hair :(</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband after reading extensive reviews on all shavers.  He loves it and it looks nice sitting on the counter 24/7.</li>
            <li> When I buy something I want the best I can afford.  You&#x27;d think that was normal, but a lot of people seem unable to *shop* and just buy whatever&#x27;s convenient.  The Net makes pretty much everything easy to buy so why not do your research and spend money wisely?  That&#x27;s why I love Amazon reviews.      Rather than hit every good and bad point about this product I&#x27;m going to give some info on me and why I bought it so people in similar circumstances can get an idea of whether it&#x27;d be good for them.  I can&#x27;t compare it to others in this price range because I haven&#x27;t tried them.    In the past I&#x27;ve used Braun and Remington electric razors (cheap ones in the $25-$35 range) but have mainly used blades, in recent years the rather effective Mach3.  But children shouldn&#x27;t be allowed in the men&#x27;s grooming section at stores since I want to curse like a sailor every time I buy refill blades!      Plus to put it as simply as possible, I have bad skin.  I had bad acne as a teenager and its been back again in recent years though at least slightly better.  So between treatments and bad genes my face is usually broken out to some extent and alternately greasy or dry.  And the skin is always sensitive.  Regardless of razor, shaving cream/gel, technique, or schedule the irritation of shaving just made things worse.  And I always got cuts and red marks on my neck.      I wanted to try an electric razor again and in making an effort to solve my problems I read almost all the reviews on Amazon.  They all started to run together and I was prepared to spend $200+ if it was going to get the job done.  But after reading I didn&#x27;t think $200 was going to get me any more than $100.  This is a wet/dry razor which I hadn&#x27;t really thought about.  It looked to be the only well rated one around $100 which was probably because its not Panasonic&#x27;s most recent model.    It really does work pretty good.  I&#x27;d say the shave is very nearly if not as close as I&#x27;ve been able to get with a blade.  I did not seea big improvement from the first day to the 30 days later they tell you to get used to the razor.  But its working well so that&#x27;s fine.  I don&#x27;t use it in the shower since I&#x27;d be sure to lose a sideburn without a mirror.  I do rinse it frequently while shaving and will use it slightly wet to get a stubborn spot.  Its comfortable to hold and seems well-built.  The size of the head makes the trimmer harder to see then my old electrics but I don&#x27;t use it that often.    I wanted a charging/cleaning station but haven&#x27;t really been able to tell if the cleaning makes much of a difference.  I thought people that complained about the noise were overreacting, but the cleaning cycle is noisy.  I set it to run just before I leave for work.  Its also got a noticeable hum when charging so I occasionally unplug it but it charges fast enough that its usually always at 100% anyway.  My face is definitely less irritated than with a blade.    I&#x27;d definitely recommend this razor and didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars simply because I couldn&#x27;t compare it with others to be sure it absolutely deserved a top rating.</li>
            <li> Have had this since xmas and so far, it is a great shaver.  Wet or dry it does a great job.  The only problem when in the shower is not being able to see what your doing.  Be sure to get a fogless mirror so you can see.  Very close shave wet or dry</li>
            <li> Started shaving my had last week!  Upon reviewing several brands and head shaving sites, I decided that Panasonic was the shaver for me.  This shaver works great - it maintains the 13,000rpms and I get a closer shave than with a blade on my head.  Perfect for the job.</li>
            <li> Actually bought this one as a gift for my son, but I have one exactly like it.  Quality, stylish, and does a great job.  Not dead silent, but so much quieter than the Braun I had before it; especially the cleaning cycle.  Cleaning unit uses soap, not alcohol; suppose that&#x27;d be less irritating.  Buying another one just like it is about the best recommendation you can get.</li>
            <li> this is the best ever, my son loves it. he has been using it and loving it evryday.. thanks so much</li>
            <li> I use this shaver in the shower.  I get a shave comparable to one with a razor blade.  So far I&#x27;ve been very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on my experience with older Panasonic models.  Although I have no experience with any other brand of electric shavers, this Panasonic model has not disapointed.  It shaves close, does not irritate my skin and the cleaning module is great.  Also comes with a portable charger so you don&#x27;t have to take the big cleaning contraption with you on a trip.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I previously had a Panasonic wet/dry shaver that was almost identical to this one.  I liked it very much, so decided to get this one.  Although the old one was getting weaker for several reasons, I was pleasantly surprised at how easily and quickly the new one went over my face.  I would definitely purchase this with a do-over.  I like the percentage of charge left indicator rather than a light that indicates when recharging is necessary - much more accurate.</li>
            <li> The product works well, however the instruction manual is poor, despite being a techie person had never had so much trouble understanding their functions.Its self-cleaning function is quite confusing.</li>
            <li> I replace another brands shaver with the Panasonic and I have been very pleased. The old shave should be banded from stores. I shave first thing every morning just to have it behind me and this shaver does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my boyfriend for Christmas. He had complained about ingrown hairs he would get from shaving with his razor. After using them item he gets a much smoother shave and rarely an ingrown hair. The self-cleaning system is a great way to shave and forget it. I would recommend this item to anyone.</li>
            <li> The shaver works well on the face, but it never once got my neck clear and smooth like I like it. I ended up using the shaver on my face and a regular razor on my neck area. Also, it takes a while for your skin to get used to the shaver so be prepared. During the first few weeks, it left several marks on my skin that I wasn&#x27;t happy about.</li>
            <li> This is my third electric shaver in eight years.  My first was a Braun Syncro 7526 (with a cleaning stand), which I bought back in January of 2001.  The second is a Norelco 7885XL, bought in January of 2004.  I wrote a review of both those electric shavers here at Amazon.  Both of them are still working.  The Braun has had its set of foil and cutter replaced a few times over the years.  Basically, I replace my shavers after four years of daily use to upgrade to newer technology.  My newest electric shaver, the Panasonic ES8109S, is the subject of this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Panasonic is a versatile shaver.  Unlike my previous electric razors, this one can be used \\&quot;wet\\&quot;.  Basically, you can use it with your shaving cream, just like a regular blade razor.  And like a typical electric razor, you can use it dry.  You can clean it with soap and water, or you can use the cleaning stand.  The 8109S gives you choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, you&#x27;re thinking, \\&quot;This Citan has been using an electric razor for eight years.  I&#x27;ll buy whatever he recommends.  He&#x27;s the new electric razor guru, the next best thing to God.  A Stud among us!\\&quot;.  Now, I appreciate your vote of confidence, but I am no electric razor guru.  And definitely not a God.  Stud maybe . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what has been the closest shave of the past eight years?  There was a period of about 4-5 months during those eight years when I took a break from the electric razor and tried a Gillette Mach 3.  I started with the typical shaving gel and found that the Mach 3 shave was only marginally smoother than the Braun Syncro&#x27;s.  Eventually, I decided to try using a shaving brush and a shaving soap with the Mach 3.  And that my friends, gave me the best shave of my life!  However, it was also messy and probably wasteful of hot water.  Not to mention the fact that the replacement blades for the Mach 3 were somewhat expensive.  You see, to get the best (and most comfortable!) shave out of a blade razor, you have to replace the blade often.  Once a week, in my case.  Once you feel the razor tugging, it&#x27;s time for a new blade.  So, I went back to the electric razor and have not looked back since.  And no, I do not have the courage to try a straight razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Panasonic shaves better than the old Braun and the old Norelco.  It is the most comfortable of the three.  Perhaps because the ultra-fast blades lessen the chances of the razor tugging on your beard.  The beard gets sheared off before the razor can move.  Hence, you will not even feel the slightest pull.  I wanted to try how the Panasonic will perform when used with a shaving soap.  Using a shaving brush, I whipped up some foam on a mug, wet my face with hot water, and lathered it on.  Under those conditions, the Panasonic gave me the best shave that I can remember.  In fact, I now shave at night, before bed.  The shave is so good that my face is smooth all throughout the next work day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, does it make sense to use a shaving brush and a shaving soap with an electric razor?  Probably not, as that defeats the need for convenience.  Citan would be late for work if he did this in the mornings!.  I will most likely go back to dry shaving very soon.  But I just wanted to see the potential of the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does it shave dry?  Very good.  The best of any electric shaver that I have tried.  But you will have to try it for yourself.  The ergonomics are fine for me.  If you have a prominent Adam&#x27;s apple, you may be better off with a blade razor.  The larger heads of the electric razors might make it hard to maneuver around your Adam&#x27;s apple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning stand is terrific!  The razor comes out clean and recharged.  It also leaves an oily film on the foil for lubrication.  While the razor can be cleaned with tap water and soap, I really do recommend the use of the cleaning stand.  The cutters on this Panasonic oscillates very fast, against the foil.  I am not an engineer, but I suspect the Panasonic has a greater need for lubrication than most other foil razors due to its faster speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face did not require any adjustment time to get used to this shaver.  I went from a Norelco 7885XL (rotary type) to this Panasonic with no issues whatsoever.  Maybe your experience will be different.  I have visited many shaving forums and message boards over the years.  And there are some people who will always have trouble shaving, no matter the system they choose.  I hope you&#x27;re not one of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this shaving system to anyone who wants to try a new electric razor.

            <li> So I was totally stoked on this product when I ordered it.  I have wanted a wet/dry electric for a long time and had been using a basic Braun model before.  Upon the first time I used the Vortex, I felt like I was using a shaver I had already been using for six months.  I literally have to go over my face in all directions multiple times to get a clean shave and still this thing misses a decent amount of hair.  I guess I can&#x27;t give a full review of this thing until a few months down the road when I see how the blades hold up.  If it works as good as it does now, great.  If it works like my Braun that has a year old blade does, then I will be unsatisfied.  I would have kept the Braun had the automatic cleaner part of it not broken.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a electric shaver.  Having said that, I love this one.  It is easy to use, cuts close, I&#x27;ve not had any razor burn issues.  A little difficult getting around my neck line, but tolerable.  Overall, I love the base, it cleans it, charges it, and drys it.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I thought electric shavers could not get as close as a blade.  While it took time for my face to adjust to the new shaver, over a couple of weeks I noticed that I was able to get a closer and closer shave with this razor until it was pretty much shaving as close as a non-electric razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and always have shaved with a blade.  An ongoing rash caused me to look into buying an electric razor.  I&#x27;ve had this razor for just under a month and love it.  I&#x27;ll never use a blade again - don&#x27;t need to.  This does as good a job shaving me as my blade and foam without the hassle.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Panasonic wet/dry shaving system for nearly twenty years.  In that time I have had at least 6 different models and have found them all to be excellent.  My curent model, Panasonic ES8109S Vortex Wet/Dry,  arrived just a few weeks ago and it has so far given me the same level of satisfaction as all the other models I have used.  I would highly recommend this system to anyone interested in a quality shave and long lasting equipment.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT shaver.  I have been shaving with a razor for 4 years now, and problems on my face have been getting worse and worse.  Prior to that, I had a Panasonic that worked great so I decided I&#x27;d get a Panasonic again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning station seems a little gimmicky, but regardless of how it seems, it really works - whatever Panasonic is doing, it works REALLY well and it&#x27;s worth every penny.  Shaving is fast and clean, my face is smooth and it has cleared up very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This electric shaver works best on a dry face.  The battery life is enough for almost two weeks of shaving.</li>
            <li> THERE IS NO FINER SHAVER SOLD.  THE NEWER MODEL HAS A LARGER SHAVER HEAD THAT MAY GET IT DONE FASTER--MAYBE BUT AT $400 THIS IS A BUY .  I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Then the cleaner/charger dies. This happens with both the Panasonic and the Braun. The Braun has a slightly better shave, but the Panasonic is the best if you shave in the shower. Overall it was a great razor until the charger/cleaner died. Since you can&#x27;t buy a replacement cleaner, you are forced to buy a new whole new kit. The cartridges are better than the Braun because they are dry and simply have a hard soap, vs the Braun that has alcohol and is bulky and costs five times as much. A razor system should last more than a year...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it! He is a very hairy man and has a thick beard/stuble. He has never had a shaver that has worked so well. He said most shavers he has used in the past has always tugged on his hairs and this one doesn&#x27;t do that at all! His face is so soft after using it, before getting him this shaver he always had stuble that would scratch my face when he would kiss me and it was very uncomfortable for me. Now that is not a problem at all. He hasn&#x27;t used it in the shower yet, but he plans to. The price of this is very decent, some may think it is expensive.. but it&#x27;s totally worth it, for me and for him. I recommend this product for anyone.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations with this razor. As it suggested, I initially used in the shower with shaving cream/gel. This was meant for the skin to get used to it. I LOVE how one can use it in the shower or on dry skin. I love the HydraClean option, even though I find it difficult to find the cartridges. The shave is good if the shaver is kept clean. My biggest peeve is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last. I hate hair on my upper lip. When I use this, it&#x27;s usually grown in by the end of the day and I&#x27;m not some hairy sasquatch. Additionally, and this is a big con, I break out much, MUCH more when I use this often. I generally try to alternate every other day with razor/electric shaves; however, when I&#x27;m traveling and use this more often, I get a significant amount of ingrown hairs/pimple looking bumps. I&#x27;ll continue to use this one but will look elsewhere when it comes time to replace.</li>
            <li> this is my first electric razor and i am very pleased.  Battery life is great however i would like a timer setting for the cleaning function.  When the cleaner or dryer is on the unit can be noisy.</li>
            <li> I have had many electric razors throgh the years and I really love this one. It shaves so close and I really like the self cleaning feature. I have been eyeing the panasonic for a couple years and now at this price I could&#x27;nt pass it up. Get it.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of shavers over the years. All of them have been wet/dry, because shaving with a wet beard gives a much closer shave. And almost all of them have been Panasonic, because they carry a broad line of wet/dry shavers. I have been satisfied with all of them, but buying this Vortex was the first time that purchase price was not my primary consideration. And I can honestly say that this is by far the best shaver that I have ever used.     First, even when I have skipped a couple of days of of shaving, and my beard is really rough, this shaver does its job smoothly, quietly, and effortlessly. And it gives a great shave every time. It also has some bells and whistles, like a digital readout of the remaining battery life, so you never have to worry about your shaver quitting on you in the middle of the job. And the Vortex&#x27;s cleaning system allows you to easily clean your shaver and make sure that it stays that way. I haven&#x27;t owned it very long, but I am hoping that using this system regularly will prolong its life. Here&#x27;s the bottom line: sometimes it is worth paying more money than you are accustomed to, and this is definitely one of those times.</li>
            <li> I bought this about a month ago. My first real electric shaver and it works amazingly, that whole 30 days to adjust is true so tough it out. The whole cleaning thing is a bit much, i just wash it once a week with liquid soap, and after every shave with water and it works fine. The battery life is about a week if used every day. Charges super quick. I paid a little over 100 and it was worth every pennie. One thing i am worried about, was the beard trimmer, i was using it once, and i must have opened it the wrong way because it detached from the moving mechanizer thingy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mainly a blade guy and have tried other electric shavers in the past. This is the first electric shaver in 6 years that I have tried. It works, others have left stray hairs and stubble, The first shave took longer than the average 3 minutes, but produced a great shaving experience. This is a first impression and it is a good one. Looking forward to shaving without water and soap and getting my face conditioned for this wonderful shaver.</li>
            <li> I always told myself I would never buy a electric razor because they are soo expensive, when I found this razor on a lightning deal for $60 on amazon, I gave it a try, I got tired of razor burn from the razor blades from gillete, so I finally got this panasonic razor and OH MY GOODNESS!!!! I am never going back to a regular razor blade ever again, this razor left my face soo smooth, and I don&#x27;t get the razor burn from it either, I tried it both dry shave and wet shave and the wet shave is much better and leaves your face more smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;you can use it dry or wet when shaving&lt;br /&gt;has a automatic Cleansing System&lt;br /&gt;less razor burn compared to non-electric razors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;the cleansing system cartridges only last a month even when you don&#x27;t clean the blades every day&lt;br /&gt;the replacement blades are pricey for one&lt;br /&gt;the cord for the auto cleanser is way too long(in my opinion)&lt;br /&gt;the razor is pretty loud&lt;br /&gt;and the cleansing system is loud too so you must remember to start it in the morning before going to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other then that I do love this razor for being my first electric razor, I hope this last me a long time.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shaver EVER!   I just had bought two others to replace my Remington that I had for a few years.  There is no comparison to the Panasonic!   You really do have to try this shaver!  I am totally in love with this.  Easy to use....easy to clean and the BEST BEST shave I have ever received.  I know I sound like a fake commercial but honestly I speak the truth.</li>
            <li> The outer foil on the shaver had a hole and was unusable after 33 days! The parts pamphlet prices a replacement at $29.99! Crazy  It was a gift as I gave up on getting a decent shave with a electric razor years ago.  It is slower, more expensive and doesn&#x27;t give a decent shave unless you go over your beard several times.      Don&#x27;t waste your money - go buy ST2 Sensitive for Men 12 ct for $6.58 at WalMart!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this razor hoping for a solution to my irritable and sensitive skin. No beuno. It cuts very awkwardly and I had a really hard time getting a clean shave with it.. not to mention my face was redder than ever before. I tried it for 30 days (as you&#x27;re supposed to do with any new shaving treatment before judging) and it never got better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my dad ended up buying it off me and he loves it... go figure haha.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old Norelco circular-blade razor with this one from Panasonic. If you&#x27;re used to the circular blades, this razor is going to require some adjustment to your routine because it won&#x27;t cut any hairs growing perpendicular to the direction of the blades. Shaving the neck becomes a slow process as you must pull the skin tight and hold the razor at a variety of angles in order to get it all.    The self-cleaning system is definitely worth it -- very convenient and doesn&#x27;t clog often, although you really do have to replace the cleaning carterage every month.</li>
            <li> I am a consistent user of this product.  Its WELL worth the money.  I Googled the best electric shavers, and this one was on the list.  STOP YOUR SEARCH HERE.  This is the real deal.  Happy Shaving!</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my friend who has a thick beard because of his middle eastern roots and this razor just didn&#x27;t do the trick. If you have really thick hair I would save your money till you can buy a more expensive electric razor that may actually cut through your manly beard :)&lt;br /&gt;I had to return this item and pay return shipping for it so unless you&#x27;re sure this razor will work for you, I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought my last Panasonic razor 15 years ago, and it worked well for all that time. But I decided it was time to replace it and bought what I thought would be the latest upgrade. I did not actually want the HydraClean feature--I think that&#x27;s mostly a gimmick to get you to continuously buy the associated replacement parts, and in any case I was able to clean my last razor simply by using the little brush that came with it. I just wanted a new, and potentially better, version of what I already had. This unfortunately isn&#x27;t it. The shave is almost as good but not quite. It also has an annoying indicator light that flashes frantically when it is fully charged, as though I should be excited about that information and take some action. Note to manufacturers: It&#x27;s great to have an indicator light to tell you something is charging, or that it is fully charged, or that there is some kind of problem that requires an action. But, particularly with regard to charging, there is absolutely no reason to have it flash, and since people typically leave their razor in the bathroom, where they may need to go in the middle of the night, a flashing light is actually an annoyance as it tends to wake one up. Overall, this is still a perfectly adequate razor and I will be using it for the next fifteen years in all likelihood. I will probably just break the indicator light. Although they don&#x27;t tell you this anywhere, you can just ignore the HydraClean thing, as I plan to. I will say that the shaver fits very nicely into one&#x27;s hand, and being a Panasonic, will probably be fairly trouble-free.</li>
            <li> Battery lasted just long enough for the guarantee period to run out. Stopped using these a few years ago. Went back to multiple blade razors and have been a lot happier.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000VKZMHK Panasonic ES8109S Vortex Wet/Dry Shaver with Nano Technology and HydraClean System]]    For it&#x27;s price, this shaver is a bargin and a half.  Change the cleaning solution monthly, using purified water, not tap, and this shaver will provide months and months of smooth, close shaves.</li>
            <li> Smooth quick shave. I need to find a cheaper cleaning cartridge though[[ASIN:B000VKZMHK Panasonic ES8109S Vortex Wet/Dry Shaver with Nano Technology and HydraClean System]]</li>
            <li> I have to use an electric unless I want to see blood.  Closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric.  Easiest way for me to tell is at the end of the workday, less 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  My beard is tough, medium density; it grows rapidly and it&#x27;s grey so less is better and it is noticeably less with this shaver.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to go to a business diner without a second shave after using this, not the case with the brand X I tossed after using the Panasonic.    I wanted to try a shaver with a \\&quot;cleaning system.\\&quot;  An electric razor is useless after about a week unless it&#x27;s disassembled and thoroughly cleaned.  Takes 15 - 20 minutes to do it right and it&#x27;s nuisance. But I refuse to pay $200 to $300 for an electric razor when I know the battery will die in a year or so.  I typically pay $60 for an electric razor but the reviews on this and Panasonic&#x27;s reputation prompted me to go \\&quot;upscale.\\&quot;  Good decision.     Pros: Close shave, nice battery state indicator, relatively quiet, trimmer only runs when it&#x27;s in the up position, center blades knock down the long stuff.  Rinses out so cleanly with just the faucet, I&#x27;m not sure it really needs the cleaning system but that works well too.  The floating head is probably nice for some people: I don&#x27;t care for it so it has a locking feature to disable the float. I get a minimum of 10 days between charges. Optionally recharges with just the cord; good for extended travel.    Cons: takes just a little longer to get a close shave and works better if I move the shaver slowly over stretched skin.  Cleaning system is a little bulky so you wouldn&#x27;t travel with it but as above, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s needed. I actually keep the cleaning system in my workshop and only the razor in the bathroom.      I&#x27;m sure it works if you want to shave in the shower; where I live the cost of water would make that a luxury I don&#x27;t chose to afford so haven&#x27;t tried that.    Update:  after seven months, I bought a second one for travel, makes sense for me.  ANDI discarded the Panasonic cleaning system.  It tends to leave the shaver with an unpleasant smell and the second unit came with an insert that recommended just a drop of dishwashing soap inside the head, put the head back on and run it briefly in turbo mode and rinse.  Takes maybe 15 seconds and it&#x27;s clean and fresh.  Easier, cheaper, faster and less bulky than the factory cleaning system.</li>
            <li> My last electric shaver was a braun shaver that I purchased refurbished about 5 years ago. That worked well enough for every day shaves, but once I replaced the foil a few times, I decided to return to razor shaving. Fast forward to a few weeks ago, I purchased this shaver based on the high reviews on Amazon.     Bottom line, this thing stinks. It doesn&#x27;t shave closely, leaves patches despite multiple run throughs, and where it does shave closely (neck area) it inflames the skin and becomes uncomfortable for the rest of the morning. I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin. I purchased lectric shave and even followed the advice of some users to take a hot shower, apply the alcohol based solution to my skin, and then shave. It ran smoother against my skin, but the results remained the same.     I&#x27;m left with a $100 paperweight. I think I&#x27;m going to buy a new foil for my 7 year old braun and just start using that again. This is a pathetic shaver.</li>
            <li> Wow!- I&#x27;ve never used an electric razor before, and this product has got me off of blades forever, I think.  I&#x27;ve only had it a couple of weeks, but each time I take a shave in the shower (without a mirror), I&#x27;m amazed at how close a shave I get.  It takes a little time to get it just right, but I&#x27;m in the shower and don&#x27;t mind having the water pouring over me as I get my shave on.  The cleaner is pretty cool too, although it takes an hour to do the job.  I&#x27;m O.K. with that- I don&#x27;t anticipate needing to shave for at least another twenty four hours.  Sometimes there are a few errant hairs on my neck; that&#x27;s the toughest place to shave for me, but no razor burn and a baby smooth face- I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many electric razors before. This one does a very average job, at best, providing a close shave. It takes me many swipes in different directions to shave an area acceptably. It&#x27;s a bit disappointing. You can get the same quality of shave in many cheaper razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the cleaning tank of this unit is very gimmicky and I don&#x27;t use it at all. The thing stays on a long time unnecessarily and I don&#x27;t believe it really does much cleaning of the head at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better to just run water over the head from the faucet, dry it with a towel and call it a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only really good thing I can say is its charger works well and the razor holds a long charge, but considering one needs to stroke an area many times to shave it in the first place, the razor needs the extra charge life - lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor considering its price, the uselessness of the cleaning tank and its shaving ability.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 stars and I&#x27;m being generous.</li>
            <li> I have owned my first and last Panasonic shaver.  After only six months the recharger completely failed, remaining filled with water with the operating lights going out permanently.  The \\&quot;service\\&quot; department requires that you send in the whole system for a remedy, and hangs up on you when you question the wisdom of that course of action.  I would not recommend this product at all and only gave it one star because this review system requires it.</li>
            <li> i used this shaver for almost 2 months, twice as long as panasonic recommended for your face to \\&quot;get used to it.\\&quot;  does a decent job on the face, routinely misses neck hairs, leaves stray hairs on the neck.  not a good shaver, back to the blade for this face.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price of the product, I mean if you add up how much it will cost you to use disposable razors or whatever you use you will realize that this price equals out to about the same cost as a years worth of disposable razors.     This product is eco friendly because you don&#x27;t have to keep throwing razors in the trash and wasting plastic etc.     I would however NOT recommend using it in the shower. The reason for this is because no product ever will be good to use in a vast amount of water. All products will get corrosion and it&#x27;s impossible to say it wont. I never use it in my shower and never will because you will have to replace it after at least 6 months, not because its made poorly because its not made poorly but because it is electronic.    Purchase this product and never feel the need to touch a disposable razor again!!</li>
            <li> Excellent overall shaver -- works very well as a wet shaver in the shower. I  used a Braun (the model in the cradle that cleans itself) for many years and liked it as well, but I like this Panasonic better -- and I like its smaller cradle and cleaning mechanism better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous electric shavers, including the really excellent high end Braun shavers. My guess is that different shavers will suit different beards/faces, and for some the Braun may be best.  The bottom line is that this shaver is the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric shaver - meaningfully closer on my face than even the Bruan.  The Braun is an extremely high quality machine, shaves very fast, the battery is amazing,  and the trimmer is better than on this one, but the Panasonic beats it for closest shave (on my beard), and really cuts as close as a manual razor, but without the nicks and irritation of a manual shave.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I finally got tired of messing around with safety razors and splurged on an electric razor.   I am VERY pleased with both the shave quality and LOVE the automatic cleaning function   with this razor. I couldn&#x27;t be any happier with my purchase.</li>
            <li> So I have always been skeptical of electric razors. I have owned the a couple Norelcos including their \\&quot;top of the line\\&quot; [[ASIN:B000PKKAGO Philips Norelco arcitec 1090 Men&#x27;s Shaving System]] and always found them lacking. They would leave a lot of hair still on my face. So I switched over to a [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]] and it is great but shaving with it takes a while because you have to be careful not to cut yourself. I needed a quick razor to get most of the hair before I had to head out to work.    Enter the Panasonic ES8109S. After reading the reviews I figured $100 wasn&#x27;t a bad price for supposedly such a good razor (and cleaning system). Turns out the reviews are true. This thing is amazing. It cuts really close (even when dry it is comparable to a disposable manual razor) and is much quicker than my safety razor (though I will probably still use my Merkur on weekends when I have more time). I would definitely suggest this to anyone thinking about an electric razor.     Also, one of the other reviews said it was really loud but I don&#x27;t find it much louded than any other electric that I have used. I wouldn&#x27;t think people in another room would be bothered by it.     I have only had this razor for a couple of days, so I will update my review as time passes and try more of the functions.</li>
            <li> I have owned Braun shavers for years and have been very happy with them.  When it was time to replace my old shaver I wanted to try something that did not require ongoing purchases of cleaning cartridges which were adding up with the Braun after several years.  So I tried a rotary and hated it, within 3 months I was looking for something better.    I had always thought of trying the Panasonic as they&#x27;re products are usually pretty good from my experience.  This shaver is no exception, it is the best shaver I have owned.  Being able to use it wet is a great feature - the shave is very close and does not irritate your skin.  The price for the Panasonic has always been fairly high but this is a great deal and well worth it.    the cartridges are not cheap but they seem to last a long time because they are not alcohol based.  The cartridges contain a soap that mixes with water you put into another canister.  I run the clean cycle after every use and the first cartridge is still in use after a month or so.  I do pre-rinse after every use before putting it in the cleaner.    Battery life is pretty good.  I have not travelled with it yet but expect you could get at least 5 days of use without a recharge probably 7 or 8 days.</li>
            <li> I have tried to use an electric shaver many times over the years but have never really been satisfied with the shave.  I ordered this and did not shave for 5 days until I received it. It shaved me better than a blade the first time I used it with 5 days of beard. I think it is the 3 blade system, but whatever it is its great.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace my 10yr(+/-) old Panasonic Linear shaver.  I don&#x27;t think it was an improvement over the old shaver, in spite of the old one having a 5 year old foil/cutter assembly.  I do like the waterproof design of the Panasonic shavers, but not the fact that you have to use them wet to get the most out of them.    Since I was looking for an improvement, I returned the shaver.  Amazon was excellent to deal with on the return.  I have since ordered and received a Braun Pulsonic, and things are looking up.</li>
            <li> I used it in the shower this morning. It felt REALLY SMOOTH while shaving, no sensation of burn whatsoever. The shave is pretty good, especially for an electric, but does not compare to the MACH system I was using for quite sometime, or even cheap 3-blade disposable razors for that matter. After the shave, it feels like I would say 6-8 hours after a shave with a blade. With a blade, going up against the beard leaves no noise with rubbing your hand against your face.  After using this unit, I still have that tiny feeling of hair, and the noise.  I think this unit is good for someone who needs to shave everyday. I usually shave 3 times per week on average.  I am debating on keeping the unit.</li>
            <li> I had to write a review on behalf of this razor and all the buyers out there. I spent several days reading reviews on razors and I was trying to decide between this one and the &gt;$200 braun&#x27;s. I got an \\&quot;epiphany\\&quot; and decided to give panasonic a try. This is my third razor. What I used to do with the other two is within the week use the electric razor and during the weekend/going out with girlfriend or special events use the regular razor(mach 3).  no need to do that with this one; Its powerful, very close shave even on dry skin.  Completely recommended, no down side yet 2 months out. Price is good compared to the other one.</li>
            <li> First a liitle background, I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in 10 years and always shaved with a razor.  I don&#x27;t have to be as close shaved as I used to and have been lazy about shaving I thought an electric would get me to trim back the stubble a little more.  Having said that...  This thing shaves incredibly close, very sleek and comfortable to use.  I generally like it.  The only drawbacks I have encountered is being that my wife and I are on opposite schedules it seems a little on the loud side and forget about using the cleaning mode if you want to keep it quiet.  It seems to take a long time and is very noisy as it goes through its cycles, but i don&#x27;t clean it all the time and just wait until everyone is up or out of the house when I do use that mode.  Last but not least, neck hairs seem to be a problem for it requiring mulitple passes.  if it was a little quieter and didn&#x27;t need so many passes over the same problem areas I would give it 5 stars because it really does shave close.</li>
            <li> I bought my husband this shaver after seeing how much time and money he was spending on the Mach 3 blades. His old shaver had run it&#x27;s course a while ago and he had gotten used to using the disposable blades. Time to teach an old dog new tricks! Hesitant at first, I told him the reviews were very good and asked him to try it. Now he uses it every day...works well with his sensitive skin and it&#x27;s quick and easy. He said it&#x27;s the closest shave he&#x27;s gotten with an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly in the shower and is very easy to clean without using the base - just turn it on the fast mode and hold it under running water.  The only problems are battery life (the manual says 2 weeks, but it only lasts one/seven shaves) and the fact that you can&#x27;t shave while the battery is charging.</li>
            <li> It is cordless and the battery works just fine. It has a cleaning mechanism that is only about twice as bothersome as cleaning the razor by hand. It shaves reasonably well if you have a lot of time to waste going over and over those neck hairs that seem to evade the cutters. Speaking of the cutters and the screens, they become quite warm before I am finished shaving which leads me to believe that there is friction and that the very thin screens are not likely to last very long. For this reason I decided to buy replacement screens, but in Amazon&#x27;s many pages of Panasonic razor stuff I find screens for dozens of different razors, but alas, none for this model. This is annoying because it makes me feel the razor is now just that much more lacking. In a way, not getting replacement parts will undoubtedly cause me to the sensible thing; i.e., chuck it and buy another Norelco.</li>
            <li> I had a previous version of this shaver, but after 3 years of shaving exclusively under the shower, it seemed that there was a leak in the electronics and the display no longer worked.  Recently, it didn&#x27;t charge at all. Since I wanted a similar shaver I found the ES8109S.  It works great and is a little bit quieter than the previous model.  I use a &#x27;Pre-shave&#x27; lotion  and shave under the water.  Never had a razor burn or other.  Recommend it strongly. Shaves pretty close.</li>
            <li> Hint:  If you skip a couple days, try a blotting motion to pre-cut the longer growth.  Its like loading a tree branch into a wood-chipper!&lt;br /&gt;Rich, Naperville, IL</li>
            <li> This is the best overall electric razor I have ever owned.  I have had Norelco and Remington before and I have been using a Norelco wet/dry shaver in the shower for the past three years.  For those who are not used to it shaving in the shower can take some adjustment.  The difference between Norelco and Panasonic was immediate.  Closer shave, less irritation.  I&#x27;m sold on Panasonic.  I no longer need to keep a blade razor for trimming and touch up.  This unit does it all.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this razor.  It shaves close, and doesn&#x27;t pinch like my old rotary shaver, and it shaves faster and closer than it&#x27;s replacement.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not as close a shave as my father&#x27;s straight razor, but then again I would sever my jugular if I used a straight razor.  Overall pleased.</li>
            <li> I tried a rotary and it didnt work very well so i pick this up because of its popularity and rating. Very please with my purchase and would definitely buy another as a replacement.     Using for about 2 months now, almost daily. Battery goes a  over a week (if i used till 0%, i usually recharge at 20% or so)    Product is popular for a reason.!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, especially around my mustache, goatee, and neck, and I hate shaving. Over the years, I came to use a rotary electric shaver around the facial hair, and a razor for the rest of my face. However, the razor always irritated my skin. I decided to buy this wet/dry shaver, and I finally found what I have been looking for.    I use it with shaving cream, and now I can shave my whole face. Sometimes it irritates my skin a little, but nothing like the before. I will experiment with a shaving oil also. This is a very good shaver. I use the cleaning system everyday, and it is great. All in all, this is one of the best things I have every done for my face.    The shave obviously is not as close as a razor, but it is very good - if you take the time to feel for rough spots. I just wet my hand and feel around.     I no longer dread shaving in the morning.    Update: I tried a shaving oil for the last three days, American Crew, and it is even better than shaving gel. I can see all the wiskers, and my face feels great after shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric razors for over 40 years.  I&#x27;ve only had this one for a month or so but it is by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever had.  It gives a very close shave very quickly.</li>
            <li> Shaver does not seem to provide close shave. Have used several other shavers that seem betterr than this model.  I would not recommend this product to anyone else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Braun owner for the last 15 years and finally had enough with their poor quality (cleaning bases dying every 8 months at $60 a pop, side burn trimmers breaking, etc.  Read all the good things everyone has to say about Panasonic and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  Using shaving cream, I can say is wow, this is just as close as a razor and so much better than Braun.  Another plus is the cleaning fluid is water, not solvent based, so it doesn&#x27;t disappear just sitting there. The cartridges are a lot less expense to boot.  Bye bye, Braun.</li>
            <li> I went from a rotary to this shaver and have been very happy. It is gentle on the skin, but cuts close and the cleaning system is nice to have.(I almost didn&#x27;t get the cleaner)It also seems to cut the ever problematical chin whiskers easier than the rotary.</li>
            <li> I have using Norelcos almost all my shaving life.  Never again! This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used at the most reasonable price for a shaver of the quality of the Panasonic.  In my opinion it does its best as a wet shaver.</li>
            <li> Best shaver I ever bought. Smooth, so smooth. No tugging at hairs at all, it&#x27;s quiet, and the auto clean works great. I would highly recomend buying this razor. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good electric razor.  The pros: 1) it holds a charge for a long time 2) the self cleaning system is easy, but you can just as easily run it under the faucet and 3) easy to hold.  The cons: 1) if you&#x27;ve let your beard get a little long (talking a couple of days here) it will definitely miss more than a few hairs.  Not a huge surprise.  Overall I would say for the price, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for over 5 years now.  I replace the blades every 5-6 months and it still works great.</li>
            <li> I have owned this unit for a year.  Prior to owning this Panasonic I had a Remington rotary shaver.  Here are the PROS:  - It shaves even the longest 7-day growth without pulling or hurting.  - You can take it in the shower &amp; its easy to wash and clean.  - It has a neat cleaner machine that will thoroughly clean the unit for you.  CONS:  - You cannot use it while charging it at the same time (sorry, for those of you who forget to charge until the last minute...although it does charge fairly quickly).  - The cleaner unit requires $10-13 &#x27;recharge&#x27; units every three months or so, which are basically new soap cartridges.  It&#x27;s kind of like the ink cartridge for the printer, except in this case everyone DOES have soap lying around--Panasonic could have easily made this an environmentally friendly mechanism whereby one uses common household soap to refill the cleaning machine; but, they were more concerned about profits in my opinion.  - My worst qualm of all is this: my beard hair is bristly and each hair very thick.  On my neck the beard hairs tend to grow flat, instead of outward.  For some reason this $100+ shaver is practically useless when it comes to my type of hair.  It requires 4 to 5 passes over the same area to clear these thick, flat laying hairs.  I tried to give the unit to my brother who, after testing it, thanked me for the generosity but insisted on sticking with old school razors.  I never had this problem with the rotary blades on my Remington.  My next shaver will have rotary action.  Good luck to the thick bearded!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re an intelligent shopper you&#x27;re doing some research comparing different shavers and brands.  You probably read all of the bad reviews of the new Norelco shavers, and now you&#x27;re probably between two shavers:  the Panasonic ES8109S, and the Braun Pulsonic 7 series.    They&#x27;re both great shavers, and in the end you&#x27;ll be pretty happy with both.  But the Panasonic has several key advantages for you to consider...    1)  Braun&#x27;s \\&quot;superior\\&quot; pulsonic technology makes 10,000 strokes.  Panasonic&#x27;s makes 13,000, for shaving, and a blistering 17,000 for cleaning purposes.  2)  Braun&#x27;s retail price is over twice that of Panasonic&#x27;s.  3)  Braun&#x27;s shaver CANNOT be used in the shower.  The 8109S can.  In fact, it&#x27;s fully immersible, if you feel like shaving underwater! :p  4)  Braun&#x27;s foil is straight, with a flexible head.  The Panasonic&#x27;s head is also flexible, but has a convex foil, which makes shaving under the neck much easier.  5)  Both have a nifty cleaning mechanism for their shavers.  To the best of my knowledge, the only way the Braun dries the shaver is with a heating element.  The Panasonic not only dries your shaver with heat, but also a fan to really air it out.  My shaver is bone dry once the drying cycle is over.  Also, the cleaning solution for the Panasonic is alcohol-free, which prevents breakdown of plastics and water seals.      ...  I&#x27;ve owned three Norelco wet/dry shavers, and this is my third Panasonic.  I gave the offering from Braun a hard look, but already knowing what kind of quality to expect from Panasonic for half the price, I decided shelling out crazy money for the Pulsonic just wasn&#x27;t worth it.  In the end, I not only saved money, but got my hands on a real gem of a shaver:  easily the best I&#x27;ve ever owned, and the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  I highly recommend using this shaver with a glycerin-based shaving gel, such as those by Gilette or Nivea with MicroTec.  Hands down, the closest shave you&#x27;ll ever get in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> Panasonic has a winner with this shaver.  Have owned a series of Panasonic electric shavers over the years and this is the best one ever. The shave is smooth and quick. The recharge is very quick.  If you run out of charge, 10 minutes in the charger will do enough to give a full shave.  The new motor is far less noisy than the older models--you do not need ear protection anymore!    The charge indicator is now in percent and is very accurate--no more LED lights that tell you nothing.  The cleaner function looks interesting but I have not used it yet. I usually just rinse the shaver using the hot water from the tap and sometimes remove the shaver head cover to rinse inside. I always use shaving lather and it seems to help since it lubricates the skin of the face and makes the shaver slide easier.    If you like an electric shaver, this is a good (though a bit expensive) choice.</li>
            <li> I could write a lot about the razor but let be simplify it to say, it does not irritate my face any more than my Gillette Mach 5 razor and it cuts as close.  There is a \\&quot;break in period\\&quot; which I would attribute to learning how to shave with an electric razor more than your face learning how to be shaved.  The cleaning station is pretty quite; however, do not start the cleaning cycle and leave the room while your wife is sleeping in the next room.  The razor will periodically pulse which while it is not loud it is rather disturbing to hear (or so I am told).</li>
            <li> Okay, so I just got this thing around 2 months ago, and it was the first time in my life, I have bought a really nice shaver for myself that was over 40.00. I was so excited... Especially reading all of the amazing reviews on this product.     I am dead serious, this product is absolute junk! It will literally RAVAGE and CUT your face and skin, it does NOT get all the hairs, it has an especially hard time on the adams apple. Its just absolutely terrible, I&#x27;ve tried using it in water, dry, with soap, with shaving cream, etc. etc. This thing is seriously the worst, I thought it might get better after a couple of weeks, but it HASN&#x27;T in fact its gotten even worse...    I am in no way kidding with you, and am in fact being very honest, when i say, this shaver will CUT your SKIN BADLY. I wish I could take pictures of myself, and show you what this product has done to my skin.     I am very very disappointed and upset with my purchase. I only wish I could return it, but that&#x27;s the risk you take buying off of amazon...    Update on this shaver - I have had it for about 4 months now (not having enough money to buy another) I have tried and tried to see what other \\&quot;Reviewers\\&quot; on here have said. Its no longer cutting my skin - but it takes around 30 minutes (not exaggerating) to shave your entire face compared to my old Norelco shaver from Walgreens which took around 5 minutes. Although admittedly it gets a closer cut, I don&#x27;t see it being worth the extra 25 minutes it takes to shave.</li>
            <li> I have no doubt that the Panasonic ES8109S Vortex Wet/Dry Shaver with Nano Technology and HydraClean System is a fine product however I seem to be one of these people who can only get a proper shave using the old low-tech razor.</li>
            <li> I have owned all brands of shavers/razors, and I have to say Braun is NOT worth the money. Not only do they not shave very well, they fall apart within a years time. Even a new blade doesn&#x27;t help. For the price you pay for those I would have expected more. Now the Panasonic is a razor I can recommend. While they also wear out quicker then I hoped, they do last longer then a year and cost half as much as other brands. But what is more important then stability...does it work? Absolutely! This is my second Panasonic, and I am never going back to another brand. They are affordable and work better then the more expensive brands. The cleaning units us a dry detergent pack with normal tap water. Other brands like Braun use a liquid detergent pack, which is easy to spill, and takes up WAY to much room in a closet or drawer. Not to mention they are harsh and can actually burn your skin or remove the coating on your sink. Why would you put that on your face? Panasonic&#x27;s cleaning detergent is small, simple, and safe. Some customers complain of the cleaning unit being very load.  This model is much quiter then other Panasonic models and way cleaner then Braun or other brands.  If you close the bathroom door you won&#x27;t even hear it. Get this Panasonic and enjoy what shaving is suppose to be like! And if you don&#x27;t like it, atleast you didn&#x27;t drop $200 - $300 on one of the other brands.</li>
            <li> I have used a few electric razor, but always found my way back to Fusion, Mach 3etc. I may stick with this one. Takes time to retrain to an electric but results are promising!   The features and the price make it a winner.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shaver that is very versatile. This is from someone who has tried a variety of shavers including Braun, Philips, etc. Most important, it is portable, easy to clean and shaves better than all the others I have used.   JR</li>
            <li> It is very nice, but the display died after a few months.&lt;br /&gt;After one year it shaves me every morning as it was the first time.&lt;br /&gt;It is a MUST using the cleaner at least once each couple of weeks and changing the soap cartdrige each 3 months at least.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic shaver is absolutely amazing. It does everything they say it will, and then some. I highly recommend this product.  Ray D.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Braun foil, and my last one was a triple headed Norelco.  This beats them all.  The Braun was a joke, would not cut a beard more than a day old, wouldn&#x27;t cut the long hairs at all, and never did a good job.  The Norelco would shave a 2 day old beard, but not real close (It worked fine out of the box, but replacement blades never seem to be near as good).  Very easy to clean, holds a charge nice, and does a good job shaving.  ANY electric will struggle with neck hairs under your chin, but this one will get them with a few passes.  It&#x27;s a little noisier than then Norelco, but not that bad- hums more than buzzes.  No matter what anyone says, an electric will never shave as close as a blade, but this one does the best job of any electric I&#x27;ve had over the years.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews, which were stellar. However, it&#x27;s not. As some others have noted, these razors die. They are not sealed well for \\&quot;wet\\&quot; work and water gets in the battery compartment, killing the razor. Signs this is happeing to you include weird display issues. I bought another razor after about a year (only the razor, since I have a base) and the razors sold seperately don&#x27;t include the connections to charge and clean from the cleaning base. While this razor still works, it is loaded with mildew in the cracks and creavases which the old razor wasn&#x27;t.  I assume this is from the base not being able to clean it properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it did shave my sensitive face well and with little irritation. Good if you don&#x27;t mind replacing every 12 months or less. Panasonic won&#x27;t get me a 3rd time. When I get a new razor both of these and the base are in the trash.</li>
            <li> Went from 6 year old Braun to this and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Very little razor burn and the time it takes for me to shave has been cut in half, even when shaving after a week or 10 days.  Used to take 15-20 minutes to shave with the Braun and now it takes a little over 10 minutes for the same kind of shave.  This trimmer gets even closer than the Braun, and I have had very little razor burn (the Braun was bad).  Wish I hadn&#x27;t put off this purchase for so long.  I actually like shaving again!  My only complaint about it is the cheap travel bag.  My old Braun pouch will work with this razor and power supply though...</li>
            <li> I use mine for head shaving in the shower.  It&#x27;s not as close as a blade, but I can also touch up afterwards.  Quality product from a quality name.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this shaver for 2 weeks so far but I&#x27;m extremely happy with it. The main thing about it is that it does not tug and scrape on my face and so I don&#x27;t feel all beat up after my shave. I have only used it in the shower and I use a shaving oil and it all works very well.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had this panasonic shaver for a few years now, and i hate the darn thing.  i bought it because i get razor-burn very badly when i shave my legs with a traditional razor, and i wanted something that was durable and effective and would give me a close shave wet or dry without leaving my skin in tatters. i read all the reviews and finally chose this one.  well, on the plus side, this shaver doesn&#x27;t give me any razor burn and i can use it in the shower, the tub, or in front of the TV.  it charges fast and cleans easily, and i really like the drying mechanism (though it is a bit noisy and slow).  but unfortunately, it takes me at least 5X as long to shave my legs with this shaver, because it just doesn&#x27;t get the job done efficiently.  when i finally do get a good shave with this, it is a clean, close shave, but it takes forever.  i have to make several passes, it doesn&#x27;t cut most of the hairs, and i have to adjust the angles ad infinitum.  and believe me when i say that my leg hairs are not nearly as dense at those on a man&#x27;s face.  if i have this much trouble getting a clean shave on a long, smooth, taut area of my leg (such as the area right next to my shin bone), i would hate to see how poorly it performs on the curves of a man&#x27;s face or the underside of the neck/chin.    i have seen mixed reviews of this shaver, and while it may work for some, it doesn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this wet/dry shaver, and I&#x27;ve never had such a close shave with any other tool.  My wife has remarked more than a few times how close my shave is and how effective the product has worked.  I also like the clippers that it comes built-in with, allowing me trim my burns in one quick shot.  Overall a great product.  I&#x27;ll stand behind this again and again.</li>
            <li> I have been wet shaving for the past 25 years, and have only tried two electric razors, which were very uncomfortable for my face. I have very sensitive skin and a thin build, so it is hard for an electric razor to shave my chin and neck.    The Panasonic Vortex solves both of these problems with a little bit of difficulty on the later. The razor has a little difficulty under my chin on my upper neck, so I normally wet shave this area, which seems to always have a few hairs that escape the Vortex, about once every three days. This also keeps any ingrowns from forming in that area. I believe this issue is more personal and wouldn&#x27;t let it affect the review.    The Vortex is easy to clean under the faucet, but it also comes with a charging/cleaning base, which works very well. The razor will alert you when it needs cleaning or charging with a small screen.</li>
            <li> This shaver is simply increadible.  I have never been happy with an electric shaver until now.  It shaves close and fast, with no irritation....even when using it dry.  It does everything it the description says.  I, like many others here, have used all major brands, but Panasonic has set a new standard....the others have a lot of catching up to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with this for about a month now and while I won&#x27;t go so far as to say that this product has changed my life, it is exactly what I was looking for- a good quick shave. Now I have more time in the morning to spend with my kid, and that is a good thing.  I also like that it cleans itself.    As far as performance goes, it is just as good as the blade I was using for the past several years. This is my first experience with a foil shaver-- I had used a rotary shaver while in college but switched to the blade as my whiskers thickened up and the rotors pulled them out. Maybe I wasn&#x27;t using it right, I don&#x27;t know. Anyway, I&#x27;ve had no problems at all with this.</li>
            <li> After reading most of the amazon reviews, I decided to buy this razor and was rather disappointed. Like one other reviewer, I have to go over the same spot several times to get a close shave. My 3 year old Norelco shaves closer even with the original blades. The cleaning station is a plus but I wish that I had purchased the equivalent Norelco model. For my money, Norelco is superior!</li>
            <li> I have always had a Braun shaver, but the Panasonic was much faster, quiet, great side burn trimmer and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I have been a blade user forever and I&#x27;ve spent my life in uniform; Marines, police, etc.  So I&#x27;m used to shaving to inspection standards.  I thought I&#x27;d try an electric because recently my face has been getting very irritated and breaking out after shaving with a blade.  Maybe my skin is changing with age, not sure.  I&#x27;ve used an electric in the past for occasional rare quick jobs, but never more than a few times a year.  After a ton of online research I bought the Panasonic ES8109S.  I&#x27;ve been using it now daily for a week.  I have to say, I am VERY impressed with this shaver.  The first use resulted in a decent shave but nothing that would pass inspection.  It left a few stragglers on my neck.  The instructions say to give it 30 days as your face adjusts to the new shaving technique.  I figured that was Panasonic&#x27;s way of saying, \\&quot;Electrics don&#x27;t shave as good as a blade, but give it 30 days and you won&#x27;t notice so much.\\&quot;  They may actually be right on this one.  The shaves now are VERY close with no stragglers left behind.  I&#x27;m not sure if my face is actually getting used to the new way of shaving, like they say, or if maybe I&#x27;m just learning how to use it.  But the end result now is a great shave.  It&#x27;s not as close as a blade shave, but it&#x27;s mighty darn close.  I can easily shave with this, put on my uniform and go in for a shift; something I would have never considered with other electrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comparison is always made between this shaver and the Braun series 7.  I tried the Braun last year for a week; also a very impressive shaver.  But I returned it on Braun&#x27;s money-back program because I just couldn&#x27;t justify the $260 price.  With the Panasonic coming in at the $95-$105 price range I thought it would be worth a shot.  The Panasonic is giving me just as good a shave as the Braun did.  I don&#x27;t think side-by-side you could tell the difference in the end result.  If you&#x27;re debating between the Braun and the Panasonic, don&#x27;t let the prices fool you.The two shavers are every bit equals, with the exception of the Panasonic being less than half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning station works great.  The cycle takes somewhere in the 45-minute range.  Cleaning an electric has always been a pain for me.  Using the little brush has never really gotten a shaver completely clean and it&#x27;s 5 minutes of time I never really wanted to spend.  So I typically cleaned my electrics infrequently.  This cleaning system is a no-brainer.  Drop the shaver back in the station, hit the button and walk away.  The result is a perfectly clean shaver; and I mean just-out-of-the-box clean.  There&#x27;s no reason to skip cleaning a shaver now.  As others have mentioned, the cleaning cycle is a little noisy.  Not terrible, but if your wife is trying to sleep and your bathroom is joined to your bedroom it may be annoying for her.  If you&#x27;re not trying to sleep and just going on about the house you&#x27;ll have no problem with the noise.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with any leaking that a couple reviewers have noted; maybe they&#x27;re just not completely seating the tank or detergent cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great shaver and cleaning system.  Very impressive shave results at a fantastic price point.  Easily a five-star product.</li>
            <li> I had an older Panasonic shaver that I got about 6 years ago that I decided to replace with this shaver.  This shaver is hands down the best shaver that I have ever used, and best of all, it cleans itself!  I would highly recommend this product if you are looking for a good shaver.</li>
            <li> This razor gives me as close a shave as a mach3 but it is faster and costs less to operate. My last model lasted over 6 years and it is still a backup. Vortex wet/dry are outstanding.</li>
            <li> I changed from a rotary  based on reviews, and what a difference! Works great wet or dry.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this electric shaver my face looked like I was slapped by my wife about half a dozen times.  That is to be expected to some degree because that happens with all electric shavers.  I&#x27;ve now had this for almost a month and it works really well and gets almost as close as a blade.  I only use it for dry shaving because when using it wet it doesn&#x27;t seem to get as close to my skin.  The cleaning system works great and the shaver looks new every time.  The time it takes to completely clean,dry and charge is 1 1/2 to 2 hours, not too bad.  Other shavers I&#x27;ve owned are Remington and Norelco which worked well but not as close as this one and cleaning those shavers was a pain.</li>
            <li> I have issues with razor-burn, especially on my neck. I&#x27;ve tried several electric-razors over the years, but typically resort to a standard disposable razor to do the job. I read some other reviews that stated this was a good razor for reducing razor-burn, and they were correct! Of course it&#x27;s not completely gone, but after a few weeks of use, this razor is performing better than my standard disposable razors: I&#x27;m able to shave 5-days/week with minimal irritation!    I would say the only downside of the razor (and probably most/all electric razors), is that it doesn&#x27;t always get the odd hairs that grow in strange directions. After shaving, I occassionally notice a hair or two that just can&#x27;t be gotten by this razor, despite attempts with different angles and direction of use. However, since it&#x27;s only a hair or two, once in a while, I simply pull out a regular disposable razor and do a quick clean-up with no problems.    p.s. I&#x27;ve been using this razor at the sink with a wet face, wet razor, and Edge shaving gel. I&#x27;ve had no issues with the gel, as I&#x27;ve read others complained of it becoming \\&quot;gummy\\&quot; or clogged after use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun electric shavers religiously for the last 20+ years once I determined that they were far superior to the competitors at that time -- Norelco and Remington.  I&#x27;ve had at least 4 different Braun shavers in that time including a AA battery powered travel shaver and the Braun series 7.  Unfortunately, the series 7 died via force majeure mishap (5 year old boy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not wanting to shell out again for another series 7, I settled on this as a cheaper (hopefully almost as effective) alternative... and received it for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOLY MOLY!  This thing shaves so much better and closer and faster and quieter than the Braun, it&#x27;s like a completely different kind of product.  This is by far the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned -- if you&#x27;re judging based on the process of shaving and the end result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimming attachment... meh, could be designed better.  The shave itself?  Awesome, I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second one of these now - the first failed after about nine months when the indicator started to lose segments as if it had water in it, (I always shave in the shower). Unfortunately the replacement is showing the same problem after about the same time. To start with the shave that they give is good using a gel in the shower, but it quickly goes off after a few months and the shaver appears to be susceptible to water getting into the electronics which is completely useless for an advertised wet shaver - don&#x27;t waste your money on this expensive Chinese made rubbish.</li>
            <li> I have owned this shaver for three years now, and I used it almost every day (I have missed maybe 45 total days of use during that time).  It has held up incredibly well during that time and heavy use, and the battery shows no sign of quitting. I have replaced the blades only once, as the cleaning/charging stand keeps the head in good repair.&lt;br /&gt;I am writing this review now because it has reached the end of its usability, and I will need to replace it. This is not due to the craftsmanship of the shaver; it is due to my own clumsiness.  I knocked it off my dresser about 8 months ago and it landed *just* right so as to break off the flip-out trimmer head. Subsequent drops have loosened the detachable foil and foil housing.  This week, it landed on the foil and bent both the foil and the blades, causing both to be worn through.&lt;br /&gt;My hundred-dollar purchase has paid for itself ten times over in terms of standard shaving paraphernalia and especially razor blades.  I recommend this product to those who are sensitive to standard shaving razors, and want more than full value for their money. Panasonic has earned some brand loyalty with this robust device.  I will be looking for their newer and better products in the coming few days to replace this workhorse.</li>
            <li> I am on my third 8109 shaver and they all shave me close and comfortable.  I like it, but...  All three of my shavers have lost their battery charge display withing a few months. I called once and they replaced it but it was a hassle and I was without a shaver for a week or more.&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed that Panasonic can&#x27;t get this detail right</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a month now and really love it.  The shave is very close and does not irritate my skin like other electric razors.  It maintains its charge for a number of shaves and can be easily cleaned manually, if you dont want to use the automated system.  My best purchase of 2012 so far.</li>
            <li> My old and worn Panasonic Vortex shaver battery died and instead of sending it to California to be fixed, I decided to get a new one.  It is improved and works great</li>
            <li> i used this product for almost 4 weeks... i&#x27;m really surprised how this item have that good reviews... it causes me a lot of irritations, leaves a lot of hair which i ended up using my razor, and it does a really really bad job around the nick. I returned this item and bough the Panasonic ES-LA93-K and have it for five days now and it&#x27;s HUGE different between the two. i recommend you buy the LA93 instead of this one.</li>
            <li> Not a smooth shave. I had to Redgrave over my areas in order to get it done, then it was just raw by that point.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver 2 months ago on sale ($75) at newegg and I totally agree with the reviews.  The shave was smooth and very close...not as close as a blade of course but much better than the old Braun i was using before.  I do not use the charging station and have no real need for the cleaning function.  I just remove the foil and run it and the head under running water.  This works for me..no fussing over cleaning cartridges.  Charging is quick and easy using the supplied cord.  Great razor even at the retail price but look for it to go on sale which it frequently does.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000VKZMHK Panasonic ES8109S Vortex with Nano Technology and HydraClean Shaving System, Silver]]To set the stage I got the ES8109S about a month ago and I have a light to medium beard.  I have been using electric razors for about 25 years and for many of those years preferred the Norelco triple head razor line as it did not pinch like the foil shaver of those days did. The last three razors I have owned have all been Panasonic. The first was the ES8066 and if I used shaving cream it would shave so close I would get nicked but the save was actually closer than a blade (hard to believe I know but true). When used dry it was as good as a blade. When that one died I purchased an ES8095. I used that one for about three years and I am sorry to say that it fell far short of the performance of my first Panasonic. From day one it just did not give as close a shave. Because of that experience I was prepared to give Braun a try this time but when I went over all the electric razor reviews I could find the Panasonic once again sounded the best. I figured I would give Panasonic one last shot and I am happy to say I was not disappointed. This razor is better in every way than it&#x27;s predecessor. It gives a close, smooth and comfortable shave. It is quiet, well balanced and easy to hold. This is my first razor with a cleaning station and I am amazed every time I use it at how clean the razor is when it finishes it&#x27;s cycle. All in all I am very pleased with this product so far.</li>
            <li> I bought this model after reading a number good reviews about this shaver. I finally put it to test last night and I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the job.     Don&#x27;t get me wrong. The shaver has all the bells and whistles - the fancy base unit, nano technology blades and the nice sturdy shaver etc. Right out of the box I was very impressed with the unit. The thing even charged very quickly. The problem started the moment I turned on the shaver. This is the loudest shaver I have ever used. Now I can live with the noise as long as the shaver gets the job done. The first few strokes and I was impressed with its performance. It did give me nice clean shave on the sides of the face. The moment I started shaving my neck the problem started.     It just couldn&#x27;t shave the parts of my neck. The performance was way worse than even my trimmer. It just can&#x27;t shave the neck. After about 15 minutes of struggle I gave up. My skin got irritated and I had to switch back to my regular gillete fusion. I felt really bad paying so much for it yet completing the job with the razor.    My initial experience was not good but I intend to try one more time before returning the it.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best electric shaver I ever have had.  It shaves my face better than a regular razor.  The results are amazing!  The best part is when I am done, I just put it in the cleaner unit and it takes care of getting it ready for my next use.  Also, I like the large digital display of the power level ... I can read it clearly without my glasses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want the best shave you can get regardless if it&#x27;s electric or not, this is the shaver for you.  You will love it just like I do.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver as replacement of an older Panasonic with linear motor, and I am pleased with the shaver itself. It probably works even better than the old one when it was new, and it weighs less, costs less (made in China), and looks more stylish. The induction charger of the old model has been replaced by a more ordinary one with a small plug, which consumes less space and weight in my suitcase, and which probably saves production costs as well as energy costs (I think it is more efficient than the induction charger). The only feature of the shaver that should be improved is the fold-out trimmer, which is even smaller than its predecessor and doesn&#x27;t look and feel as if it has been designed for frequent use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like is the included cleaning device. I didn&#x27;t expect such an advanced device with a built-in electric dryer etc. Since I am not planning to use it (cleaning by hand may be less fun for some people, but it seems to be more effective and it definitely costs less effort, time, and energy), I could probably have saved a considerable amount of money by selecting one of the Pansonic shavers that come without the cleaning device.</li>
            <li> I have owned several electric shavers over the years, but so far this one is my favorite. It was very well designed, easy to grip and use. Keeping it maintained is very simple, either using the HydraClean system or just regular liquid soap.    I have never used a wet/dry version before, but so far I am enjoying the ability to use it in the shower, it works much better than a dry shave.    Just keep in mind, if this is the first electric shaver for you, it is NOT as close as a razor shave, not even a little bit. It will take a few weeks for it to go a really good job on your face. If you can wait out the two or three weeks, this type of product is for you, otherwise, stick to the razor.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his new shaver.  He needed a shaver that works great in the shower and this was the one.</li>
            <li> This has got to be the worst razor I have ever owned.  I do not have a very tough beard, but just went back to one I used 12 years ago and it gave a better shave.  Noisy, doesn&#x27;t shave, leaves stubble . . . . .. A total waste of money!!</li>
            <li> I HAD A OLDER MODEL OF THE VORTEX AND JUST THOUGHT I WOULD SEE WHAT A NEW MODEL FEELS LIKE!! WHAT THEY SAY ONCE OVER, THEY MEAN IT. I HAD A COUPLE DAYS WORTH OF STUBBLE!! I WANTED TO SEE IF THEY MEANT IT--THEY DID. ONCE OVER AND A LOT QUIETER THEN MY OLDER ONE!! THE CLEANING PROCESS IS QUIETER TOO!! THIS PRODUCT IS WELL WORTH THE MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> Initially, I bought this (1) due to my previous experience with a Panasonic shaver; and (2) the great price on Amazon.     I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about 9 months, and it does a good job. It works especially well (i.e. shaves closer) when using it in the shower with shaving cream. A single charge usually lasts me for about 2 weeks, so I have no complaints there.     My biggest complaint is the cleaner/charger itself. When the unit is charging the shaver, it is loud. If you don&#x27;t believe me, compare the level of noise when in the same room as the shaver is being cleaned to when the cleaner is done. Just don&#x27;t be in the same room as the cleaner as it&#x27;s charging the shaver. I find the noise level too high.     Knowing what I know now, I probably wouldn&#x27;t pay full retail for this shaver. It&#x27;s not worth it. Thankfully on Amazon, it&#x27;s discounted pretty heavily.</li>
            <li> First, a little background on my shaving history.  I started around 14 with my Dad&#x27;s standard rotary electric shaver, which he claimed was all I&#x27;d ever need to get the job done.  In a sense, he was right; the shaver got the job done, but I now know that it takes a truly great product to get the job done WELL.  I dabbled a bit with blade shaving but found it to be impractical and often painful.  It was just not worth the extra effort to achieve a minor improvement in closeness.  So I did what most men do: Take their dad&#x27;s advice and continue on a path of a daily ritual of mediocrity and indifference.  I used to dread waking up knowing that the task lay before me, just wanting to blink my eyes and have it be over.  No longer.  This product truly did change my whole perspective.    Turning on this razor for the first time summoned a response akin to what an aviation engineer must have felt when he heard a jet engine for the first time...wow.  The 13,000 RPM blades emit a futuristic whir that almost say \\&quot;Shave with me, you won&#x27;t be sorry.\\&quot;  And you won&#x27;t.  This was my first experience with a foil shaver so I was a bit dubious about their supposed performance.  However, that soon passed after my first shave.  I have NEVER had a shave as close or as painless.  The combination of the swivel head that contours over your face with the high RPMs of the blade that capture even the toughest hairs make for an extremely close, comfortable shave.  This thing is what George Jetson uses in the morning before he hops in his spaceship...it&#x27;s that good.  After I shaved with it the first time I could not stop running my hands over my face in amazement, and I still can&#x27;t.  If you&#x27;ve shaved with a rotary your whole life, you will not believe the difference in performance this foil razor gives.  So as to not be long winded, the moral of the story is: Close, comfortable, convenient shave at a reasonable price.  I can&#x27;t compare it to some of the higher end competition, but I can say I couldn&#x27;t imagine getting a closer shave than this (so why pay an extra $100 to test that theory?).    Some Tips I&#x27;ve Learned After 3 Months of Use:  -For the closest, most comfortable shave possible with this shaver, shave after your stubble has had 2 days to grow and shave with shaving gel/cream and hot water like a blade.  I do mine in the shower.  The 2 days of growth allows the shaver to capture the hairs much more easily and the gel helps give a comfortable, smooth shave.  Follow up with an aftershave balm.  I follow this ritual:  After shaving Friday morning, I usually don&#x27;t shave again until Monday morning, after which I get an amazing shave that puts a smile on my face and prepares me to face the challenges of the work week.  -For daily shaves, use a pre-shave solution and shave dry.  This is convenient and allows for maximum day-to-day performance.  -Use the cleaning base after EVERY shave.  When shaving dry, take the foil off and rinse out all the hairs before putting it back into the cleaning base.  The most important thing this cleaning base does to your shaver is LUBRICATE.  If you notice after the cleaning cycle is over, take the foil off and look at the blades in the light.  The liquid on the blades is lubricant, and it will help tremendously to provide a smoother, closer shave as well as preserve the life of the blades.  As a matter of fact, try an experiment.  Rinse the blades and let them dry, then put the foil back on and turn on the shaver to listen to the blades.  Now do the same after the shaver has been through a cleaning cycle.  You will notice that without lubricant the blades actually give off a slight grinding, abrasive sound barely noticeable to the ear.  It is noticeable to the face...trust me.  Always use a properly lubricated shaver when you can.  By rinsing after shaving and then putting your shaver in the cleaning base, you will prolong the life of the cleaning cartridges.  -To best shave the sides of your cheeks along the jawline up the sideburns, I&#x27;ve found that pulling the skin to make it tighter actually doesn&#x27;t result in the closest shave.  Instead, move the shaver over the skin without stretching it.  This makes the skin kind of roll underneath the shaver, then the 13,000 RPM blades make short work of the hairs.    This pretty much wraps it up.  I don&#x27;t usually review products here on Amazon, but I do when I find them particularly noteworthy and I have something of substance to offer consumers.  If you&#x27;re still wondering whether or not to get this razor, take Nike&#x27;s advice...Just Do It.  Your face will thank you.</li>
            <li> Had this razor about 3 weeks very pleased so far, gives close shave east to clean and maintain. Looking for a razor don&#x27;t hesitate to by this one.</li>
            <li> The blade design and motor speed make it very easy to shave smooth and clean. Charges fast. Easy to wash and clean. I love this shaver!</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S FINE.  IT WAS A REPLACEMENT FOR A SIMILIAR PANASONIC RAZOR THAT WORE OUT.  I LIKE THE FACT THAT IT TELLS ME HOW MUCH CHARGE IS LEFT.</li>
            <li> Switched from rotary to foil with this razor and am highly satisfied in all regards: speed, closeness, skin comfort, even cleaning. I have light skin yet a fairly heavy beard, which suggests that this razor would be a great asset to virtually anyone.</li>
            <li> I recently lost my Braun razor so I picked this one to replace it.  It works great, gives you a nice shave, and I \\&quot;think\\&quot; i&#x27;ll really like the cleaning system.  After about a year of use I&#x27;ve noticed that my two previous Braun razors would start to smell a bit musty.  You can rinse them with water but I think they start to smell.  So I&#x27;ve only had this razor for about a week, but it looks like the cleaning and drying system will help solve that problem.  Also, its nice that when you put it into the base you can select from various modes, charge, clean, dry, or combinations of those, so if you just want to clean it, but not charge, you have those options.</li>
            <li> THIS RAZOR IS VERY NICE, AND I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT DEALS2U.COM, THESE PEOPLE ARE VERY CONSIDERATE, AND QUICK TO RESPOND IF THERE IS ANY PROBLEMS, I WOULD GIVE THEM A 5 STAR RATING. AND THIS RAZOR IS AS CLOSE AS ANY BLADE WITHOUT THE NICKS. THANKS AGAIN DEALS2U.COM,   A. DUNKIN, IND.</li>
            <li> I like this shaver.  Have been using it for six months now and have no serious complaints.    The shaver has pretty good battery life, I can get about three shaves before wanting to recharge.  If I had to order this again I would not order it with the recharging/cleaning station; it is just not necessary and takes up space while not being used.  The power cord is all I take with me when traveling.  I clean the shaver head with a little liquid soap in the palm of my hand. With warm water flushed through the shaver head I operate the shaver while the foil is in the liquid soap.  The shaver head foams up with the water and soap, and I just rinse it out in running warm water.  It comes out pristine.    For a good shave I use Williams Lektric Shave lotion.  If there are any stray whiskers left I flush my face with water and shave again with just the water on my skin.  I get ingrown whiskers really bad everytime I use a razor, so I just do not use a razor unless it&#x27;s an emergency.  When I do use a razor I get razor burn, and that does not happen with this shaver, or most shavers for that matter, and neither do the ingrown whiskers.    I would not recommend using this shaver dry.  The one or two times I have used it dry I felt the heat in the shaver foil.  Heat equals friction, and that means wear and tear on the shaver head.  So keep it cool and the shaver foil and blade should last a long time.  Before this shaver I used  Remington 304&#x27;s for years and was quite happy with them, but their quality and durability seemed to go downhill over the last three of them I wore out.  So I switched, and am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I have owned several electric razors over the years. I bought my first Panasonic almost ten years ago. It lasted for several years and when it finally died I bought another one. The last model of Panasonic that I had lasted nearly seven years and was a great product. When it came time to buy another I went several other brands including Braun and Norelco. All of these went bad in less then a year so I decided to go back to Panasonic. It was the right decision because this razor works better then both of the brands mentioned above and is cheaper.</li>
            <li> Great item. My husband loves it. I love it, since I shave him at least once a week. Great product. This is the 2nd one I have bought. I gave the other one to my son.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:  8/23/12  Replaced the blades and it stills works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a week of research...(mercy!), I purchased the ES8109S and it&#x27;s fantastic.  I was comparing the Braun Pulsonic and this particular model and made the right choice as the ES8109 is working great and it&#x27;s as close to a shave as possible.&lt;br /&gt;I was using an older model Panasonic ES8066 that is still working, but I wanted an update and took all the time needed to make a decision that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;A concern that I did have with these shavers was the large looking docking/cleaning stations.  I found that you don&#x27;t have to use the station all the time as you can plug the station&#x27;s electrical cord directly into the shaver for charging purposes.&lt;br /&gt;I read that the sound can be loud- but no louder than the razor I&#x27;m replacing, so there&#x27;s no issue I have there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t second guess yourself, try it out and make your own decision as skin types do vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  It may take a bit of time for your face to adjust to an electric shave.  The first time around for me, it looked like I was attacked by my girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver about six months ago and waited to see if I still liked it after some use before writing a review.  My face is fairly sensitive and I&#x27;ve always had trouble in the summer.  This shaver is the best thing since sliced bread.  The shaver itself is probably a bit better than any other I&#x27;ve tried (Norelco, Braun, Grundig).  The ability to use it with lather makes it fantastic.  I really do get a shave as close as a razor - I can feel my skin against the direction of my beard and it feels smooth.  I can also use an alcohol based after shave lotion and it doesn&#x27;t burn.  One other thing, I&#x27;ve found that the cheap shaving soap available in the grocery store works best.</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product to shave my head i had moles that kept getting cut with my regular razor. This product has been working great for me. It takes a little longer than shaving to get all the areas done but it does a good job. It works everywhere good except for my neck somtimes i have to carfully strech my skin and go agenst the gain to get the neck. the cleaning feature works great and i would recomend this product.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement to a four or five year old Panasonic wet-dry.  Improvement over the old one, but not sure if its due to the shaver or just new blades.  Haven&#x27;t gottten around to the cleaner device thingy.  Not sure if I ever will.  But I have come to love the Panasonic shavers over the years.  I use use it daily (or almost).</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES8109S Men&#x27;s 3 Blade Arc3 Wet/Dry Nanotech Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Vortex Cleaning System - Silver - Liked the product. However, my regular razor gave me a better closer shave. The cleaning feature was a great idea.</li>
            <li> I just returned mine. The cleaning portion of this system works great but the actual shaver is garbage.  Does not give a close shave.  My $20 airport shaver does a better job.  Avoid this thing if you don&#x27;t want a five o&#x27;clock shadow at 10 am!</li>
            <li> I just received this Panasonic ES8109S Vortex electric razor today that I ordered for Christmas and I must say I am very pleased and impressed with it.  I am one of those guys that can&#x27;t seem to get a close shave no matter what I use.....the Mach 3 Turbo razor or even the Gillette Fusion blade razor leaves my face less than perfectly smooth as I would expect with that many blades. Well I have to say, much to my surprise that this Panasonic electric razor shaves my face about 99% as close as the Fusion razor and that is impressive to me since I don&#x27;t have to keep buying those expensive Fushion blades!  I highly recommend this razor!</li>
            <li> Took me no less than a month to get used to the shaver as I only used razors in the past.  Made the purchase after reading positive reviews and after my need to substitute my expensive razor cartridges (Gillette)&lt;br /&gt;So far the results are very good.  My skin is now used to it and the shaver is a pleasure to use.  With the HydraClean system, the unit is kept clean and fresh.  I highly reccommend this shaver.  Saludos!</li>
            <li> shaves okay but it feels like you have nothing in your hand .  if you drop it even on a soft surface the possibilities of damage are endless. the cleaning mode is extremely loud and annoying .i&#x27;ve used panasonic electric razors for many years, this one is more of a toy than a mans grooming tool .  overall i think i might go back to using a braun or an older model panasonic if i can find one .</li>
            <li> I love the quality, and I love the speed in which it was delivered. It doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room on the bathroom counter, and my husband loves the features. He&#x27;s been bothering me since Christmas for a new shaver, so I let him get an early start for Father&#x27;s day. This is a great find and cheaper than buying it in the store.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for almost 3 years and just thought I would share how much I love it.  It works great.  Have never had one issue with it.  I get a very close shave and my wife expresses how much she loves it every time.    I was reminded to write this review because my wife actually just dropped it and one of the razors broke off.  So I am looking into another razor.  To my surprise this razor is still rated really high and doesn&#x27;t seem like their are to many other razors that compare.    With that being said I think I am going to be onto number 2!   I highly recommend this razor!</li>
            <li> This electric razor gives me a much closer shave than the previous name brand I&#x27;d been using. I&#x27;ve had it for a month and have no complaints or problems. I haven&#x27;t tried the self-cleaning charger yet for either cleaning or recharging. When the faucet appears on the readout to indicate a self-cleaning is due, I just remove the foil and run the blades under hot water. This seems to satisfy it (the faucet picture disappears). I recharge it with the power cord.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor as a gift for my husband. He had an old chargeable razor for years and it finally broke. It wasn&#x27;t very good to begin with and at the time we really couldn&#x27;t afford to put a lot of money into a new quality one. I researched for months and read every single review for this Panasonic Razor and decided to buy it. It was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my husband but when it came in I was too excited and had to have him open it! He tried it out and love it! He said it was better than anything his father had and his dad has one of those top notch Braun razors. You know the ones that cost roughly $300. He said it was perfect around the next and jaw area and there was no pinching or tearing out of the hair. My husband said this is the best gift he has ever had and he recommends it to anyone thinking of getting it as well!</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading tons of online reviews. I wasn&#x27;t really a fan of this shaver. The biggest thing was that it was nearly impossible to shave evenly. There were so many times I&#x27;d had to go over the same area. There was never a time that I didn&#x27;t get razor burn with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I liked about this was the beard trimmer. I still use it as a body hair trimmer to this day, and I purchased it over 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> This product is designed exceptionally well and performs to my highest expectations.  I&#x27;m not sure of the value in the Vortex Cleaning System which seems a bit complex for something I could otherwise clean off with running water, but maybe I&#x27;ll change my thinking over time. The Vortex container provides a handy, compact and convenient storage recharging station so for that reason alone I guess I&#x27;m glad I bought that unit.  Service was excellent with delivery as promised.</li>
            <li> My 3+ year old Braun 7526 Syncro with Clean and Charge finally had enough. Prior to that was a blade preceeded by a Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets jump back a few years and share my history...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always broken out with razor burn and ingrown hairs on my neck for as long as I started growing facial hair. Cheap razors were terrable so I asked for an electric. The Norelco made it easier to shave but still had the issues. Several months later it was back to the blade. Someone suggested a foil shaver and, after much hesitation, I purchased the Braun. Wow! What an improvement over the blade and rotory shavers. I have been happily using it daily for almost 4 years. Dare I say...almost enjoy shaving. Razor burn is almost non-existant unless you grind away in an area for too long a time (come back to the area 15 minutes later helps), ingrown hairs are 98% cured, and it shaved closer than a rotory with only a few passes. A win/win combination. The cleaning system is great except when away from home and you have to do it manually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That brings us to the present...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun has hit the snooze button and no longer wants to get up in the morning with me. After many hours of research I thought I wanted another Braun...their top of the line Pulsonic model. Almost bought one based on a few blogs on the web. I did cringe at the asking price of $250 - $300 suggested retail. I have always enjoyed Panasonic products and noticed this razor at half the asking price of the Braun. It seemed too good to be true, but Panasonic products have never let me down yet. I gave it a try, knowing I could try it for 30 days and send it back if unhappy. I had nothing to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had it a week now and nobody is taking this shaver away from me. I dare you to compare the 2 razors back to back and honestly say the Braun is worth double the price. They are, in my opinion, in the same class. The Panasonic is quieter both shaving and in the cleaning stand. It shaves closer and cuts more hair on the first pass, eliminating a 3rd or 4th pass. The Braun would sometimes knick my adams apple or lip and I have tried to get the Panasonic to do it but it wont (call me stupid). Since I dont have to shave 3, 4, or 5 times on my neck, the razor burn is gone. The ingrown hairs are 99% gone (I have had only one this past week). The cleaning gets the blades cleaner and they smell soapy clean and not chemically clean. The best part, a bonus if you will, is the Panasonic is water-resistant. Not only can you rinse the head off underwater at home or on the road, but you can shave in the shower or use shaving creams or lotions (gels are not recommended). The top of the line Braun can be rinsed under water but not used \\&quot;wet\\&quot; or with creams or lotions. The only drawback I could find is the travel bag they supply. I was hoping they could have supplied a better case to hold the cord and shaver for extended trips. Not a big deal though, on a big trip...I will have a big suitcase so I&#x27;m sure there will be plenty of room in there for a cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, a great shaver with all the current technology and features offered by the competition at a reasonable asking price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT - MONDAY JANUARY 21, 2008&lt;br /&gt;Since purchasing, this razor still continues to be my favorite. I have now started using it \\&quot;wet\\&quot; by warming my face with hot water, then applying a Neutragena shaving cream. The results are better. It shaves more hairs on the first pass, the cream eliminates any friction, and gives me the closest shave yet with an electric (some areas of the face feel like I shaved with a blade).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT - SUNDAY JANUARY 18, 2009&lt;br /&gt;Still loving it and using it everyday. However, the wife ran it through the front load washer tonight. It is now very clean. Still runs but needs a new set of blades. For added measure and the price of new blades and foil, I found a really good deal on the ES8228S shaver. The only difference between the two is the ES8228S adds a zippered vinyl travel case (vs cloth bag with draw strings) and the head has independent floating foil (each of the 3 foils is on their own suspension to track the curves of the face better).th draw strings) and the head has independent floating foil (each of the 3 foils is on their own suspension to track the curves of the face better).</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my boyfriend who needs to shave often but was always cutting himself. His old electric left his face feeling whiskery even right after he shaved. Read other reviews about the Panasonic being almost like a razor so I decided to try and he LOVES it.....doesn&#x27;t even mind shaving. Plus he can used this wet (for a real close shave) or dry!</li>
            <li> I purchased the ES8109S Vortex after reviewing several brands and reading hunderds of reviews.  First use, perfect shave.  Yes it misses a few hairs under the chin, but I have never owned an electric that didn&#x27;t.  It is the nature of how they work.  A few passes, perfect.      I am shaving my head daily.  It works great in the shower with a little soap.  Smooth as a blade, takes about 4 minutes for whole head.  I would highly recommend this shaver for those who want an electric option for head shaving.  Looks like I&#x27;m getting 5 shaves (face and head) on a charge.      I have read a lot about the noise from this and other panasonics.  I did not mind the noise.  It was not as loud as I expected after reading the reviews.      My preference, clean the shaver under water most days.  run it through the cleaner once a week.</li>
            <li> To preface, this shaver is the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve used in probably a good decade. I had a cheapie Norelco years and years ago when I first hit puberty, but I quickly changed to razors. My reasons for doing so were just about the reasons of everyone who prefers razors: My beard grows thick and quick, and within a week I&#x27;ve usually got a good \\&quot;crumb catcher\\&quot; going. Beyond that, razors are just the smoothest shave you&#x27;ll get, even with the risk of nicks and razor-burn.     After finding this on a deal through Amazon, somewhere in the low $90&#x27;s I believe, I felt like it was time to try electrics once again since shaving every other day was a losing battle for me and I had resorted to once a week grooming. I figured for the price, it better be pretty darn good - $90 (on sale) is no small drop in the bucket for me when it comes to this stuff.    Well, I set aside my favorite blade (Mach 3 Turbo for me) and prepared for the worst. Like every new shaving method, it takes about a month for the beard to adjust, and the first shave wasn&#x27;t entirely pleasant (as I recall from my previous foray with electrics a decade ago).     But, now speaking about 4 weeks into it, I can honestly say I&#x27;m impressed. On my cheeks and face, it&#x27;s almost impossible to tell between the razor and Panasonic&#x27;s little beauty. I&#x27;ve tried it in the shower (yes, it is completely waterproof) and with shaving cream and all sorts of lubricants, but for my thick beard I found that it just didn&#x27;t get close enough and took too long with all the water and creams. My favorite method, I&#x27;ve found, is dry shaving at the end of the day/beginning when your face isn&#x27;t so sensitive, and just running the blades under some cold water now and then (both to clean them momentarily, lubricate your skin just a tad, and keep them cool - the blades do get hot) while simultaneously moving it in small circles over the area you want shaved (almost like brushing your teeth).    There are still a few trouble spots underneath my chin and on my neck that are difficult to get without stretching my skin quite a bit, but they were problem areas even when I was using a razor.     What&#x27;s more, and this is definitely my favorite attribute; with the method above there&#x27;s so little irritation (only on the outskirts underneath my chin) that I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve been mauled by some ravenous feline after shaving! It&#x27;s fantastic. Particularly above the chin, I can barely tell it&#x27;s cutting the hairs, and don&#x27;t feel bothered even during the process.     The base itself fits in a corner, is fairly compact (about the size of one of those scented candles in a jar), and does its job well. The cleaner does not use alcohol to clean, but a detergent solution that uses water housed in a small tank also in the base.    And to top it off, you&#x27;re looking at a cheaper upkeep than blades. The detergent packs are cheap ($15 for a set of 3, each one lasts a month), and you need to replace the foil (once a year, with the blades once every two years (~$50 for both foil and blades). So that&#x27;s $110/year max for shaving, compared to $180/year for cartridge blades.    If there are any Cons for me, it would be the following:    -While in operation it is a tad loud. Not annoyingly so, but it&#x27;s a very high frequency pulsating noise (that you won&#x27;t notice in about 30 seconds into the shave), but afterwards (especially if you shave in a smaller room) everything sounds distorted because of it for about a minute.    -The cleaning base is also a little noisy. You won&#x27;t hear it down the stairs or anything, but if you&#x27;re in the next room and this buzzing keeps coming up, it&#x27;s the base and the shaver cleaning itself.     -The same button that turns the shaver on also turns on the \\&quot;manual cleaning\\&quot; mode if you press it for 5 seconds. This is NOT a shaving mode, but a cleaning mode to use when you don&#x27;t have the base. I have not had any trouble with it accidentally changing modes so far, but the manual does warn that the cleaning modeis not designed for shaving.    Overall, I&#x27;ve had a rather pleasant and refreshing experience with the shaver. While occasionally I may return to razors if I need that ultra-smooth shave (black tie events), this thing is now my bread and butter. It does a grand job once you&#x27;re used to it, and I can&#x27;t imagine going a full week without shaving again. The only area this thing has left to surprise me in is how long it lasts without being recharged as I haven&#x27;t had any extended trips, but I don&#x27;t see it failing me there either (I use about 20-30% of the battery per shave, at about 7-minutes a shave).    I highly recommend it for anyone who&#x27;s looking at an electric shaver and is pondering whether it&#x27;s worth the ~$100 investment. I found it to be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers for a few years, and prior to that Norelco.  The cleaning system for the Braun always irritated me, due to the evaporation of the solution.  However, it was giving me a very close shave until, I believe, the battery finally lost enough power.  Despite the cleaning problem, I was willing to buy the $200+ Braun shaver since I like their foil system.  But I&#x27;ve always wanted to try a wet/dry shaver, and Amazon had this razor on sale for $88, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I was really suprised how well the shaver works wet.  The foil system is very similar to the Braun, and its easy to clean either with the cleaning unit or under water.  Plus the cleaning solution seems to last forever - its been about 6 weeks and I haven&#x27;t had to buy a new cartridge.    So why 4 stars?  It doesn&#x27;t work very well dry, so you have to spend extra time in the shower in the morning and buy gel for a close shave.  Because the blade and foil are very sharp and have a high RPM, you get cuts periodically...just like a blade!  Also, my cleaning unit will only clean if I unplug it and plug it in again.  Very odd design.  Finally, I&#x27;ve never seen those cleaning cartridges for sale anywhere, which is kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> Now, I suppose if you buy this razor thinking it&#x27;s going to cure diseases, fix your car, or get you that long sought-after menage a trois, then your expectations are too high and you&#x27;re going to be disappointed.  Reading some of these reviews, I was prepared to find your average electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the third electric razor I&#x27;ve owned and second Panasonic.  I look at these Brauns and Remingtons and they just don&#x27;t seem to be worth it.  Especially Brauns.  $200 or more for a razor?!  Seriously?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use electric razors because my beard requires hot steam treatment prior to shaving with a regular razor.  It seems like no matter what I do, whether it&#x27;s using special shaving cream, hot wash cloths on my face, the finest disposable razors, etc, that I get nicks, ingrown hairs, and general irritation if I use a regular disposable razor.  So, I turned to electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, you don&#x27;t get as close a shave as you would with a disposable.  But, if you didn&#x27;t know that, then you&#x27;ve never used an electric razor before.  However, all of that being said, this is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve used it for over a month now and am extrememly satisfied with it.  The shave is close and smooth.  The razor is easy to use and versatile.  As I said, I have a tough beard and sensitive skin.  This razor does the best job with those weird little hairs on my neck and has yet to give me an ingrown hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not \\&quot;one-pass shaving\\&quot; that&#x27;s for sure.  But, then, I don&#x27;t know an electric razor that is.  But it is pretty fast, I think.  And smooth.  The pivoting head is easy to use.  And, the flip trimmer on the back can take care of those pesky longer neck hairs as well as trip up side burns.  I even use it to even out my mustache and goatee between trims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger/cleaner is easy to use and does a great job.  I wish it was faster.  I love the complaints about the noise it makes.  I mean, seriously?  Where do you live, in an isolation chamber?  For those of us that live in cities near other people and stuff, I don&#x27;t think this is noisy.  It certainly isn&#x27;t nosier than my television.  But, I used this for over a month and cleaned the razor each day.  The filter lasted around 30 days, as advertised.  My razor was always clean and ready to use the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is an excellent razor.  And, with the discount Amazon is giving, I think it&#x27;s a no-brainer to buy it.  I got the whole thing with another coupon for $75.  Maybe that&#x27;s why I like it so much.  In any case, it really is the best razor I ever bought.  So glad I got it.  Too many nitpickers around here complaining about stuff that doesn&#x27;t matter.t live in cities near other people and stuff, I don&#x27;t think this is noisy.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a blade since I was 18 years old.  For the years before that, it was a hand me down Norelco rotary from my dad.  The wet shave option on the Panasonic is better than my blade.  I used Mach 3 then switched to one of the 5 blade razors a few months ago.  The Panasonic does a better job in less time.  It only took a few days for my skin to get used to the electric razor.  This unit has exceptional quality and the charging/cleaning base outstanding.  I love everything about this shaver and highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd Panasonic shaver and it&#x27;s just as good or better than the first.  My first shaver lasted about four years and had one blade/screen replacement.  It got to the point that the batteries wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge and the shaver wasn&#x27;t running at full speed.  I was sad to see my older razer go since it had the great induction charging that was the halmark of older Panasonic razors.  I started my search for a new shaver and came across this shaver.  I was skeptical at first about the cleaning system since I hate spending money on crap that I don&#x27;t need.  After reading reviews on the shaver, plus the discount Amazon had, I took the plunge.    It&#x27;s like I have my old shaver back.  It goes through my face hair w/ out shuddering and leaves my face smooth.  I also like that the cleaning carts are only about $12 for three of them.  From other reviews I have read you don&#x27;t have to change the water once a month.  You can wait till the light comes on and then change it.    Overall, it&#x27;s a great buy and I&#x27;m looking forward to more years with another wonderful razor.</li>
            <li> Ok, after using the &#x27;cheaper&#x27; offerings in the Norelco brand of shavers for the last 20+ years I wanted to upgrade. After reading all the positive reviews here I thought I&#x27;d give this one a try. It is cheaper than the Braun and the arcitec and rates just as good (if not better). I knew I&#x27;d have to give my face a chance to &#x27;adapt&#x27; to the foil vs. the Norelco rotary blades. Well after 28 days this shaver is going back. It has not been able to shave nearly as close as my 8 year old Norelco and this shaver has a design flaw. The Panasonic shaver has no collector for the beard clippings. If you hold the shaver just right you will get shaver clippings all over your face, your clothes, your sink, etc. I had to follow up with a razor after each and every shave. The Panasonic was never able to properly shave my chin. I can&#x27;t comment if it is this shaver or this type of shaver (foil). I did read in a consumer&#x27;s report where it&#x27;s best to stick to one type of electric shaver, so I may be destined to stay with a rotary shaver. Regardless, with this Panasonic I was covered in clippings at the end of each morning&#x27;s shave and I don&#x27;t find this acceptable.</li>
            <li> This razor gave me a shave equal to or better than any shave I&#x27;ve gotten without using a regular blade (even a somewhat dull blade).    My beard is probably average; not too thick, not too thin.  If I don&#x27;t have anything special going on I can go two days after shaving with a blade with only the mustache / goatee area looking kind of scraggly on the second day.  But I have to shave every day when using an electric.    I&#x27;ve only had three electric razors in over 30 years of shaving; a cheap rotary non-cordless Norelco, a Braun 6520 and now this one.  I have also used a blade between razor purchases, when the razors needed new parts and on special occasions just because it looks better.    The Norelco may or may not have done a better job on my neck due to the rotary heads but overall I recall it giving me an average to poor shave even after replacing the heads.  The Braun gave me a great shave and I would still be using it if I were not concerned about how much longer the battery would last.  It used to provide about ten shaves per charge but now it&#x27;s down to maybe four.  Since the Braun needed a new screen and blades I figured the money would be better spent buying a new razor.  Braun has priced their razors out of the range I&#x27;ll pay for shaving my face so I read the reviews and bought the Panasonic.    The Panasonic has been great for the two weeks I&#x27;ve used it.  After the first two or three uses I noticed my neck was kind of itchy which has since subsided.  I suspect it was due to pushing too hard or maybe my face just needed to get used to the new razor.  Or maybe it had nothing to do with razor, who knows.  It is a little louder than the Braun or at least a different pitch but I don&#x27;t think that it would be any more liable to wake someone up in an adjacent room.    The power button certainly is in an odd place where I suspect most men put their thumb when shaving and I did shut it off by mistake once.  To avoid that from happening a minor change in how you holdthe razor is required which is to shift the thumb closer to the head where at least Panasonic thinks your thumb should be.  I like to hold the razor so that it does not touch the palm of my hand and only my thumb and fingers are gripping it but I have tried a golf club grip a few times which worked fine but will take some getting used to.    I have only shaved dry and probably won&#x27;t use it wet, with or without lather.  I have also not used the cleaning feature yet but I do like the base for charging and to have somewhere to put the razor when not in use.  I suspect the cleaning feature will be useful if and when I use it but the documentation shows the razor can be easily cleaned with soup and water under the faucet.  Either way, it will be nice to be able to thoroughly clean it and not have to rely on the dumb little brushes.    All in all I have no complaints about this razor and I would recommend it to anyone who does not expect a shave as good as a regular blade.  If there&#x27;s an electric razor out there that does that good of a job I would like to know about it.  Until then, I&#x27;ll be happy using this one.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Panasonic ES8109S Vortex Wet/Dry Shaver in mid-December 2008 at a great price.  I took advantage of free shipping and my shaver arrived sooner than the estimated date.    This shaver is the best of the many electric shavers I have owned.  Its considerable power makes shaving quick and as close as I&#x27;ve ever had.  And the HydraClean System is amazing.    Unfortunately, I have yet to find a Target, Wal-Mart or similar discount store that stocks replacement foils and blades or cleaning solution for the HydraClean system, but that is no major problem since these items are readily available at good prices via Amazon.    I recommend this product without reservation.</li>
            <li> My Facial Background: I have very sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve never been able to shave more than once a week due to skin irritation because I would get those water pimples that would make the area painful if I shaved against the grain with a razor or by using those electric razors from the 90&#x27;s. Luckily I never suffered from Razor burn or Ingrowns. Due to that I learned to shave never going against the grain with a razor and that has let me shave my face twice a week problem free, if I shaved more than twice... skin irritation.    Then I recieved this bad boy as a Father&#x27;s day gift and now after a couple of months usage I have to say I&#x27;m pretty impressed; electric razors have come a long way. I won&#x27;t say this is a miracle razor, because it isn&#x27;t, but it allows me to shave my face against the grain for a much closer shave than I was getting with my razor with the grain. That now allows for a smoother feeling and I look better til my next shave. I also have noticed that I can shave my face more frequently as well, every other day bringing it to 3 times a week instead of the 2 before hand. Altho I will admit that I also use Neutrogena after shave lotion which helps out greatly.    What I mean by no miracle razor, is that if you have sensitive skin, it isn&#x27;t going to cure it. It has allowed me an extra shave a week and my face feeling smoother than my previous method, but I still can not shave every single day because I will get irritated. I&#x27;m not knocking the razor, it&#x27;s awesome, just making sure you are realistic in your expectations.    The benefits this electric has provided me has made me retire my razor permanently. I defintely recommend giving this razor a try, especially if you tried electrics in the past and thought they were garbage, times have changed my friends!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this shaver a few times since I bought it here but it has worked great and gives a great shave in shorter time than a messy blade and shaving cream.  I know that&#x27;s what I have been looking for in a shaver for a while.  It&#x27;s been a few years since I last tried an electric (rotary) shaver but the new foils like this really have come a long way in a few years and give an amazing, quick shave.  Like I said, I haven&#x27;t used it a ton yet, and never have I had multiple days&#x27; stubble to shave off, but this shaver is worth every penny (I paid less than $80 for it with the $30 code thru March 31st).  For ths price and the quality of shave it gives, I think any guy would be foolish not to give this a try.      Can&#x27;t give any updates as to charging time/battery life or the cleaner as I haven&#x27;t had to use either yet, but I&#x27;m sure they are as solid as the shaver itself is.</li>
            <li> For years I shaved with a Mach 3, then for two years I used a Remington rotary electric before trying this Panasonic.  I have now used the Panasonic every day for a couple of months now and am still thrilled with the purchase.  It shaves way closer than the Remington and more comfortably (and less messily) than my Mach 3.  The cleaning system works very well; only caveat there is that the full cycle takes about two hours to run.  This has never been a problem for me but did somewhat surprise me.    All in all, a wonderful shaver and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have had this product about 2 months.  It is my second electric razor, first being a Braun that lasted me 7 years.  It gives a pretty close shave around the mustache and goatee chin area.  It does not shave well next to my ears or on my neck.  This is what really disappoints me about this product.  I have to take a disposable razor to finish the job. Positives are that it cleans well and a charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver, clean it with water, since its wet/dry and it does result in a smooth shave on your skin. However the trimmer cannot trim hair too good. It&#x27;s very weak on that. Other than that, Ive had no problems with it yet, and the charge lasts a while. only takes an hour to fully charge.</li>
            <li> Shaver has not given me a \\&quot;close as a blade shave\\&quot; as of this time.  I was hoping for a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic I bought. Last one is 8 years old and still works fine. SO i brought this one for my teenager. He loves it. He is amazed with the clean shave he gets with his razor. This is a self cleaning device. I would not hesitate to buy one for myself again in the future.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review after using the shaver for last 10 months! Frankly speaking, this is how long it took for me to realize the full potential of this amazing shaver. For the first couple of months I thought I wasted my money. I just wanted to use it for a few more months and switch back to blades. But.... in last 2 months, I am getting the best shave ever! I realized that you have to know the grain of your beard to get the best of this shaver. Recently I switched to one of those foamless shaving gels  which helps me to figure out which way I should move. Since then, I am getting the closet shave. I will highly recommend this shaver... but please try  foam-less Gel to get the closest shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And one tip that will save you some money - dont use the Vortex cleaning system as frequently as the manual says. I use it once in 2 weeks. Other times I just clean the shaver with my hands under running water using regular hand soap. I have changed the cartridge after 10 months and blades are still like new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. - The trimmer is one heck of an utility! Its really neat.</li>
            <li> I was going to buy the Braun Pulsonic until I read the reviews here and on other Web providers.  They convinced me the 8109 was worth the purchase.  Note that this shaver is the same as their more expensive 8228 except for a wood trim and case color on the latter. Out of box set up took 10 minutes to read and do.  Charged up fully in 30 minutes even tho literature says \\&quot;up to an hour\\&quot;.  Wet shaves are great but even dry this shaver is without pulling and takes little effort for a shave second only to a blade. Putting in a new cartridge every month for the cleaning system is a minor nag  but you can also rinse in tapwater.  With a great shave, the ability to go into the shower with you, and a price well below The Braun, Panasonic has the winner here.  To be fair, I did not shave with the Pulsonic and took the recommendation of others who had.</li>
            <li> so expensive. just crazy but this is what our son wanted.. oddly enough he barely uses it. i just can understand why a razor costs so much</li>
            <li> I replaced a Braun with this Panasonic and have been very happy.  It is quieter and shaves closer.  The blades seem to last longer too.  I have had it for a couple of years and still performs like new.</li>
            <li> I owned this razor for over a year and I&#x27;ve been very pleased.  However, I wish I hadn&#x27;t purchased the cleaning station as it is an expensive way to clean it when liquid detergent would have worked as well.  The cleaning station isn&#x27;t poorly made, just unnecessary.</li>
            <li> Having the cleaning system is an added bonus.  The panasonic razor is a great razor!  it is also easier to store!</li>
            <li> I bout this 3 years ago and the best investment in years. I was paying 24.00 bucks for Gillette. They hardly lasted a week. This was a good buy, maybe 250 bucks and 3 years later, still going strong. Never really used the cleaning kit, just hose off in the sink.</li>
            <li> Have had two wet/dry shavers, the only reason I bought this one several years ago is I left the first one in a hotel room. I just replaced foils and blades, its like new again. Very good shaver lasts 2 weeks on a full charge using every other day. love it.</li>
            <li> Most electric razors cut up my neck but this one does awesome especially in the shower, love that it can be used wet. using it in Afghanistan now good for on the go</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for awhile. The tank stopped working within 6 months.  But the shaver has been plugging along and it works quite well. I use it every morning. Glad I have it.  Reasonably priced and does a good job.</li>
            <li> I am used to Gillette Mach3 for last 5 years or so and wanted to try something new that is maintainence free. I decided to try this one based on many positive reviews from users &amp; a positive fan following over here. However, I am little disappointed with the results.     I just got the shaver and tried it three times since. The facial shave seems to be quite good either on wet or dry shave but lot of neck hair were left even after 4-5 passes. No irritation or razor burn or nicks ( normally caused by Gillette Mach3) on the face even after 2-3 consecutive attempts. frankly it feels quite good for the face!     However the experience on shaving the neck hair is totally opposite. It almost started bleeding after so many tries but I could not get a clean shave on the neck at all.   I am in a fix here. I will try it for a few more days and then will decide whether its a keeper.   Any suggestions are welcome, as I really don&#x27;t want to return it.</li>
            <li> Been using this shaver now for 2 weeks and I love it!  Used for both the head and face.  Works exceptionally well to shave the head - wet or dry.  As with all electric shavers, it has difficulty with neck hair.  The cleaning system is fantastic - used about every 3-4 days to clean the shaver. An excellent value in this price range. In fact, I would put it up against the $180.00 Braun in all aspects!</li>
            <li> My credentials: 40 yrs. shaving (the 1st 25 years only with a blade.)  I was so obsessed with closeness that I used to shave with a badger brush and shaving soap using a Hoffritz single blade. (This is as close as a barber&#x27;s straight blade.)    I have tried just about all the shavers since then.  Remingtons, Norelcos (through the Bond, James Bond model), all the Brauns through the Activator, and the last 3 or 4 Panasonic models.    Braun, with its interceptor blades, convinced me that shaving electrically was quicker, less bloody, and more comfortable than my blades, along with an acceptable shave.    Panasonic&#x27;s shavers convinced me that shaving with an electric could come very close to the quality of a blade.  However, there was always a problem.  The first few ultrasonics I had had terrible batteries.  Another one went dead after a year (and had the reputation for doing that too).  And the last one (I&#x27;m too lazy to look up that number) was a step backwards and never shaved very close.    I got the ES8109s for around $86 here at Amazon before Christmas and was delighted.  It fit perfectly in my hand, had the closest shave I have experienced so far, was good around the neck, and was comfortable.  I always liked the cleaning system but cleaned and charged my shaver in the cleaner only once a week (every Sunday).  Daily, I would brush out the whiskers.      Unfortunately, after only 3 months, I already felt that the blades needed to be replaced.  After 6 months, I can barely get an acceptable shave at all, having to go over and over the same area and still not get a close shave.  This is not acceptable since (it seems to me at least) Panasonic&#x27;s replacement blade/screens are the most expensive.  The Brauns always lasted me between 18 months to 2 years.    I am now debating whether to give this shaver one more try by replacing the blades or try a Braun 360 instead.  (I refuse to buy the Braun Pulsonic since they feel very cheap in the hand, in my opinion, and have integrated blades/shaver screens that cannot be cleaned out with a brush.)  This is really frustrating since Panasonic makes wonderful shavers but always appears to have an \\&quot;Achille&#x27;s heel.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Shaves very closely without irritating the skin. Used wet with lather it glides very smoothly but doesn&#x27;t seem to shave any closer than dry, and using it wet takes extra time fussing with lather and cleanup so I usually just pick it up and shave without water. The cleaning unit has a complex cycle that whirs and clicks for over an hour, but it cleans the shaver well. This shaver is much less expensive than the top-end Braun, which I haven&#x27;t tried, but I&#x27;m glad I bought this one as I don&#x27;t see how an electric shaver could perform much better.</li>
            <li> Either wet or dry, this shaver didn&#x27;t do a good job for me.  I wasn&#x27;t able to get a close shave at all.  The last straw was when I did one of those side by side tests.  I shaved with an old dull Gillette razor on half my face and this thing on the other.  The powerless, old blade won hands down.  My wife saw the difference immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above, of course, were my results and it may have a lot to do with my facial make up.  However, there were other things that I disliked:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- When the shaver is at full charge it blinks all the time.  I found that pretty annoying in the middle of the night if I happened to have the bathroom door open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- One of the reasons I got the shaver was to save money in the long run on blades.  However, the cleaning cartridge doesn&#x27;t have a long life and would have cost me as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- The cleaning system takes about an hour and is pretty noisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- I found the shaver screen got hot pretty quickly, even when using it wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for me, it didn&#x27;t work too well.  I&#x27;ve shipped it back and gone back to my old blade razor.</li>
            <li> OK, so I have decided to stop being a review parasite (I often look to reviews to help me in buying decisions, but don&#x27;t write my own review).  I have been using the Panasonic E8109S shaver for about a week now, and here is my 2 cents.    1st, in my opinion, based on using two rotary electric razors (Norelco), 2 foil razors (Braun), and now a 3rd foil razor, none give as close of a shave as a razor blade, but if you give your face about a month to adapt you can generally get a good shave from the better (more expensive) electrics.  I prefer the foil razors, as they seem to me to shave closer, and it is easier to maneuver them around the ears and nose without leaving behind hairs.  Now on to the review.    As stated above, I had 2 Braun shavers.  Braun 1 was an excellent shaver that cost around $80 - $100.  It gave a great shave, held a charge for a couple of weeks, and quietly hummed when operating.  It came with the Braun cleaning system.  When it&#x27;s motor failed after a year of operation I bought Braun 2, which was a cheaper razor (around $60 I think).  It didn&#x27;t hold a charge as long, didn&#x27;t have the cleaning system, didn&#x27;t shave as well and was much louder.  The lesson here is you get what you pay for, and name brand doesn&#x27;t guarantee anything.  Luckily  I realized Braun&#x27;s warranty is 2 years, not 1 as I had thought, so I got Braun 1 repaired for free (they even mailed it to me after fixing it) and I got another 3 years or so use before the on/off switch got stuck in the on position, and I started using Braun 2 again.  Needless to say, it didn&#x27;t take long before I was ready to shell out some cash for a better razor.      Initially I was planning on getting another higher priced Braun, but was pulled to the Panasonic by a couple of points.  First, it is cheaper than Braun&#x27;s with comparable features, and I was intrigued by the ability to shave using shaving cream again.  Since the Panasonic sells for $100 (although I got it for $73), I will compare it to Braun 1, which was similarly priced.  I cannot compare it to today&#x27;s Braun models, so you will have to look to reviews of those products, although I doubt they are much different from the model I owned.  It was a 4000 series (I don&#x27;t remember the exact number, but I still have Braun 2, which is model 5770).      Cleaning System:   I much prefer the cleaning system that comes with the Panasonic, as the base is more square, and takes up less room than the rounded Braun base, and more importantly it has rubber feet that keep it in place when the razor is being cleaned.  I had to wedge the Braun cleaner against something, or else it would slide across my sink from the vibrations caused by the razor running.  It also seemed louder than the Panasonic, but since it died a couple of years ago, I may be remembering that part incorrectly.    Ergonomics:  The Panasonic is a clear winner here as well.  Not only is the razor noticeably lighter, it is skinnier, with a contoured shape for easy gripping, and a rubberized handle to reduce slipping.  The bulkier, plastic handled Braun doesn&#x27;t come close.    Noise: Here I have to give the edge to the Braun.  I don&#x27;t think the Panasonic is much louder in Db, but it is much more high pitched, almost like a Dentist&#x27;s drill and hair clippers had a baby, and this is it.  Luckily I find that I get used to the sound about 2 seconds after I turn it on, probably because it is fairly quiet.  It still beats Braun 2&#x27;s roar.    Shave: Again the Panasonic clearly beats Braun 2, but the more aptly compared Braun 1 gives it a run for it&#x27;s money.  I would call this a tie in the dry shave category.  The dry shave was closer than the shave with shaving cream the first couple of days, but it seems to be shaving closer as I continue using shaving cream.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is due to my face adjusting, me learning better technique, or what.  I will say that I love using shaving cream again, and it is worth the miniscule difference that may occur in closeness.  When I finish shaving, my face feels totally clean shaven, and I only notice the difference at the end of the day (stubble seems slightly more pronounced).    Overall, I give the Panasonic 5 stars because it is reasonably priced, gives a great shave, holds it&#x27;s charge for a long time and isn&#x27;t unreasonably loud.  The led that gives the remaining charge in 10% increments is also nice (and puts it in competition with higher priced competitors).  On the negative side, the whine is a bit high pitched, and I cannot find replacement heads or cleaning solution at local stores, so will have to order it online - probably cheaper, but certainly not as convenient.  All that to say I believe this is the best electric razor I have ever owned, and I won&#x27;t hesitate to get another one in a few years when this one inevitably dies.</li>
            <li> I have only used rotary shavers before this one, and always seemed to get burned by them, and my neck would always get ripped up and blotchy red spots, which is really annoying when you have to shave to look clean for work, parties, events, etc.    So I decided to try a foil shaver and see if it worked any better. Well, after using this shaver for almost two months now, I have to say it is the best shaver I could imagine using. I have not burned my neck since I began using it, and it stays much cleaner than my old razor, thanks to the HydraClean System and even the ease of cleaning with running under a faucet. I feel that foil shavers rinse cleaner than do rotary ones, and it is probably purely because the blades are more straight on these, whereas the old rotary shavers I had contained slightly curved blades, and could never seem to get fully clean.    This is the type of shaver a person can use for years, with replacing the foils, of course, and be completely happy with. I would recommend this to anyone that swears by electrics, as it is smooth, comfortable, can work wet or dry, and leaves you with the smoothest shave you can have from an electric. I&#x27;ve never shaved better in my life, and plan on sticking with Panasonic shavers in the future.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver to replace my existing 6 year old Panasonic.  I was not disappointed.  The same quality that I found with the original razor was easily rediscovered with the new unit.  The only reason the old unit was retired was that I was due for a new razor/foil set (approx $30).  After discounts, the new unit was only ~$40 more -- so upgrade time!  The new unit is faster, charges quicker, and runs quieter (great with 2 small kids).  Another great razor from Panasonic -- highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The shaver is great. I need to shave everyday and the traditional razors give me a lot of bumps. This shaver is much better and gives a much closer shave than my old Norelco.  The cleaning cycle is noisy, but it does not need to run very often, so it doesn&#x27;t bother.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Bought this to upgrade a previous panasonic wet/dry shaver.  This shaver is even better if that is possible.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use the shaver for both my face and my head... It is more efficient and effective than any other shaver I have ever owned...</li>
            <li> Foil just won&#x27;t cut rogue hairs a few days old.  You need to use the trimmer all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;Also it doesn&#x27;t operate while charging.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind of good.&lt;br /&gt;shaving well and easy to Maintenance also price is not high. I&#x27;m satisfied it. thank you.</li>
            <li> Panasonic always seems to hit a home run with their products. This razor works great, in wet or dry. Since it is lithium powered, it holds the power all the way down, unlike Ni-Cad which starts losing power as the battery loses charge. Do you really need the charging/cleaning base? You could argue it is a gimmic, since you can easily clean the razor under the sink faucet. Maybe the cleaning system does something that just running water doesn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t know, but the base works fine.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor!nafter the initial 2-3 weeks of your skin getting used to the new type of shaving (if you&#x27;re switching from a traditional razor) it gives a nice close shave with very little skin irritation. The upkeep (soap cartridges) and replacement parts (razors and foil) are very low cost and you will definitely be better off in the long run when you compare to buying shaving cream and triple blade razor heads every few weeks.</li>
            <li> As far as electric razors go, this one is up there in terms of efficiency and comfort.  There&#x27;s only one significant drawback, it&#x27;s LOUD.  Loud to the point where you worry about waking people up if you use it early in the morning.</li>
            <li> I understand that electric shavers don&#x27;t get quite as close as a real razor. After using this shaver, I still feel like I have approximately a noon shadow. It just isn&#x27;t close enough. I&#x27;m back to the real razor, and this one will be used for other areas.</li>
            <li> I gave up electric shavers years ago but tried this on a lark and am impressed.  I think the abiltiy to use in the shower is a big plus.  I still have trouble shaving my neck and the far sides of my jaw.  I hope that will change as my face adjusts to electric shaving.  I have noticed that i have less shadow at teh end of the day, suggesting that I am getting a closer shave than baldes.  I read somewhere that blade shaving looks closer at first because it causes the skin to swell, but that wears off after a short period of time.  That could well be true.  I&#x27;m sticking with this electric.</li>
            <li> The Winner Is...    The Panasonic ES8109S 3-blade - barely. Put the Remington blades and cutter (keeping the center blade of the Panasonic) on a Panasonic 13,000 RPM shaver and you would have the World&#x27;s best electric shaver. The Remington shaved a little closer than the Panasonic and provided a faster shave. However, the difficulty in cleaning, noise and lack of a charging base tipped me to the Panasonic as the final choice.    This is a review of three Panasonic models; ES8243A (4-blade), ES8109S (3-blade) and ES7109, the Remington MS2-390, the Norelco 8260 CC and the Braun Series 5 8995 (8985 &amp; 8975 only differ in displays and cleaning). I have an average beard and have been using electric shavers (foils and rotaries) over 30 years. The models here are no better than any of the other higher quality shavers I&#x27;ve owned. It takes about 10 minutes (no shaver will give you a first-pass close shave) to get to that good dry shave (with or without pre-electric gels/oils) and you do have to put pressure on to get a close shave. This means recharging every 4-5 days. Gels/oils do make the process easier - not faster - and I have reviewed six of them on their Amazon sites.    ES8109S: This 3-blade shaver gives a very close shave, with some work. It does give off a higher pitch &#x60;whine&#x27;, while shaving, that is somewhat annoying, but is not what I would consider noisy. Nor is the cleaning operation noisy. Based upon other reviewers, I was expecting it to sound like a lawn mower, but it is just an occasional buzzing noise as it cleans. The \\&quot;Arc Foil\\&quot; design slows shaving (see discussion, below).    ES8243A: I had hoped that the four blades of the Panasonic ES8243A just might be able to give a superior shave. As it turns out, the large four-blade surface is like trying to keep the end of a 2x4 on your face. It makes cutting in the areas where you don&#x27;t have a lot of skin area (chin, jaw line, upper lip, base of sideburns, etc) more difficult. In fact, I think that the fourth blade in the middle actually interferes with a better shave and these two middle blades are not as good as the primary cutters. The \\&quot;Arc Foil\\&quot; design makes it even slower (see discussion, below). Another future problem with the 4-blade system is that you&#x27;ll want to buy a new shaver when your blades and foil need to be replaced. What kind of an idiot is going to spend 80% of the cost of a new shaver just to get a set of new cutter blades and foil? All in all: the ES8243A 4-blade is a poor value.    ES7109S: The flat design of the foil is a better design than the \\&quot;Arc Foil\\&quot; (see below). Unfortunately, this shaver has an under-powered motor and the floating head that cannot be locked.    Panasonic discussion: Panasonic had developed an outstanding shaver line some ten years ago. My old ES8067 still shaves closer than this new \\&quot;NANO Technology\\&quot;- a misnomer (marketing gimmick). I think the reason is that Panasonic&#x27;s older models came with cutting blades with the individual blades having been about half the width of all of Panasonic&#x27;s newer cutting blades (including replacements). This means more surface area on the newer blades and that means less cutting. Remington has the ideal blades (that Panasonic used to make) and it shows in closer cutting and less time spent doing so. Additionally, these new Panasonic \\&quot;Arc Foil\\&quot; shavers have the foil curving AWAY from your face at the ends of the foil, further decreasing exposure to the blades and requiring many more passes to cover the same area. Unfortunately, Panasonic puts their better motor (13,000 RPMs) only on these ill-conceived \\&quot;Arc Foil\\&quot; designs. Battery time on the Panasonics is the shortest of all shavers reviewed here. The Panasonic trimmers are so narrow, on all of these models, that you will not be able to trim sideburns with one attempt. You will have to re-position the trimmer to get what you missed. This increases the probability that you will get an uneven sideburn.    The Remington MS2-390 has the blades that thePanasonics should have (and did have years ago): flat foil area (not \\&quot;Arc Foiled\\&quot;), good length (25% longer) and ultra thin cutting blades. As a result, closeness of the shave is better and time spent is shorter. This is, however, the loudest (and it is loud) of all shavers and there are no bells and whistles. Using a pre-shave oil/gel will gum up the blades, as with any shaver, but these blades pop off with even the slightest brushing so be prepared to watch them fall into the sink with every cleaning attempt. A charging stand would greatly increase the convenience of this shaver. Remington did a poor job with the details.    The Braun Series 5 8995 tries hard (you can hear noticeable slowing when necessary pressure is applied, like a lawn mower when it reaches thicker grass), but it doesn&#x27;t get quite as close as the Panasonics or Remington without leaving a stronger burning sensation after the shave. The Braun can also leave burn marks and even cuts (nose and lips) that will bleed. Odd: you would think that, with it getting so close as to actually burn the skin, it would also give a closer shave. I suppose this is proof that shavers cannot \\&quot;lift\\&quot; hairs to cut better. Additionally, the design of the handle is inferior, making positioning more difficult. It does have a much wider trimmer and longer battery life between charges, though.    The Norelco 8260 CC: I used this rotary-type of shaver for many years during the 80&#x27;s. I switched to foil and found I could get a closer shave. This is still the case. Additionally, because of the circular blades, it is somewhat difficult to target certain spots for cleanup. However, this is the quietest shaver.    PS: don&#x27;t accept the nonsense about giving your face 30 days to adjust, unless you are coming off a blade. If you are accustomed to an electric shaver, you only need a week or two to determine the difference. The only thing magical about 30 days is that you can no longer return it for a refund - what a coincidence!</li>
            <li> I bought a refurbished ES8109 shaver on Ebay.  So far, after 2 weeks of using it, I&#x27;m thrilled.    I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for over 15 years.  During that period, I&#x27;ve almost exclusively used rotaries.  However, I kept buying new ones because they either broke, shave quality wasn&#x27;t good, etc.  I was most recently using a Norelco shaver (Speed XL I think) with a jet clean unit.  I never was crazy about the shave it gave me, and the cleaning unit was messy and eventually stopped working.  Very frustrating.  I liked having a cleaning unit, so I decided to give the Panasonic a try.  With my very first shave I could tell a huge difference.  A nice close shave with little to no irritation.  It even worked well the tough spots (like on the neck).  My face never felt so smooth.  I also love being able to shave in the shower again (all the wet/dry shavers I&#x27;ve used in the past died in 1-2 years, hopefully not this one).  And the cleaning unit was awesome.  Easy to use, not messy like the Norelco one, and it even dries the razor.  The cleaning solution is pretty cheap on Amazon too (about $10 for a 3 month supply).    One suggestion.  I&#x27;ve been using shave oil (try American Crew, or Kiehl&#x27;s Shave Oil) and it&#x27;s worked very well. I tried shaving one day with Edge Gel, and maybe it shaved too close.  I ended up with a lot of irritation, even drew some blood in places.  My face felt like it was burning.  I went back to the shave oil again, and voila, another great shave.</li>
            <li> As the title mentions spending higher than average on a product doesn&#x27;t always mean you will get a higher than average product. And in my opinion the Panasonic ES8109 is one of those cases.    For the positives:  Very fast smooth motor, much more comfortable shave overall compared to the $30 shavers I have used in the past. It comes with a built in trimmer to edge up around hairlines/etc which is always a plus, but even standard on the cheaper models. The LCD display is neat and gives an accurate measurement of the battery life remaining in which I start to charge it around 10%. Speaking of charging it does come with one of the fancy smancy self cleaner&#x27;s &#x27;ala&#x27; more profit for Panasonic on accessories(need&#x27;s cartridges).    For the negatives:  Honestly, I could swear I&#x27;ve gotten a closer shave with the Panasonic ES4026NC ($25 Shave mind you). The upside of the ES8109 is that is does to a better job at getting neck hairs, but still has yet to impress me. For the most part I have to work at it to get most hairs, about 95% at best. It still cannot get all of them and this is the biggest downfall on top of the OK quality shave, really nothing to brag about on this shaver. Also the first cartridge didn&#x27;t even last the whole month, and this was after hearing someone being able to use it twice over. I reinserted the cleaner cartridge to see if I could get more out of it but ran into a couple problems. The first being that yes, the cartridge was really used up, after it was done &#x27;cleaning&#x27; quite a bit of hairs were still around the razor. Secondly, the station will not let you select the clean option once it recognizes a dirty cartridge. All in all on the clean/charge station, I honestly think its a waste of a plug and money on cartridges. And as a funny little side note, the adapter plug does make an annoying high pitched squealy noise. Of course it&#x27;s not loud and is inaudible probably more than 4 feet away in a quite room, but still, sounds like cheap parts to me.    Andthere you have it, take my opinions as you will but I just find for the price this shaver sells at, far exceeds what it can actually do. Like I said it isn&#x27;t all bad but at the end of the day I rate this shaver as  \\&quot;It&#x27;s OK\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> My husband has very sensitive skin and he is pleased that it does not irritate his face. He says that it works best when used with shaving cream. He likes the cleaning feature, although it took him a while to get used to it - the directions weren&#x27;t as good as they should have been.</li>
            <li> After of over one year of use, I am going to throw it away.  It is noisy (angry bee hive) needs a razor blade to get remaining stubble to a cleaner shave and side burn trimmer is useless.  I would never recommend this product no matter how well it is recommended.</li>
            <li> This product was a good buy.  While it did not provide as close of a shave as I hoped for, it did not irritate my face and cleanup was easy.  It takes about five minutes to fully shave with this product, I have found that I have to go over areas of my face multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning function of the base works well, but it is very noisy and takes a long time.  The battery life of the shaver is more than adequate, it should last for between five and seven shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this product is touted as suitable for wet use, I found that the shave quality suffers greatly unless you rinse off the shaver and your face every couple passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product with a moderate price.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my boyfriend to use for when he stood over at my place.  he has baby facial hair (i make him shave his barely-a-man beard) so i couldn&#x27;t really give it a honest review.      but last christmas my parents came to stay for the holidays, and well, my dad took the darn shaver!  i didn&#x27;t realize it was gone until my boyfriend asked to use it and i eventually asked my parents if they saw it (apparently my father believed he should take the liberty of possessing all non-feminine items in my home for as long he can benefit from them).    anyhow, my dad raves how great it is and how it doesn&#x27;t bother his skin at all (i noticed a difference after inspecting my dad&#x27;s face that wasn&#x27;t as red or irritated).  my dad is in his fifties and has a beard that can grow almost as long as santa claus, so i was happy for him.    so in my books, this is a true winner (plus i only paid $70 in total for a brand new set from amazon).  so try to get it with the lowest price available and you, too, can have an excellent product at a great steal.</li>
            <li> I am 71 and was finding it increasingly difficult to shave with a razor as beard was not only grayish white but harder to cut.  Perhaps any electric shaver would be better than what I was doing.  So based on reviewers comments on Amazon I purchased this shaver and observe that not only do I get a closer shave, which surprised me, but a more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I have no complains about this shaver. Very good quality as expected from Panasonic.  The neatest thing about it is the care of it -cleaning- you just put it in the cradle push a button and the next time you use it is nice and clean.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Panasonic ES8109 for about 7 months now.  Prior to this I was a Norelco user for nearly 25 years.  Why did I decide to try something different?  I found that over the last 10 years or so the quality of the Norelco products and the shave I received were both decidely in decline.  Even right out of the box, the Norelco shave quality was marginal, and my face still felt like 100 grit sandpaper after working it over for 5 minutes.  The Panasonic was an entirely different story.  I have always used a dry shave, and the Panasonic gave me a smooth shave in the same amount of time.    I use the Panasonic hydrasonic cleaning device that came with it whenever the shaver gets around a 60-70% charge on it, which in my case is about 5 shaves.  It still is giving me a great shave.  The sideburn trimmer does a better job than the Norelco and operates at a higher trimming speed.  I am on my third box of cleaner inserts for the cleaning unit, and each insert seems to last about 3 weeks.  I bought the replacements through Amazon.  The unit restores the shaving head unit and screen to their original condition.  I have not noticed any deterioration of the blades so far, unlike the Norelco that seemed to fade after 4-5 months and you had press very hard to get even a marginal shave!    I would recommend this shaver for a good, close shave.  I&#x27;m impressed with the quality of workmanship.</li>
            <li> I almost never write reviews, so why am I writing one now ? Because I think a lot of people will benefit from what I have to say. I&#x27;ve been using the Norelco Spectra 8894XL rotary for years. I guess if it&#x27;s good for 007 it&#x27;s good enough for me. Movie advertising really does work. Before that I was a blade person. I still use the blade occasionally when I want a smooth shave.     The Norelco never could come close to the blade even with the Spectra set to the closest shave setting. So why did I go to the electric shaver. Speed and convenience. Don&#x27;t need to worry about packing shaving cream when I fly. It still always took at least 6 minutes for the Spectra to do a reasonable job. Three to four years ago, when I had to replace the Spectra blades I thought I would take a look at the foil shavers. I went on to Amazon and read the reviews. There really did not appear to be a major difference between the rotary and foil products. Each had enough offsetting pluses an minuses so I didn&#x27;t really see a clear winner. I stayed with the Spectra.    Finally , a few weeks ago my Spectra battery died. I opened up the case, saw that the battery was basically soldered to a circuit board. Thanks a lot Norelco. Time to look at some alternative options. First thing I did was go to Amazon. They have the most thorough reviews for these types of products on the web. Reviews from a lot of other web sites are basically copy and pasted from Amazon. After I read the reviews, and looked at the distribution of ratings, it appeared that the Panasonic foil product line was getting consistently higher reviews vs other foils and the rotaries. When you see the number of reviews rated 5 or 4 vs the number at 1 or 2, and the 5/4&#x27;s outnumber the 1/2&#x27;s by almost 9 to 1, it&#x27;s time to start paying attention. And this wasn&#x27;t just for the Panasonic foil I bought, which was the ES8109S, but all of the Panasonics were getting consistently high reviews. One recommendation, Amazon, is you should come up with anaverage rating number. Just helps a little, especially if there are a large number of reviews.    I settled with the ES8109S. Best price for the features and technology, including the cleaning unit. Just $20 more than the bare bones shaver. If the cleaner becomes a pain, just don&#x27;t use it. For $104 on Amazon, it was worth a try. Got the shaver yesterday. I read the directions. Panasonic needs to hire some better technical writers. Their instructions are in a treasure map format. It&#x27;s all there, but you need to cipher to break the code. Just a few more sentences and better organized layout,  and I think they could sell more units, especially if people download the manual before they buy a product. I have an advanced engineering degree and it still took me an inordinate amount to time to figure out what the hell they were talking about. What&#x27;s a \\&quot;course\\&quot; ? Replace that word with \\&quot;sequence\\&quot; and use some other American English words in some other instances and the manual will be more readable. Panasonic, hire some good American English technical writers. Please.    Finally, I set up the shaver and the cleaner while heeding all the warnings delineated in the manual. Nothing blew up or smoked, or spilled. That was a good sign. Charged the unit overnight and tried it out in the morning. I was more than impressed. How can I make up for all the time I lost using the stupid Spectra ? It took me less than half the time, under 3 minutes, to get a shave that was far better than what the Spectra will ever be capable of, and that&#x27;s coming from a foil \\&quot;virgin\\&quot;. FYI, I don&#x27;t have a very heavy beard, but enough to frighten the cat in the morning. Face burn, not a problem with this unit. The shave rivaled the blade. Rotary users, take a look the this Panasonic line next time you&#x27;re in the market. The learning curve is non-existent. I was a little reluctant making the change to a foil, and I&#x27;m glad I switched.</li>
            <li> This shaver replaced a Braun. So far I have to say that this one is far superior!</li>
            <li> i bought this because i shave my head, and my earlier norelco was worn out.  i did not realize how worn out my old shaver was until i used this one.  the shave is really very good and surprisingly close.  the unit is easy to clean, including a mode where you rinse it and then just put it in the cradle and select the dry option.  the battery lasts long enough to do about 4 or 5 days of shaving with it.    the only real drawback is that the straight cutting surface (as opposed to the floating heads of the norelco) means that you have to make a lot of passes over curved surfaces like the head, and it can be kind of harsh on thin skin.  as my skin toughens up a bit and i learn a new pattern, this is getting better.    overall a very good shaver.</li>
            <li> I reserched a TON of electric razors as I did a few years ago. I had been using a Panasonic and LOVED my old razor, but it gave out on me. The reviews for this model were so good, I trusted them as I trusted the reviews that were accurate about my last panasonic. Unfortunately, this razor is TERRIBLE for my sensitive skin.    I&#x27;m a female, with pale skin and thick dark hair, and I suffer from folliculitis which means when I shave I get infected hair follicles. That&#x27;s why I HAVE to use an electric razor. Well, this razor causes such awful ingrowns my legs have constant scabs because I need to dig the hairs out from underneath my skin. NOT GOOD!!!! I wish I knew why it caused ingrowns because I can&#x27;t figure it out.    Also, reviews stated that the shave is such a close clean shave that you need one pass... uhh, not with my experience. I had to keep going back and forth over the same area about 4-5 times to get all the hair shaved.    So for me, wish to GOD I would not have bought this razor. It wasn&#x27;t cheap and now I have to go looking for another one. : (</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as a Christmas gift. He loves it and comments frequently about how well it works. He uses it in the shower and above the sink. It cleans itself well and he charges it less than once a week. I think it does a great job of shaving closely and taking care of his sensitive skin. He&#x27;s had it since Christmas and has not even thought about replacing any parts or the blade - it still works like a champ! We&#x27;re both very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Best shaver ever. close shave and zero irritation. I have sensitive skin and had an issue of ingrown hairs, but now I get none. Highly reccommended!</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for a year and half now. It still works great. I have been changing out the hydroclean insert about every 3 or 4 months and the blades once a year. I have found that squirting a little hand soap on top of the blades and running the razor about 20 seconds every now and then helps keep the blades fresh smelling.  The charging/cleaning stand is a very good idea and gives you a good place to store it between shaves. This razor is not as good as the Norelco on shaving the curves under your neck so I keep a waterproof Norelco in the shower to \\&quot;finish up&#x27; while I take a shower. Hey, it works for me!</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver because it was the cheapest self-cleaning model I could find. I was not disappointed. Not having to clean it is a huge time saver, and it&#x27;s surprisingly gentle. I&#x27;ve actually managed to cut myself with electric shavers before (don&#x27;t ask me how that works, I don&#x27;t know) but not with this one.    A huge bonus to it is that it&#x27;s able to work through a few days&#x27; growth. Previously, I had to use the trimmers on electric shavers if I&#x27;d forgotten to shave for a few days. With this model, I simply have to very lightly run it back and forth along the grain (as per the instructions) and it is able to cut down my beard millimeter by millimeter, much less hassle than using a razor.    Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric razor that I&#x27;ve purchased and been satisfied with.  Granted the previous 2 were rougly $50 or $60, so you can&#x27;t expect anything more than average from them.  The price I bought it at (approx. $110) was a steal for its simplicity and usability.  It&#x27;s a wet/dry razor, so I always use it in the shower.  Drop it into the cleaner/charger and it&#x27;s ready to go the next day (my job requires a face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s caboose).  It does take awhile for it to go through the cleaning cycle, but I doubt that the majority of (wo)men using this razor need to shave every 2 1/2 to 3 hours.    Now the big disappointment with the razor has been the quality of the shave.  On a good day, it gets about 90% of the job done.  On a bad day, probably 75%.  I have to come in and clean up with a hand razor.</li>
            <li> This thing rocks!!  I have tryed others but they do not compare.. 13,000 rpms!!! DO I NEED TO SAY MORE?</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for about three weeks now and am either going to return it or give it away for the ES-LA93-K.      It&#x27;s good on my face but not on my neck.  It simply does not shave close enough to make my neck feel smooth like a blade.  My Panasonic wet/dry that I purchased more than ten years ago did a much better job.  This razor is way over-rated.    It&#x27;s OK as a dry razor but one would think that using it wet would give a close shave.  It does NOT!!!  I don&#x27;t have a thick beard, just an average one.    Please read the reviews for the higher end Panasonic razors.  I do not recommend this version.</li>
            <li> This is my First Electric Razor.. and I am 30 now..  so it explains that I did not want to try one because of the sensitive skin.  I got this after going through all the reviews even the once with 1s and 2s..  apparently the lower ratings were not for the shaving effectiveness at all.  So I did get this one..  It has been a month now...  I am a professional, explains to be clean shaven every day..  so that is what I do, Shave every day.  And this razor does a clean and close shave that rivals the hand razors.  Its dry wet option is good as well.  My skin is very sensitive, but this razor does not irritate the skin at all.  Did not jump into the next gen in this systems because of the price factor.  The cleaning system does take a while, but again you do not use this to clean every day.  Charging is pretty fast, for a quick shave just few minutes should be good.    Love this razor so far.  San.</li>
            <li> I was very favorably impressed with this shaver and agree and thank all those who wrote good reports about it before!</li>
            <li> I love the close shave I can get with this shaver. I am also impressed with the HydraClean system as it is a big improvement from their old models. The clean shaver icon takes to long to come on and I much prefer the reminder on the Braun models however this shaver is way superior in every other. I am sure it will out last my LAST Brauns 90 day life span. Great quality, battery life, high speed motor and sharp blades make any Vortex Panasonic a good choice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using a Braun Activator for almost 5 years until just recently when it started to poop-out and self destruct on me. I tried switching to a blade just to save a few bucks, but I could find no combination of products or techniques that did not result in severe irritation on my neck.     Recently, I was at a major club/warehouse store and saw this shaver on sale for $99. I had never used a Panasonic shaver before, but the price was right and I liked that it had the self-cleaning system like my old Braun. Also, the box claims that it has the \\&quot;sharpest blades\\&quot; and \\&quot;one of the fastest motors\\&quot; among its competitors. I don&#x27;t know how true those claims are, but here is my experience so far:    Pros:  I am very impressed with this shaver after about one week. As a direct comparison to my old Braun, the results of the shave are as good as ever. Nice, close shave with practically no irritation. However, it seems to one-up the Braun in one very interesting way- the motor never bogs down in the heavy sections of my beard. My old Braun had to be slowly and gingerly moved around my chin hair or else it would struggle, and this happened even with a brand new cutting block and foil. The Panasonic seems to have no issue at all with the chin beard. It just cruises right through the thickest parts with no signs of struggle. And that means less effort on my part, which I appreciate.    Cons:  The cleaning and drying selections on the stand aren&#x27;t incredibly intuitive, however. My old Braun just had to be plopped into its stand and it figured out what it needed to do on its own. The Panasonic has options for a few different modes, but I&#x27;m not sure which is the best method yet. The instruction manual is pretty useless in this regard as well.     The cleaning solution may only last a couple of weeks depending on how often you use it. The more you use it, the longer it should last (what?) even if that&#x27;s only one month tops. The Braun&#x27;s solution could last for 3 months usually.     Panasonic also claims that the foil and cutting block should be replaced every 12 months. That combo costs $50 (from the manufacturer, could be cheaper through another source) whereas the Braun block and foil were good for 18 months and cost around $40-45 dollars to replace. Not a huge difference, but perhaps something to consider.    Also, it sounds like some others here have had issue with the durability of these shavers. I thought my Braun&#x27;s run of almost 5 years was pretty decent. Hopefully the Panasonic can make a similar run.    Conclusion:  Given the results of the shave so far, I am thoroughly impressed with this product. Considering that I paid $99 (plus tax), and it shaves as close and comfortably as my old $250 Braun, I don&#x27;t think I could do any better. I would highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all the other shavers and after 2 months of use I like this one best. Much faster and closer than the norelco(and less irritation), the Remington was so noisy and irritating I only used it for a few weeks, I liked the Braun as well as the Panasonic when it was new but it went downhill from there and didn&#x27;t improve with new cutter and screen. I&#x27;ve only used this one for two months but so far it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to adapt. I&#x27;m in the process but this has been really good so far. And the razor is amaizing...</li>
            <li> This is my first electric/ cordless shaver and I realy like it,does a great job. I will tell my friends about this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit after researching it for 2 weeks and found that for the price it had the best review.  I bought it for my husband as a Christmas gift. However, he didn&#x27;t open it and use it until we came back from vacation because I didn&#x27;t want to carry the box in my suitcase.  When he used it the 1st time it didn&#x27;t shave around the adams apple very well.  He tried both wet/dry with and without shaving cream.  The instructions made it clear that it might take 30 days for your beard to get used to it, so don&#x27;t give up.  As is it turned out he tried it for 10 days and it would not make it better.  I decided to call Panasonic to get my money back because that&#x27;s what it said on the book and now they are refusing to give me the money back because it was only for 30 days after purchase (including the day that you buy it online, not even from the day that you receive it).  I explained to them that he only used for 10 days and that the waranty said 30 days and they didn&#x27;t agree.    So, if you are going to buy this for a present make sure that if you don&#x27;t like return it right away or you are stuck with the razor or a re-furbished one.    I will never buy another Panasonic product again.  Too bad for them because half of my house appliances and electronics are Panasonic but if this is the customer service that they offer it is not worth it.</li>
            <li> I used to take the time to shave with a blade - various types - from Bic disposables to the more expensive and \\&quot;advanced\\&quot; multiple blade models. The shaves were always close, but I have always found my neck and mustache area to be tough to shave closely without abit of razor burn or a nick. My beard is medium heavy, although I am no Geico Caveman or Robin Williams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also had almost all brands of electrics, from the best models of Norelco, Braun, Remington, etc. Rotary head shavers always cut my neck up, whether they have \\&quot;sensitivity adjustments\\&quot; on them or not. Always. Anyhow, many hundreds of dollars later, I decided to try one of the Panasonic linear wet/dry shavers I had seen advertised for so long. I had 30 days to try it, so I thought I had nothing to lose except a little shipping charge back if it was a dud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many shaves later - first dry, then with a little shaving gel, I am very happy with this shaver. It provides, after a few gentle passes, a shave I think is as close as any blade ever gave me, without burning me. It&#x27;s a cinch to clean, and since I don&#x27;t travel much, working only uncorded does not bother me at all. Battery life is fine. Unlike some reviewers, I am not bothered by the hum or high pitched noise it makes. If you want very fast speed and use an electric shaver, expect abit of noise. Compared to my father&#x27;s old shaver I recall, this is very, very quiet. If the noise bothers you, either use a blade or perhaps listen to music while you&#x27;re shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I did not spend extra money for the model with the self cleaning business. Why take up extra counter space with something to put this in, at extra cost, when this is so simple to clean my six year old grandson could do it? This works great, takes up little space, has a nice easy to read display, charges fast, and unless I run into serious problems (although with a 2 year parts and labor warranty I am not worried) in the next year or more, I am sure it can be handled and I might by that time upgrade it. I like the feel in my hand also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: If you like electric shavers, don&#x27;t mind a fast motor slight humming noise, like a close shave with options of wet or dry shaving, and don&#x27;t want to worry anymore about razor burn or bumps or not getting a close shave, then this is the shaver for you! I would skip the higher end models with \\&quot;self cleaning,\\&quot; since this is so easy to clean, but that&#x27;s up to you. I look forward to the next improvement on this shaver, but until then I am happy, I got it for less than $100., and if I change in even two years, I got more than my money&#x27;s worth!by that time upgrade it. I like the feel in my hand also.     Bottom line: If you like electric shavers, don&#x27;t mind a fast motor slight humming noise, like a close shave with options of wet or dry shaving, and don&#x27;t want to worry anymore about razor burn or bumps or not getting a close shave, then this is the shaver for you!

            <li> This was on my son&#x27;s wish list so I bought it for Christmas. He really loves it and comes with high recommendations.</li>
            <li> My husband likes everything that is easy for him and he uses it everyday!!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone!!</li>
            <li> Tried this shaver for a couple weeks. Tried to let my skin &#x27;get accustomed&#x27; to a foil shaver. After those two weeks, the shave was still as bad as the first day. No matter what I tried, I couldn&#x27;t get it to shave the sides of my neck properly. I went over the same areas dozens of times, making my skin practically raw, and it failed to provide a clean shave. In places where it did shave, my skin felt sensitive and inflamed afterwards.  It did give a good shave in some areas but most still felt rough. And then there was my neck that just didn&#x27;t work at all.    The cleaner is nice, although quite loud and pretty cheap-looking. I didn&#x27;t get the feeling it would last very long.     This may work for some people but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the way it shaved. You had to make several passes to get a decent shave. Went back to Braun.</li>
            <li> Good shaver, I like the cleaning station. Takes longer to shave than a blade, but the convenience is nice. The pros outweigh the cons.</li>
            <li> Good quality item, sent fast by Amazon!  I recently started my year-long deployment to Afghanistan and wanted a good shaver that charged and cleaned.  And this is that!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about another electric razor.  My last one did not shave closely and would not cut some of the fine hair on my neck under my chin.  Because I am taking Chemo treatments for cancer, my doctor told me to use an electric razor to avoid cuts. My immune system is low and I risk infections.    The first time I used the razor I was really impressed. I used a shaving cream on my face and started shaving with the Panasonic ES81095.  When I finished, my skin was smooth and I could not feel any stubble at all.  It felt as smooth as a babies face! I have used it for about three weeks and noticed that if I skipped a day, my face feels like I had already shaved that morning. My wife couldn&#x27;t tell I had not shaved the second day.  I seems the razor cuts below the skin surface by pushing up the hair follicles as it shaves.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8109S Vortex wet/dry shaver with nano technology and hydra clean system is the best shaver I ever used. No having to take a not so good product back, no having to buy a different shaver over and over before I get one that works as the product description says. That is so huge. I can only say thank you for being and doing what you say you are and do. It gives a smooth shave too.</li>
            <li> Ok, this is only my second electric razor. I have been shaving with a blade for over 40 years. Actully mostly just trimming around a full beard because shaving with a blade every day is painfull, at least for me. With a full beard, I just trim it my upper checks and around and under my neck every other day or so.    I decided to clean shave with a blade for a while and give my face a break. Now I know why I have not been shaving clean for all those years. It is a pain, literally, to shave with a blade every day. After reading all of the reviews, and especially the wet/dry capabilities, I decided the ES8109S was the one for me to try. Now, I am glade I did. Although it takes longer to shave than with a blade, especially if you want to get a close (Blade) shave, I can do it every day without any pain or nicks.    It feels good to use and can run over areas several times without any burning, even dry. I do have a heavy beard that grows very rapidly. My 5 o&#x27;clock shadow looks likes most peoples 3rd day without shaving. Anyway, I will try to update as I have time behind this electric, but for now, for those wanting to try an electric, I think you will be pleasantly surprised how close you can shave without any burn.</li>
            <li> Have always used Norelco for over 35 years, but was not satisfied with the current one I had, the one that dispenses Nivea shave cream. Saw the reviews of this on line and ordered it. It came with 10% battery power so I tried it. Closest shave with a cordless razor ever! It is noisy when you clean it, but I do it in the morning and then leave for work. Trimmer works good on sideburns too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for over 20 years, both linear and rotary, and this one is by far the best. I loved my previous Panasonic Wet/Dry, but the ES8109S is substantially better. I&#x27;ve used it for about a year now.    It is definitely important to allow a few weeks for your skin to adapt. Reports of razor burn might come from those who are too impatient, pressing too hard or too long in one place while shaving, especially in the first few weeks of use. Keep the razor moving!    The battery lasts well between charges and maintains strong motor power throughout the discharge cycle, rather than fading slowly as the battery discharges.    The pop-up trimmer works really well too. I use it to clean up my neck, sideburns, ears, nose, and unruly eyebrows.    I prefer not to use the pivoting head, so I&#x27;m glad that it can be locked in place.    I don&#x27;t use the cleaning function in the base, I only use the base for charging. Manual cleaning is quick and easy.     Easy to use, easy to charge, easy to clean, great battery life... A real gem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit loud but I don&#x27;t think my husband has ever had a closer shave.  Easy to clean.  Just set it and forget it!.  It made an excellent christmas present this year. I think this was a great product.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the es8109s so far. For the first month it is shaving quite nicely. It feels better than the Panasonic I used for the past four years. I will wait and see if it is the razor or the new blades that are doing a better job on my \\&quot;difficult\\&quot; spots.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my fiance for Christmas.  It has been great. Very close shave.  Less ingrown hairs than with his previous razors.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I hate electric razors.That is until now.I&#x27;m a Gilette Fusion man,a wet shaver who needs more lubrication than Joan Rivers on date night.I&#x27;m 42 this month and have worn a goatee forever.You see for me the most sensitive part to shave has always been the mustache and chin area.The hair in that area is the heaviest and thickest and shaving it with a disposable or anything for that matter left it raw,red and sometimes pimpily.Yes at 42 I still suffer from occasional acne,Mother Nature has a sense of humor.  Now my goatee has alot of gray in it and it really makes me look older than I&#x27;d like to.So I searched,researched and inquired as to what electric razor could do the job of shaving 10 years off my face.I arrived at the Panasonic ES8109 Wet/Dry Shaver.I&#x27;m a firm believer in the art of wet shaving and would NEVER drag a dry razor across my face so the wet feature appealed to me.Here&#x27;s how the first try went and the products I use to obtain a great shave.  First I trimmed my goatee down a bit with the pop out trimmer on the unit,a great feature in itself.Then I took a hot shower to soften up the hair.I fill the sink with HOT water and lube up my face with King Of Shaves Gel.Hands down the slickest most soothing gel ever created! The King Of Shaves line is THE BEST for anyones skin.Tea Tree Oil,Vitamin E and all kinds of nutrients for your face.  Now I&#x27;m ready.I turn it on and make a few practice swipes above my face to get the feel of the razor and the proper angles.I recall a previous reviewers advice,\\&quot; Keep the razor moving \\&quot;, I dip it in the water and start erasing the years.  Almost instantly I&#x27;m impressed,it&#x27;s removing hair painlessly and in one or two passes tops.I continue on keeping the razor wet as well as my face.I&#x27;m shocked at how close a shave this electric is giving me,the technology for shaving has finally arrived!  I finish up shaving off my goatee and am very pleased.No cuts and no irritation and smoooooooth baby!  Now remember I only bought this to shave my goatee and it did a great job.But I finish up my shave with a Gilette Fusion Power razor.I&#x27;ve suffered from cystic acne on my neck and cannot afford to experiment on that area.A Fusion with a downward stroke,NEVER upward,does the job for me so if it ain&#x27;t broke.........  That&#x27;s it,this Panasonic shaves as smooth as a Fusion.The vortex cleaner is sweet,you can charge and dry this baby when you&#x27;re done and clean it every week or two.  All the great reviews are true,this is the elite of electric shavers and should cost twice what you&#x27;ll get it for on Amazon.Buy the Vortex it&#x27;s worth it.  ......And my last product.Anthony Logistics Ingrown Hair Treatment for Men</li>
            <li> This is by far the best electric shaver I have used from the quality of shave I get from it.  It&#x27;s comfortable with no irritation and gets a very close shave for an electric.  Not quite as close as a blade but close enough.  I have used it shaving dry and wet and had good results both ways but the wet yields the closest shave which I tend to use the most.  I generally use shaving gel and it works real well and is convenient being able to shave in the shower.  The cleaning base stand works very well and keeps the shaver in tip top order.  The cleaning cartridges are kinda spendy and I can&#x27;t find them anywhere locally so I have to order them from Amazon which is inconvenient.  About a month or so ago I purchased my second set of replacement cutters and foil as I tend to change them both once a year.  For the past couple months the LCD display started to go out but that didn&#x27;t bother me as the shaver still worked.   Unfortunately last week I hopped in the shower to shave and the shaver was dead.  It worked fine the day before and was charged a day prior and when I hit the switch there was nothing.  Total bummer!  I&#x27;m torn on what to do now.  I have a set nearly new cutters and foil and two spare cleaning cartridges and no shaver.  I&#x27;ve had to go back to me old Norelco 9160XL and it totally sucks!  It doesn&#x27;t get nearly as close a shave.  I&#x27;m reluctant to try one of the new Panasonic Arc IV&#x27;s because of the ridiculous cost of replacement cutters.  Looks like I&#x27;ll probably buy another one these even if it does last less than 3 years again.</li>
            <li> I just received the Panasonic ES8109s Vortex a few hour ago. This will be my first impressions rather than a long term quality review.  I think a long term usage review is more useful to know if your hard earned money is being well spent. But I was immediately impressed with the Vortex after the first use, I had to write a review.  This is only my second electric razor.  I did not enjoy the first, so I switched to a Gillet.    The first thing you will notice is the weight and the comfortable handle (I have small hands).  It is much heavier than it looks and the build quality is great (so far).  Skipping the minor details... After not shave for a week, I shaved dry for the first use.  This razor works amazingly!!! My previous experience with electric razors left me with bad impressions of razor burn and skin irritation.  So I was skeptical of spending $100+ on another electric.     I can tell you, shaving dry is great.  No pulling, pinching, and especially NO RAZOR BURN!!!! Who cares if it does not get it it all in one pass.  The point is, even on multiple passes, I did not get the usual skin irritation. I consider my skin to be relatively sensitive.  Keep in mind I have not used an electric for years and have not had the 30 day face break in period.     HERE  IS WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW:       For the actual shave; this thing shaves as close as any straight wet razor.  No shaving prep needed (lotions, gel, or any other lubricants).  I went from the box to my face. And the results left my face as smooth as if I had used shaving cream and a good straight razor. SMOOTH as a baby&#x27;s bottom!   Spending this much money, for something, is always a hard decision when all you have to go on is the words of others.  Rest assured that this product is well worth the investment.  I read many reviews on electric razors and I took a chance on this razor.  Glad I did.</li>
            <li> I have had an assortment of electric razors over the past 30 years and by far this is the best one yet.  The only complaint I have is that it does not seem to hold the charge as well as other razors I have had in the past.</li>
            <li> I got this because I wanted to save some money. There was a deal where I could get this for about $49 with a rebate. An 8 pack of Gillette Fusion blades are now going for $30 a pop. I figure this thing would save some blade purchases for a while. The wet dry feature was also a selling point. I would never get a razor that&#x27;s dry only. This thing chafes enough as it is. For every day use, it&#x27;s ok. I&#x27;ll still use blades for touch up or special occasions. Bottom line, it does the job adequately.</li>
            <li> This is my first Panasonic Razor. I usually buy Brauns. First off let me say that this Panasonic Razor is excellent. When you first take it out of the box make sure you give it a FULL charge for the first time usually takes around 2 1/2hrs to FULL Charge. It takes some time for your skin to get used to this eletric razor, but that really goes for any electric razor...but as soon as your face and neck is used to this razor it is awesome from there! This razor is on the small side compared to other Brands like Braun and Norelco. Since it is on the small side  you actually get a good grip of it in your hand which is cool because the razor is under total control with a good grip. The sound is pretty average for eletric razors...not too loud, not too quiet...pretty decent sound. You can actually hear how fast the blades are moving...an amazing 13,000rpms which is fast for an electric razor......Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with my first purchase of a Panasonic Electric Razor........I would definately recomended purchasing this Razor....best of all is the price $$$  compared to expensive Brauns and Norelcos....but this razor will give you the same quality if not better then those brands !  Thanks Amazon for the Fast FREE Shipping !  Overall Great Buy !</li>
            <li> I had looked at powered shavers with skepticism but Im happy to have been proved otherwise.  This is a neat product and I got it at a great price.   It does a take a little getting used to, especially for someone who had never used one of these before. The dry and wet functions performs well. My stubble isnt very stubborn and that possibly helps.    The battery held up well and the blades did well. I will probably add to this comment in a few months to let you know how it stood the test of time.  Very easy to set up and use and it takes around 2-3 passes to catch all the bristles.   Used it in the shower too and all in all, an excellent value for the money.</li>
            <li> I really looked forward to receiving this product and trying out simply based on all the great reviews it received. Its well thought out, well built, easy to clean and has a lot of potential. The downside was that it took forever to shave. I intentionality grew my beard out (1 week of hair) to test its cutting ability and I was really disappointed. Its a good stubble remover. I eventually had to pull my regular andis shaver and clean the areas that the Vortex couldn&#x27;t do. It did my cheeks really well but the jaw line, throat and neck all failed. The time I spent trying to get a clean shave eventually irritated my skin leading to lots of razor bumps and then led to me not being able to shave for one week and having to remove a lot of ingrown hairs. I gave it a three because of the hydra clean system and ease to clean, dry and charge. This shaver will compliment your other shavers but definitely will not be a replacement.</li>
            <li> I had a really good experience with this seller, he is very professional and i received my item in prompt time and i definitly recommend buying from this seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a Panasonic shaver fan but this one is the best I&#x27;ve ever bought.  The cleaning function works great and keeps the blades in much better condition for like new shaves everytime.  I can shave for many days in a row without irritation.</li>
            <li> nice machine  i dont have too much hair in my face but anyway it is good for me and i like it.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco was doing a terrible job on my beard. Time for a change . . . I knew I didn&#x27;t want to go back to the Braun that I had before the Norelco so I read a few reviews and found this Panasonic. The difference is unbelievable! I&#x27;ve been using the new shaver for about two weeks now with Neutrogena shave cream (low foam, great smell) and this is by far the closest, smoothest shave I can ever remember having. I will never go back to dry shaving with one of those other shavers. The Panasonic also has several different selectable functions (clean, dry, charge, etc.) that can be used individually or together for a complete refresh of the unit. After a shave I remove the foil and rinse the foil and cutting head under running water and then put the razor back in the charging stand and use the dry function to dry it for the next use.  Then I only use the complete clean cycle once a week or so which should extend the life of the cleaner cartridges. As I say, I&#x27;ve only had this shaver for two weeks but so far I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> This is my first foil shaver and after using it for about a month I am enjoying it.  I get much closer shaves than my previous rotary razor.  It holds a charge for much longer and is very easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> Performs as expected.</li>
            <li> For those of us who prefer a foil headed shaver, this is one of the best I&#x27;ve owned.  It holds a charge for a long time, cuts close and smooth, and never irritates my skin.  The sideburn trimmer works acceptably, and the % charged display is very useful when anticipating the need to recharge.  The charging/cleaning base is something unnecessary, since the shaver is waterproof and can be cleaned easily under a faucet, but it&#x27;s included.  I stopped using mine.</li>
            <li> Good close shave, good ergonomics. The wash is a good feature however the solution is expensive and unnecessary. I wash it in the sink.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a birthday gift for my husband.  Since it was rather expensive, I was concerned how he would like it.  No need for concern as he said it&#x27;s the best razor he&#x27;s ever had.  All&#x27;s well that ends well!!!  Thanks for the Deal of the Day price.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these shavers several months ago, and was not impressed. After using Braun shavers for many years, and being satisfied, I just thought I&#x27;d give a Panasonic wet/dry a try...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have just stayed with Braun. Within about 6wks of buying it, the battery began to not hold a charge more than 5-6 minutes total...and after about 3 more weeks, it just would not come on at all...dead...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The few shaves I did get were sub par at best...not very close, and made my face burn, especially when dry...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up going with yet another Braun, and it cost about $50 more...and just as the others, I love it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sticking with Braun from now on. Sorry Panasonic...in shavers, you just don&#x27;t have a clue...</li>
            <li> This electric shaver was a gift for my boyfriend, for Christmas. When he first used it, he didn&#x27;t think it was working because he couldn&#x27;t feel the shaver cutting his beard. He then realized it was working fine and it gave a painless, close shave without any pulling or tugging. In the instructions it says \\&quot;Give your beard 30 days to adjust to the new razor and it will grow out softer and easier to shave.\\&quot; So far that&#x27;s held true and it has given him a better shave then his Braun electric foil razor he previously used. The self cleaning feature works great, it fully cleans the shaver without having to take all the pieces off and manually do it. It comes with a rechargeable lithium ion battery that only takes 10 minutes to get a 100% charge. This shaver is awesome and if you&#x27;ve read this review you have to buy one!</li>
            <li> My husband loves it! Easy to use, clean and store. Shaves very well and leaves his skin smoooooooth.    Great birthday gift for him!!!!!!!!!    Thanks</li>
            <li> I received this electric razor as a Christmas gift in 2009.  It completely died on me in February 2011. Because I am beyond the 12 month period, it is out of warranty.  I don&#x27;t expect these types of electronics to last forever, but I do expect them to last more than 13 months.  Worked well when it was working, but I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband as a gift. The price is reasonable and the product looks decent. My husband likes it -especially the hydraclean system :)</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd Panasonic shaver. My first was a rotory. It was slow and battery did not last long. I enjoy this Panasonic. It gives me a close shave when I use it dry. I finally tried it wet and I was amazed that it better than dry. I would recommend this shave. The only complaint is that my wife wants me to shave more often than once a week.[[ASIN:B000VKZMHK Panasonic ES8109S Vortex Wet/Dry Shaver with Nano Technology and HydraClean System]]</li>
            <li> Bought because my husband needed to replace the heads in his old shaver.  The Panasonic came on Amazon for a great price and decided to give a try.  He loves the shaver.  Once he read all the instructions and became familiar with the shaver I don&#x27;t believe he would give it up.</li>
            <li> I bought it for a friend who likes it very much. He said that he did not use any shaver like this one before. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have been a very long time user of a Remington.  Unfortunately Remington no longer makes the kind of razor I wanted.  I purchased the Panasonic wet/dry and have been very pleased.  I have a very heavy beard which grows very fast.  The Panasonic gives me a close clean shave.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun razors since I was 17 (now 70).  Needed a replacement, but balked at $240 price tag.  Thought to try the Panasonic.   Every bit as good!  Shaves as close and as fast, and cleans as efficiently.   Definitely a good buy!</li>
            <li> I bought this as my first electric shaver after borrowing and trying many others. I wanted this specifically for two reasons:    I have sensitive skin that is easily irritated by shaving with blades, and  I was told by quite a few people that this shaver got closer than any other electric out there.    In both of those qualifiers, this was a good purchase. This shaver is way easier on my skin than shaving with blades, and allows me to shave twice daily with very little if any irritation. It is capable of achieving a very close shave in most areas, however I noticed it lacking in my neck and the bottom of my chin. I assumed it was user-error that was the problem, so on more than one occasion I tried repeated to get these areas with the shaver only to end up getting nicks and razor-burn. This shaver simply does not get those areas well on some people, and if that&#x27;s a problem for you, you may want to look at other shavers, or keep a spare blade around (which is what I do). The wet/dry function is nice, I&#x27;ve found that I tend to get really good results by shaving with it in the shower, but the hassle-free ability to pop in and shave with it real quick before going out is also very convenient.     Both the cleaning cycle and the shaver itself are VERY loud. As in, loud enough that it WILL wake up someone if you shave in a nearby room. If you work nights or early mornings, you might want to look for something more quiet, as the noise on this shaver has made it difficult for me to shave in my usual habits.     Overall though, the performance of the shaver as well as the convenience and versatility make this still a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> Received the saver for Father&#x27;s Day. It only worked for about two months before the display stopped functioning. Just mailed it to San Francisco for service (it&#x27;s still under warranty).</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver I have purchased that cost more than $25.  After purchasing cheap shavers that didn&#x27;t work and pulled hair like crazy, I decided I would never try to buy one again and just continued to use a blade.  I finally decided to try one that was more expensive and I chose this Panasonic.  I have been amazed at how great this works!!  I absolutley hate shaving and will let my hair grow for 3-4 days.  This thing has no problem with longer growth, just takes a couple more minutes.  I have only had the shaver for a little over a month so I hope this review isn&#x27;t premature but I am delighted with its performance so far.  As for the noise that other reviewer&#x27;s mention, yeah it makes a little noise but I am shaving in the bathroom and not concerned the least bit with the amount of noise it makes.  For as good a job as this thing does, I wouldn&#x27;t care if it was as loud as my lawnmower!  To go a step further; my wife even tried it on her legs and was exstatic about how good it done.  She would rather use mine than her women&#x27;s shaver.  She has also asked for the same one for Christmas.  The best of all, I didn&#x27;t spend a fortune on it like some of the other ones are priced at.  If you hate shaving and hate the irritation that goes along with using a regular blade (even the Mach 3) this is what you need.  For the cleaning station, I dont have much to say about it yet as I have only used it about 3 times.  So far so good!!!</li>
            <li> i was very pleased with the razor that i order for my husband for christmas  i had fast and prompt service had it in time for christmas and he enjoyed the gift  thank you for your prompt service wlm</li>
            <li> I have used it for over a year. What amazes me is the battery, which is much better than my previous model of Panasonic shaver. I do not have much facial hair, so this model with 3 blades is pretty good to me. The only thing I don&#x27;t like it is the cleaning system broke down less than a year after I started to use it. I googled it everywhere and there is no way you can purchase it separately.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Panasonic ES8109S in Dec. 2011 and have never had an electric shaver as good as this one.  It gives you a very close shave.  After using a Grundig for several years, this one is unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two months use the LED&#x27;s went out. I could not tell how much reserve was left.  Amazon sent me another shaver.  The same thing happened after another two months use.  I had to return it to the Panasonic repair center in Texas.  Lo and behold they sent me a new Panasonic ES-LA-93 three head shaver.  You get a much better shave with this shaver and so far no defects after several months use. The re-charging cleaning system is a pain, not so much the cost but it takes over 2 hours to go through the clean-charge cycle. I use it about every 2 weeks and just recharge in between with the power cord. The same senario happened to my brother with his ES8109S.</li>
            <li> Only would cut 1/2 my hair. Has to go over same spot many times to only get 3/4. Just died on me and only used like once a month as razers were better and faster. Never by Panasonic again!!</li>
            <li> A few years and it still works great!!</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this!!!</li>
            <li> This thing gets you the closest shave.  I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks and I will never go back to a straight razor or any other electric.  Well worth the extra couple of bucks.  Do yourself a favor and pick up this razor.</li>
            <li> It is a good razor with excellent shipping.  I have owned other rechareable razors and this is the best one I have used.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Panasonic shaver.  The first I dropped and broke.  I then purchased a Braun and took it back after three shaves and bought a Panasonic ES8066 which has lasted me 10 years and still works.  I finally decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the risk of replacing the blades with that shaver so far past the waranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this model (ES8109) for a month now and I typically get 3 shaves per charge.  A teenager might get the 14 shaves advertised, but that shouldn&#x27;t be the measure.  I very much like the charge indicator.  My last one didn&#x27;t have that so I had to keep it fully charged just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried the Cleaning System so no comments.  I miss the charging stand that came with my older Panasonic shaver.  This one I have to lay out to dry or put it in the Cleaning System still wet.  On the positive side, you can connect the charging cord directly to the shaver, bypassing the cleaning system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic casing on this model is thinner than previous models which will most likely equate to easier breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know Panasonic makes the best shavers out there (from my experience) but that doesn&#x27;t mean I have to like the prices, especially of their replacement blades and foils.  I just wish there was some quality competition.</li>
            <li> Have owned three electric shavers before this purchase, with my most recent two being Braun&#x27;s.  This one seems to work better and costs less than half!  I hope it lasts as long as my Braun.  Only time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very quiet, does a great job on the beard and holds a charge very well.  It seems to give me a better shave than the Braun.  Try it, I do not think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The shaver is comfortable to hold and can reach all areas of face and neck.  However, it does not provide as close a shave as a razor blade and unless you go over at least three times you will have stubble when done.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor based off of the reviews and the price (about $90).  I&#x27;ve always been very satisfied with any Panasonic products I&#x27;ve owned from phones, DVD players, to TV&#x27;s, so I was pleasantly surprised to see a Panasonic razor in the list of highly reviewed razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin which means shaving is basically a means of tearing my face apart several times a week, the summer is the worst.  I&#x27;ve tried different razors with 2 through 4 blades.  I&#x27;ve tried shaving lotions, gels, and creams.  No matter what combination I tried or direction I shaved in, my face was always left raw in certain places.  I&#x27;ve spent 20+ years dreading my morning shave.  I finally had enough and purchased this razor to see if it could make a difference.  I had tried electric razors early on (15 years ago) and wasn&#x27;t happy with the results.  I was hoping things had changed in the razor industry.  It apparently has and to a great degree!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the box I was surprised at the actual size of the razor, this isn&#x27;t a lightweight cheap feeling product, it has some mass to it and fits nicely in your hand.  Everything feels like it was made from quality materials with high standards of construction.  I haven&#x27;t used the cleaning station yet, I just charged the razor with the cord the first time.  A full charge took about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Shave:&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a lotion style shaving cream, it wasn&#x27;t cheap but I&#x27;m willing to spend a few extra bucks if it makes a difference.  You don&#x27;t need a lot of foam or cream, just a light wet coat to give your face a slick feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big difference is in the shaving technique.  With a regular razor you make 1-2 passes and move on, otherwise you risk razor burn (at least for me).  With the Panasonic I found that you can go over the same spot 2-3 times and from different directions to make sure you don&#x27;t miss anything.  You really don&#x27;t have to worry about razor burn as long as your not pressing hard.  I used slight pressure and a smooth long motion like you would normally use, but I did this in 3 directions.  My face feels like the shave was nearly as clean as a razor shave, but with zero irritation.  I think after 2-3 shaves I&#x27;ll have a pattern down that works for my particular beard growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning was a breeze.  I just rinsed the shaving cream off of the head with hot water and held the power button until the razor went into it&#x27;s 17,000rpm (you hold the power button down for 5 seconds for this) cleaning cycle.  I turned the razor off added a little hand soap to the screen and repeat the cleaning process.  When I was done I removed the screen, rinsed it out and shook off any excess water.  I then rinsed off the exposed blades, shook off excess water, and took a towel to it briefly to remove any visible moisture and set it on the counter to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I really haven&#x27;t found any at this time.  I will probably hook up the cleaning station this weekend to see how it works.  It takes up some counter space so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll keep there or not.  It seems to me that I will spend just as much time cleaning the cleaning/charge station as I would just cleaning my razor by hand after each use, but I&#x27;ll give it a shot and see if I like using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality of this razor and the comfortable shave it provided.  I will try it out for a few weeks and provide another update.  At this point I feel comfortable in recommending this razor based off of the shave I was able to get on the first use.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor.  I spent a long time looking up reviews and this one met all of my expectations.  First off it took about two weeks of using it every day for my neck line to become accustomed to it(some irritation/red bumps) and after that it has been smooth sailing.  I also use this to keep my head shaved and it does a very smooth job of that as well.  I will also add in that I hardly used a razor before mainly because it was very time consuming and at points messy and constantly having to buy blades.  I have rather thick hair on my face and head and I would blow through razors like they where going out of style so mainly I just used a beard trimmer to keep it stubbly/short and said to hell with razors but that was also a messy endeavor which left little hair clippings everywhere.  So that turned into a once a week ordeal.  With this razor I mainly use it everyday(98% of the time).  I could go upwards of three days before having to use a trimmer to bring the hair down to short enough pieces for this shaver to do its job efficiently.  However, as I said I mainly use it everyday.  It only takes a couple of moments to devour the hair that has grown in roughly a 24 hour period it also does this very neatly in the sense that I don&#x27;t have any hair to sweep up after I&#x27;m done.  Just pop the head off under the tap(or in the shower) and presto nice and clean and ready to be used.  The cleaning/charging base was neat in the beginning but I have since quit using it because I mainly use the shaver in the shower now so a quick pull apart and rinse gets it cleaner than the stand.  Now one thing that took the longest to get used to was figuring out which way the hair grows out of my face, razors where much more forgiving in that sense but you really need to find out which way the grain is going and then move against it, for that razor smooth finish so cheeks/jaw where easy it&#x27;s just the neck/under the chin that gets tricky but very possible just takes some learning.  I can pull off a razor smooth finish on my head and face with this shaver and I have been using it for about two months now and I haven&#x27;t managed to kill it yet and it doesn&#x27;t feel like the blades are dulling out or having any issues yet.  So this was well worth the money though if I could go back I would save some money and just buy the shaver by itself.</li>
            <li> I bought one in 2007 and never changed the head.  I just decided to get the whole new razor as it was ~2X the price of a new head.&lt;br /&gt;Works well and cleaning is easy by just lowering it into the sink under water with it running.  You can use turbo mode to clean but not that necessary.&lt;br /&gt;Great shave!</li>
            <li> Light weight, shaves very close..don&#x27;t get the base cleaner...you never use it..tedious cleaning process that takes too long, just rinse the thing under your tap and brush it off.  Waste of money to buy the cleaning base.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his new Panasonic ES8109S.  He shaves more often, gets a closer shave and best of all the cleaning system is the best invention ever.  Thank you Panasonic!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have never been a big foil type razor lover.  Apparently they did some work since I tried one of these 20 years ago!  This one works very well and shaves me as close if not closer than my old rotary shaver.  I have not tried it yet with shaving cream but I have not felt the need to do that yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charge lasts at least a week with daily use, I cleaned it and recharged it the first week I owned it so I am not sure exactly how long it will go but after a week it is still at 90%.  I am a very light bearded guy, YMMV!</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver a few weeks ago when the Braun I had been using for several years finally died. My intention was to replace it with a similar Braun shaver, but I was a little taken aback by the pricing. Instead, I decided to purchase the Panasonic for roughly half the price of the Braun, based on the very high ratings it had received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been very pleased with the performance so far. It gives a very close shave for an electric... not as close as a blade, of course, but the closest of any electric shaver I have used. I have not tried shaving with a gel, but I suspect that might even improve the results. It charges quickly and holds a charge well. I took it on vacation recently, and it still had 40% power after daily shaving for 8 days and no charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning cartridges are much smaller than the Braun cartridges, but this is because you have to manually add water to a small tank on that back of the charging base. This is slightly less convenient, but much less to throw away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about the shaver is that the location and angle of the trimmer is somewhat awkward for trimming a moustache, though it is perfect for sideburns. I&#x27;ve learned to use it effectively, though, so it is only a minor inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t think you can get a better shaver for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a very smooth razor that is also very quiet. The self cleaning and charging dock is very nice. This is an excellent product for the low cost.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great shaver, however, I don&#x27;t know why they bother to include the cleaner / charger stand.  I&#x27;m guessing I&#x27;ll NEVER use it.  It&#x27;s a snap to wash the heads out under the faucet and charge with the direct, plug in charger.  Saves some counter-top clutter that way.  I couldn&#x27;t bear to throw it away, so I stashed it in the closet.  Wonder how much I paid for it?</li>
            <li> After 24 years of shaving with a blade I switched to a electric razor, this  was not really my choice as I received one for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently retired from military service and started to grow a goatee (its like mandatory for retirees), my wife watched me struggle every morning trying to use a blade to get the edges of the goatee just right with out slipping and taking to much off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On christmas day I opened my razor and off I went to shave, I knew that she bought it and had not shaved for 3 days, I have a heavy beard and thought that this would be a good test for it.  The razor had a 10% charge on it out of the box and according to the manual that should be enough for 2 shaves.  I can say that it was enough for a very long first shave.  I have learned that using a electric razor it is more important that shave every day instead on leaving my beard over the days I don&#x27;t need to shave. The first shave I got was very good, it did miss a few hair on the neck as they were long and of course neck hairs tend to lay flat.  theses were removed on next few shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally by the end of the week my face hurts and this is the main reason I did not shave on my time off.  So far my face and neck do not hurt and no bleeding from the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a convert to the electric, I might have to shave more often but the relieve of the pain is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the cleaning system is very nice I put it on clean and leave when I need the razor again it is cleaned and dry ready to go.  nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I would recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
            <li> PROS:    1. Close shave  2. Good battery life  3. Cleaning system that works!    CONS:  1. HydraClean is not the quietest   2. Pop-up trimmer seems not as sturdy as my earlier Panasonic    OVERALL:  I&#x27;ve swithced from blade to shaver couple of years ago. Started using this shaver for over a month and love it. Close shave each time and the battery life is awesome. Used this shaver for a week without charging, still 50% battery left.     All in all, good value for the money spent</li>
            <li> Ok, here are my initial thoughts after four days of use.  I bought this razor based mainly on the positive reviews I read here.  A bit about my shaving history.  First of all I have a fairly heavy beard coming from a Welsh background.  For a couple of decades now I had mainly used Norelco rotaries including a high end Speed-XL for the past few years.  It would do a sorta ok job on the face and cheeks although no semblance of being as close as a blade but refused to cut the long hairs in the neck.  So I would use that as a first shave and then touch up the rough spots in the shower with a blade.  Why even use an electric at all?  Also because of my sensitive skin by using the blade, I had to skip shaving the next day.  About four or five years ago, I tried a Braun Syncro shaver, a foil type like the Panasonic.  Where it cut, it cut closer then the rotary but left huge gaps, particularly on the neck and I never could seem to get all the hair no matter how many passes I made.  So I was skeptical that the Panasonic, another foil shaver would really be better.    From the first day I used this shaver, I knew it was going to be my best electric razor ever.  Mowed right thru the hair getting most in the first pass and I shaved my entire face all within a a couple of minutes.  Did a great job on the neck as well although the hair was not too long to begin with as I had shaved the previous day.  The heads look somewhat similar to the Braun Syncro but for whatever reason, the performance difference between the two is like night and day.  In the ensuing four days, it has only gotten better.  Already my neck has become de-sensitized enough so I know I&#x27;ll be able to shave every day.  After I finish, it feels in most areas as close as a blade although truth be told, it&#x27;s not quite because the five o&#x27;clock shadow creeps in a bit earlier in the day then it did when using a blade.  However as mentioned, I can now shave every day and I think I could shave more then once a day if needbe, something I never thought would be possible.    The biggest drawback?  The NOISE!  It whines like a little jet engine!  It is be far the loudest shaver I have used, louder then the Braun and way louder then the Norelco rotary.  I live in a condo with my bathroom wall facing another unit and I really hope the noise is not bleeding thru.  That is something Panasonic needs to work on and I think I will let them know about it.  That is why I&#x27;m cutting back on my rating a bit.  Performance wise I&#x27;d give it a solid four and a half stars.    I just used the cleaner setup tonight and it did a fine job.  I don&#x27;t see the need to use it every day.  I just tap the hair out after each use and I think using this setup just a couple times a week will be fine.    If my mind changes significantly after more use, I&#x27;ll edit my review.  Things I want to try is a wet shave in the shower and to skip a day and see how it handles the extra growth but right now I&#x27;m happy I bought the razor as long as the noise isn&#x27;t bothering my neighbor.</li>
            <li> This electric razor will shave you close to a blade razor.  You don&#x27;t even feel it cutting.  At first I thought that was weird after using a Nokia Series 7 with rotary blades.  The Nokia always left my skin irritated due to constant running of the razor on one spot to get all the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic will get them with 2 or 3 runs.  You can run it deeper and more if you want to get the closest shave and it will not irritate you.  It&#x27;s simply amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some additional features are water based cleaning base (cheaper refills), super accurate sideburn trimmer, and nice display.  This razor&#x27;s price is also a winner.  To my understanding it shaves as good or better then high end Brauns or Nokias, but it has half initial and ongoing costs.</li>
            <li> After 1 month of using this shaver, I&#x27;m convinced it is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve been using a Norelco 8865 XL for several years now, and I was pretty happy with it. But if I had to shave 2 days in a row, it was a very uncomfortable experience, with a lot of irritation on my neck. And I also have always used a foil type shaver, currently a Remingtom Titanium and earlier a cheaper Braun, because I couldn&#x27;t use the 8865 to square off my sideburns with a nice straight line, or get a couple spots under my nose and lower lip. So if I traveled, I either had to take 2 shavers along or try to make due with the Norelco. The Remington gave a decent shave, but it would actually draw tiny dots of blood around the edges of my mouth, which is a bit too close for comfort. Also, I&#x27;d use it very sparingly on my neck, as it wasn&#x27;t as comfortable as the floating triple heads on the Norelco.   Now everything has CHANGED! I&#x27;ve found one shaver that does it all in the Panasonic 8109. I think it&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;m not sure why, but this shaver does not irritate my neck area at all. I don&#x27;t mean less irritation than the other 2, I mean NONE! I really can&#x27;t feel a difference on my neck where I did and didn&#x27;t use the razor. And the shave I get is nice and close. I&#x27;ve never used a blade in my life, so I have no idea how it compares, but it shaves me as close as any shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. This is a shaver and not a magic wand, so it does require several passes to get a clean shave. But I believe anybody who complains that it doesn&#x27;t shave clean with 1 pass has just never used electric before. I&#x27;d love to hear about the electric shaver that can shave clean in one pass, I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s possible. And I also feel that the poor craftsman blames his tools, and this tool will allow a very good shave when used correctly.  As for the self cleaning stand, I&#x27;m less enthusiastic. It does work as advertised and is a nice addition, but if price was my biggest concern I would get the lower model Panasonic without the HydraClean. I got mine for $108, minus a $30 instant rebate so it only cost $78. The next model down was $79 with no rebate, so taking the HydraClean version was a no brainer. And it is a cool little toy that does work well, it just isn&#x27;t a necessity like with the Braun 360. You can put some soft soap into the heads &amp; let them clean themselves because water can&#x27;t hurt this shaver, unlike the Braun.   In conclusion, I&#x27;d say the number 1 reason I like this shaver so much, is because after 30 years of hating shaving and the irritation I knew I was going to feel, I actually don&#x27;t mind shaving any more. Shirt collars don&#x27;t cause discomfort because the skin feels fine. And shaving 2 days in a row is no longer a dreaded experience, it is actually okay. I would give this shaver 5 stars, but the battery life is a little shorter than my Norelco and I&#x27;m saving that 5 stars for a magic wand that I can just wave over my beard and it disappears.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a middle-of-the-road, one-year-old Braun 4775.  The shave quality on this Panasonic is WAY better than the Braun.  Compared to a brand new, out of the box blade, the blade will shave closer.  But compared to a blade that is a couple of days old, this is at least equal, and compared to a four day old blade, the Panasonic is superior.  I do get a few nicks from this each day, but none are enough to need to do anything to staunch the bleeding or otherwise address the issue (which is more than I can say for a 3 day old blade).  I use it wet with shaving cream, but not in the shower, since I have no place to put it in the shower when I&#x27;m not shaving.  Not a perfect shave, but over time, will be far more economical than buying two expensive blades a week.  I&#x27;ve also had it 3 weeks and have not used up the first cleaning cartridge yet, and I clean it daily, so that seems to be good too.</li>
            <li> Replaced my Braun shaver w/ this unit and am very satisfied with the performance, battery life of the shaver and cleaning unit. This is the first shaver that I purchased with a cleaning unit so I can&#x27;t compare it with others but for the most part it does what it should.  I just wished it had a traveling case. Also be sure not to pour water in the cleaning unit. Overall I highly recommend this shaver and am planning on getting another one for my father for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Remington 3 blade electric for years.  I&#x27;ve preferred to use in the shower but never wanted to spend +$100 to get a good one.  Lighten deal + $30 off, I picked this up for $49.  Great deal!  Great shaver.</li>
            <li> Have owned this shaver for a year now and am very pleased. Close shaves, no irritation. I like the self cleaning system. I use the shaver dry and the shave is the same I was getting from a blade. Would definitely recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> I like to shave in the shower to prevent a mess in the sink with hair debris.  The last 3 Panasonic shavers I have purchased each lasted at least 2 years, so I decided to purchase the 8109S with the handy shaver cleaner/charger.  The batteries last at least 9-10 shaves, and I only need to charge once ever 2 weeks.  One of the best shavers I have owned!</li>
            <li> I shave my head as well as my face, and this linear Panasonic shavers  are a favorite among the cue-ball set. It took me just two years to   wear out a prior Vortex Linear shaver. One of the blade-holders   broke loose. I briefly tried a top-of-the-line Braun, and returned it.    The Nano-line is definitely an evolutionary improvement compared to   the Panasonic Linear units of the past couple of years.     What you lose (for shaving your head) is a bit of width and flatness  that seemed to help make quick work of head-shaving.    On the other hand, the shave is even better--- the sound alone tells  you this is a very \\&quot;fine\\&quot; cut. It&#x27;s a \\&quot;zing\\&quot; as opposed to the old  \\&quot;chopping\\&quot; sound. And the clippings in the razor or more like dust   than bits of whiskers. These new blades are *sharp*. One touch with  a fingertip proves it.    The razor is quieter than the older linear models, which will be a   relief to some.    The cleaning unit is improved as well. The power tower is gone, and  the process is quieter.     It remains to be seen how blades and foils hold up to the extra  \\&quot;acreage.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a good close shave. I charge it once a week although it is still about 50 - 60 percent charged.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase of a new Panasonic ES8109S razor. I have used Norelco razors since 1968 my last new one I bought in 2005. With six years of shaving with it,it was becoming useless,so I thought I would try the Panasonic. I am glad I did! No electric shaves as close as a blade,but this one is as close to a blade as you can get without all the nicks and cuts! Just a super razor for the money!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know much about it since I don&#x27;t use it, it was for my husband&#x27;s Father&#x27;s Day.  He told me the exact model and brand and I went looking for it. Trust me, you should order online from AMAZON.COM because it&#x27;s pretty much the only place I could find it and price-wise, it&#x27;s the lowest!  He was thrilled when he got it, his older shaver was about 6 yrs. old I think...  Anyway, he loves the auto-cleaning and the fact that he can use it in the shower or dry if he wants.  I asked him 2-3 times, \\&quot;what do you think?\\&quot; - he raved!  So, I recommend it and can truly say paying more is not necessary. Anything over $85 for a razor is too much (my opinion).</li>
            <li> My experience so far:  The shaver works better after a couple of uses (in my case I would say after 3 weeks of use). So far so good. Of course, it doesn&#x27;t do miracles, but it can be used in the car or in other situations when the traditional foam and razor can not be used. Be aware that an electric razor may cut hair that it is not visible in your face (example, the area below your eyes); so I would recommend to use a mirror in order to see what you are shaving.</li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic shaver I&#x27;ve own.  The first one lasted me eleven years.  This new one is better and shaves closer then the old one.  Even easier to clean and charge.  Need I say more?!  Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers for years, the last being the 9595.  Always had good service from them but the 9595 needed replacing and naturally I started reading reviews of the newer Brauns.  I was surprised to see so many average ratings and discovered from several written reviews that Gillette had purchased Braun.  At that point I began reading reviews of the other major brands. Anything new to you takes a little getting used to and the ES8109s was no different.  I got good, close shaves from the start and noted it was about half the size of my Braun.  This shaver is about half as loud and the HydraClean system has more pluses to it than the Braun&#x27;s.  I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase and could summarize the difference between my old shaver and this one as smaller, sleeker, quieter and faster.  I&#x27;d recommend this shaver to anyone in the market for a new one.</li>
            <li> Just bought this item after a lot of consideration and upon reading all the reviews.   Back in the day my first shaver was a cheap $40 panasonic which shaved very well but could not shave around the neck area. Later on I upgraded to a high end norelco shaver XL series and at first it seemed great with its 3 floating heads. It did a little better job around the neck area but after every shave my neck would be red and severely sensitive with some light hair still there. I spent $110 dollars and my biggest regret is that i did not return it for the 30 day guarantee (I guess at the time I thought thats the best you can get out of a shaver). Basically I gave up on electric and started using the disposables. Recently the fusion disposables (which are great) have been racking up a bill and its kind of a slow process in the morning. I decided to give the panasonic a try and this time determined to use the 30 day return guarantee.   My experience - Usually when I have not used an electric shaver for a while my skin goes crazy red and hurts for the first few shaves. However right out of the box I used the panasonic and went over the neck few times and no burn at all. WHAT? I could not believe this. This is not possible. Some light hair still remained but its just the first shave. This razor is light and smaller than what it appears on the pics. Either way - no razor burn around the neck?!?! I still can&#x27;t believe this (even after not using an electric shaver for a month or so). This is ridiculous. I almost tore up the receipt because no one will ever take this shaver away from me EVER!.   I will continue to use it and post updates but from what I have seen so far i just can&#x27;t imagine how it would be possible for another razor to be better than this.   PS: For the last few years I have been buying panasonic products and have been very very pleased. Recently bought a plasma TV and its amazing as well. Now my first choice for everything is panasonic because have never been disappointed yet. Not sure how long that will last as these companies are cutting costs everywhere.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying from Amazon for a long time now and I always use the reviews to help me make a decision on which product to buy. Being lazy, I never sit down and write product reviews. Well, this product made me go WOW!!! This shaver rocks!!! I felt the need to stop being lazy and give a review of this purchase.  For years, I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers, but usually I just use the cheaper types that you can buy at Wally World. I never liked using blades much but I wasn&#x27;t always pleased with the finished result of these electric shavers. I wanted a closer shave with a smoother result. I told myself that someday I would invest the money for a better model. I finally made the plunge and boy am I glad I did!! This shaver did well the first time I used it with just a dry face. After reading reviews on here, I decided to go out for the first time in my life and buy shaving cream to try out with this razor. Well, the next time I shaved, I lathered up and went to town with my new razor. The results? AWESOME!! My face has never felt smoother in my life! This product went above and beyond my expectation and now I&#x27;m kicking myself for waiting so darn long to buy one! The self clean system works great and I get great results every time I use the razor. If you are like me, and are &#x27;ok&#x27; with the cheaper models offered at the local box stores, I highly suggest putting a few more dollars into this razor. It is well worth the money!!</li>
            <li> I have used an electric razor for over 40 years and thought I would try the Panasonic ES8109S.  The clean system is hardly worth the effort - you do just as well holding the razor under a tap to clean it.  As far as the shave, this razor does not get a close shave and it is difficult to get all the beard growth shaven.  I am not satisfied with this razor at all.</li>
            <li> This is my first Panasonic brand electric shaver.  Earlier I&#x27;ve used foil based Braun shavers for about 10-11 years.  Initially I was very skeptical to switch over the brand.  But after going through the positive reviews on Amazon I thought of taking a chance.  I paid about $200+ on my last Braun... in contrast on this Panasonic just about $89 (1/3rd price of costly Braun model).  Unlike my Braun models, this one requires just one recharge per week.  I shave every day and shave is definitely better than my Braun model.  Another big difference between Braun &amp; Panasonic cleaning, Braun uses alcohol based liquids which dry up fast no matter you use it or not... whereas Panasonic uses soap based.  Also since this is a wet/dry model I can clean my shaver under running tap water first and use hydraclean only once a week.  I will definitely recommend this model... which is about 1/3rd the price of expensive Braun models but gives you the same or better quality of shave.    PS:  I&#x27;ve used this for about 2 months now and happy with this model.</li>
            <li> I replaced an old panasonic with this new one. It shaves close and smooth. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This shaver is amazing, it provides a very smooth close shave, with less effort, and is not loud.  I purchased the prior model of this shaver, then the battery went bad, I contacted the Panasonic service department, and the representative was very helpful and provided the details and instructions to send my razor in for repairs as it was still under warranty. I sent it Priority Mail, and the delivery confirmation indicated they received it on a Monday; by Thursday that same week I received a replacement! Not only was it a new unit, but also the updated model (ES8109S). I only had to pay for the one-way shipping to the service center.  I am very happy with my new Panasonic razor, it performs even better than the old one did when it was new. And the service I received from Panasonic was outstanding!</li>
            <li> I replaced a decade-old Norelco rotary shaver with this Panasonic model.  Overall pleased, but a few of my observations have been:  Pros:  Gives a better shave with far less irritation  Rotary shaver had difficulty with certain spots (jawline, above adams apple) that this one gets just fine  The cleaning feature is pretty slick  Shaver itself is compact and easy to handle.  Cons:  Loud!  Razor is much louder than the Norelco, enough that I have to shave in the guest bathroom so I don&#x27;t wake her up when I&#x27;m getting ready in morning.  Loud!  That slick little cleaning station?  It&#x27;s got a noisy little water pump and an air blower.  I don&#x27;t get to run it before bedtime or after shaving in morning unless I move that to guest bathroom also.  Not sure what I&#x27;ll do when we have guests.  Big.  The cleaning station is like adding another countertop appliance to your life.  Approximately the same size as a small blade-style  coffee grinder.  Other thoughts:  Battery life...maybe too early to tell, but in two shaves I dropped to 80%.  At that rate, I&#x27;ll only get about ten shaves per charge.  My Norelco gave me almost twice that, despite being many years old.  I guess making all that noise requires extra power...</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s this particular model, or all of this type, but I found this shave much less through than my old Phillips shaver with three circular heads.  The Panasonic parallel blades just did not cut many hairs on each pass, requiring a far longer shave.  Ultimately went back to [[ASIN:B001AMRQ2W Philips Norelco Speed 8240 Men&#x27;s Shaving System]]</li>
            <li> Much rather use a regular razor. Took too long, left stubble - would not recommend to buy. There are better models out there, just do your due diligence.  AR</li>
            <li> My husband likes this razor, he says he has a pretty close shave compared to other electric razors. However, the cleaning feature did not work properly. It would not cycle through the cleaning process so we would have to unplug the device before it was done being cleaned. Panasonic did replace the item but I had to pay for the shipping.</li>
            <li> Easy care razor. Does all it claims. Husband satisfied.no pulling of whiskers. Wife does not worry about cuts any more!</li>
            <li> Had it long enough now to rate it, and I have gone back to my blade. Just doesn&#x27;t shave close enough. It does well around my ears and sideburns, and my neck, better than a blade. That&#x27;s why I bought it. But not close enough otherwise.  So I will use both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could have got by with a cheaper model, but no way to tell in advance. if you have a light beard, especially in the upper lip area, they are OK.</li>
            <li> the charge holds well, i live the different settings on the charger, if i want to charge, clean, or dry.  it does a great job on shaving my face, my neck is more difficult but my neck hair also swirls so i dont blame shaver</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who was limping along with a 20-year-old Norelco.  He thought he preferred a blade shave -- until he tried this Panasonic.  He is delighted.  The shave, he says, is so close that even if he doesn&#x27;t shave all weekend, he can sneak by.  He actually admits that there has been tremendous progress in electric shavers in the last 20 years!</li>
            <li> Smooth shave. Very quiet. Slick charging station, such that I do not need to use two hands to plug any cords in.</li>
            <li> It has worked decent for me so far. Unfortunately, it fell and broke a part of the base. It sometimes does not give a great shave in the neck area.</li>
            <li> It has been three years now since I purchased this shaver from Amazon. It has been going strong with no problems. I am completely satisfied with it and it gives a close shave. Just a note: For long battery life, do not charge it everyday. Let it run down to a 10% charge and then recharge. Just remove the foil cap and clean with tap water in between charging cycles. Then, when recharging, go through the clean process. That is all that is needed. I have only replaced the blades once in three years and have just ordered the third set today for replacement. I have just ordered the first replacemt foil. The original is still fine but I figured after three years, why not. Very pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this raiser. He uses it every day and could not be happier. Really likes the wet or dry feature. Great gift item.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Like that it can be used either wet or dry.  Convenient,  easy to hold.  Electric not as close as a razor.</li>
            <li> I have used this system so long I can&#x27;t remember how long! One thing I always do is clean the unit after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes let my beard grow for 2 days and still get a good shave.</li>
            <li> Had my old shaver for about a decade, but the battery finally died.  Did some research and focused on this one.  I&#x27;ve been using it since last November and love it.  It&#x27;s quieter than my old one and works beautifully.  I like the high-frequency cleaning mode.  I never use the HydraClean solution.  I always just rinse in the sink and it gets clean just fine.</li>
            <li> Still using it and going strong. It does not work very well in the shower. I use it after the shower in the sink.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully and love the battery life marker. I do have to go over the spots twice or three times for the clean shave, but the action is smooth and doesn’t irritate so I don’t mind.</li>
            <li> I like this shaver, it cuts close and fast. The cleaning system is for the birds. My old Panasonic didn&#x27;t have a cleaning station and was easy to clean just running it under the faucet. I wish the charge indicator on the shaver didn&#x27;t blink when 100%. In fact I wish it didn&#x27;t glow at all, which only adds to power drain and light pollution in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> 3.5/5 -Average shave, have not used its self-cleaning methods. Had it since summer of 2012. Overall decent product for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had nothing but Braun razors for the past 12 years, the last one is four year old 8000 series.  After cringing at the $40 replacement cost of blades I gave the Panasonic a shot.  I can honestly say it&#x27;s a better shaver.  You can tell right away it does a better job overall and as others have said, doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin as much or leave that \\&quot;slight burn\\&quot; you&#x27;re used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a rough beard and sensitive skin, so anything but Mach 3&#x27;s cut me to ribbons.  Any electric requires multiple passes along with pressing hard in some spots and pulling skin taught underneath, just goes with the territory for some.  I don&#x27;t plan on using mine in the shower as I seem to get better results dry anyway and want to avoid the problems of leaking some experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the money, replacement cost of blades and cleaning cartridges, the only thing that remains is durability, my braun is beat up but still works well, if I can get 2 years out of the Panasonic I&#x27;d be happy, everything chinese is crap shoot in my experience.</li>
            <li> I use electric shavers to shave both my face and my head, so I put some serious wear and tear on them.  Unfortunately, Panasonic&#x27;s shaver did not provide a particularly close or quick shave when compared to the Braun Series 7 shaver.  Not only that, but the replacement foils for the Panasonic wore out with incredible frequency -- once every 3 months -- compared to Braun&#x27;s.  I got this product when it was on sale for about $100, which is probably what it is worth.  If you are serious about getting a bang for your buck, go with the Braun series instead.</li>
            <li> After checking reviews for several products of different brands, I chose this one. I read about it being a comfortable good shave. This was COMPLETELY true! As a first time user of an electric razor, I am so happy with my choice. I have only used it as a dry shave so far, and I definitely plan on using it in the shower soon with a recommended menthol based shaving cream. For other first time users, it will take a while to get a good shave the first time around. I spend like 30 minutes with a beard just long enough to curl into my face and make it hard to get. The 2nd time around was so quick and easy. I&#x27;ll definitely be adding more after a wet shave and a longer period of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product if you&#x27;re looking for a great shave. Already recommending it to my brothers and other guys.</li>
            <li> The shaver seemed of good quality, but the shave was only fair compared to my old Braun 7526.  The charger cleaner unit was defective, and following the directions in the manual did not get it to work properly.</li>
            <li> nothing beats a razor</li>
            <li> This is the first razor that I have owned that has not pulled most of my beard out. It is very smooth, quit and the fact that it is just as good in the shower or at the sink, is mind boggling. I would highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> He was always wanted one. I was worried about buying it without his knowledge since he was going to be the one using it. He likes it. Works great. And I&#x27;m happy that he liked it and uses it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor as a replacement for another Panasonic model that I was only marginally happy with.  The previous unit did not provide a close shave and was not very efficient.  This new razor is wonderful.  It provides a close shave in minimul time and is extremely quiet.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This shaver has been a Godsend for me.  I first picked it up at a Sam&#x27;s Club 5 years ago. It has shaved my face at least 5 times a week, every week, for the past 5 years. That is more than 1300 shaves total! After 3 years, I replaced the foil and blade and it seemed to help it keep going. I never once used this in the shower. I prefered a dry shave, as I didn&#x27;t think it would stay very clean if it were getting wet. Unfortunately, good things come to an end, and this amazing device eventually gave up the ghost. It produced a clean smooth shave every time, right up to the final shave.  I thought I would take a break and return to wetshaving, specifically double-edge safety razors, but I hope my future electric razors can give me the satisfaction that this did.  It was worth every penny I paid, and then some.</li>
            <li> This shaver is very good when it is working.  It gives a very close, comfortable shave.  The problem is that although it is stated to be, this shaver is not watertight.  A few months after 2 years owning this shaver (hey, the warranty is for 2 years.  What a coincidence!)  The display started going wonky, showing random characters that made no sense.  No biggie.  I never really looked at it anyway since I just keep it in the cradle to keep it charged.  Next thing that happened was the blades stopped moving properly.  They would just vibrate in a strange manner, not enough to actually cut (no, it wasn&#x27;t the turbo clean mode).  Having no other choice I opened up the razor and low and behold the entire inside was corroded with a brown sludge.  (see pictures above) Awesome.  Keep in mind I never used this in the shower or anything, only rinsing under the faucet.  Since I like the shaver, apart from this flaw, I ordered the ES8103 as a replacement which is essentially the same shaver.  Please note, however that the ES8103 does not have the recharging nubs on the back like the ES8109 does so you can&#x27;t charge it in the cradle.  Thanks Panasonic!  Anyway, I&#x27;ll be using the ES8103 without water this time as I have no doubt that water would condemn this shaver to the same fate as before.  You have been warned.</li>
            <li> Hey I have used a power razor all my life, for the last 40 years or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Razor is the best of the newer razors on the market today. I miss my norelco from 20 years ago because it gave the best shave.&lt;br /&gt;This razor does a good job. My neck hairs are very tight and lay very flat. This razor needs to be run over my neck in every possible direction in order to have a close shave. If you are in a hurry and do not take your time then it wont be close. I wear a tie all day and when I do not have a close shave my wiskers rub my shirt collar all day and makes my neck red and bumpy.&lt;br /&gt;The razor is Good to Great 4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the cleaning gizmo....2 stars, Great Idea but has many downfalls. First, what is it supposed to do...clean your razor and then air dry it while charging it back up for the next use and it has some lube in the cleaner to keep the blades nice and sharp and ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;Sounds great right? Well, I get done shaving I take off the screen and rinse the head in the water faucet so the Cleaner last a month. The cleaner is a bit expensive a $3 or 4 dollar expense a month. Then you put it in the cachine heads down and hit the button to turn it on...all three lights turn on....but the unit might actually not turn on and the next day you still have a wet razor to use...I like a dry razor in the morning. If it does turn on it will fill the chamber holding the razor with the cleaner and run on a very high speed to get the hairs to fall out. Then it drains and a blower turns on and dries the razor, or it should anyways....It might not turn on and now the next morning you have not only a wet razor but a musty smelly razor to boot...I REALLY HATE THAT ON MY FACE.&lt;br /&gt;Then sometimes it works properly.&lt;br /&gt;Once a month or sooner if needed you have to clean the cleaner. You first unplug the unit!!!! You remover the fluid chamber and pour out the now somewhat milky water...you will find that just pouring out the fluid is not enough to cleanit. You will want to use bleach water it so it is clean and not smelly. Then you remover the cleaner cartridge...I rinse my razor after ever use before I let the machine clean the razor, so my cartridge is pretty clean not tons of hair in the filter of the cartridge so I know it will last a month. Now before you put in a new cartridge I use some dial soap and water in the cleaner chamber to clean it good... Every couple of months I have to use a tooth pick to get down in the cracks and ridges to get the hair out. You have to be very careful and not get the actual unit wet on the outside because the unit is not water resistant and you will ruin it.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaner is a great Idea for sure but for a $150+ razor I would think in this class of razor in this price point that the cleaning machine would be as good as the razor remember that the cleaning unit has a monthly cost of cleaner cartridges of $4 a month so in a years time you are in the $225+ level of razor....the razor is 4 star the cleaner is 2 star and that is being nice.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps...buying a good razor is important and worth the money over the years of service you would expect from the razor....long before this razor dies I will cough up another $200 for a razor that does not have the cleaner unit.</li>
            <li> I have owned a number of electric razors in my lifetime. Some very expensive Brauns, Remington and others. None can hold a candle to this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have let my beard grow for most of the last 20 years and only shaved when I absolutely couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore...until I bought this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solid charger, great self-cleaning, better cut than any razor have ever seen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know what I would do without it!</li>
            <li> We use this almost every day. I think it works great although it did not work that will wet. I just had to buy another blade.</li>
            <li> My husband wanted an electric shaver for years, put none shaved close enough, and they were awkward in tight places.  But that has been resolved and Mr. Fussy is happy as a pig in mud with this shaver.  He even goes out of his way to promote it to friends, singing its virtues to all who listen.  (You can read its virtues in other reviews.)</li>
            <li> As you would expect, takes awhile (weeks) for face to warm up up to using electric razor vs blade.  I had to switch methods due to medical issue (cancer).  Works well but only use dry.  Even when face is wet, doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well.  I was using hair trimmer in shower and I dropped five feet (once) and it broke that feature.  Still works fine as a shaver.</li>
            <li> Razor line just fine with that, but I think the clean bucket of little use.Panasonic is more suitable than other razors I&#x27;ve me some.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shaver. Easy to clean as it can be put under running water!  And easy to recharge, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this electric shaver for 3 1/2 years and overall think it is a great electric shaver.  It gives you a close and quick shave if you lack time in the morning to do a proper shave. I only replaced the blades once while owning it ($32) and the cleaning cartridge twice (packs of 3 for $9 a pack).  I have even used the shaver a couple of times in the shower. I do not recommend this however because the steam can get inside the LCD. I thought I had broke it but after the water inside dried out it came back on.  I have never owned any other electric razors and don&#x27;t see the need to either because this gets the job down for the fraction of the price of more expensive brands like Braun and Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I&#x27;ve noticed as time passed on the &amp;#34;Cleaning&amp;#34; function on the dock became less effective. Also, the docking station is loud if that&#x27;s something your conscious about, I can hear it from across the house in my bathroom. The dock itself easily gets dirty, especially if you have it around your sink. As you can imagine, after 3+ years of using it the shaver itself has build up in places that aren&#x27;t easily able to clean. The biggest problem I have about it is that because there&#x27;s a lot of moving parts to the setup, it can be tedious to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this was a great electric shaver for the money.  It still works for me I just decided to try traditional DE razor blades instead because I prefer simplicity and the ability to easily keep my shaver clean.  However, if you&#x27;re looking for a close, quick shave this Panasonic can very well be the answer for a fraction of its competitors.</li>
            <li> I selected this razor based on buyer feedback found at Consumer Reports. 15 users all left similar feedback in terms of how close the shave is and ease of use. The comments were left by both men and women. After receiving the shaver, I charged it up and tried it out. The claims are 100% accurate. This foil razor really can claim to shave as close as a blade. I have only tried to dry shave and was thrilled with the results. I have not tried the auto clean feature yet, but CR reviews spoke highly of that too. I expect that the auto clean feature will be equally effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that the auto clean feature uses a special cleaning cartridge that must be replaced after 30 cleaning cycles. Plan to spend periodically to replace the cleaning cartridge. According to the manual, the shaver can be cleaned under cold running water and air dried if you opt to buy the shaver only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone that isn&#x27;t happy with this razor either isn&#x27;t using it right, has a defective unit, or holds unrealistic expectations. The razor is truly superb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Panasonic electric shaver with nano blade technology (ES8228 or ES8109S) for the past 2 months and love it.  Without exaggeration, it gives me the closest shave ever, and I&#x27;ve been using the top of the line electrics from Norleco and Braun for over 20 years. I have compared the Panasonic shaver with nano blades with the Braun Pulsonic and Norelco Arcitec and found that the Panasonic gives me the closest shave.  Dry shaving will also give you a close shave.  You won&#x27;t regret this foil beauty, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my situation, I&#x27;m fair skinned and somewhat acne prone.  I&#x27;ve used a top of the line Braun in the past, which extremely   irritated my skin.  Switched to the old mug soap and top of the line   razors from Mach3 to Fusion, but for me, cuts way to close and at times would leave me in a bloody mess.    My next venture was with the Philips Norelco Advantage and then the updated Cool Skin.  These worked well..........but still not 100%    So while reading the reviews here, and seeing that there was a 30 day money back guarantee, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  I hoped that this time, with the technology advancements, I&#x27;d have a winner.  Well, here it is!  This is absolutely the best shave I ever received from any electric shaver.....PERIOD!  This thing is incredible, no irritation  immediately after shaving and no skin breakouts the next day.  I use it strictly in wet mode and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and does it well.  From the other popular brands and more expensive price tags, this shaver is an under rated sleeper.     THANK YOU PANASONIC!!!!!</li>
            <li> I got this device after using my dad&#x27;s ES8077S (which is also a great shaver mind you). I get a closer shave using this guy than a blade, let me qualify that... I am susceptible to getting ingrown hairs when I shave against the grain, so I don&#x27;t. Shaving with the grain is a quick, easy and painless process however you don&#x27;t get anything resembling a close shave! My solution? I use the ES8109S in the shower with a little bit of soapy lather and I get a comfortable, quick and dead close shave (especially when compared to using a blade). The LCD display is overkill in my opinion but I guess they have to justify $130 somehow. Remember, you have to shave everyday when using an electric to see optimal results.    I have to agree with a previous reviewer however regarding noise. The shaver itself is not very loud in my opinion however the cleaning process is a noisy one. I&#x27;d give this product 4.5 stars but have not been given that option so I am rounding down.    A great Shaver!</li>
            <li> Ok, so this is my third Panasonic wet/dry shaver in about 5 years and, by far, this one is the best one yet. I&#x27;ve experimented with other manufacturers&#x27; shavers over the years, including Brauns, Norelcos and Grundig shavers, but I&#x27;ve ultimately found nirvana, ok, not quite nirvana, but a most pleasant shaving experience with Panasonic shavers.  I love Panasonic&#x27;s shavers because I like being able to shave in the shower with an electric shaver and a little glycerin based shaving foam (Gilette Series foam in the long silver tube works best for me and doesn&#x27;t gum up the shaver like gels do). I swear, this unbeatable combination (i.e., shower steam, Panasonic wet/dry shaver and Gilette Series foam) shaves me closer than even the best blades that Gilette offers (at present, the Gilette Fusion) with far less irritation and with no annoying little cuts in conspicuous locations around my face and/or neck.    Just to review, my first Panasonic wet/dry was great and served me well for about 3 years, but when the Panasonic models came out a few years ago with the Vortex cleaning systems, I just had to have one, so I moved on to the model ES8078 wet/dry shaver. The ES8078 served me well for a year-and-a-half - until I dropped that bad boy in the shower earlier this week! &#x27;Nuf said. It didn&#x27;t break into a zillion pieces or anything, but the motor just stopped working. (It&#x27;s actually kinda funny because I was so preoccupied with ensuring the safekeeping of that little shaver ever since I brought it home, chiding my poor wife for even looking at it wrong, and then my dumb arse drops the dang thing in the shower. AAARGHHHH!!!)  Anyhow, after a quick review of the top of the line shavers from various manufacturers currently available (including the new Braun Pulsonic models), I opted to go for the latest offering from Panasonic. Even though the new Brauns cost $100 more than the Panasonics, their motors are still slower, and you still can&#x27;t shave with &#x27;em wet. For the uninitiated, higher motor speed &#x3D; faster moving blades &#x3D; less friction &#x3D; less irritation. Panasonics have consistently had the highest motor speed available in any electric shaver.    I&#x27;ve shaved with the new ES8109S shaver for a few days now, and my first impression after the very first shave was that I got a very close shave (consistent with the performance of my prior Panasonics) and, try to understand this, my face did not FEEL as though I had just shaved. It may sound a little odd, but you know how your face feels sensitive to the touch after you typically shave? Well, that sensation, at least for me, was far less apparent after shaving with the new Panasonic. Heck, maybe it&#x27;s the new curved blade and foil assembly that reduces irritation or something. In this respect, the new ES8109S actually outperforms Panasonic&#x27;s prior top of the line offering (the ES8078) and actually causes even less shaving irritation than that model (which itself wasn&#x27;t all that irritating to begin with). Also, much like the prior models, the little pop up trimmer on the side of the new shaver is great not only for trimming sideburns (which I actually never use it for), but also for capturing those awkward little hairs that lie flat or may be becoming ingrown. The latest model is also quieter than the last model and has a more substantial feel to it while holding it.    Oh, one more thing, the ES8109S comes with Panasonic&#x27;s latest iteration of its Vortex Cleaning and charging base, which is slightly different from its prior models, but appears to use the same cleaning cartridge. The Vortex quietly cleans, lubricates and even fully recharges your shaver for you (alternatively, you can just plug the power cable for the Vortex directly into the shaver to recharge it). The cleaning/lubricating solution in the Vortex consists of a slender cartridge containing a detergent based solid that becomes \\&quot;activated\\&quot; when it mixes with water in the Vortex base. The cleaner is not alcohol-based, so it does not evaporate over time like the Braun cleaning solution does - along with the money you&#x27;ll spend on their big, expensive refills.     In summary, I highly recommend the Panasonic ES8109S shaver to persons like me with sensitive skin that is prone to irritation (I know you&#x27;re thinking, \\&quot;Why didn&#x27;t he just say that from the outset?\\&quot;) Hope this review helps!     LONG TERM UPDATE! - Well, I&#x27;ve had 8109S for almost one full year now and it&#x27;s still going strong. I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s become slightly less efficient at capturing the few hairs on my cheeks that tend to lie flat, so it&#x27;s about time for the annual changing of the foil, which I know (based on past experience with Panasonics) will restore the shaver to its fullest hair capturing &amp; cutting potential. One tip I have about cleaning the razor - I shave and rinse clean my shaver every day, and I only clean it in the Vortex when it needs charging which, for me, is about once every two weeks. This cuts down on the usage of the cleaning cartridge. The need to clean your shaver will depend in large part on what you shave with (I use a foam, which tends to rinse cleaner than creams and gels). Also, one more tip regarding the cleaning cartridges in the Vortex cleaning system - you DON&#x27;T HAVE TO replace the cleaning solution at the manufacturer recommended interval. You can definitely get away with using them longer. I tend to use them until the service light on the Vortex base turns on, then I change the cleaning cartridge and water in the Vortex and it&#x27;s good to go. I&#x27;m only on my third cleaning cartridge in the year I&#x27;ve owned the razor.    EVEN LONGER TERM UPDATE! - Well, it&#x27;s a little over a year-and-a-half since I purchased this shaver, and it has died on me. It all started about two weeks ago when I noticed that it was holding less of a charge between chargings, i.e., I could get progressively less and less shaves per charge. Then the display started giving unintelligible readings that did not correspond to the charge level. Then, today, I go to try to turn on the shaver and no response. All in all, this shaver performed exceptionally well throughout it&#x27;s lifespan and, considering the price of \\&quot;next-best option\\&quot; Gillette Fusion blades, was far less expensive, and less irritating, over time than shaving with blades. I have to admit I thought it would&#x27;ve lasted me a little longer than it did as past Panasonics I&#x27;ve owned have lasted longer. Now, I could try to have this thing repaired for some astronomical price, only to have it stop working again. Or, I could take this opportunity to purchase Panasonic&#x27;s latest offering, the Arc IV Nano Men&#x27;s Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaver, which I&#x27;ve scoped out and seen positive reviews of here on Amazon. I think I&#x27;m going to go with the new Panasonic, but this time without the Vortex cleaning base as this was the 2nd Panasonic shaver I&#x27;ve owned (one of which I dropped) that I am now stuck with a useless Vortex cleaning base. Happy shopping!</li>
            <li> Excellent razor.  When used with shaving cream as good as a blade razor and easier on the skin.  when used dry as good as any electric.  I haven&#x27;t used the hydraClean cleaning system yet.</li>
            <li> A little better then the travel shaver from Braun (as close shaving capability) and the best so far from everything I tried. Better than any plastic shaver with 4-5 blades on a very stubborn beard. Very good cleaning   device. The bad, but not that bad: an annoying operating sound (as a huge mosquito) and pretty noisy cleaning.</li>
            <li> I too have tried many different brands over the years. This shaver is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Not quite as close as a blade but close enough. It actually shaves my neck smooth which is something that I&#x27;ve only been able to do with blades. The best part is the complete lack of irritation. I have a very sensitive neck and I have yet to need any lotion to sooth irritation. I shave in the shower so the fancy cleaning system is pretty much a waste of space but I do love the Lithium-Ion battery technology. The only shortcoming is the lack of a lanyard. I&#x27;ve dropped more than one slippery shaver in the shower over the years. They generally don&#x27;t tolerate too many drops to the tub floor before they fail! If they can put a lanyard on a fancy digital camera they can put one on a fancy shaver!</li>
            <li> Showed up on time, and in perfect condition.  This shaver is faster, closer and easier on the face (multi pivotal head) than Panasonic it replaced (9 yrs old).   If I had to do it again, I might not get model with Hydraclean system, just double clicking on button drives motor to higher rpm, stick it under faucet and its clean!</li>
            <li> I have always had extremely sensitive skin and was only able to tolerate shaving with a razor once a week.  This is the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve had, but I read reviews before buying this one.  It definitely lives up to the reviews written about it.  It delivers a comfortable, clean, and quick shave.  I have even been able to shave daily which makes my wife extremely happy.  The price was better than the \\&quot;In store best price\\&quot; at the major retail stores, and the shipping was extremely fast.</li>
            <li> I bought the Panasonic ES8109S Vortex Wet/Dry Shaver with Nano Technology and HydraClean System, at age 50 (still young in my book).  It is my first electric razor.  I did a good bit of research and was looking at another razor which has commercials being aired all day long.  This commercial claims that it really gets the neck very well and the new design allows for an overall new electric razor experience.    Well, I have been shaving for some time now and I like a very close shave.  I use a wonderful Body Shop shaving cream and a great set of blades and razor.  I get incredibly close, it is amazing, though it takes a long time; and, occasionally it will leave my neck a bit rough and red.  Still, it works wonders.  However, with my job and the amount of travel I do, overnight flights, right into meetings and so on, I wanted a way to clean up a bit, and fairly fast.  The electric razor seemed like a good place to start.    So, I researched the razor described above, from the commercial, and while its overall rating was quite good, the negatives were real and very concise, especially about its lack of quality in the neck area, the very thing it was selling so hard.    I continued to read reviews, mostly on Amazon, but also other places and I kept coming back to the Panasonic ES8109S Vortex Wet/Dry Shaver.  The reviews were positive, it scored slightly higher than the one being advertised, it was said to handle the neck very well, that it was quiet, held a charge, plus it also had the self cleaning device, if one wanted to use it.  And, of course, it could work in the shower, with my favorite shaving cream, or without.    It also was much less expensive due to a great Amazon sale.  I went for it.  I fell in love the first time I used it.  That time I used my shaving cream.  The next time I did not and for just over a week now I have used it in the dry mode.  I have not gotten irritation, though I moisturize right after shaving.      It handled the neck better than I expected, the cheeks and side burns come out much smoother than I though an electric razor could get.  This razor has a number of options, a number of ways to clean it, including  the self-cleaning/charging system (doing both at once).  It has a nice pivot and the very finely crafted foil glides across the face, at least my face.    I did NOT buy it because of the money, I was prepared to buy the one advertised and $70 more.  But, with the special, well, that was the tipping point, though how it worked and the reviews were the deciding factor.  Also, if I am not pleased with something, if it doesn&#x27;t live up to its advertising, I will return it (always politely, but return none-the-less).    If you are looking for your first electric razor or a replacement, I strongly suggest you give this a try.  Amazon is a great place for just this purpose.  Their policies allow a great deal of freedom when shopping and it works to the buyers favor.  I will NOT be returning this razor.  I know it hasn&#x27;t been long, but I can tell already, this is a winner.  Take a shot - try it.  I believe you will be pleased.  No matter what you buy, good luck in your shopping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Panasonic wet/dry shaver user for many years and they keep getting better. Being able to shave in the shower in the morning gives me an extra 5 minutes of sleep time. If you shave everyday, this razor will keep you in great shape. However, if you get a little lazy and some decent growth, you may need a razor to tighten up a few areas. I am extremely pleased with this shaver and its much quieter than some of the prior models.</li>
            <li> This is my fourth Panasonic wet/dry shaver and so far it is the best.  I really like the cleaning system.  Very smooth shave and ease of use.</li>
            <li> this shaves very nicely, you must follow the recommend directions and allow 30 days for body to adjust to shaving in this manner.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Panasonic razor after reading the reviews thoroughly for the Panasonic and most other razors offered by Amazon.  I&#x27;ve been using a blade for decades, but decided to try an electric razor to see how close it comes to the excellent shave provided by a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first purchase was a Norelco Arcitec.  I used it for 3 weeks, and sent it back (thanks Amazon for your return policy!)  I had to shave several times a day - and it just wasn&#x27;t worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the Panasonic.  THIS is the one to buy.  I had a Braun that I used once in a very long while, but the Panasonic excels in comparison.  The noise from operation is fairly quiet, and very tolerable.  Best of all, the motor provides a \\&quot;linear\\&quot; performance throughout the battery&#x27;s charge, and doesn&#x27;t drop off as the battery charge is diminished.  It is equally effective at a 10 percent remaining charge as it is at 100 percent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head \\&quot;floats\\&quot;, or can be locked in place, similar to a shock absorber - a great feature.  I like the feel of the floating head, as it makes it very comfortable and equalizes pressure.  If I need it, I can lock the head, but have rarely found the need.  It&#x27;s a very comfortable razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Panasonic when Amazon was having a great sale, and ended up paying about $75 for it - a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is done by using the \\&quot;cleaning fluid\\&quot; in the charger, which works well, or by putting a small amount of liquid soap on the razor and letting it run until it \\&quot;foams\\&quot;.  I&#x27;ll probably use that latter method the large majority of the time, and the \\&quot;cleaning fluid\\&quot; once in a while to ensure it&#x27;s nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this razor for the person who prefers a blade, but wants to try something different.  It&#x27;s a wet/dry razor, and I&#x27;ve used it both ways - and it works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the razor just before a trip to Alaska for my son&#x27;s wedding.  We were only going to be there 3 days, however the SeaTac airport snow closure resulted in our being stranded for 9 days before we could fly home.  The battery held the charge the entire time, and worked well - good thing, since I left the charger at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The side burn trimmer is excellent, and very handy in trimming unruly hair - I&#x27;d imagine it would do a great job for trimming mustaches, although I don&#x27;t have one.  The razor handles the sensitive neck area very well, and does an excellent job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.  An excellent value for the Amazon price!</li>
            <li> the setup is good as far as being useable wet or dry.  Charger is easy to use. Problem is in the cleaning and replacement foils. The cleaning cartridges don&#x27;t last long.  Supposed to be 30 - 45 days.  More like 1 or 2 cleanings then they plug up.  I do like this better than the Wahl shavers though.  However, I suggest getting a shaver that doesn&#x27;t have cleaning cartridges.</li>
            <li> This shaver actually works fine.  It is the cleaning system I have an issue with.  My last shaver was a Braun and I replaced it with the Panasonic after several years of service.  The difference is, the Braun always seemed clean after a cleaning while the Panasonic did not. Braun uses an alcohol based cleaning solution. It evaporates over time so you con only use it so long.  but the shaver feels/smells clean every time you run the cleaning program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic chose a water based system.  While I believe it was clean (most of the time), it just didn&#x27;t seem as clean, and when the cleaning fluid was near the end of its life, it wasn&#x27;t clean.  There were times I had to rinse it off in the sink because it smelled bad after a &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34;.  So, did I use the fluid longer than I was supposed to? I don&#x27;t know, likely with both shavers.  with one of them it didn&#x27;t matter, and the other one had no way to remind me it was time to change.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this razor for somewhere around four years now. It&#x27;s a real champ. I&#x27;ve only changed the blade once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t bother with the soap container. I do wash it myself and use the stand to dry it, which works great.</li>
            <li> After extensive research, looking for \\&quot;the best electric shaver\\&quot; as a gift for my husband, I confidently settled on Panasonic&#x27;s ES8228. As I shopped around for the best deal, I came across Panasonic&#x27;s ES8109S on Amazon, at a much lower price PLUS an instant rebate PLUS free shipping. Bestill my heart!    I compared the two models on Panasonic&#x27;s website and since they both offered the features I wanted-nanotech, vortex and HydraCleaning system--and since both got rave reviews--I ended up purchasing the ES8109. (I&#x27;m still not sure of the difference between the two.)    From the start, my husband was amazed at the unbelievably close shave, which, according to him, is equal to that of a blade razor. He has tried it both wet and dry and, either way, was quite pleased with the results. He was also pleased that he didn&#x27;t get any nicks or irritation, which he expected as part of the getting-used-to-a-new-shaver experience.    In summary, my husband has been shaving for over 4 decades and he says this is THE best shaver he has ever owned.</li>
            <li> People who write 4 paragraph reviews need to get a life!!!  I bought it after comparing many brands and model #&#x27;s.  I LOVE IT!!. I used it wet,dry,and with gel. It does a great job and close shave. Cleaning base is nice,not a gimick. A bargain for $100...Buy it and enjoy.</li>
            <li> This absolutely sucks. This is the 4th Vortex in 1 yr  Shaves great if it works.</li>
            <li> This shaver works really well. You don&#x27;t have to apply a lot of pressure, just go back and forth for a while and the job is done. It&#x27;s very easy to clean up under the faucet and I really don&#x27;t use  the autoclean function very often(too long and noisy).  The battery lasts for 9 of my shavings! and if it goes off during a shave (not very likely) it takes 5 min to charge it enough for finishing the job.  It is not possible to shave while the battery is charging.    Interestingly, it shaves also 3 days beard!!! No other electric shaver I used was able to do this.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an well-used and aging ES8162 I bought 2 years ago.  With the rising cost of blades/foils it didn&#x27;t make much sense to keep buying parts for that one compared to a new one, so I upgraded to the ES8109 and will craigslist the ES8162 (hopefully).      The 8019 is awesome - closer shave, longer lasting battery (almost 2.5 weeks!) and it&#x27;s more quiet than I expected.  Only nit is that the foil pops out of the top too easily, this happened a few times before I caught on what I was pushing (those 2 balck tabs).  I guess that makes it easier to clean the foil?      Anyway, I dont really care about/use the Hydraclean system, like I need one more thing to clutter my bathroom. I just rinse it after every shave and soap the foil/blades once a week.  I wish Panasonic hadn&#x27;t jumped on the bandwagon to include these cleaning stations for their high-end razors, just reduce the price and leave that crap out!  Great razor, would recommend and buy again from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I ordered this electric razor after reading several reviews.  My one question was would it work on women also.  It was a far better rated razor than what is offered for women.  My husband felt like it would work the same, and if not, well he would be happy to oblige and use it himself.  Well, I waited the approx. 30days for the skin to get use to the shaver, and so far I absolutely love it.  It works well in the most sensitive areas, such as bikini lines, underarms etc.  I love the self cleaning system, it helps to keep the blades sharp and the drying feature is very nice.  Easy to use and place and go.  As far as other reviews stating that it can be loud, this is true, but after using in the morning, I am on my way out the door, so I am not generally there to notice.  I am very please with this product, after purchasing so many women&#x27;s electric wet dry razors, and have them \\&quot;crap\\&quot; out after a few months, it is exciting to use something with this many nice features to keep the blades lubricated and sharp.  Very please with the product, the only person disappointed would be my husband, since this one is a keeper for me.</li>
            <li> We have tried several different shavers but this is the best one yet and&lt;br /&gt;it has a cleaning attachment. Perfect</li>
            <li> I orginally bought this razor for my son, who has a thick beard, and he has been very pleased with it.  My husband also tried it, and he thought it was superior to any shavers he had used before, so I bought him one next.  My husband told my father how satisfied he was with his new shaver, and loaned it to him to try.  Now my dad is also using this shaver and all three were purchased from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am having problems with the base, the part that holds the shaver.  It does not drain completely.  There is water or cleaning solution pooling at the bottom of the base, which means the shaver head sits in the water/cleaning solution over night.  I have to run the dry cycle twice to evaporate all the water/cleaning solution out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried to clean out the drain hole at the bottom of the base.  I unfolded a metal paper clip so that it is a long straight piece of metal.  I used that long thin metal rod to poke into the drain hole at the bottom of the base to try to clear it of any obstruction, but this didn&#x27;t improve anything.  Water/cleaning solution still pools at the bottom of the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any ideas how to fix this?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good razor. But I do notice that if you don&#x27;t use the cleaning feature regularly the mechanism doesn&#x27;t flush all the cleaning fluid/water out of the well. At first I thought it was broken, but when I changed the cleaning cartridge it worked fine again. As far as cutting goes, I would rate the razor as very good, not excellent. In my opinion, in spite of all the new bells and whistles, these expense razors don&#x27;t shave any better than their predecessors, regardless of brand.</li>
            <li> I have used a blade razor all my adult life.  A year ago I had a stroke and for safety reasons had to use this type of razor for shaving.  I willl never be as satisfied as I was with the blade.</li>
            <li> Considering the price and the other reviews, this shaver did not meet my expectations. I could not get a close shave as I expected. The shave quality is exactly the same as the other less expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Use Scrubbing Bubbles to clean the blades once in a while. Eliminates the dulling residue. The Vortex system is an expensive joke.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the razor about a month and it replaces a Braun I had for several years. The Panasonic gives a much better shave, is easy to clean and provides a week of shaving before it need recharging.</li>
            <li> There may be later more advance models offered by Panasonic but this model does a great job.  I&#x27;ve owned Braun and norelco and this trimmer is unreal and far superior.  Buy it, you will not be dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my friend because we are taking a trip to San Francisco in November and I want him to look nice.  He has pretty course hair so I got the shaver all ready for him to use and it didn&#x27;t quite get the job done by itself.  We both worked on his shaving and decided to get a standard razor to do the hard work and use this razor to clean up the stubble.</li>
            <li> I would have given the review five stars, but the razor was a gift for my husband so I haven&#x27;t used it. He, however, likes it a lot and it has made the morning routine a lot less painful. He gets a clean shave in less time than the straight edge. The razor was as described and we received it promptly.</li>
            <li> The shaver really is awesome.  Wet or dry I get a nice clean shave with almost no irritation to my sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;The base on the other hand came defective. The dryer doesn&#x27;t heat (it just blows), it buzzes when plugged in, and after its done cycling through a clean and charge it causes the lights on both the shaver and the base to flicker.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately panasonics customer service was abysmal and nothing got resolved so I&#x27;m stuck with it. At least it can perform the most important functions.</li>
            <li> Paid $150 to Good as New Electronics for this shaver which died after a year. Was told it was guaranteed for only 30 DAYS!</li>
            <li> Fair  razor.  Not like safety razors.</li>
            <li> I bought this electric shaver from amazon on a recommendation from the star of the Broadway Musical that I had joined. the show required us to shave every day and I have very sensitive face and neck skin that breaks out like crazy if I shave every day and so did he. He swore by this razor and said that even though it was expensive it&#x27;d be worth it. He was RIGHT! I was LUCKY to get it on super duper mark down and it actually wasn&#x27;t that expensive (under one hundred dollars). keep checking back. The 8103 is the same razor without the fancy charging and cleaning system and frankly if I was reading this and couldn&#x27;t afford this one and needed/wanted it RIGHT NOW, I&#x27;d go with the 8103 for a fraction of the price. You&#x27;ll see from the side by side comparison that it&#x27;s the same razor just doesn&#x27;t have the cleaning system. I&#x27;ve used the cleaning system twice and actually found that I do a better job of cleaning it by hand so that&#x27;s what I do. I continue to use it two years later and it&#x27;s awesome. everyone I do shows with want to know how I get such a great shave. It looks like I went to the ole time parlor and got a straight razor shave that&#x27;s how good it looks! I just got a text from a former cast mate of my previous show asking me which razor it was because he was going to ask for it for Christmas :). ENJOY!</li>
            <li> I use an electric razor 4 days a week and have been for the last 8 years.  This is by far the best system I&#x27;ve used.  I came from a Braun system and was not impressed, but kept with it for about 3 years until it broke.  This is the first time I shave with an eletric razor that I feel it can get as close as a traditional razor.  I&#x27;m also liking the cleaning base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance:&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned this thing can get as close as a normal razor does.  If I&#x27;m patient and go over the same section enough I do feel like I&#x27;ve shaved with a normal razor, but I normally don&#x27;t have the patience.  The great thing about this razor is I don&#x27;t get near the razor burn I did with my other electric razors, so I can go over the same section over and over if I feel like it.  I still get a much better shave than with any other electric razor even if I&#x27;m in a hurry.  Going against the grain has the best results that I&#x27;ve noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life on this thing is amazing.  It has a % indicator and I haven&#x27;t noticed it drop below 100% even after longer shaves.  If I had to guess, you could probably go 10-15 shaves without needing a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging/Cleaning Base:&lt;br /&gt;This is a huge improvement over the Braun system.  Instead of a large alcohol filled container you need to replace monthly, you get compact hard soap filled catridges that last much longer.  You actually fill the base with water yourself and then it mixes the soap and water whenever you run it through the cleaning cycle.  It says you can use tap water, but if you have hard water I would recommend distilled/purified.  It doesn&#x27;t need much water and you only replace it when you replace the cleaning catridge.  Another huge improvement over the Braun system is that if I feel like just charging and not cleaning my razor I can do that easily.  It has different modes so that I can set it to charge and clean or just charge.  There is also a drying mode, but I haven&#x27;t figured out a good use for that yet.  This is much better than having to unplug the charging cable from the base to plug directly into the razor if I didn&#x27;t want to go through the cleaning cycle and waste the cleaning cartridge.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months and haven&#x27;t replaced the cleaning catridge or the water and still get excellent results.  I usually run the cleaning cycle every other shave.  The best part about it is that the cleaning catridges cost about half of what they did for the Braun system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m extremely happy with my purchase and don&#x27;t think you can get much more for your money.</li>
            <li> My husband has quite a heavy whisker growth, but due to medication is no longer advised to wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;Despite rave reviews, we ended up returning the shaver as it would barely cut through the whiskers. We only tried dry shaving, as, at the time, he was unable to shower. Perhaps it works better wet?</li>
            <li> Nice colorful as advertiised? Product quality is unquestionable. It makes you have a good feeling to receive such a good product.</li>
            <li> I bought this razer to shave my head. I think the Norelco 3 blade does a better job, But the Panasonic is twice as fast. But if you put the slightest dent in the foil screen, the blade will cut through it. But if you push the dent out from the back side with an ink pen clicker or something small and with rounded sides before you turn it on, it will prevent this from happening.</li>
            <li> This shaver sounds rather whiny.  Not pleasant.  It does OK on short stubbly stuff but tends to miss stuff that&#x27;s longer or not stiff.  If I need a clean shave I have to go over it with a razor.  It has some lights that default to blinking.  The designers apparently thought I needed a mini lightshow in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: so far it has held a charge for 10 or more days while traveling.  Having a base is a real plus.</li>
            <li> I have a very tough beard at several odd angles.  I was skeptical about replacing my old razor, but the old one was ten years old.  This Panasonic from day one worked better than my other brand ever did.  I only use it dry shaving, but it gets through tough patches of beard and it feels like I used a blade and cream.  It takes a bit longer on a four day beard, but still does the job! Not sure how it will do with water, but  I&#x27;ve had this for several years and other than occasionally replacing the blade (as expected) it works like new.  Best razor I&#x27;ve used.  I would hesitate moving to a different brand.</li>
            <li> Bought this shaver for my boyfriend and he loved it. This shaver does a good job. Easy to clean, easy to use. Smooth shave.</li>
            <li> This product is my first electric shaver.  I have researched online to find the right product that doesn&#x27;t have too much maintenance and spare parts to purchase. So far I am pleased with the product. It does charge quickly, you have the option to shave dry or wet. I prefer the ladder. When the unit is wet, you can set the dry option in the charger to remove the water in it.. It comes with a power cord that can be used to connect to the charger. If travelling you can take the cord for a corded shave. It does old charge for a great amount of time so you don&#x27;t have to charge it every three day. I usually do it once a week.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8109S still gives me a good close shave after a year of use, even though I haven&#x27;t yet used the cleaning fluid..</li>
            <li> Still using it after a few years, and still working well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this electric razor for 5 years and it still works like a charm!  Honestly I hardly clean it anymore and have NEVER changed the blade inside.  I travel A LOT with this razor and one thing that really sticks out for me is the battery life.  I can probably go about 2 weeks without charging it and using it for 3-4 minutes each time.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a proven, reliable, charger.</li>
            <li> I use it strictly dry. Does a good job.</li>
            <li> This product has high RPM but you must move slowly across your face and exert some pressure to get a &#x27;close&#x27; shave. Even after doing this my beard (slow growing) has a stubble at the end of the day which I&#x27;ve never had before. Comfortable shave with no irritation. Recharges well and cleaning system seems to work well. Only had it for about a month. Cleaning &#x27;soap&#x27; seems expensive (according to enclosed brochure) although I haven&#x27;t actually searched for any. Haven&#x27;t used it in the shower or tried to clean it with hand soap........</li>
            <li> Lets get right to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this item on March 17th, 2011 for $59.99 and have been using it for a little over a year now.  I am a 22 year old Pakistani-American and have thick facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Overall, on the cheeks, the product works fine.  In fact, since its electric, I&#x27;m also able to go against the grain which gives me a much smoother shave than a traditional razor blade.  Very pleased with that.  The cleaning system also works fine and there are no major technical downfalls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: This product just simply doesn&#x27;t work on neck hair.  After a normal run through, I&#x27;d have to go back 3 or 4 times all at differing angles to clean up the neck hair--and even then it doesn&#x27;t catch them all.  I&#x27;d usually have to supplement shaving my neck with a razor blade.  Another downside I found was that contrary to most other men reviewing here on Amazon, the electric shaver took LONGER for me to shave.  Even on the cheeks, after a good shave, I&#x27;d see little hairs poking out that I&#x27;d have to go back to.  With a traditional blade, even with my thick hair, I&#x27;d have the initial shaving with little pulses until the area is clean and follow up with a new lather and new shave.  With this electric razor, I literally have to go through it 3 times until it catches everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would not recommend this product to men with thick facial hair (especially if you have thick neck hair).  If you have thin hair, then perhaps this would work.  I just shaved with a blade for the first time in a year and was amazed at how short it took me.  I will post pictures of my facial hair for reference to compare in 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve any questions, just shoot em here.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this electric shaver from panasonic after a lot of search and going through the reviews that others posted online. I have been using it for almost a month now and I feel pleased with my decision to go for this. The good things about this shaver are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It gives nice smooth and close shave&lt;br /&gt;2) The head can be locked at a position and also can be left otherwise which helps it to move smoothly over your skin.&lt;br /&gt;3) It is rechargeable and the best part is that it can be charged while you are travelling other countries that have 220 volts instead of 110 volts that we have in USA.&lt;br /&gt;4) The battery lasts long once it is fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;5)Last but not the least it comes with a cleaning system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Till now I am pretty pleased and will definitely recommend this product to those looking for a good and long lasting electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abhishek Kala</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES8103 and 8109 (they&#x27;re the same) shave well when they work. I have owned 3. But there are two big problems with both. One problem is the battery. It just doesn&#x27;t last. Yesterday my shaver died after less than one year. My two other shavers also had battery and charging problems. The other problem is the little screen that indicates how much charge is left. That screen begins to lose characters and definition within weeks and after a few months they go blank, meaning that you don&#x27;t know how much charge is left. These Panasonic models will give you a good shave if you plan to use them for just a few months and them throw them away. If you hate wasting your money and want to have a good shaver that will last a reasonable amount of time, then buy a different brand.</li>
            <li> My husband said this was the best razor he ever had.  He has very sensitvie skin and this works perfectly for him.</li>
            <li> This is a horrible horrible product. After about 30 days of use it started pinching and pulling my skin and left a red spot and here and than  and I thought my skin was too dry. This morning it basically cut me up real bad and I have a pic of of my jaw all RED and bloody due to to the machine.....trying to return it but I guess it is to late and get a full refund, says I will receive a partial refund and will have to pay for shipping etc, actually I hate this product so much I am going to send it back along with a picture of my jaws all red......to make a point I am mad as hell</li>
            <li> I was hoping this new shaver would be significantly improved over the Braun Model 7526 I&#x27;ve been using for a dozen years, but it isn&#x27;t. It isn&#x27;t any faster and doesn&#x27;t shave any closer, if as close. I do like the fact that I can use it in the shower and wash it with soap and water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had and used this razor for over a year. I still use my old Panasonic ES8068 from years ago. It&#x27;s heavy and fairly quiet and very reliable. This new Panasonic is very loud (to the point where you wonder if you are damaging your hearing) as well as uncomfortable to hold. Where you would want to hold it while shaving you can&#x27;t because you will cut it off. Panasonic even knows this because it is mentioned in the directions - so why didn&#x27;t they just design it differently? It also gets very hot during your shave which the old versions never did. This razor needs a redesign badly! The cleaning system is its strong suit and I&#x27;ve used this poorly designed razor for over a year because I liked the cleaning system so much. This month I bought an upgraded Norelco with a cleaning system so this Panasonic is on its way to Goodwill. I would not recommend this razor for the money. Their MUCH cheaper battery powered ES4815 is a better design and I travel with that razor a lot and give it 5 stars for the money.</li>
            <li> The razor shaves well, no complaints there.  The wet/dry is great.  The pop up beard trimmer on this razor is virtually useless, I would recommend buying a dedicated trimmer if you need one.  The charging/cleaning base is a bit large, but not too large.  The cleaning modes do take forever to run their cycle, but hey, at least you don&#x27;t have to be around for it to do its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update**&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning base has died.  It no longer will cycle through.  It stalls when it gets to the drying cycle.  Sad since I only used the cleaning cycle about a half dozen times in the time I have owned it, due to how long it took to clean.  -1 star for dead cleaner.</li>
            <li> My husband says that this razor has ruined him for any other saver. According to him: it gives a closer shave, is easy to use, and the self cleaning function is great.</li>
            <li> Very convenient to shave in shower.  This shaver does a good job.  Easy to clean. I&#x27;ve owned it for about a year at approx 5 shaves per week and it still holds charge over 8-10 shaves.</li>
