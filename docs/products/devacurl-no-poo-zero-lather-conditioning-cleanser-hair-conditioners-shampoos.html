            <li>I got a great \\&quot;curly girl\\&quot; haircut to flatter my curls, and using the Deva Curl products feels like a must.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The DevaCurl products are great.  </li>
            <li>This product is affordable and smells great, but it does not work for me.  </li>
            <li>DevaCurl No-Poo has been a great find.</li>
            <li>My scalp is happy, too, no itch and no dryness.    </li>
            <li>It feels great</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear my hair curly, and it works great for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells great, feels like conditioner but gets the job done.</li>
            <li>and it looked great.</li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo, even with no bubbles.  </li>
            <li>I use this with the curl one conditioner and this is a great product.</li>
            <li>Great for curls.</li>

            <li>The shampoo smells great, has no sulfates</li>
            <li>I heard great things about this product &amp; a friend</li>
            <li>Great softening, cleaning, conditioning, and manages to keep my hair in great condition.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t matter because the conditioner smells great.  </li>
            <li>The creme hold stuff smells great too.  </li>
            <li>If your hair is curly or wavy, as mine is, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product</li>

            <li>so great for curly hair</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great, too.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a great combination</li>
            <li>and the price was great.  </li>
            <li>works great with deva conditoner</li>
            <li>A joy to wash my hair.</li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>and my curls are still there happy and</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell great, but it does have a bit of a tingle on my scalp which makes me think it&#x27;s cleaning my scalp since there are no suds.</li>
            <li>lol  </li>
            <li>Great hair cleanser.</li>
            <li>Great cleaning for my 3A curls.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, too.</li>
            <li>But all of the conditioning sans stripping probably explains why it makes your hair look great.</li>
            <li>LOVE the Deva line of products!!</li>
            <li>but I always had very nice hair</li>
            <li>but what ever it is seems to be working amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>I think it will just take more time to figure out what works best.  </li>
            <li>The smell is ok, not the best.</li>
            <li>Its always good to buy one of devacurl&#x27;s low-poo hair cleansers with the no-poo in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I hope it works as good for you as it does for me.  </li>
            <li>Even co-washes aren&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for my hair</li>
            <li>The bottle size is fair for all I needed to use.</li>
            <li>It works fairly well.</li>
            <li>Good stuff</li>
            <li>It cleans my hair well, is good for the environment, has no sulfites, and I don&#x27;t have to use a conditioner.  </li>
            <li>The creme smells good, feels good, and I even rubbed my hands on my face after running it through my hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought a trial pack and loved it immediately.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read a lot of good reviews of Deva No Poo.</li>
            <li>I know people always rave about DevaCurl, and I&#x27;m here to tell you there&#x27;s good reason.</li>
            <li>Good product for my curly hair.</li>
            <li>Good point: bubbles &#x3D; drying.  </li>
            <li>had a lot of really good reviews, so I picked some up.</li>
            <li>It hydrates curls and is even more moisturizing than the one condition surprisingly!</li>
            <li>My scalp and hair felt clean, it smells wonderful,</li>
            <li>But I otherwise love the shampoo, great smell</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and does a great job for curly frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>My curls are healthy, happy, and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with my results.</li>
            <li>it smells wonderful and you don&#x27;t need very much to get the job done.</li>
            <li>(low-poo has a lighter more fruity scent!)</li>
            <li>I have not tried the \\&quot;no poo\\&quot; yet, but I absolutely LOVE the low-poo!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>As a curly haired woman, I love this cleansing conditioner!</li>
            <li>Love Deva Curl products!</li>
            <li>Love curl deva!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>love it!  </li>
            <li>I really love this product!</li>
            <li>use them together and your hair results will be better than you can even imagine!</li>
            <li>I would have it on hand for sure!</li>
            <li>(TIGI Catwalk Strong Mousse works great and isn&#x27;t crunchy at all).  </li>
            <li>Has a healthy feel and pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great on my fine (</li>
            <li>Feels super good!</li>
            <li>It does a great job of getting build up gunk from my hair making it light again while not activating my frizz issue.</li>
            <li>Amazing how my hair looks.</li>
            <li>I could see it being amazing for someone else.</li>
            <li>Nice cleanser.</li>
            <li>Has a tingling sensation from the menthe which is nice.</li>
            <li>The peppermint fragrance is really nice too.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing line, you just have to figure out which combination works best for you.</li>
            <li>I liked it</li>
            <li>just some kind of coincidence, I like my hair texture, but hair lose</li>
            <li>so I just wonder if anyone else is experiencing this kind of problem with this product.</li>
            <li>But I ended up loving this stuff to death.</li>
            <li>Wonderful for curly hair, but I also use it when I plan to blow my hair out straight.</li>
            <li>This  will leave your hair with nice curl and no frizz.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll admit I do miss that nice soapy feeling while washing my hair.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice minty smell to it.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;d tried DevaCurl and liked it.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo has a nice scent but it does not create suds which I knew ahead of time.  </li>
            <li>I was so impressed by reviews I read about this brand that I ordered the whole line.  </li>
            <li>and yes, it smells nice (just like VO5)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any idea why this line has so many good reviews.  </li>
            <li>It does have a nice smell though that isn&#x27;t too overpowering.</li>
            <li>It cleaned my hair nicely.</li>
            <li>If you can get over using shampoo that is creamy and has no suds, you&#x27;ll end up loving this product.</li>
            <li>To each it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s kind of like if you were to apply moisturizer on your face for days without washing it..</li>
            <li>It does clean and lather well, but I&#x27;m still hunting for the best sulfate free poo for my hair.</li>
            <li>But I love the scent of this shampoo and the squeaky clean feeling of my hair after a good shampoo!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far the best product I&#x27;ve ever put on my hair, way better than Wen!</li>
            <li>It is a nice shampoo, but I thought it would be especially good for naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and great product.</li>
            <li>The shampoo does good things for my curls, but dang, it&#x27;s just so strong that if I wash my hair at night, the perfume in the shampoo keeps me up.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong, chemical fragrance smell (to my nose, anyway).  </li>
            <li>my hair looks and feels more purely healthy than i ever thought it could!</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s the best shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner are the best I have found for my naturally curl hair.</li>
            <li>You could use a conditioner from the drugstore that is silicone free that would be just as good for the purpose of cleansing.</li>
            <li>Wonderful scent, leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>the BEST line of hair products I have ever purchased in my adult life.  </li>
            <li>Makes my curly-haired 3 year old&#x27;s hair smell and look great!</li>
            <li>The texture is perfect and not watered down, the smell is minty and I love it!!</li>
            <li>However I do not like the rose scent and get better detangling and even more moisture from DEVA CARE NO POO.</li>
            <li>Very gentle, and does a great job with my damaged hair--it feels softer, silkier, and looks shinier after a couple weeks of using this product.</li>
            <li>this shampoo has no lather and you wonder if it really works, it does, noy hair feels and looks clean and what it does for my curls they look great!</li>
            <li>you should never put a drop of shampoo on your ends, instead use the Deva conditioner after to hydrate you hair from top to bottom and feel your silky hair.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair more receptive to conditioning product as well.</li>
            <li>This product, like the conditioner is ok.</li>
            <li>All in all ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really a low maintenance person, and have become more so, the more children I have, so this product is AWESOME for me!  </li>
            <li>My curly hair looks so much better when I use it...</li>
            <li>plus I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so glad I splurged on this one.  </li>
            <li>My scalp used to get itchy and oily by the end of day two, but with this my scalp feels a lot better.</li>
            <li>I bought both the shampoo and the conditioner (One Condition) and have been quite pleased with both.</li>
            <li>My hair forever lost the ringlets and most of the curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work the curling magic of my hopes and dreams</li>
            <li>I LOVE DevaCurl.  </li>
            <li>Love Deva Curl products.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.    </li>
            <li>I noticed my hair looked so much better when I used this I started using it more often and</li>
            <li>I bought the travel pack and experimented with all the products, but I ended up just using the shampoo and nothing more.  </li>
            <li>Like many, I was intrigued by the Wenn commercials, and like many, I wasn&#x27;t keen to deal with Guthy Renker to get it.  </li>
            <li>I am absolutely healthy and now I keep wondering if the reason could be those DevaCurl products, or it&#x27;s just  </li>
            <li>any more cuase</li>
            <li>your hair needs a bit more conditioning/moisturizing</li>
            <li>Love DevaCurl products.</li>
            <li>I have been using Alterna for a year and wanted to try a more affordable product.</li>
            <li>I love love love love this product.</li>
            <li>I FINALLY found a product that is wonderful!</li>
            <li>First off, the DevaCurl line smells freaking AMAZING!</li>
            <li>And I love rubbing this stuff all over my hair.</li>
            <li>and I love it,</li>
            <li>I do love the smell and the tingly feeling of the peppermint oils.</li>
            <li>I notice the shampoo has brought about more improvement as the weeks go by.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it in time to help.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the scent and the creamy</li>
            <li>I do think my curly hair is better managed with these products</li>
            <li>For my hair, the No-Poo works much better.  </li>
            <li>I think everyone&#x27;s hair is different and the trick is finding what works best for you!</li>
            <li>and I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I simply love it.  </li>
            <li>You just have to make sure that once every 2 weeks you use a lathering shampoo to avoid any build up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 2 years and my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li>Mostly, I just massage my hair with the shower water most days.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shoulder length or more and somewhat</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need to add more, just needed to touch up my hair</li>
            <li>I like biolage better, but can&#x27;t afford it.  </li>
            <li>But this is better than then the Nexxus products.  </li>
            <li>I love using it and just purchased the conditioner as well.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff- shampoo, conditioner, both-</li>
            <li>Love these products.</li>
            <li>You will have to get used to it not lathering in your hair the way regular shampoo does but afterwards, your hair will feel great!</li>
            <li>It does not lather and even without the conditioner my hair feels better.</li>
            <li>- I love these products.</li>
            <li>Everything DevaCurl makes is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It gives my hair more body.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still a great way to wash your hair and my hair was super clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products to manage my curly hair.</li>
            <li>Next day I woke up and my hair was still looking great!</li>
            <li>Just healthy hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many products, i&#x27;m sure like a lot of us curly haired ladies have.</li>
            <li>and although they are a bit pricey I will by them at different times &amp; when I see good deals &amp; just stock up, but the this shampoo is really great.</li>
            <li>This one smells great &amp; I never have any product build up, it really cleans your hair and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it.  </li>
            <li>and I love how well it works with my curly hair</li>
            <li>Okay, I *</li>
            <li>Love all things devacurl.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s like magic, I can run my fingers through her hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never looked or felt better than it does with these products.</li>
            <li>Works well on my wavy, not terribly curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I tried the Lo-Poo but find No-Poo give me more curl.</li>
            <li>but I have to admit that I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair is definitely more moisturized, even without using the conditioner.</li>
            <li>but I need to use way more because it does not lather</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I love that the product tingles a lovely minty or citrus feeling and scent when rubbed into scalp, feels refreshing.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Wish more of them had mentioned the scent.  </li>
            <li>Love Deva curl.</li>
            <li>I can feel perfectly confident with the cleanliness of my har on day two.</li>
            <li>To top it off, I was experiencing acne style bumps in my hairline around my face which have all disappeared.</li>
            <li>love love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The best and only shampoo for curly hair!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li>more than allergic.  </li>
            <li>Satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the vendor didn&#x27;t send it off like that</li>
            <li>I love what the Deva Curl line is doing for my hair.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never been able to control the frizz until I discovered DevaCurl No-Poo and the Conditioner.</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase these hair products and I&#x27;ll update my review after 6 weeks! :)</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find a better No Poo for your hair...</li>
            <li>Love the smell and that it doesn&#x27;t have sulfates.  </li>
            <li>Eh, okay for me.    </li>
            <li>Ok, Update:  </li>
            <li>I am glad i did.</li>
            <li>I like the lo-poo better.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>The more I use this the better</li>
            <li>It does have things in it that is better on curly hair</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this product is that I can detangle my hair while washing it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like magic.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>love the smell of it.</li>
            <li>I like the product, however - the scent is overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It was okay.</li>
            <li>More would come out when I worked the conditioner through my ends.</li>
            <li>I use Redken Curvaceous now and love it so much more.</li>
            <li>LOVE having fewer chemicals in my hair.</li>
            <li>but I still use a stronger more clarifying shampoo a couple of times a month.  </li>
            <li>these products are great for my curly hair (I am 69 years old!!!)  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair clean and healthy!  </li>
            <li>It makes my scalp tingle, makes my hair smell good and smooths my course, dry, frizz-prone hair beautifully.  </li>
            <li>this will be the first thing I pack in my survival kit!!!</li>
            <li>I was very excited to use this as soon as it arrived.</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair shiny and nice frizz free condition..love the curls......and even smooth I love it.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much at first.  </li>
            <li>STRONG scent though, which I found surprising as a pervious user of DevaCurl Low-Poo, which has a much more gentle scent!</li>
            <li>The No Poo leaves my scalp and hair clean, even though using a cleanser that doesn&#x27;t lather took some getting used to!</li>
            <li>Love what this does for my fine, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>I have used plenty of other cheap conditioners for CO-Washing, many cone-free, and have been way more impressed with the results.</li>
            <li>Great product for naturally curly hair, but don&#x27;t expect a lot of suds.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and happy.  </li>
            <li>great natural product</li>
            <li>A good friend uses the shampoo for straight hair and loves it.</li>
            <li>Great product for curly girls - no lather cleanser is important to not dry out curly hair and this product is highly recommended by my stylist so I was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This line of product definitely makes my curls look gorgeous!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to comb my hair out after using it.</li>
            <li>My hair has never been so clean, bouncy and healthy.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells and it leaves my hair feeling clean without a lather.</li>
            <li>Love the clean feel.</li>
            <li>The scent is fantastic and it leaves my hair feeling so soft and looking great.</li>
            <li>This shampoo does help to keep my curls more intact and bouncy but not as clean as I would like.</li>
            <li>It has a strong perfume-like smell that lingers on your head for hours.  </li>
            <li>The bottom line is that if you use this shampoo you will smell *strongly* like a cough drop.</li>
            <li>I feared that something this good would cost too much, but it fits comfortably within my budget.</li>
            <li>The smell is hideous and strong.  </li>
            <li>hair is baby fine and tangles easily.  </li>
            <li>I saw amazing results after the first time I used this</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think I have the technique down perfect yet.  </li>
            <li>I wanted it to be the last product that touched my hair because of it&#x27;s smell, but was happy that the other DevaCurl products smell equally as great - thank you DevaCurl!</li>
            <li>It leaves my fine shoulder length type 3 curly hair moisturized.</li>
            <li>, this is fine.</li>
            <li>Packaging was fine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s baby fine, wavy and</li>
            <li>(I have 2B/C waves - fine hair, a tendency toward both frizziness and greasiness)</li>
            <li>My fine hair comes out with added body and no frizz.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT I HAVE FOUND A PRODUCT TO CALM MY CURLY HAIR, IT IS ALSO GOOD FOR MY HAIR</li>
            <li>I love the DevaCare which has just a mild minty fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and have been ready to shave my head many times trying to deal with it!</li>
            <li>Maybe the formula has changed since she recommended it because while I&#x27;m sure the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; aspect of it would work out great for my naturally curly hair, the strong rose scent caused an instant headache.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made a huge difference in conjunction with the No-Poo.  </li>
            <li>SLS-free, smells amazing, and cleans better than shampoo; it doesn&#x27;t strip my hair of its natural sheen.  </li>
            <li>Even though Deva is a product which is sulfate and sodium free</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and cleans well.  </li>
            <li>This product worked great for my hair when it was short.</li>
            <li>Shampoo lightly to retain the curl, and the waves droop and look greasy.</li>
            <li>Fabulous book on caring for curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>and my hair looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>After washing my hair, I use the leave-in conditioner and then the light gel.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is absolutely fabulous.</li>
            <li>I used a whole bottle of No-Poo and honestly didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li>It smells like cheap perfume, like roses and it&#x27;s too overpowering.</li>
            <li>One Condition and Frizz free Volumizing mousse because they perform so well.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair silky smooth, helps decrease frizz and helps with styling.</li>
            <li>it makes it feel smooth</li>
            <li>I am allergic to sulfa and Deva products are sulfa free.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m talking $1 conditioners like V05 or Suave, that you can find dirt cheap at K-Mart, Target, Wal-Mart, drug stores, etc</li>
            <li>Overall great product.</li>
            <li>With No Poo, the curls that surface are actually waves I can be happy about.  </li>
            <li>so I could utilize my Prime membership and get free shipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to use the products as directed to see the results.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Deva Curl Angel Light</li>
            <li>Well, Set It Free did not control the frizz (Got2be Shine Serum works like a charm) and the Arc Angel gel didn&#x27;t hold my style</li>
            <li>I bought this one and the deva girl set it free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not gluten free and irritated the heck out of my scalp...</li>
            <li>For me, the scent of a product is equally important as whether or not it can get the job done.</li>
            <li>This shampoo fit the bill.</li>
            <li>Love the fresh smell</li>
            <li>Also, although I only apply this to my scalp, I found myself having to use loads of this product on my medium thickness hair which makes this a bit pricey even for the great deal you get on Amazon.</li>
            <li>but I have wavy hair and it works fantastic.</li>
            <li>My three year old daughter has gorgeous ringlet curls.  </li>
            <li>so far so good.  </li>
            <li>Very odd that it doesn&#x27;t lather, but still cleaned my hair fantastically - and smells great!  </li>
            <li>Very fresh &amp; clean.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li>Since moving to them I have seen my daughter&#x27;s hair look more vibrant and healthy.  </li>
            <li>When I got married I stopped using perms because I could see more damage from the perms chemicals.</li>
            <li>This was the first I&#x27;d tried after WEN, thinking this may do more for my waves.</li>
            <li>so maybe this isn&#x27;t the original formula?</li>
            <li>I was so excited to use this.</li>
            <li>The first time I used No-Poo, I had to pick the bottle up again to make sure I hadn&#x27;t grabbed conditioner by mistake.</li>
            <li>She replies that if she could perm like that, she would be a rich woman.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>It is a nice product for once or twice a week, It tended to weigh it down a bit with daily use, but it does feel great and enviromentally kind...</li>
            <li>With this, I never felt clean.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo doesn&#x27;t seem to get my hair really clean.</li>
            <li>When I started working out, I needed something to make my scalp feel clean.    </li>
            <li>It gets my scalp clean, I can feel it.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is not designed to clean the oil from your scalp but it does clean product residue.  </li>
            <li>Gets hair clean and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I use a refresher mist in the mornings to clean up the shape of it and go.  </li>
            <li>Like if you don&#x27;t have lather you might not think your hair is clean, so let&#x27;s dump in some mint to mimic the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling of toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I swear I could spend 15 minutes just siting there and smells this amazing stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, as you most likely heard there is no lather in this, but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like you&#x27;re washing your hair with conditioner, but it does leave your hair clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell, but this shampoo does seem to clean my scalp without drying out my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fantastic for someone with much thicker hair, but it just didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li>Great for dry curly hair.</li>
            <li>Great for dry curly swimmers hair.</li>
            <li>It doesnt feel like your hair is getting clean</li>
            <li>This product has been great to help the condition of my dry colored hair.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice minty aroma and it leaves the hair seemingly clean although I don&#x27;t know if it completely cleans the scalp.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed after the first few washes -</li>
            <li>I love this stuff so much that I bought 2 - one bottle to keep at home and one for my gym bag.</li>
            <li>so I ordered the full bottle.</li>
            <li>may do more for people with much curlier hair, but if all you have is wave, I&#x27;d try something else.</li>
            <li>It made such a good lotion.  </li>
            <li>Also, make sure you really rinse well.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft after washing it out.</li>
            <li>And I am very hyper-sensitive to many  </li>
            <li>I was doing the no-poo challenge but was having difficulty with my hair being incredibly greasy after just a few hours.</li>
            <li>It smells really good, and my hair actually feels clean/refreshed after I use it.</li>
            <li>With this cleanser, my hair feels clean again and super moisturized.</li>
            <li>Liked the look, soft curls.</li>
            <li>I recently tried this shampoo again and loved it...stapling.</li>
            <li>It really does feel like you&#x27;re just putting more conditioner on your hair every time you wash</li>
            <li>I have used several what I would call luxury products, Curl Junkie, Oyin, Darcy&#x27;s Botanicals, all good.  </li>
            <li>They smell fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Makes my scalp feel fresh and clean and</li>
            <li>well conditioned, adequately moisturized hair/scalp that is neither goopy, greasy, or crunchy.  </li>
            <li>I have not had great success styling my hair with these products but am not ready to give up yet.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was quick with Prime and on time.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo soothes the scalp, reduces frizz, smells fantastic yet natural and has no nasty parabens or sulfates.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re more defined and my husband constantly tells me it looks sexy</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and packaged well.  </li>
            <li>This is not my favorite shampoo but it ranks better than any drugstore or regular store shampoo!</li>
            <li>I am super frugal by nature</li>
            <li>When I was a little girl I had beautiful curly hair.</li>
            <li>It softens and moisturizes and helps to enhance curl pattern while refreshing the senses with a surprisingly clean smell with the odd rose peppermint fragrance.</li>
            <li>Basically, it smells exactly like some cheap, vile, powdery-floral bathroom spray.</li>
            <li>My normally extremely frizzy hair is now tamed, my fine hair has never been able to hold a curl for more than 12 hours (without a lot of product) and the curls would fall out into waves immediately if touched.  </li>
            <li>Along with the other products, conditioner and light hold, it woks great on my daughters hair, really helps with the frizziness</li>
            <li>The only thing that I am not too thrill about is the smell of the no-poo and conditioner, but the curl gel smells great and kind of mask the smell of the other products.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to the no poo movement, you may have to use more often gradually weaning off every day cleaning.  </li>
            <li>The No Poo is good for dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li>The pirce is good and it didn&#x27;t dry out my hair</li>
            <li>It seems to clean very well and leaves my hair feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li>You need to get used to no suds when you first use it, but the feel of your hair will keep you using it!</li>
            <li>I have a perm and it is great, especially when the perm is new.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and scalp and am very glad there&#x27;s a product that I can use to clean the product residue without leaving my hair drier than it already is.</li>
            <li>I have fine, very curly hair that hates me and the rest of the world.  </li>
            <li>Not only is my curl amazing now, I do not have to wash my hair every day like before.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and wanted to try this shampoo because I thought it would help hold my curls and keep them looking better throughout the day.</li>
            <li>But I do find that my hair seems healthy and soft when washed with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair seems to be more moisturized, with soft and improved curls.</li>
            <li>Probably won&#x27;t work for everyone, but definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>For you curly haired people out there, you already know this in itself makes this product worth</li>
            <li>I have not had success using the additional conditioner and gel to style my hair.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Must better than any of my old products.</li>
            <li>and I figured it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>I really cannot say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all the conditioning cleansers and this one is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through Redken, Mixed Chicks, Miss Jessie&#x27;s, BioSilk, MoroccanOil, Pantene and who knows what else, but I honestly don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever been happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yeah, I look more frizzy, but only marginally, and my hair feels clean.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely curly hair and always have difficulty finding good shampoos.</li>
            <li>Does not smell right at all</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t right for my hair.</li>
            <li>when I use it I really feel like my hair is getting really clean.</li>
            <li>on my straight hair days, it didn&#x27;t feel clean.  </li>
            <li>and it makes me wonder if my hair is really getting clean.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product with high hopes, but the smell of this shampoo is so strong, it was really overpowering!  </li>
            <li>I have really curly hair &amp; have always struggled to find good products that don&#x27;t dry out my hair.  </li>
            <li>Like many gals out there, I&#x27;ve pretty much have tried EVERYTHING, even the high price/name brand products and none work as well as curl deva.</li>
            <li>Its turkish rose and peppermint, and it seems to stick in my hair all day long.</li>
            <li>This product is good to have, but it&#x27;s not really worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to read all the reviews about this product and had high hopes.</li>
            <li>I have used Suave Shea Butter Conditioner (less than $2 at Safeway) as a &amp;#34;nonlathering hair cleanser&amp;#34; and my hair is shiny, wavy, and smells really good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing in that your curls really do react differently with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The formulation really is quite amazing that a shampoo can cause your curls to &#x27;behave&#x27; differently!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really nice product for dry curly hair.</li>
            <li>Once my regimen in the shower is complete, I rinse my hair out, leaving it nice and soft again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to using Jessicurl Hair Cleansing Creme, which smells FABULOUS (to me), but admittedly isn&#x27;t available on Amazon Prime.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>Overall, I would say the product is good so far.  </li>
            <li>It leaves it clean, soft and super curly.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure that this would actually work to get my hair clean and must admit that sometimes I still feel like I need a real shampoo.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product because of the all natural ingredients and lack of harmful chemicals</li>
            <li>It actually reminds me of the smell of perm solution -- it&#x27;s very strong and chemical-like (the conditioner smells only slightly better -- like the soap in the car wash).</li>
            <li>I LOVE this cleanser because it seems to clean AND moisturize without weighing my hair down or making it look super greasy -</li>
            <li>And they have very FAST growing 3b wavy/big ringlets hair type.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle</li>
            <li>It has no lather but leaves your hair clean and feeling extra smooth.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and it leaves my hair feeling soft and clean!</li>
            <li>The water based product is a plus, as well as no sulfites in the \\&quot;no Poo\\&quot;  If you have curly hair, try it, you might love it...and if you don&#x27;t, sell it back to someone who does!</li>
            <li>If you have oil production in your scalp you might like Low Poo shampoo better, by Diva because NO poo doesn&#x27;t lather AT ALL</li>
            <li>I started out with cheap Suave natural conditioner which was ho hum.</li>
            <li>HOT...</li>
            <li>My hair got much healthier when I started using this!</li>
            <li>This is the first product of this type that I have used.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo for those with curly or otherwise delicate hair.</li>
            <li>I recently stumbled upon the curly girl method and I love this no poo cleanser.  </li>
            <li>the reason I purchased in the first place.</li>
            <li>After my first use, I realized I probably should  have purchased the conditioner too.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, it works wonders for hair and is the only cleanser that I can use for months</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon and DevaCurl!</li>
            <li>Most regular shampoos blow up my hair shafts (because of coloring/streaking with foils every month?).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Deva Curl products for a year now &amp; it is the first line of products that work &amp; still continue to work.  </li>
            <li>No Poo smells awesome, One Condition to me smells weird.  </li>
            <li>This really seems to do the trick!</li>
            <li>I have grown accustom and love Deva Curls products, only con I have with the No Poo</li>
            <li>The lack of lather was concerning to me first because I&#x27;m so used to it</li>
            <li>first time my daughter&#x27;s hair had shine</li>
            <li>I wholeheartedly recommend this product, but make sure you only use products that are compatible-</li>
            <li>Now, months later, I have stopped using it, and my hair feels better now that I&#x27;ve gotten all the no poo out.  </li>
            <li>I have frizzy hair, a cross between curly and wavy, and got this thinking it would define my curls more.</li>
            <li>Wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much!</li>
            <li>I have very fine, very curly hair and recently jumped on the no-poo train.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so good after using this stuff and it&#x27;s less frizzy too!</li>
            <li>I follow up with Lace Therapy&#x27;s Detangling treatment and a quick spritz of either DevaCurl&#x27;s Set it Free or Global Keratin&#x27;s Hair Taming spray.</li>
            <li>Good for a quick clean, but is not strong enough to remove chorine, hair spray, etc.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel soft but not as clean as with a foaming shampoo.</li>
            <li>i absolutely love it, makes my hair feels real clean, need only small amount, not for people who think they need a lot of lather to get their hair clean</li>
            <li>well, defrizzes a decent amount, smells nice, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp like shampoo.</li>
            <li>If your scalp does not produce much oil, this product could work well for you, since it&#x27;s very gentle on curls.  </li>
            <li>Also have to make sure to hydrate my hair with Rosemary oil more frequently because I noticed that after shampoo-ing it does need a little &amp;#</li>
            <li>This one is a decent price and leaves my hair looking normal and clean.</li>
            <li>after the first wash, my curls have more structure, bounce and vitality, and the ends are no longer brittle and dry.  </li>
            <li>As a curly-haired woman who&#x27;s tried pretty much every product on the market</li>
            <li>On the one hand, it&#x27;s more economical than some other nonlathering shampoos, so you won&#x27;t go broke trying it.</li>
            <li>If you can get past the smell, it is a good product.</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean &amp; hasn&#x27;t shed anywhere near as much as before.</li>
            <li>Leaves a nice smell to your hair but does not weigh it down.  </li>
            <li>(I use it also on my LONG, fine, 4a natural Black hair with great results -- however I use Aussie moist conditioner, followed by sealing my ends with grape seed oil/sweet almond oil and finish up with Oyin Handmade Hair Dew for moisture and defined coilies.  </li>
            <li>very long hair prone to breakage, mostly because she refuses to cut it,</li>
            <li>My scalp tends to be dry, but it is much better with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I believe it&#x27;s mint and rose -- an odd combination.</li>
            <li>My hair is always super soft, shiny and feels silky, just from this-</li>
            <li>I walked into work the next day and people 3 desks away commented on how strong it was.</li>
            <li>Certainly does not strip or damage in any way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll certainly hold on to the bottle to use every now and then, but I&#x27;ll be purchasing a sulfate-free shampoo, as DevaCurl just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>Okay, I have never tried a no lather shampoo and to be honest, I was pretty skeptical.</li>
            <li>used Deva Curl for a few weeks now, and after only one week noted that my hair is much shinier, softer, and has beautiful waves.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is so gentle and moisturizing that I can use a regular conditioner and be absolutely fine.</li>
            <li>So I am a Caucasian female with fine sometimes-wavy/mostly straight hair but was looking for a &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Coconut Co-Wash is great, too, but it left my hair feeling a little too greasy.  </li>
            <li>This cleanser works very well on my 2b/c hair.  </li>
            <li>Shampoo too much to get it cleaner</li>
            <li>What I wash with doesn&#x27;t make too much difference because it will be frizzy if I don&#x27;t set it somehow</li>
            <li>He really likes these products and has switched over to this brand.</li>
            <li>I was sceptical about this whole &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; business, but my curls were getting drier and frizzier as my hair got grayer.</li>
            <li>(even tho my hair is straight &amp; no curls), so I bought a travel size just to try it.</li>
            <li>I rub it in well and let it set a minute, then rinse it really really well.</li>
            <li>My hair was damaged from meds for my breast cancer and this shampoo really helped it.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how someone with really curly hair could use this and not wash for a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>This product might appear cheaper by the ounce but the amount you have to use is almost three times as much product.</li>
            <li>I really like loo poo,&lt;br /&gt;however and deva curl conditioner.</li>
            <li>However, the smell is just too much.</li>
            <li>and if you have curly hair you really should try it.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t want to have to spend that much on it</li>
            <li>I have very curly, kinky, frizzy hair</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t notice a difference in my hair being &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; or not.</li>
            <li>I guess I really will have to see if there is a difference with the conditioner.</li>
            <li>Shampoo bottle packed in an envelope and much of the contents of the bottle leaked out.</li>
            <li>ONE CONDITION with the DEVA Care and go straight to styling if I choose.</li>
            <li>I have VERY curly hair.</li>
            <li>have very processed hair.  </li>
            <li>The trick is to really use your fingers and massage the scalp as you wash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very conditioning which is what curls need.</li>
            <li>;  Another thing that REALLY helps is my Aquasana Water Purifier for my shower.  </li>
            <li>I really was convinced I had straight hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s overpoweringly intense - like nausea/migraine inducing.</li>
            <li>This is an absolute product for anyone who has curly hair.  </li>
            <li>That scared me off the whole</li>
            <li>I take the &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; and really work it into her hair and scalp</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair and</li>
            <li>In short, this product makes my hair look absolutely fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a project that creates this much build-up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks softer and very shiny.</li>
            <li>Gentle on my hair</li>
            <li>I really recommend this</li>
            <li>course, scent is a very subjective experience, and your mileage may vary.  </li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing</li>
            <li>it keeps my hair clean and not dry.</li>
            <li>Gentle on my hair.  </li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>hair looks and feels much too.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
            <li>I found that this made my hair feel very greasy.</li>
            <li>no frizz that I get from &#x27;real&#x27; shampoo lather.</li>
            <li>Really cleansed my hair and conditioned it as well.  </li>
            <li>do like the smell of it, however, and have mixed it with my regular shampoo on occasion for that nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But on the whole this has been great for my curly, thin, and dyed hair.  </li>
            <li>So if you have really fine curly hair that normally ends up as wavy a couple of hours after it dries, this product may improve the health of your hair enough to allow it curl and hold shape like it did mine.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life I finally have silky shiny hair while using this product,, definitely recommend. :)</li>
            <li>There was several complaints to the smell, but to be honest it&#x27;s not bad, just a heavy \\&quot;natural\\&quot; smell to it</li>
            <li>There are plenty of non-natural ingredients on the label, including the extremely offensive \\&quot;Parfum (Perfume)\\&quot; - so I should have known better.</li>
            <li>I would buy more, try some other of their products, and recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would be possible for a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t lather to properly clean your hair.</li>
            <li>but sometimes I just use a regular shampoo to feel totally clean.  </li>
            <li>The scent is a little strong, and I am still not used to it!  </li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s best to avoid sulfates, but because they&#x27;re missing, this doesn&#x27;t lather, and I feel like it&#x27;s hard to tell when I&#x27;ve gotten it thoroughly disbursed through my very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t experience any scalp issues, so I would really caution against using this if you already have problems with your scalp.</li>
            <li>The price I got on Amazon beats anything local (I can&#x27;t afford shopping local principles right now) and even in Alaska I received it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>This product smells good and leaves my hair clean without turning it into a dried frizzy mess.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shampoo, my hair does not get weighed down, and boy does it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit odd at first to wash without seeing a lather and your brain wants to say \\&quot;no lather/foam &#x3D; not clean\\&quot; but it really does get your hair clean without the lather.  </li>
            <li>I had a gift certificate from Christmas and really needed some new hair products.  </li>
            <li>With this product less is always more</li>
            <li>My hair is much less frizzy, and the curls are much better defined.</li>
            <li>It left my hair smelling fresh and clean and left my hair managable for it being so curly</li>
            <li>My hair is curly in back and the middle, and wavy in front top and sides.  </li>
            <li>I used to shampoo once daily (sometimes more) with a daily clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is decent but I wouldn&#x27;t staple it just yet.</li>
            <li>I switched back to Alterna and after a few days I&#x27;m back to beautiful shiny hair</li>
            <li>It is so gentle to my uber sensitive skin and has a very delicate, botanical fragrance that is so pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone struggling with the no-poo thing.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone curly hair or not.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to all curly hair types.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for anyone with curly hair.</li>
            <li>properly care for my daughter&#x27;s hair I first ordered the book Curly Girl!  </li>
            <li>fresh and No-Poo helps my color stay so vibrant that when I went to get my hair done last week</li>
            <li>I have really fine curly/wavy hair and the shampoo just weighed it down so much</li>
            <li>non-foaming shampoo cleans the hair gently but completely, and leaves it silky-soft.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair and it keeps my scalp clean and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Few more weeks and this continued, so I threw the rest away.</li>
            <li>For the first couple of weeks of use, this product seemed like a miracle worker on my extremely dry, chemically damaged hair because it is intensely moisturizing and gentle.</li>
            <li>This is the only product so far that has kept my curls looking natural and full of life - as they should.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like putting on a new wig every time I wash it.</li>
            <li>I live at the shore</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t buy them where I live</li>
            <li>It makes your hair soft and gives more hold, but I thought doing that made my hair feel heavy, but I did try it.  </li>
            <li>Organics Lemongrass + Argan Stem Cell Shampoo - moisturizing AND clarifying, smells divine and is a high quality natural product</li>
            <li>It was very soft.</li>
            <li>The No-Poo was a little strange the first couple of times since it doesn&#x27;t produce suds, but I adjusted quickly, and my hair is definitely not dirty.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft, moisturized, and I dont have frizz or tangles anymore!  </li>
            <li>I am in love with the smell, every product has a different type of smell, but along the same lines a similar smell.</li>
            <li>Not sure, but I am sure my daughter hates it.  </li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s so fine, I typically have to wash every day, which is wreaking havoc on the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li>and my hair is exposed to all sorts of weather every day and yet my hair is soft and untangled!</li>
            <li>Regardless, the No-Poo didn&#x27;t help my dandruff at all, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s made much of a difference in my hair in general.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that gets dry quick so after hearing about this product, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Next was having the proper products to keep the hair clean and detangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you realize that it won&#x27;t &amp;#34;suds&amp;#34; up like other shampoos do but still leaves your hair and scalp clean</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not sure if I was shipped the same product as all the higher star reviewers or those reviews were posted prior to long term regular use</li>
            <li>difference may be the absence of silicone - it seems like a lot of the other cleansing cremes are full of chems including silicone, and silicone is a pretty greasy substance, something I would think would create buildup instead of remove</li>
            <li>My hair did get a little greasy at first because I was used to using the typical large glob of other brand shampoo to get a good wash.</li>
            <li>I use the right type of dryer too (which I don&#x27;t use every single time).</li>
            <li>For a curly girl it would be hard to find a better product.</li>
            <li>At $18/12 oz bottle, it&#x27;s a little pricey, but very worth it to me.</li>
            <li>It works great keeping my hair from frizzing, however, my hair feels so greasy and dirty and has been falling out.</li>
            <li>Leave-in - it&#x27;s natural and smells like an absolute dream but requires a daily wash.</li>
            <li>The waves perk up, the hair shines, and everything swings naturally.</li>
            <li>For those that have curly hair (mine&#x27;s natural)</li>
            <li>The book also gave suggestions on how to cut the hair to maintain the curl&#x27;s natural shape.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy (no suds) and rinses out complete.  </li>
            <li>My hair is finally soft, shiny and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft.  </li>
            <li>and wow what a difference.</li>
            <li>After using DevaCurl cleanser and conditioner for almost 3 years, I of corse have an addiction because those make my hair really really soft, but my hair start falling a lot, of course everyone complains about this problem</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to perfumes, dyes etc.</li>
            <li>and this tames my hair and it leaves it really soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It keeps hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I have a natural wave to my hair</li>
            <li>This product has really helped get a lot of shine and health back to my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m reviewing the 3 products as a whole system overall.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo allows my hairs natural wave and curl to come to life.  </li>
            <li>and oh so soft.</li>
            <li>I do still use the conditioner on occasion, but using both in one wash left my curly hair looking very greasy.</li>
            <li>I have blonde straight medium length hair.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and this shampoo works wonders.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair frizz-free, and enhances the natural wave that I have.</li>
            <li>This no-poo cleanser makes my curls so soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair shiny and soft and it is helping prolong the life of the Brazilian blowout..</li>
            <li>and it takes much longer to wash the product than regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>it did make my hair feel really soft.</li>
            <li>Being sulfate-free, this product produces zero lather, which feels really strange at first.  </li>
            <li>However, this is BY FAR</li>
            <li>The change away from harsh detergents can cause your scalp to seem extra oily - it&#x27;s used to being stripped of all oils and needing to overproduce more oil out of desperation to protect itself.  </li>
            <li>My hair never looks or feels dried out (and I swim daily in a lake over the summer), and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I do not use any styling products at all and only rarely use the One Condition (the No-Poo conditions enough for my hair)</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m forced to use a more clarifying shampoo soon after using this to avoid furiously scratching at my head all day.</li>
            <li>I have superfine, loosely curled, over shoulder length hair that can get really dry and frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>I have very fine and very dry curly hair, and shampoo is too harsh for me</li>
            <li>I did decent research into the product and received mixed reviews.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem particularly moisturizing, but it is definitely non-stripping.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it, but once a week I use the Low Poo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently switched back from synthetic to human hair wigs, and I&#x27;ve found the thick, wavy texture challenging to keep in the right condition.</li>
            <li>No more dandruff and my scalp and hair feel so clean and soft!</li>
            <li>I dye it regularly and high heat wave, curl, or straighten depending on my mood.  </li>
            <li>I also chose to use the DevaCare Arc AnGell Extra Hold Conditioning Gel as it seemed my hair needed a little more hold than the regular gel provided.  </li>
            <li>Make sure hair is evenly  wet before distributing No-Poo since it does not create foam as with typical shampoo product.</li>
            <li>In the past, when I have tried to go without shampooing for a day, my hair became greasy and flat on top.  </li>
            <li>, this is the first time EVER in my 45 years that I haven&#x27;t had to use a conditioner in order to brush my wet hair without tears.  </li>
            <li>This is the only stuff that makes me look like a normal person.  </li>
            <li>, I have very fine, thin, wavy hair.    </li>
            <li>I have colored, blond, wavy hair and live in Southern California.</li>
            <li>Wen was okay, but too expensive, and it made my hair fall out after using it too much.  </li>
            <li>The fact that it does not lather is hard to get used to, but the hair washes nicely and does not over dry like regular shampoos.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my hair feel strange.. dry right from rinsing  </li>
            <li>If it needs to be freshened up (after fun in the sandbox) I use a little bit of the conditioner when she is in the tub.  </li>
            <li>After about 2 weeks of use, I went back to my old sulfate shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I never really spent lots of money on hair products</li>
            <li>Not rough the way some shampoos leave your hair feeling.</li>
            <li>The only thing that would have made me happier would be to find Amazon selling it directly</li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might go back to my old routine.&lt;br /&gt;Acure</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy/curly hair but never before could I make a daily style work</li>
            <li>Only used it once so far, but my curls are bouncy and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been curious about Wen ever since I saw my first infomercial, but I did my research and found a lot of mixed reviews which scared me off.  </li>
            <li>Some have worked OK, but not great.</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair and this shampoo actually made it look straight, frizzy, and dry.  </li>
            <li>I even let my hair dry naturally and the ensuing curls were soft and looked</li>
            <li>I have wavy, corse frizzy hair and this makes it very soft especially the second day.</li>
            <li>on the other side -- and can&#x27;t really see any difference.</li>
            <li>It just proves to me how much other shampoos dry out my hair and the ones I use</li>
            <li>Otherwise, sometimes I simply spritz her hair with a water bottle filled with a few drops of essential oil such as lavendar or orange mixed with water.  </li>
            <li>for curls - I have half very wavy &amp; half very straight hair.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, all the hype DevaCurl spends on making their product sound like it&#x27;s better for you than a sudsing shampoo seems sort of misplaced if they can&#x27;t even take out the artificial scents.   </li>
            <li>The girls at my salon told me to stick it out for a few weeks because I might not like it at first.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it-I hated it because my hair just felt greasy-but after a few more times and finally getting rid of the buildup that I had in my hair-I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>wish it was still made with the older recipe because it is a much more artificial product</li>
            <li>I get lots of compliments on my hair, mainly from other curly-haired women.</li>
            <li>you want clean, fluffy hair with NO tangles, use just this product without the other products.  </li>
            <li>my hair is soft and shiny and my bouncy curls look like I just stepped out of the salon, even after letting them air dry!</li>
            <li>Very disappointed in this product but love many others in the DevaCurl line.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Deva for a little over a year and highly recommend ALL curly girls to make the change to DEVA!  </li>
            <li>I rinsed the conditioner very well and then, still in the shower, I squeezed the excess water and applied a little of the Curl Angel Gel.</li>
            <li>I had been using typical drug store brands to where my curly hair was becoming a frizzy mess and not really curly anymore.</li>
            <li>But the bad out weighed the good here for me.</li>

            <li> Deva works great for me!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not do anything remotely impressive for my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo, I wish that it didn&#x27;t smell like roses and chamomile</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 Deva Curl products from my stylist who insisted that all three would work together to produce awesome results.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t lather which is perfect.  </li>
            <li> Best combo out there.</li>

            <li> I was so happy.</li>
            <li> I got a great \\&quot;curly girl\\&quot; haircut to flatter my curls, and using the Deva Curl products feels like a must.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The DevaCurl products are great.  </li>
            <li> This product is affordable and smells great, but it does not work for me.  </li>
            <li> DevaCurl No-Poo has been a great find.</li>
            <li> My scalp is happy, too, no itch and no dryness.    </li>
            <li> It feels great</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear my hair curly, and it works great for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells great, feels like conditioner but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> and it looked great.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo, even with no bubbles.  </li>
            <li> I use this with the curl one conditioner and this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Great for curls.</li>
            <li> It cleans my hair and leaves it smelling great.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo smells great, has no sulfates</li>
            <li> I heard great things about this product &amp; a friend</li>
            <li> Great softening, cleaning, conditioning, and manages to keep my hair in great condition.  </li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t matter because the conditioner smells great.  </li>
            <li> The creme hold stuff smells great too.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is curly or wavy, as mine is, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great for curly hair.</li>
            <li> so great for curly hair</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great, too.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a great combination</li>
            <li> and the price was great.  </li>
            <li> works great with deva conditoner</li>
            <li> A joy to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> Works great</li>
            <li> and my curls are still there happy and</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell great, but it does have a bit of a tingle on my scalp which makes me think it&#x27;s cleaning my scalp since there are no suds.</li>
            <li> lol  </li>
            <li> Great hair cleanser.</li>
            <li> Great cleaning for my 3A curls.  </li>
            <li> It smells great, too.</li>
            <li> But all of the conditioning sans stripping probably explains why it makes your hair look great.</li>
            <li> LOVE the Deva line of products!!</li>
            <li> but I always had very nice hair</li>
            <li> but what ever it is seems to be working amazing!</li>
            <li> Amazing product!</li>
            <li> I think it will just take more time to figure out what works best.  </li>
            <li> The smell is ok, not the best.</li>
            <li> Its always good to buy one of devacurl&#x27;s low-poo hair cleansers with the no-poo in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I hope it works as good for you as it does for me.  </li>
            <li> Even co-washes aren&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for my hair</li>
            <li> The bottle size is fair for all I needed to use.</li>
            <li> It works fairly well.</li>
            <li> Good stuff</li>
            <li> It cleans my hair well, is good for the environment, has no sulfites, and I don&#x27;t have to use a conditioner.  </li>
            <li> The creme smells good, feels good, and I even rubbed my hands on my face after running it through my hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought a trial pack and loved it immediately.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of good reviews of Deva No Poo.</li>
            <li> I know people always rave about DevaCurl, and I&#x27;m here to tell you there&#x27;s good reason.</li>
            <li> Good product for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> Good point: bubbles &#x3D; drying.  </li>
            <li> had a lot of really good reviews, so I picked some up.</li>
            <li> It hydrates curls and is even more moisturizing than the one condition surprisingly!</li>
            <li> My scalp and hair felt clean, it smells wonderful,</li>
            <li> But I otherwise love the shampoo, great smell</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and does a great job for curly frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> My curls are healthy, happy, and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with my results.</li>
            <li> it smells wonderful and you don&#x27;t need very much to get the job done.</li>
            <li> (low-poo has a lighter more fruity scent!)</li>
            <li> I have not tried the \\&quot;no poo\\&quot; yet, but I absolutely LOVE the low-poo!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> As a curly haired woman, I love this cleansing conditioner!</li>
            <li> Love Deva Curl products!</li>
            <li> Love curl deva!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> love it!  </li>
            <li> I really love this product!</li>
            <li> use them together and your hair results will be better than you can even imagine!</li>
            <li> I would have it on hand for sure!</li>
            <li> (TIGI Catwalk Strong Mousse works great and isn&#x27;t crunchy at all).  </li>
            <li> Has a healthy feel and pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great on my fine (</li>
            <li> Feels super good!</li>
            <li> It does a great job of getting build up gunk from my hair making it light again while not activating my frizz issue.</li>
            <li> Amazing how my hair looks.</li>
            <li> I could see it being amazing for someone else.</li>
            <li> Nice cleanser.</li>
            <li> Has a tingling sensation from the menthe which is nice.</li>
            <li> The peppermint fragrance is really nice too.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing line, you just have to figure out which combination works best for you.</li>
            <li> I liked it</li>
            <li> just some kind of coincidence, I like my hair texture, but hair lose</li>
            <li> so I just wonder if anyone else is experiencing this kind of problem with this product.</li>
            <li> But I ended up loving this stuff to death.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for curly hair, but I also use it when I plan to blow my hair out straight.</li>
            <li> This  will leave your hair with nice curl and no frizz.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll admit I do miss that nice soapy feeling while washing my hair.</li>
            <li> It also has a nice minty smell to it.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;d tried DevaCurl and liked it.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo has a nice scent but it does not create suds which I knew ahead of time.  </li>
            <li> I was so impressed by reviews I read about this brand that I ordered the whole line.  </li>
            <li> and yes, it smells nice (just like VO5)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any idea why this line has so many good reviews.  </li>
            <li> It does have a nice smell though that isn&#x27;t too overpowering.</li>
            <li> It cleaned my hair nicely.</li>
            <li> If you can get over using shampoo that is creamy and has no suds, you&#x27;ll end up loving this product.</li>
            <li> To each it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s kind of like if you were to apply moisturizer on your face for days without washing it..</li>
            <li> It does clean and lather well, but I&#x27;m still hunting for the best sulfate free poo for my hair.</li>
            <li> But I love the scent of this shampoo and the squeaky clean feeling of my hair after a good shampoo!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by far the best product I&#x27;ve ever put on my hair, way better than Wen!</li>
            <li> It is a nice shampoo, but I thought it would be especially good for naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and great product.</li>
            <li> The shampoo does good things for my curls, but dang, it&#x27;s just so strong that if I wash my hair at night, the perfume in the shampoo keeps me up.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong, chemical fragrance smell (to my nose, anyway).  </li>
            <li> my hair looks and feels more purely healthy than i ever thought it could!</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s the best shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner are the best I have found for my naturally curl hair.</li>
            <li> You could use a conditioner from the drugstore that is silicone free that would be just as good for the purpose of cleansing.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent, leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> the BEST line of hair products I have ever purchased in my adult life.  </li>
            <li> Makes my curly-haired 3 year old&#x27;s hair smell and look great!</li>
            <li> The texture is perfect and not watered down, the smell is minty and I love it!!</li>
            <li> However I do not like the rose scent and get better detangling and even more moisture from DEVA CARE NO POO.</li>
            <li> Very gentle, and does a great job with my damaged hair--it feels softer, silkier, and looks shinier after a couple weeks of using this product.</li>
            <li> this shampoo has no lather and you wonder if it really works, it does, noy hair feels and looks clean and what it does for my curls they look great!</li>
            <li> you should never put a drop of shampoo on your ends, instead use the Deva conditioner after to hydrate you hair from top to bottom and feel your silky hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair more receptive to conditioning product as well.</li>
            <li> This product, like the conditioner is ok.</li>
            <li> All in all ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really a low maintenance person, and have become more so, the more children I have, so this product is AWESOME for me!  </li>
            <li> My curly hair looks so much better when I use it...</li>
            <li> plus I love the smell.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so glad I splurged on this one.  </li>
            <li> My scalp used to get itchy and oily by the end of day two, but with this my scalp feels a lot better.</li>
            <li> I bought both the shampoo and the conditioner (One Condition) and have been quite pleased with both.</li>
            <li> My hair forever lost the ringlets and most of the curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work the curling magic of my hopes and dreams</li>
            <li> I LOVE DevaCurl.  </li>
            <li> Love Deva Curl products.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.    </li>
            <li> I noticed my hair looked so much better when I used this I started using it more often and</li>
            <li> I bought the travel pack and experimented with all the products, but I ended up just using the shampoo and nothing more.  </li>
            <li> Like many, I was intrigued by the Wenn commercials, and like many, I wasn&#x27;t keen to deal with Guthy Renker to get it.  </li>
            <li> I am absolutely healthy and now I keep wondering if the reason could be those DevaCurl products, or it&#x27;s just  </li>
            <li> any more cuase</li>
            <li> your hair needs a bit more conditioning/moisturizing</li>
            <li> Love DevaCurl products.</li>
            <li> I have been using Alterna for a year and wanted to try a more affordable product.</li>
            <li> I love love love love this product.</li>
            <li> I FINALLY found a product that is wonderful!</li>
            <li> First off, the DevaCurl line smells freaking AMAZING!</li>
            <li> And I love rubbing this stuff all over my hair.</li>
            <li> and I love it,</li>
            <li> I do love the smell and the tingly feeling of the peppermint oils.</li>
            <li> I notice the shampoo has brought about more improvement as the weeks go by.</li>
            <li> Glad I found it in time to help.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the scent and the creamy</li>
            <li> I do think my curly hair is better managed with these products</li>
            <li> For my hair, the No-Poo works much better.  </li>
            <li> I think everyone&#x27;s hair is different and the trick is finding what works best for you!</li>
            <li> and I love this product.  </li>
            <li> and I simply love it.  </li>
            <li> You just have to make sure that once every 2 weeks you use a lathering shampoo to avoid any build up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 2 years and my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> Mostly, I just massage my hair with the shower water most days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shoulder length or more and somewhat</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need to add more, just needed to touch up my hair</li>
            <li> I like biolage better, but can&#x27;t afford it.  </li>
            <li> But this is better than then the Nexxus products.  </li>
            <li> I love using it and just purchased the conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff- shampoo, conditioner, both-</li>
            <li> Love these products.</li>
            <li> You will have to get used to it not lathering in your hair the way regular shampoo does but afterwards, your hair will feel great!</li>
            <li> It does not lather and even without the conditioner my hair feels better.</li>
            <li> - I love these products.</li>
            <li> Everything DevaCurl makes is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair more body.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still a great way to wash your hair and my hair was super clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products to manage my curly hair.</li>
            <li> Next day I woke up and my hair was still looking great!</li>
            <li> Just healthy hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many products, i&#x27;m sure like a lot of us curly haired ladies have.</li>
            <li> and although they are a bit pricey I will by them at different times &amp; when I see good deals &amp; just stock up, but the this shampoo is really great.</li>
            <li> This one smells great &amp; I never have any product build up, it really cleans your hair and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it.  </li>
            <li> and I love how well it works with my curly hair</li>
            <li> Okay, I *</li>
            <li> Love all things devacurl.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s like magic, I can run my fingers through her hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair has never looked or felt better than it does with these products.</li>
            <li> Works well on my wavy, not terribly curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I tried the Lo-Poo but find No-Poo give me more curl.</li>
            <li> but I have to admit that I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair is definitely more moisturized, even without using the conditioner.</li>
            <li> but I need to use way more because it does not lather</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I love that the product tingles a lovely minty or citrus feeling and scent when rubbed into scalp, feels refreshing.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Wish more of them had mentioned the scent.  </li>
            <li> Love Deva curl.</li>
            <li> I can feel perfectly confident with the cleanliness of my har on day two.</li>
            <li> To top it off, I was experiencing acne style bumps in my hairline around my face which have all disappeared.</li>
            <li> love love this stuff.</li>
            <li> The best and only shampoo for curly hair!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li> more than allergic.  </li>
            <li> Satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the vendor didn&#x27;t send it off like that</li>
            <li> I love what the Deva Curl line is doing for my hair.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never been able to control the frizz until I discovered DevaCurl No-Poo and the Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase these hair products and I&#x27;ll update my review after 6 weeks! :)</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find a better No Poo for your hair...</li>
            <li> Love the smell and that it doesn&#x27;t have sulfates.  </li>
            <li> Eh, okay for me.    </li>
            <li> Ok, Update:  </li>
            <li> I am glad i did.</li>
            <li> I like the lo-poo better.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> The more I use this the better</li>
            <li> It does have things in it that is better on curly hair</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this product is that I can detangle my hair while washing it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like magic.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> love the smell of it.</li>
            <li> I like the product, however - the scent is overwhelming.</li>
            <li> It was okay.</li>
            <li> More would come out when I worked the conditioner through my ends.</li>
            <li> I use Redken Curvaceous now and love it so much more.</li>
            <li> LOVE having fewer chemicals in my hair.</li>
            <li> but I still use a stronger more clarifying shampoo a couple of times a month.  </li>
            <li> these products are great for my curly hair (I am 69 years old!!!)  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair clean and healthy!  </li>
            <li> It makes my scalp tingle, makes my hair smell good and smooths my course, dry, frizz-prone hair beautifully.  </li>
            <li> this will be the first thing I pack in my survival kit!!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to use this as soon as it arrived.</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair shiny and nice frizz free condition..love the curls......and even smooth I love it.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much at first.  </li>
            <li> STRONG scent though, which I found surprising as a pervious user of DevaCurl Low-Poo, which has a much more gentle scent!</li>
            <li> The No Poo leaves my scalp and hair clean, even though using a cleanser that doesn&#x27;t lather took some getting used to!</li>
            <li> Love what this does for my fine, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I have used plenty of other cheap conditioners for CO-Washing, many cone-free, and have been way more impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> Great product for naturally curly hair, but don&#x27;t expect a lot of suds.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and happy.  </li>
            <li> great natural product</li>
            <li> A good friend uses the shampoo for straight hair and loves it.</li>
            <li> Great product for curly girls - no lather cleanser is important to not dry out curly hair and this product is highly recommended by my stylist so I was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This line of product definitely makes my curls look gorgeous!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to comb my hair out after using it.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been so clean, bouncy and healthy.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells and it leaves my hair feeling clean without a lather.</li>
            <li> Love the clean feel.</li>
            <li> The scent is fantastic and it leaves my hair feeling so soft and looking great.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does help to keep my curls more intact and bouncy but not as clean as I would like.</li>
            <li> It has a strong perfume-like smell that lingers on your head for hours.  </li>
            <li> The bottom line is that if you use this shampoo you will smell *strongly* like a cough drop.</li>
            <li> I feared that something this good would cost too much, but it fits comfortably within my budget.</li>
            <li> The smell is hideous and strong.  </li>
            <li> hair is baby fine and tangles easily.  </li>
            <li> I saw amazing results after the first time I used this</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think I have the technique down perfect yet.  </li>
            <li> I wanted it to be the last product that touched my hair because of it&#x27;s smell, but was happy that the other DevaCurl products smell equally as great - thank you DevaCurl!</li>
            <li> It leaves my fine shoulder length type 3 curly hair moisturized.</li>
            <li> , this is fine.</li>
            <li> Packaging was fine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s baby fine, wavy and</li>
            <li> (I have 2B/C waves - fine hair, a tendency toward both frizziness and greasiness)</li>
            <li> My fine hair comes out with added body and no frizz.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT I HAVE FOUND A PRODUCT TO CALM MY CURLY HAIR, IT IS ALSO GOOD FOR MY HAIR</li>
            <li> I love the DevaCare which has just a mild minty fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and have been ready to shave my head many times trying to deal with it!</li>
            <li> Maybe the formula has changed since she recommended it because while I&#x27;m sure the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; aspect of it would work out great for my naturally curly hair, the strong rose scent caused an instant headache.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made a huge difference in conjunction with the No-Poo.  </li>
            <li> SLS-free, smells amazing, and cleans better than shampoo; it doesn&#x27;t strip my hair of its natural sheen.  </li>
            <li> Even though Deva is a product which is sulfate and sodium free</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and cleans well.  </li>
            <li> This product worked great for my hair when it was short.</li>
            <li> Shampoo lightly to retain the curl, and the waves droop and look greasy.</li>
            <li> Fabulous book on caring for curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> and my hair looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> After washing my hair, I use the leave-in conditioner and then the light gel.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is absolutely fabulous.</li>
            <li> I used a whole bottle of No-Poo and honestly didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li> It smells like cheap perfume, like roses and it&#x27;s too overpowering.</li>
            <li> One Condition and Frizz free Volumizing mousse because they perform so well.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair silky smooth, helps decrease frizz and helps with styling.</li>
            <li> it makes it feel smooth</li>
            <li> I am allergic to sulfa and Deva products are sulfa free.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m talking $1 conditioners like V05 or Suave, that you can find dirt cheap at K-Mart, Target, Wal-Mart, drug stores, etc</li>
            <li> Overall great product.</li>
            <li> With No Poo, the curls that surface are actually waves I can be happy about.  </li>
            <li> so I could utilize my Prime membership and get free shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to use the products as directed to see the results.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Deva Curl Angel Light</li>
            <li> Well, Set It Free did not control the frizz (Got2be Shine Serum works like a charm) and the Arc Angel gel didn&#x27;t hold my style</li>
            <li> I bought this one and the deva girl set it free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not gluten free and irritated the heck out of my scalp...</li>
            <li> For me, the scent of a product is equally important as whether or not it can get the job done.</li>
            <li> This shampoo fit the bill.</li>
            <li> Love the fresh smell</li>
            <li> Also, although I only apply this to my scalp, I found myself having to use loads of this product on my medium thickness hair which makes this a bit pricey even for the great deal you get on Amazon.</li>
            <li> but I have wavy hair and it works fantastic.</li>
            <li> My three year old daughter has gorgeous ringlet curls.  </li>
            <li> so far so good.  </li>
            <li> Very odd that it doesn&#x27;t lather, but still cleaned my hair fantastically - and smells great!  </li>
            <li> Very fresh &amp; clean.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Since moving to them I have seen my daughter&#x27;s hair look more vibrant and healthy.  </li>
            <li> When I got married I stopped using perms because I could see more damage from the perms chemicals.</li>
            <li> This was the first I&#x27;d tried after WEN, thinking this may do more for my waves.</li>
            <li> so maybe this isn&#x27;t the original formula?</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this.</li>
            <li> The first time I used No-Poo, I had to pick the bottle up again to make sure I hadn&#x27;t grabbed conditioner by mistake.</li>
            <li> She replies that if she could perm like that, she would be a rich woman.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> It is a nice product for once or twice a week, It tended to weigh it down a bit with daily use, but it does feel great and enviromentally kind...</li>
            <li> With this, I never felt clean.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t seem to get my hair really clean.</li>
            <li> When I started working out, I needed something to make my scalp feel clean.    </li>
            <li> It gets my scalp clean, I can feel it.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is not designed to clean the oil from your scalp but it does clean product residue.  </li>
            <li> Gets hair clean and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I use a refresher mist in the mornings to clean up the shape of it and go.  </li>
            <li> Like if you don&#x27;t have lather you might not think your hair is clean, so let&#x27;s dump in some mint to mimic the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I swear I could spend 15 minutes just siting there and smells this amazing stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, as you most likely heard there is no lather in this, but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like you&#x27;re washing your hair with conditioner, but it does leave your hair clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell, but this shampoo does seem to clean my scalp without drying out my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fantastic for someone with much thicker hair, but it just didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li> Great for dry curly hair.</li>
            <li> Great for dry curly swimmers hair.</li>
            <li> It doesnt feel like your hair is getting clean</li>
            <li> This product has been great to help the condition of my dry colored hair.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice minty aroma and it leaves the hair seemingly clean although I don&#x27;t know if it completely cleans the scalp.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed after the first few washes -</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much that I bought 2 - one bottle to keep at home and one for my gym bag.</li>
            <li> so I ordered the full bottle.</li>
            <li> may do more for people with much curlier hair, but if all you have is wave, I&#x27;d try something else.</li>
            <li> It made such a good lotion.  </li>
            <li> Also, make sure you really rinse well.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft after washing it out.</li>
            <li> And I am very hyper-sensitive to many  </li>
            <li> I was doing the no-poo challenge but was having difficulty with my hair being incredibly greasy after just a few hours.</li>
            <li> It smells really good, and my hair actually feels clean/refreshed after I use it.</li>
            <li> With this cleanser, my hair feels clean again and super moisturized.</li>
            <li> Liked the look, soft curls.</li>
            <li> I recently tried this shampoo again and loved it...stapling.</li>
            <li> It really does feel like you&#x27;re just putting more conditioner on your hair every time you wash</li>
            <li> I have used several what I would call luxury products, Curl Junkie, Oyin, Darcy&#x27;s Botanicals, all good.  </li>
            <li> They smell fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> Makes my scalp feel fresh and clean and</li>
            <li> well conditioned, adequately moisturized hair/scalp that is neither goopy, greasy, or crunchy.  </li>
            <li> I have not had great success styling my hair with these products but am not ready to give up yet.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was quick with Prime and on time.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo soothes the scalp, reduces frizz, smells fantastic yet natural and has no nasty parabens or sulfates.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re more defined and my husband constantly tells me it looks sexy</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and packaged well.  </li>
            <li> This is not my favorite shampoo but it ranks better than any drugstore or regular store shampoo!</li>
            <li> I am super frugal by nature</li>
            <li> When I was a little girl I had beautiful curly hair.</li>
            <li> It softens and moisturizes and helps to enhance curl pattern while refreshing the senses with a surprisingly clean smell with the odd rose peppermint fragrance.</li>
            <li> Basically, it smells exactly like some cheap, vile, powdery-floral bathroom spray.</li>
            <li> My normally extremely frizzy hair is now tamed, my fine hair has never been able to hold a curl for more than 12 hours (without a lot of product) and the curls would fall out into waves immediately if touched.  </li>
            <li> Along with the other products, conditioner and light hold, it woks great on my daughters hair, really helps with the frizziness</li>
            <li> The only thing that I am not too thrill about is the smell of the no-poo and conditioner, but the curl gel smells great and kind of mask the smell of the other products.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to the no poo movement, you may have to use more often gradually weaning off every day cleaning.  </li>
            <li> The No Poo is good for dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> The pirce is good and it didn&#x27;t dry out my hair</li>
            <li> It seems to clean very well and leaves my hair feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li> You need to get used to no suds when you first use it, but the feel of your hair will keep you using it!</li>
            <li> I have a perm and it is great, especially when the perm is new.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and scalp and am very glad there&#x27;s a product that I can use to clean the product residue without leaving my hair drier than it already is.</li>
            <li> I have fine, very curly hair that hates me and the rest of the world.  </li>
            <li> Not only is my curl amazing now, I do not have to wash my hair every day like before.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and wanted to try this shampoo because I thought it would help hold my curls and keep them looking better throughout the day.</li>
            <li> But I do find that my hair seems healthy and soft when washed with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair seems to be more moisturized, with soft and improved curls.</li>
            <li> Probably won&#x27;t work for everyone, but definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> For you curly haired people out there, you already know this in itself makes this product worth</li>
            <li> I have not had success using the additional conditioner and gel to style my hair.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Must better than any of my old products.</li>
            <li> and I figured it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I really cannot say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the conditioning cleansers and this one is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through Redken, Mixed Chicks, Miss Jessie&#x27;s, BioSilk, MoroccanOil, Pantene and who knows what else, but I honestly don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever been happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yeah, I look more frizzy, but only marginally, and my hair feels clean.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair and always have difficulty finding good shampoos.</li>
            <li> Does not smell right at all</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t right for my hair.</li>
            <li> when I use it I really feel like my hair is getting really clean.</li>
            <li> on my straight hair days, it didn&#x27;t feel clean.  </li>
            <li> and it makes me wonder if my hair is really getting clean.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product with high hopes, but the smell of this shampoo is so strong, it was really overpowering!  </li>
            <li> I have really curly hair &amp; have always struggled to find good products that don&#x27;t dry out my hair.  </li>
            <li> Like many gals out there, I&#x27;ve pretty much have tried EVERYTHING, even the high price/name brand products and none work as well as curl deva.</li>
            <li> Its turkish rose and peppermint, and it seems to stick in my hair all day long.</li>
            <li> This product is good to have, but it&#x27;s not really worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to read all the reviews about this product and had high hopes.</li>
            <li> I have used Suave Shea Butter Conditioner (less than $2 at Safeway) as a &amp;#34;nonlathering hair cleanser&amp;#34; and my hair is shiny, wavy, and smells really good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing in that your curls really do react differently with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> The formulation really is quite amazing that a shampoo can cause your curls to &#x27;behave&#x27; differently!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really nice product for dry curly hair.</li>
            <li> Once my regimen in the shower is complete, I rinse my hair out, leaving it nice and soft again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to using Jessicurl Hair Cleansing Creme, which smells FABULOUS (to me), but admittedly isn&#x27;t available on Amazon Prime.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> Overall, I would say the product is good so far.  </li>
            <li> It leaves it clean, soft and super curly.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure that this would actually work to get my hair clean and must admit that sometimes I still feel like I need a real shampoo.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product because of the all natural ingredients and lack of harmful chemicals</li>
            <li> It actually reminds me of the smell of perm solution -- it&#x27;s very strong and chemical-like (the conditioner smells only slightly better -- like the soap in the car wash).</li>
            <li> I LOVE this cleanser because it seems to clean AND moisturize without weighing my hair down or making it look super greasy -</li>
            <li> And they have very FAST growing 3b wavy/big ringlets hair type.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle</li>
            <li> It has no lather but leaves your hair clean and feeling extra smooth.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and it leaves my hair feeling soft and clean!</li>
            <li> The water based product is a plus, as well as no sulfites in the \\&quot;no Poo\\&quot;  If you have curly hair, try it, you might love it...and if you don&#x27;t, sell it back to someone who does!</li>
            <li> If you have oil production in your scalp you might like Low Poo shampoo better, by Diva because NO poo doesn&#x27;t lather AT ALL</li>
            <li> I started out with cheap Suave natural conditioner which was ho hum.</li>
            <li> HOT...</li>
            <li> My hair got much healthier when I started using this!</li>
            <li> This is the first product of this type that I have used.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for those with curly or otherwise delicate hair.</li>
            <li> I recently stumbled upon the curly girl method and I love this no poo cleanser.  </li>
            <li> the reason I purchased in the first place.</li>
            <li> After my first use, I realized I probably should  have purchased the conditioner too.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, it works wonders for hair and is the only cleanser that I can use for months</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon and DevaCurl!</li>
            <li> Most regular shampoos blow up my hair shafts (because of coloring/streaking with foils every month?).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Deva Curl products for a year now &amp; it is the first line of products that work &amp; still continue to work.  </li>
            <li> No Poo smells awesome, One Condition to me smells weird.  </li>
            <li> This really seems to do the trick!</li>
            <li> I have grown accustom and love Deva Curls products, only con I have with the No Poo</li>
            <li> The lack of lather was concerning to me first because I&#x27;m so used to it</li>
            <li> first time my daughter&#x27;s hair had shine</li>
            <li> I wholeheartedly recommend this product, but make sure you only use products that are compatible-</li>
            <li> Now, months later, I have stopped using it, and my hair feels better now that I&#x27;ve gotten all the no poo out.  </li>
            <li> I have frizzy hair, a cross between curly and wavy, and got this thinking it would define my curls more.</li>
            <li> Wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much!</li>
            <li> I have very fine, very curly hair and recently jumped on the no-poo train.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so good after using this stuff and it&#x27;s less frizzy too!</li>
            <li> I follow up with Lace Therapy&#x27;s Detangling treatment and a quick spritz of either DevaCurl&#x27;s Set it Free or Global Keratin&#x27;s Hair Taming spray.</li>
            <li> Good for a quick clean, but is not strong enough to remove chorine, hair spray, etc.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel soft but not as clean as with a foaming shampoo.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love it, makes my hair feels real clean, need only small amount, not for people who think they need a lot of lather to get their hair clean</li>
            <li> well, defrizzes a decent amount, smells nice, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp like shampoo.</li>
            <li> If your scalp does not produce much oil, this product could work well for you, since it&#x27;s very gentle on curls.  </li>
            <li> Also have to make sure to hydrate my hair with Rosemary oil more frequently because I noticed that after shampoo-ing it does need a little &amp;#</li>
            <li> This one is a decent price and leaves my hair looking normal and clean.</li>
            <li> after the first wash, my curls have more structure, bounce and vitality, and the ends are no longer brittle and dry.  </li>
            <li> As a curly-haired woman who&#x27;s tried pretty much every product on the market</li>
            <li> On the one hand, it&#x27;s more economical than some other nonlathering shampoos, so you won&#x27;t go broke trying it.</li>
            <li> If you can get past the smell, it is a good product.</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean &amp; hasn&#x27;t shed anywhere near as much as before.</li>
            <li> Leaves a nice smell to your hair but does not weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> (I use it also on my LONG, fine, 4a natural Black hair with great results -- however I use Aussie moist conditioner, followed by sealing my ends with grape seed oil/sweet almond oil and finish up with Oyin Handmade Hair Dew for moisture and defined coilies.  </li>
            <li> very long hair prone to breakage, mostly because she refuses to cut it,</li>
            <li> My scalp tends to be dry, but it is much better with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I believe it&#x27;s mint and rose -- an odd combination.</li>
            <li> My hair is always super soft, shiny and feels silky, just from this-</li>
            <li> I walked into work the next day and people 3 desks away commented on how strong it was.</li>
            <li> Certainly does not strip or damage in any way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll certainly hold on to the bottle to use every now and then, but I&#x27;ll be purchasing a sulfate-free shampoo, as DevaCurl just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Okay, I have never tried a no lather shampoo and to be honest, I was pretty skeptical.</li>
            <li> used Deva Curl for a few weeks now, and after only one week noted that my hair is much shinier, softer, and has beautiful waves.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is so gentle and moisturizing that I can use a regular conditioner and be absolutely fine.</li>
            <li> So I am a Caucasian female with fine sometimes-wavy/mostly straight hair but was looking for a &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Coconut Co-Wash is great, too, but it left my hair feeling a little too greasy.  </li>
            <li> This cleanser works very well on my 2b/c hair.  </li>
            <li> Shampoo too much to get it cleaner</li>
            <li> What I wash with doesn&#x27;t make too much difference because it will be frizzy if I don&#x27;t set it somehow</li>
            <li> He really likes these products and has switched over to this brand.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical about this whole &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; business, but my curls were getting drier and frizzier as my hair got grayer.</li>
            <li> (even tho my hair is straight &amp; no curls), so I bought a travel size just to try it.</li>
            <li> I rub it in well and let it set a minute, then rinse it really really well.</li>
            <li> My hair was damaged from meds for my breast cancer and this shampoo really helped it.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how someone with really curly hair could use this and not wash for a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> This product might appear cheaper by the ounce but the amount you have to use is almost three times as much product.</li>
            <li> I really like loo poo,&lt;br /&gt;however and deva curl conditioner.</li>
            <li> However, the smell is just too much.</li>
            <li> and if you have curly hair you really should try it.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to have to spend that much on it</li>
            <li> I have very curly, kinky, frizzy hair</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t notice a difference in my hair being &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; or not.</li>
            <li> I guess I really will have to see if there is a difference with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Shampoo bottle packed in an envelope and much of the contents of the bottle leaked out.</li>
            <li> ONE CONDITION with the DEVA Care and go straight to styling if I choose.</li>
            <li> I have VERY curly hair.</li>
            <li> have very processed hair.  </li>
            <li> The trick is to really use your fingers and massage the scalp as you wash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very conditioning which is what curls need.</li>
            <li> ;  Another thing that REALLY helps is my Aquasana Water Purifier for my shower.  </li>
            <li> I really was convinced I had straight hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s overpoweringly intense - like nausea/migraine inducing.</li>
            <li> This is an absolute product for anyone who has curly hair.  </li>
            <li> That scared me off the whole</li>
            <li> I take the &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; and really work it into her hair and scalp</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair and</li>
            <li> In short, this product makes my hair look absolutely fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a project that creates this much build-up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks softer and very shiny.</li>
            <li> Gentle on my hair</li>
            <li> I really recommend this</li>
            <li> course, scent is a very subjective experience, and your mileage may vary.  </li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing</li>
            <li> it keeps my hair clean and not dry.</li>
            <li> Gentle on my hair.  </li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> hair looks and feels much too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
            <li> I found that this made my hair feel very greasy.</li>
            <li> no frizz that I get from &#x27;real&#x27; shampoo lather.</li>
            <li> Really cleansed my hair and conditioned it as well.  </li>
            <li> do like the smell of it, however, and have mixed it with my regular shampoo on occasion for that nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But on the whole this has been great for my curly, thin, and dyed hair.  </li>
            <li> So if you have really fine curly hair that normally ends up as wavy a couple of hours after it dries, this product may improve the health of your hair enough to allow it curl and hold shape like it did mine.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life I finally have silky shiny hair while using this product,, definitely recommend. :)</li>
            <li> There was several complaints to the smell, but to be honest it&#x27;s not bad, just a heavy \\&quot;natural\\&quot; smell to it</li>
            <li> There are plenty of non-natural ingredients on the label, including the extremely offensive \\&quot;Parfum (Perfume)\\&quot; - so I should have known better.</li>
            <li> I would buy more, try some other of their products, and recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would be possible for a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t lather to properly clean your hair.</li>
            <li> but sometimes I just use a regular shampoo to feel totally clean.  </li>
            <li> The scent is a little strong, and I am still not used to it!  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s best to avoid sulfates, but because they&#x27;re missing, this doesn&#x27;t lather, and I feel like it&#x27;s hard to tell when I&#x27;ve gotten it thoroughly disbursed through my very curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t experience any scalp issues, so I would really caution against using this if you already have problems with your scalp.</li>
            <li> The price I got on Amazon beats anything local (I can&#x27;t afford shopping local principles right now) and even in Alaska I received it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> This product smells good and leaves my hair clean without turning it into a dried frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo, my hair does not get weighed down, and boy does it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit odd at first to wash without seeing a lather and your brain wants to say \\&quot;no lather/foam &#x3D; not clean\\&quot; but it really does get your hair clean without the lather.  </li>
            <li> I had a gift certificate from Christmas and really needed some new hair products.  </li>
            <li> With this product less is always more</li>
            <li> My hair is much less frizzy, and the curls are much better defined.</li>
            <li> It left my hair smelling fresh and clean and left my hair managable for it being so curly</li>
            <li> My hair is curly in back and the middle, and wavy in front top and sides.  </li>
            <li> I used to shampoo once daily (sometimes more) with a daily clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is decent but I wouldn&#x27;t staple it just yet.</li>
            <li> I switched back to Alterna and after a few days I&#x27;m back to beautiful shiny hair</li>
            <li> It is so gentle to my uber sensitive skin and has a very delicate, botanical fragrance that is so pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anyone struggling with the no-poo thing.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone curly hair or not.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to all curly hair types.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for anyone with curly hair.</li>
            <li> properly care for my daughter&#x27;s hair I first ordered the book Curly Girl!  </li>
            <li> fresh and No-Poo helps my color stay so vibrant that when I went to get my hair done last week</li>
            <li> I have really fine curly/wavy hair and the shampoo just weighed it down so much</li>
            <li> non-foaming shampoo cleans the hair gently but completely, and leaves it silky-soft.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair and it keeps my scalp clean and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Few more weeks and this continued, so I threw the rest away.</li>
            <li> For the first couple of weeks of use, this product seemed like a miracle worker on my extremely dry, chemically damaged hair because it is intensely moisturizing and gentle.</li>
            <li> This is the only product so far that has kept my curls looking natural and full of life - as they should.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like putting on a new wig every time I wash it.</li>
            <li> I live at the shore</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t buy them where I live</li>
            <li> It makes your hair soft and gives more hold, but I thought doing that made my hair feel heavy, but I did try it.  </li>
            <li> Organics Lemongrass + Argan Stem Cell Shampoo - moisturizing AND clarifying, smells divine and is a high quality natural product</li>
            <li> It was very soft.</li>
            <li> The No-Poo was a little strange the first couple of times since it doesn&#x27;t produce suds, but I adjusted quickly, and my hair is definitely not dirty.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft, moisturized, and I dont have frizz or tangles anymore!  </li>
            <li> I am in love with the smell, every product has a different type of smell, but along the same lines a similar smell.</li>
            <li> Not sure, but I am sure my daughter hates it.  </li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s so fine, I typically have to wash every day, which is wreaking havoc on the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li> and my hair is exposed to all sorts of weather every day and yet my hair is soft and untangled!</li>
            <li> Regardless, the No-Poo didn&#x27;t help my dandruff at all, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s made much of a difference in my hair in general.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that gets dry quick so after hearing about this product, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Next was having the proper products to keep the hair clean and detangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you realize that it won&#x27;t &amp;#34;suds&amp;#34; up like other shampoos do but still leaves your hair and scalp clean</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not sure if I was shipped the same product as all the higher star reviewers or those reviews were posted prior to long term regular use</li>
            <li> difference may be the absence of silicone - it seems like a lot of the other cleansing cremes are full of chems including silicone, and silicone is a pretty greasy substance, something I would think would create buildup instead of remove</li>
            <li> My hair did get a little greasy at first because I was used to using the typical large glob of other brand shampoo to get a good wash.</li>
            <li> I use the right type of dryer too (which I don&#x27;t use every single time).</li>
            <li> For a curly girl it would be hard to find a better product.</li>
            <li> At $18/12 oz bottle, it&#x27;s a little pricey, but very worth it to me.</li>
            <li> It works great keeping my hair from frizzing, however, my hair feels so greasy and dirty and has been falling out.</li>
            <li> Leave-in - it&#x27;s natural and smells like an absolute dream but requires a daily wash.</li>
            <li> The waves perk up, the hair shines, and everything swings naturally.</li>
            <li> For those that have curly hair (mine&#x27;s natural)</li>
            <li> The book also gave suggestions on how to cut the hair to maintain the curl&#x27;s natural shape.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy (no suds) and rinses out complete.  </li>
            <li> My hair is finally soft, shiny and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft.  </li>
            <li> and wow what a difference.</li>
            <li> After using DevaCurl cleanser and conditioner for almost 3 years, I of corse have an addiction because those make my hair really really soft, but my hair start falling a lot, of course everyone complains about this problem</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to perfumes, dyes etc.</li>
            <li> and this tames my hair and it leaves it really soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It keeps hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I have a natural wave to my hair</li>
            <li> This product has really helped get a lot of shine and health back to my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reviewing the 3 products as a whole system overall.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo allows my hairs natural wave and curl to come to life.  </li>
            <li> and oh so soft.</li>
            <li> I do still use the conditioner on occasion, but using both in one wash left my curly hair looking very greasy.</li>
            <li> I have blonde straight medium length hair.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and this shampoo works wonders.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair frizz-free, and enhances the natural wave that I have.</li>
            <li> This no-poo cleanser makes my curls so soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair shiny and soft and it is helping prolong the life of the Brazilian blowout..</li>
            <li> and it takes much longer to wash the product than regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> it did make my hair feel really soft.</li>
            <li> Being sulfate-free, this product produces zero lather, which feels really strange at first.  </li>
            <li> However, this is BY FAR</li>
            <li> The change away from harsh detergents can cause your scalp to seem extra oily - it&#x27;s used to being stripped of all oils and needing to overproduce more oil out of desperation to protect itself.  </li>
            <li> My hair never looks or feels dried out (and I swim daily in a lake over the summer), and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I do not use any styling products at all and only rarely use the One Condition (the No-Poo conditions enough for my hair)</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m forced to use a more clarifying shampoo soon after using this to avoid furiously scratching at my head all day.</li>
            <li> I have superfine, loosely curled, over shoulder length hair that can get really dry and frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> I have very fine and very dry curly hair, and shampoo is too harsh for me</li>
            <li> I did decent research into the product and received mixed reviews.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem particularly moisturizing, but it is definitely non-stripping.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it, but once a week I use the Low Poo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently switched back from synthetic to human hair wigs, and I&#x27;ve found the thick, wavy texture challenging to keep in the right condition.</li>
            <li> No more dandruff and my scalp and hair feel so clean and soft!</li>
            <li> I dye it regularly and high heat wave, curl, or straighten depending on my mood.  </li>
            <li> I also chose to use the DevaCare Arc AnGell Extra Hold Conditioning Gel as it seemed my hair needed a little more hold than the regular gel provided.  </li>
            <li> Make sure hair is evenly  wet before distributing No-Poo since it does not create foam as with typical shampoo product.</li>
            <li> In the past, when I have tried to go without shampooing for a day, my hair became greasy and flat on top.  </li>
            <li> , this is the first time EVER in my 45 years that I haven&#x27;t had to use a conditioner in order to brush my wet hair without tears.  </li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that makes me look like a normal person.  </li>
            <li> , I have very fine, thin, wavy hair.    </li>
            <li> I have colored, blond, wavy hair and live in Southern California.</li>
            <li> Wen was okay, but too expensive, and it made my hair fall out after using it too much.  </li>
            <li> The fact that it does not lather is hard to get used to, but the hair washes nicely and does not over dry like regular shampoos.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my hair feel strange.. dry right from rinsing  </li>
            <li> If it needs to be freshened up (after fun in the sandbox) I use a little bit of the conditioner when she is in the tub.  </li>
            <li> After about 2 weeks of use, I went back to my old sulfate shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I never really spent lots of money on hair products</li>
            <li> Not rough the way some shampoos leave your hair feeling.</li>
            <li> The only thing that would have made me happier would be to find Amazon selling it directly</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might go back to my old routine.&lt;br /&gt;Acure</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy/curly hair but never before could I make a daily style work</li>
            <li> Only used it once so far, but my curls are bouncy and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been curious about Wen ever since I saw my first infomercial, but I did my research and found a lot of mixed reviews which scared me off.  </li>
            <li> Some have worked OK, but not great.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair and this shampoo actually made it look straight, frizzy, and dry.  </li>
            <li> I even let my hair dry naturally and the ensuing curls were soft and looked</li>
            <li> I have wavy, corse frizzy hair and this makes it very soft especially the second day.</li>
            <li> on the other side -- and can&#x27;t really see any difference.</li>
            <li> It just proves to me how much other shampoos dry out my hair and the ones I use</li>
            <li> Otherwise, sometimes I simply spritz her hair with a water bottle filled with a few drops of essential oil such as lavendar or orange mixed with water.  </li>
            <li> for curls - I have half very wavy &amp; half very straight hair.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, all the hype DevaCurl spends on making their product sound like it&#x27;s better for you than a sudsing shampoo seems sort of misplaced if they can&#x27;t even take out the artificial scents.   </li>
            <li> The girls at my salon told me to stick it out for a few weeks because I might not like it at first.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it-I hated it because my hair just felt greasy-but after a few more times and finally getting rid of the buildup that I had in my hair-I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> wish it was still made with the older recipe because it is a much more artificial product</li>
            <li> I get lots of compliments on my hair, mainly from other curly-haired women.</li>
            <li> you want clean, fluffy hair with NO tangles, use just this product without the other products.  </li>
            <li> my hair is soft and shiny and my bouncy curls look like I just stepped out of the salon, even after letting them air dry!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product but love many others in the DevaCurl line.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Deva for a little over a year and highly recommend ALL curly girls to make the change to DEVA!  </li>
            <li> I rinsed the conditioner very well and then, still in the shower, I squeezed the excess water and applied a little of the Curl Angel Gel.</li>
            <li> I had been using typical drug store brands to where my curly hair was becoming a frizzy mess and not really curly anymore.</li>
            <li> But the bad out weighed the good here for me.</li>
            <li> Hate the smell but it does seem to be both effective and gentle.</li>
            <li> Normally when I wake up in the mornings my hair is a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using harsh shampoos on your hair right now, maybe go to a sulfate-free shampoo every other day before diving into this.</li>
            <li> Hard to say definitely that it&#x27;s the products in this hot, humid summer when our HVAC and swimming pool and indoor allergens could be causing it.</li>
            <li> I talked to an estetician and her explanation was that since my scalp and skin around the hairline were not being stripped of natural oils, they were not working overtime to replace the necessary oils which in turn let my skin settle down.</li>
            <li> I started doing this out of desperation, regular shampoo would dry my scalp and hair out, then turn my scalp greasy hours later.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry my hair out like regular shampoos and my hair starting to curl as soon as I washed it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it leaves behind a very STRONG perfume smell that, for me, lasted the whole day and would have gone on lasting if I hadn&#x27;t given up and washed my hair with a different product.</li>
            <li> (but curly, flat curls).</li>
            <li> Hair felt dry and it actually seemed to make my hair straighter rather than curlier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can rinse it and then towel dry your hair and put a bit back in to stay.  </li>
            <li> If anyone I knew had dry hair, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> everything else left my hair frizzy and dry looking.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo did wonders for my naturally dry, coarse, curly/wavy hair!</li>
            <li> I was very surprised how quickly the product came, but was disappointed to see the top broken in off of the Deva Curl</li>
            <li> so why spend the money when something that&#x27;s ten times less expensive works just as well or better.  </li>
            <li> As there is no lather, this shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip the natural oils out of your hair (which curly hair has little of to start with).  </li>
            <li> I see how some people would like this product, and while it did seem to make my curls more manageable, I just could not stand my hair always looking greasy and dirty.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t keep my hair long because of the frizz, so I would perm it.</li>
            <li> Strange smell does not work well</li>
            <li> You work the conditioner through and leave it on as long as you need it.  </li>
            <li> But throughout that time I developed a low-grade cough/chest congestion that the doc said was an allergy and have been sensing the smell of dried smoke or firewood that seems to be around my hair (scent and smoke-free home).</li>
            <li> &amp; I have really long hair.</li>
            <li> Curly, tame, and not heavy or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my other shampoo occasionally.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, the other DevaCurl products are not needed and only add weight to your hair and make it feel heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it regularly with other Devalporudct.</li>
            <li> The other issue I have with this stuff is that it actually doesn&#x27;t make my hair curl at all.</li>
            <li> Other ingredients listed on thus label are different as well.  </li>
            <li> but it left my hair cleaner than any other shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It might work for other people, but this left my hair unclean and greasy.</li>
            <li> I have very long curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have herd about the Deva salon for over a year and have always straightened my hair because of the frizzy dry curls I was having.</li>
            <li> I have dry, wavy hair with a lot of frizz in the summer months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had dry frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> My curly hair tends to be oily at the roots and dry at the ends.  </li>
            <li> No lather, just creamy cleansing that doesn&#x27;t dry out your curls.</li>
            <li> Keeps my dry curly hair in check</li>
            <li> and I just scrunch it and let it air dry</li>
            <li> My hair was so dry and bleh.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s tons of it), slightly dry, red-dyed hair.  </li>
            <li> Then I just let the hair air dry</li>
            <li> I hair no longer feels dry.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my hair feel dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, but it still cleans it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I wrote the above after I had only used this a few times.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> After only two days of washing my hair with Low-Poo, it had become weighed down and sticky.  </li>
            <li> Easy on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Living in Chicago where winter is COLD and heat in homes/offices</li>
            <li> I went back to my previous product and after a couple of days the clumping stopped.</li>
            <li> My color is Demi and Red and this product does not fade it out, it also keeps my hair cleaner longer because I need less products.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair that is colored.</li>
            <li> I think next time I may try the one called \\&quot;Some Poo\\&quot; that has a little lather to it.</li>
            <li> Every day I will wake up and use a little bit of this No-Poo product and message it only in the scalp of my hair to not make the ends dryed.</li>
            <li> After years of battling my frizzy, dry curls, I had all but given up wearing my hair in anything other than a ponytail on a day-to-day basis.</li>
            <li> Give it a try if you have curls or bad frizz &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount, so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I learned I was washing my daughter&#x27;s hair too often and brushing it when wet.  </li>
            <li> I can COMB my wet hair and I have zero tangles.  </li>
            <li> the worse, really, is the smell.</li>
            <li> I also now only have to wash my hair every few days</li>
            <li> It’s a bit expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> In fact my hair feels sort of rough &amp; tangly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for a few weeks, but can already feel a bit of a difference.</li>
            <li> is one of the few I have yet to change out of my rotation of different products.</li>
            <li> I only used it a few times, then stopped.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, this product doesn&#x27;t clean my scalp properly, causing a buildup that leads to irritating bumps, mild dandruff, and annoying itchiness.</li>
            <li> I have mid-back length blonde, wavy, coarse, thick hair.</li>
            <li> Why would I waste my time to send back a partial bottle of shampoo.</li>
            <li> I had been using Wen and wanted to try a few other condition only washes and/or no-poos.  </li>
            <li> Ive only tried DEVA CARE NO POO in the past and thought I would try something a little different.</li>
            <li> strongly suggest giving this a try if lather shampoos and other non-lathering conditioning cleansers have left you disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hair before bed, it feels clean when I fall asleep but wake up with it feeling dirty.</li>
            <li> I have thick, grey hair that is very coarse.</li>
            <li> and I find a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> They use this in conjunction with other items in this product line for</li>
            <li> Use with other Deva products.</li>
            <li> I got my hair analyzed and was told that this shampoo would work for my extremely course hair.  </li>
            <li> I use this once a week during the winter and every other day during the summer.  </li>
            <li> First thing I thought, \\&quot;Please don&#x27;t let me like this stuff, please!!\\&quot; For one, is because it is so expensive for shampoo</li>
            <li> A girl who I work with had also tried this product in the past and told me that she had the same issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I went from one extreme to the other, which is why I think this didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> So I gave DevaCurl a try and started shampooing every other day.</li>
            <li> Due to this, I have a tendency to overuse the Deva Curl.</li>
            <li> Small price to pay for my hair being in vastly improved condition!</li>
            <li> A small trial size is enough to find out if it will work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes curls behave when used with other products in this line.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend using one or the other.</li>
            <li> Was just what I expected!</li>
            <li> Having extremely curly hair, I&#x27;ve been advised not to wash and use conditioner like non-curly-haired people.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to mix it with other shampoo just to get through the bottle.</li>
            <li> My hair can get a little dry sometimes from blowing drying and color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> products seem to be a little too heavy for my hair though I do use them about once a week for a deep conditioning.  </li>
            <li> I was really worried with all the other comments about this product being fake</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry it out and helps tame frizz as a result.</li>
            <li> Eventually after being convinced by my mother to go to the Deva salon in White Planes and seeing what a difference it makes in your hair, it was hard not to buy the product.</li>
            <li> I think this nonlathering shampoo craze is just the latest marketing ploy by manufacturers who think women are stupid.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff, but it&#x27;s so expensive.</li>
            <li> stuff blows your average department store products away.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m a customer for life...and honestly I&#x27;m not going back.</li>
            <li> Once I got over the awful eucalyptus smell I loved how the product controlled my frizz.</li>
            <li> Now to find it in a bigger bottle since my hair is so thick</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair that has a lot of curl in the back</li>
            <li> I used as directed and my hair was weighed down and too oily to skip a shampoo for a day.</li>
            <li> When I let my hair grow shoulder length I would wet my hair and use stiff paste to keep it from frizzing.</li>
            <li> between washings I run my wet fingers through my hair, then run a dab of conditioner through the curls to tame any outliers.</li>
            <li> I also wanted a product that allowed me to go a couple days without washing my hair, I usually have to wash my hair everyday to activate the curls, but I have very long, thick hair that I air dry, so it takes half day for it to be completely dry, washing my hair</li>
            <li> My daughter is biracial and has very tight curls, her hair doubles in length when its wet.  </li>
            <li> I have reactive scalp to all shampoos I&#x27;ve previously used.</li>
            <li> Now my hair remains curled for a day and a half (even after sleeping on it), and I can put a shirt on or run my hands through my hair and still have curls afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Now after using this product for almost 3 years I noticed that half of my hair are gone</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost twice as less as it used to be, even people around me will notice.</li>
            <li> I can go three or four days between washes (now...after the transition period while my scalp adjusted to less cleansing).  </li>
            <li> I follow it up with the conditioner and the gel and her hair has less frizz and the curls are defined.  </li>
            <li> A friend of mine with curly hair also uses it and we&#x27;ve both noticed less frizz.</li>
            <li> Has an odd feel to it when shampooing the hair, since there are no suds</li>
            <li> and I find myself having to use less product after showering to revive my curls.</li>
            <li> It was sort of odd washing my hair with shampoo that doesnt lather.</li>
            <li> I have less frizz and</li>
            <li> My hair is less frizzy with this shampoo</li>
            <li> I was determined to hate the stuff - I thought I needed suds - and had to eat crow when I determined that I LOVE this stiff.</li>
            <li> They are teenagers and very active</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going home after work and wash this mess out and use my No-poo.  </li>
            <li> Her hair is thick and getting long.  </li>
            <li> I tried to use without the conditioner and it still left me with flat wavy weird hair.  </li>
            <li> Bottle is simple, plain, not gimicky, if you know what I mean.  </li>
            <li> After about a month my hair was still looking dirty on the second day when I normally only wash my hair every other day, which I continued to do anyway.</li>
            <li> Because after a few weeks of using just the no poo, my hair would start to feel a little heavy and weighed down.      </li>
            <li> Just like when I was a little girl.</li>
            <li> It takes a little while to get used to not having lather</li>
            <li> Wish it was a little cheaper</li>
            <li> My hair is very, very thick though, and though this product did eliminate frizzies, it also weighed my hair down, making it almost flat</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I was having to wash my hair everyday after exercising</li>
            <li> knowing I&#x27;m using a product without harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Shampoo is a sham.  </li>
            <li> My hair is medium oily and wavy this was not a fit for my hair.</li>
            <li> I am not planning on using it everyday because I&#x27;m  going  curly  girl method and</li>
            <li> Waste of $30.00  Should&#x27;ve bought her the WEN, atleast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll repeat the test a few times.</li>
            <li> I use this a few times a week and also use one condition and deva&#x27;s gel.  </li>
            <li> It was too heavy for my hair</li>
            <li> always* needed heavy conditioners for my colored, Botticelli-type curls.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to go to the trouble of ordering and be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can use this everyday and it doesn&#x27;t strip my hair.</li>
            <li> Not to heavy; keep your curl and body</li>
            <li> But for everyday cleansing and moisture I will use Deva Curl.  </li>
            <li> I was wanting something that would have my hair hold out for a few days before washing it - but continued to use it anyway.</li>
            <li> No more hard, crunchy, dry, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It just takes some time to get used to the no suds feel, and I mean it&#x27;s absolutely no suds.</li>
            <li> Usually it is just a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> The gel holds my curl without getting stiff and crunchy.  </li>
            <li> It relaxes some of my curls, but still can&#x27;t tame the frizz.</li>
            <li> As a no-pooer, I cringe at having to strip my hair with sulfates found in ordinary shampoos, but this sulfate-free product just does not clean your hair whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Keeps her curls bouncy and tame.</li>
            <li> and my hair was getting really dry and looked unhealthy.</li>
            <li> This week I had a sample of a lathering shampoo that I tried and my poor hair was so tangled and rough feeling.  </li>
            <li> I usually do this twice.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve using some &amp;#34;non sulfate&amp;#34; shampoos and either they stink or they make your hair feel weird, or they actually do suds up.</li>
            <li> This is no better than VO5 Kiwi Lime Conditioner (a product I found out about from a beauty review website).  </li>
            <li> No more frizzies.</li>
            <li> Not Deva, not sure what this is.</li>
            <li> I like how it makes my hair feel, but I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell!</li>
            <li> It takes out all of the chlorine and other chemicals that are tough on one&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> so I stopped using them and tried other stuff, not a good thing!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Beware if you have heavy, thick hair!</li>
            <li> It builds up in my fine curly hair, and makes it feel awful.  </li>
            <li> Not too crazy about my head smelling like a public</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s hair is wavy and thick.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t hate the scent, but it was just much stronger than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of thick, &amp;#34;botticelli&amp;#34; curls.</li>
            <li> Expensive product that it largely not useable.</li>
            <li> No more frizz!</li>
            <li> No more!</li>
            <li> (i mean, no-poo).</li>
            <li> on my curly days, my hair looked and felt weird and weighed down.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for months &amp; seriously dislike it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried the baking soda method, but I gave up on it because my hair always felt weird and never clean.</li>
            <li> I was sad because I wanted the curly hair I had when I was a little girl.</li>
            <li> it is a little weird washing my girls hair and not seeing any foam.</li>
            <li> Too bad I can&#x27;t get my money back because if I could I would.</li>
            <li> All in all, I&#x27;m sorry I wasted the money and all three bottles are gathering dust in my hall closet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit it--I am very hard on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, frizzy, curly hair that I now get straightened.</li>
            <li> poor scalp and hair takes a beating.</li>
            <li> Not great, I have thin blond curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> and my hair not grow tired of it.</li>
            <li> and it became broken in the process of delivery.  </li>
            <li> Some other reviewers said it smelled bad</li>
            <li> but this makes it much, much less painful.  </li>
            <li> I recently skipped the Deva regimen for a couple of days (those were bad hair days!)</li>
            <li> After a few days the smell is making me sick though...</li>
            <li> and that is weird to get used to.</li>
            <li> and it tangles something fierce, which leads to hair loss in an expensive wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Me and my hair are addicted to the products!  </li>
            <li> I am sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> It feels weird not to lather my shampoo.</li>
            <li> Just be thorough rinsing it out from you hair, since without suds it&#x27;s difficult to tell when it&#x27;s fully rinsed out.</li>
            <li> I would be skeptical about this curly ladies and gents.</li>
            <li> it looked greasy and weird.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> sadly it has wheat amino acids</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too expensive..</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> expensive</li>
            <li> Disappointing for how expensive it is.</li>
            <li> The other thing is that the shampoo smells horrible.</li>
            <li> shampoo to avoid sulfates and other nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li> My hair was a nasty, greasy, tangly mess.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t  feel like my hair was dirty like another review mentioned.</li>
            <li> made my head itch like crazy.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell</li>
            <li> like I&#x27;m washing my hair with cold cream.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of cold cream.</li>
            <li> Well, this has proven me wrong!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and was very disappointed with it.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t have the nasty detergents that strip your hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For one, it smells disgusting.</li>
            <li> Horrible.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible.  </li>
            <li> However, the smell is AWFUL!</li>

            <li> Nice cleanser. I had to get pass the fact that there is no lather, but overall I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> As a curly-haired woman who&#x27;s tried pretty much every product on the market (well, not quite) I can say this &amp; DevaCurl Ultra Defining Gel are my favorites.  I get lots of compliments on my hair, mainly from other curly-haired women.</li>
            <li> For a curly girl it would be hard to find a better product. Because of my curl type I cleanse my hair twice a week with this product and then follow up with the OneCondition. With this product less is always more and I find a little goes a long way.  Check out the 3-step cleansing routine at devachansalon.com.</li>
            <li> Just to start off, I gave this 4 stars because I don&#x27;t know how to judge the product since I&#x27;ve never used anything that has no lather to it. I have naturally curly hair that gets dry quick so after hearing about this product, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It definitely doesn&#x27;t lather so in the back of my mind, I&#x27;m wondering if it even works.  It has a nice minty aroma and it leaves the hair seemingly clean although I don&#x27;t know if it completely cleans the scalp.  I think next time I may try the one called \\&quot;Some Poo\\&quot; that has a little lather to it.</li>
            <li> I have herd about the Deva salon for over a year and have always straightened my hair because of the frizzy dry curls I was having. Eventually after being convinced by my mother to go to the Deva salon in White Planes and seeing what a difference it makes in your hair, it was hard not to buy the product. Every day I will wake up and use a little bit of this No-Poo product and message it only in the scalp of my hair to not make the ends dryed. Even though Deva is a product which is sulfate and sodium free you should never put a drop of shampoo on your ends, instead use the Deva conditioner after to hydrate you hair from top to bottom and feel your silky hair. I don&#x27;t know what this brand puts in there products but what ever it is seems to be working amazing! For the first time in my life I finally have silky shiny hair while using this product,, definitely recommend. :)</li>
            <li> Best product ever for my multi-racial children/boys.  It&#x27;s light and cleans well.  They are teenagers and very active so they cleanse 3 times per week.  And they have very FAST growing 3b wavy/big ringlets hair type.  They use this in conjunction with other items in this product line for well conditioned, adequately moisturized hair/scalp that is neither goopy, greasy, or crunchy.  Their hair is shiny and their curls are well defined.  (I use it also on my LONG, fine, 4a natural Black hair with great results -- however I use Aussie moist conditioner, followed by sealing my ends with grape seed oil/sweet almond oil and finish up with Oyin Handmade Hair Dew for moisture and defined coilies.  The Hair Dew I use each morning!).</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. When I was a little girl I had beautiful curly hair. When I was in my 20&#x27;s I couldn&#x27;t keep my hair long because of the frizz, so I would perm it. When I got married I stopped using perms because I could see more damage from the perms chemicals.I was sad because I wanted the curly hair I had when I was a little girl. I thought I would never have it again because of the damage and the frizz. What I didn&#x27;t know was the shampoo I was using had detergent in it that damaged my hair too. When I let my hair grow shoulder length I would wet my hair and use stiff paste to keep it from frizzing. Then my hairdresser introduced me to DevaCurl. No more hard, crunchy, dry, frizzy hair. I was so happy. I use all the DevaCurl products. My hair is so soft and shiny and healthy. The curl is beautiful. Just like when I was a little girl. Thank you DevaCurl.</li>
            <li> I have dry, wavy hair with a lot of frizz in the summer months.  This product has worked wonders on my hair on all fronts.  My hair is soft, moisturized, and I dont have frizz or tangles anymore!  Its always good to buy one of devacurl&#x27;s low-poo hair cleansers with the no-poo in my opinion.  Why?  Because after a few weeks of using just the no poo, my hair would start to feel a little heavy and weighed down.      Why the 4 stars then you ask? The scent is a little strong, and I am still not used to it!  Its turkish rose and peppermint, and it seems to stick in my hair all day long. (low-poo has a lighter more fruity scent!)</li>
            <li> I see how some people would like this product, and while it did seem to make my curls more manageable, I just could not stand my hair always looking greasy and dirty.  After about 2 weeks of use, I went back to my old sulfate shampoo.  Yeah, I look more frizzy, but only marginally, and my hair feels clean.  With this, I never felt clean.  Maybe I&#x27;ll give this another go sometime in the future, but for now I can&#x27;t do it.  I did not look &amp;#34;professional.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the smell of it, however, and have mixed it with my regular shampoo on occasion for that nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do still use the conditioner, and that works well for me, and fights off a bit of the frizz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had dry frizzy hair. With this product my curls have form and movement. I don&#x27;t even travel without it anymore!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and wanted to try this shampoo because I thought it would help hold my curls and keep them looking better throughout the day. After using this shampoo for about a month I have found my hair always feels like there is a film on it. This shampoo doesn&#x27;t seem to get my hair really clean. The other thing is that the shampoo smells horrible. Some people might like the smell, but not me!</li>
            <li> This product worked great for my hair when it was short.</li>
            <li> Great product for naturally curly hair, but don&#x27;t expect a lot of suds. Wonderful scent. Use with other Deva products.</li>
            <li> shampoo without the lather takes some getting used too. But I love the scent of this shampoo and the squeaky clean feeling of my hair after a good shampoo!  Makes my hair more receptive to conditioning product as well.</li>
            <li> This product, like the conditioner is ok. Has a tingling sensation from the menthe which is nice. It doesn&#x27;t lather and its not supposed to and that is weird to get used to. All in all ok.</li>
            <li> This cleanser works very well on my 2b/c hair.  In the past, when I have tried to go without shampooing for a day, my hair became greasy and flat on top.  This cleans my hair &amp; scalp very well, without harsh detergents.  I can skip conditioner after using this, because it is practically a conditioner itself.  My only quibble is with the fragrance.  It smells like roses - an old-fashioned scent I associate with my grandmother.  If the scent was nicer, or it maybe came with different fragrance options, I&#x27;d give it five stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really a low maintenance person, and have become more so, the more children I have, so this product is AWESOME for me!  My hair is curly in back and the middle, and wavy in front top and sides.  I got a great \\&quot;curly girl\\&quot; haircut to flatter my curls, and using the Deva Curl products feels like a must.  My curly hair looks so much better when I use it...plus I love the smell.  The water based product is a plus, as well as no sulfites in the \\&quot;no Poo\\&quot;  If you have curly hair, try it, you might love it...and if you don&#x27;t, sell it back to someone who does!</li>
            <li> I got my hair analyzed and was told that this shampoo would work for my extremely course hair.  I never really spent lots of money on hair products but I&#x27;m so glad I splurged on this one.  It works great!  I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to comb my hair out after using it. So far it&#x27;s the best shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.  I would recommend this product to anyone with course hair for its conditioning properties.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently switched back from synthetic to human hair wigs, and I&#x27;ve found the thick, wavy texture challenging to keep in the right condition. Shampoo lightly to retain the curl, and the waves droop and look greasy. Shampoo too much to get it cleaner and it tangles something fierce, which leads to hair loss in an expensive wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This non-foaming shampoo cleans the hair gently but completely, and leaves it silky-soft. The waves perk up, the hair shines, and everything swings naturally. I follow up with Lace Therapy&#x27;s Detangling treatment and a quick spritz of either DevaCurl&#x27;s Set it Free or Global Keratin&#x27;s Hair Taming spray. It&#x27;s like putting on a new wig every time I wash it.</li>
            <li> My scalp used to get itchy and oily by the end of day two, but with this my scalp feels a lot better. I can wash every 2 or 3 days, rather than every 1 or 1 1/2 days like before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for curls - I have half very wavy &amp; half very straight hair. What I wash with doesn&#x27;t make too much difference because it will be frizzy if I don&#x27;t set it somehow (thank goodness for velcro rollers). But I do find that my hair seems healthy and soft when washed with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, my hair doesn&#x27;t mind whether I use shampoo or no-poo, but my scalp prefers this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have reactive scalp to all shampoos I&#x27;ve previously used. DevaCurl did not make my scalp turn red.  Could be lack of sulfates.  I&#x27;m very happy with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> My normally extremely frizzy hair is now tamed, my fine hair has never been able to hold a curl for more than 12 hours (without a lot of product) and the curls would fall out into waves immediately if touched.  Now my hair remains curled for a day and a half (even after sleeping on it), and I can put a shirt on or run my hands through my hair and still have curls afterwards.  So if you have really fine curly hair that normally ends up as wavy a couple of hours after it dries, this product may improve the health of your hair enough to allow it curl and hold shape like it did mine.</li>
            <li> I did decent research into the product and received mixed reviews. I bought both the shampoo and the conditioner (One Condition) and have been quite pleased with both. There was several complaints to the smell, but to be honest it&#x27;s not bad, just a heavy \\&quot;natural\\&quot; smell to it and I&#x27;ve even received compliments. For those that have curly hair (mine&#x27;s natural) it&#x27;s been great! My hair seems to be more moisturized, with soft and improved curls. I fully recommend the product.</li>
            <li> My three year old daughter has gorgeous ringlet curls.  Her hair is thick and getting long.  I&#x27;ve been terrified to do anything to her hair in fear that we will lose the curls.  Around the same age I had similar hair and my mom cut it off to achieve the Dorothy Hammel bob.  My hair forever lost the ringlets and most of the curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To properly care for my daughter&#x27;s hair I first ordered the book Curly Girl!  Fabulous book on caring for curly hair.  I learned I was washing my daughter&#x27;s hair too often and brushing it when wet.  Big no no&#x27;s!  The book also gave suggestions on how to cut the hair to maintain the curl&#x27;s natural shape.  Next was having the proper products to keep the hair clean and detangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DevaCurl products are great.  They smell fresh and clean.  Since moving to them I have seen my daughter&#x27;s hair look more vibrant and healthy.  In addition, I no longer need detangler.  I only \\&quot;wash\\&quot; her hair with the No Poo once a week. If it needs to be freshened up (after fun in the sandbox) I use a little bit of the conditioner when she is in the tub.  Otherwise, sometimes I simply spritz her hair with a water bottle filled with a few drops of essential oil such as lavendar or orange mixed with water.  I squeeze her curls after they are misted and they bounce back to shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products seem to be a little too heavy for my hair though I do use them about once a week for a deep conditioning.  My husband&#x27;s hair is wavy and thick.  He really likes these products and has switched over to this brand.</li>
            <li> This product is affordable and smells great, but it does not work for me.  My curly hair tends to be oily at the roots and dry at the ends.  After only two days of washing my hair with Low-Poo, it had become weighed down and sticky.  If your scalp does not produce much oil, this product could work well for you, since it&#x27;s very gentle on curls.  Otherwise you need a stronger shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair and always have difficulty finding good shampoos. DevaCurl No-Poo has been a great find. My hair is much less frizzy, and the curls are much better defined. My scalp tends to be dry, but it is much better with this shampoo. The peppermint fragrance is really nice too.</li>
            <li> I use this once a week during the winter and every other day during the summer.  It&#x27;s creamy (no suds) and rinses out complete.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair and it keeps my scalp clean and moisturized.  Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair, this shampoo line by DevaCurl is a MUST HAVE. I have not tried the \\&quot;no poo\\&quot; yet, but I absolutely LOVE the low-poo! The scent is great, my hair and scalp are healthier than ever, and it&#x27;s affordable! Tell your friends, too...they&#x27;ll thank you!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work the curling magic of my hopes and dreams but it detangles well, defrizzes a decent amount, smells nice, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp like shampoo.</li>
            <li> I LOVE DevaCurl.  Me and my hair are addicted to the products!  I have been using Deva for a little over a year and highly recommend ALL curly girls to make the change to DEVA!  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love Deva Curl products. They are the only hair line I use now, and my hair has drastically improved. Very moisturizing line, you just have to figure out which combination works best for you.</li>
            <li> I like how it makes my hair feel, but I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell! People definitely notice a difference in how your curls look!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been doing no poo, meaning not using shampoo for quite a while.  I started doing this out of desperation, regular shampoo would dry my scalp and hair out, then turn my scalp greasy hours later.  My scalp was always itchy with shampoo, this stopped when I stopped using it.  When I started working out, I needed something to make my scalp feel clean.    I love this product.  It smells wonderful.  It gets my scalp clean, I can feel it.  It doesn&#x27;t strip all the oil out of my scalp or hair.  My hair is soft and happy.  My scalp is happy, too, no itch and no dryness.    I do not have curly hair, I have very fine, thin, wavy hair.    I love this product.    If you use regular shampoo now and want to switch to this, give it a month before you decide if you like it or not.  The change away from harsh detergents can cause your scalp to seem extra oily - it&#x27;s used to being stripped of all oils and needing to overproduce more oil out of desperation to protect itself.  Once it adjusts, you&#x27;ll discover that you don&#x27;t actually have an oil problem.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical about this whole &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; business, but my curls were getting drier and frizzier as my hair got grayer. I bought the 12 oz bottle and thought I&#x27;d give it to the bottom of the bottle to see how it worked. I still have a quarter of the bottle to go but I&#x27;m back to buy the biggest bottle I can find. This stuff is a miracle for my hair! I can actually go longer between &amp;#34;shampoos&amp;#34;, and as the humidity increases as we go into summer my hair is getting curlier, not frizzier! I use Paul Mitchell The Conditioner as my leave-on conditioner, and between washings I run my wet fingers through my hair, then run a dab of conditioner through the curls to tame any outliers. I have found the perfect combination of products for my hair!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is not designed to clean the oil from your scalp but it does clean product residue.  If you have oil production in your scalp you might like Low Poo shampoo better, by Diva because NO poo doesn&#x27;t lather AT ALL, it&#x27;s like a cleansing lotion.  I have very dry skin and scalp and am very glad there&#x27;s a product that I can use to clean the product residue without leaving my hair drier than it already is.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I was having to wash my hair everyday after exercising and my hair was getting really dry and looked unhealthy. My hair stylist suggested Deva Curl No-Poo (even tho my hair is straight &amp; no curls), so I bought a travel size just to try it.I liked it so well I ordered the 12 oz. size and now I&#x27;m ordering the 32 oz.  I noticed my hair looked so much better when I used this I started using it more often and my other shampoo occasionally. You have to get used to no lather. I rub it in well and let it set a minute, then rinse it really really well. My hair has never looked healthier or shinier, I also don&#x27;t have to use a conditioner. It just proves to me how much other shampoos dry out my hair and the ones I use are supposedly &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34;.  Probably won&#x27;t work for everyone, but definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now and will never use another shampoo again.  My hair is very short and not oily.  I bought the travel pack and experimented with all the products, but I ended up just using the shampoo and nothing more.  It feels great knowing I&#x27;m using a product without harsh chemicals.  My hair is finally soft, shiny and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this is the first time EVER in my 45 years that I haven&#x27;t had to use a conditioner in order to brush my wet hair without tears.  I can COMB my wet hair and I have zero tangles.  For you curly haired people out there, you already know this in itself makes this product worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want clean, fluffy hair with NO tangles, use just this product without the other products.  In my opinion, the other DevaCurl products are not needed and only add weight to your hair and make it feel heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 2-28-13:  I&#x27;ve now been using this for well over a year.  This week I had a sample of a lathering shampoo that I tried and my poor hair was so tangled and rough feeling.  I&#x27;m going home after work and wash this mess out and use my No-poo.  I hope it works as good for you as it does for me.  I&#x27;ll never ever try lathering shampoo again.  Yuck!</li>
            <li> While there is no lather I work the lotion in well and rinse. It leaves my hair soft.  My hair was damaged from meds for my breast cancer and this shampoo really helped it. I like the smell. A good friend uses the shampoo for straight hair and loves it.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, very curly hair and recently jumped on the no-poo train. I started out with cheap Suave natural conditioner which was ho hum. A friend encouraged me to try this and wow what a difference. I love this stuff so much that I bought 2 - one bottle to keep at home and one for my gym bag.</li>
            <li> I bought this product with high hopes, but the smell of this shampoo is so strong, it was really overpowering!  It has a strong perfume-like smell that lingers on your head for hours.  I only used it once.  I am sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> Shampoo is a sham.  And poo.  Finding this product taught me that.  Like many, I was intrigued by the Wenn commercials, and like many, I wasn&#x27;t keen to deal with Guthy Renker to get it.  DevaCurl No-Poo changed my life.  It makes my scalp tingle, makes my hair smell good and smooths my course, dry, frizz-prone hair beautifully.  A couple of things:&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s not just for curly girls.  I don&#x27;t wear my hair curly, and it works great for me.&lt;br /&gt;* I find that I don&#x27;t need the conditioner with it.  I have it but never use it.  I just use a leave-in styling product and I&#x27;m all good.&lt;br /&gt;* Since I&#x27;ve been using this product, I only have to wash my hair every 4-5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRY IT.  I send sample sizes to my friends all the time, so I can be their hero.</li>
            <li> After using DevaCurl cleanser and conditioner for almost 3 years, I of corse have an addiction because those make my hair really really soft, but my hair start falling a lot, of course everyone complains about this problem but I always had very nice hair, dryness was sometimes a problem but hair lose not.  Now after using this product for almost 3 years I noticed that half of my hair are gone it&#x27;s almost twice as less as it used to be, even people around me will notice. I am absolutely healthy and now I keep wondering if the reason could be those DevaCurl products, or it&#x27;s just  I just some kind of coincidence, I like my hair texture, but hair lose became a problem so I just wonder if anyone else is experiencing this kind of problem with this product. Thanks</li>
            <li> It softens and moisturizes and helps to enhance curl pattern while refreshing the senses with a surprisingly clean smell with the odd rose peppermint fragrance.</li>
            <li> Smells great, feels like conditioner but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> LOVE the Deva line of products!!</li>
            <li> I went to the salon and got the trial size and it&#x27;s been doing wonders for my hair so I ordered the full bottle. I never leave my hair curly any more cuase it never does what I want it too but with this product I did and it looked great.</li>
            <li> I have mid-back length blonde, wavy, coarse, thick hair. I had been using Wen and wanted to try a few other condition only washes and/or no-poos.  This was the first I&#x27;d tried after WEN, thinking this may do more for my waves. Wasn&#x27;t very impressed. Hair felt dry and it actually seemed to make my hair straighter rather than curlier.&lt;br /&gt;If your hair needs a bit more conditioning/moisturizing I would not recommend this unless you follow it up with a leave-in treatment.&lt;br /&gt;This may do more for people with much curlier hair, but if all you have is wave, I&#x27;d try something else.</li>
            <li> this shampoo has no lather and you wonder if it really works, it does, noy hair feels and looks clean and what it does for my curls they look great!</li>
            <li> Love DevaCurl products. The shampoo and conditioner are the best I have found for my naturally curl hair. Best curls of my life.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo, even with no bubbles.  Gets hair clean and shiny.  Feels super good!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and was very disappointed with it.  It did not work well at all with my hair texture.  I would tell others about this product but warn them to test it on a small section of hair first.</li>
            <li> Easy on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Living in Chicago where winter is COLD and heat in homes/offices HOT...poor scalp and hair takes a beating. I use this occasionally, to give my hair a rest.&lt;br /&gt;The husband used it to get his scalp to STOP itching. It worked for him.</li>
            <li> My hair got much healthier when I started using this!</li>
            <li> I tried out DevaCurl on the recommendation of a coworker. The \\&quot;No-Poo\\&quot; shampoo is hydrating yet cleansing. Unfortunately, it leaves behind a very STRONG perfume smell that, for me, lasted the whole day and would have gone on lasting if I hadn&#x27;t given up and washed my hair with a different product. There are plenty of non-natural ingredients on the label, including the extremely offensive \\&quot;Parfum (Perfume)\\&quot; - so I should have known better. Nevertheless, all the hype DevaCurl spends on making their product sound like it&#x27;s better for you than a sudsing shampoo seems sort of misplaced if they can&#x27;t even take out the artificial scents.   If you are sensitive to perfumes, dyes etc. these are not the products for you.</li>
            <li> I use this with the curl one conditioner and this is a great product. I live at the shore and this tames my hair and it leaves it really soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair that likes to frizz. My hair stylist suggested I try a no poo wash for my hair. This is the first product of this type that I have used. It works great keeping my hair from frizzing, however, my hair feels so greasy and dirty and has been falling out. I wash my hair before bed, it feels clean when I fall asleep but wake up with it feeling dirty. I don&#x27;t understand how someone with really curly hair could use this and not wash for a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years and will never go back to shampoo. Even co-washes aren&#x27;t as good. No lather, just creamy cleansing that doesn&#x27;t dry out your curls.Leaves your hair clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Great for curls. I have a perm and it is great, especially when the perm is new.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for those with curly or otherwise delicate hair. STRONG scent though, which I found surprising as a pervious user of DevaCurl Low-Poo, which has a much more gentle scent! I didn&#x27;t hate the scent, but it was just much stronger than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> I recently stumbled upon the curly girl method and I love this no poo cleanser.  It cleans my hair and leaves it smelling great.  If you&#x27;re into the no poo movement, you may be put off by a commercial product, but for us curly girls, this does the job and hydrates my curls without drying them out.  If you&#x27;re new to the no poo movement, you may have to use more often gradually weaning off every day cleaning.  I can go three or four days between washes (now...after the transition period while my scalp adjusted to less cleansing).  I use a refresher mist in the mornings to clean up the shape of it and go.  Would def recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Not great, I have thin blond curly/wavy hair. I used as directed and my hair was weighed down and too oily to skip a shampoo for a day. I have been using Alterna for a year and wanted to try a more affordable product. This product might appear cheaper by the ounce but the amount you have to use is almost three times as much product. It takes forever to rinse out, and I lost clumps of hair every wash. I switched back to Alterna and after a few days I&#x27;m back to beautiful shiny hair, that doesn&#x27;t break every time I wash it.</li>
            <li> I love love love love this product. It didn&#x27;t dry my hair out like regular shampoos and my hair starting to curl as soon as I washed it. Great Product!!!!!</li>
            <li> I started using no poo and within a month I had a scalp crust problem. My hairdresser told me that if you have wavy hair, or S waves, rather than denser curly hair this may not work&lt;br /&gt;For you. My hair is medium oily and wavy this was not a fit for my hair. I really like loo poo,&lt;br /&gt;however and deva curl conditioner.</li>
            <li> THis is the best product for curly hair.  It keeps hair soft and manageable.  I use it regularly with other Devalporudct.</li>
            <li> The shampoo smells great, has no sulfates and it does not strip your hair like regular shampoo.  Keeps my dry curly hair in check</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this shampoo. On the one hand, it&#x27;s more economical than some other nonlathering shampoos, so you won&#x27;t go broke trying it. However, the smell is just too much. I believe it&#x27;s mint and rose -- an odd combination. It&#x27;s the mint I object to. Virtually EVERY nonlathering shampoo is &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34;. Why? I think it&#x27;s an attempt to &amp;#34;compensate&amp;#34; the user somehow for the lack of lather. Like if you don&#x27;t have lather you might not think your hair is clean, so let&#x27;s dump in some mint to mimic the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling of toothpaste. The bottom line is that if you use this shampoo you will smell *strongly* like a cough drop. The other issue I have with this stuff is that it actually doesn&#x27;t make my hair curl at all. I have wavy hair and this shampoo actually made it look straight, frizzy, and dry.  I have used Suave Shea Butter Conditioner (less than $2 at Safeway) as a &amp;#34;nonlathering hair cleanser&amp;#34; and my hair is shiny, wavy, and smells really good. I think this nonlathering shampoo craze is just the latest marketing ploy by manufacturers who think women are stupid.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and have been ready to shave my head many times trying to deal with it! I FINALLY found a product that is wonderful! The girls at my salon told me to stick it out for a few weeks because I might not like it at first. The first time I used it-I hated it because my hair just felt greasy-but after a few more times and finally getting rid of the buildup that I had in my hair-I LOVE IT. My hair has never been so clean, bouncy and healthy. I use it everyday because it is gentle and I just scrunch it and let it air dry and my hair looks fantastic. WONDERFUL-try it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing in that your curls really do react differently with this shampoo.  I have not had great success styling my hair with these products but am not ready to give up yet.  I think it will just take more time to figure out what works best.  I have not had success using the additional conditioner and gel to style my hair.  Overall I do like the shampoo and if you have curly hair you really should try it.  The formulation really is quite amazing that a shampoo can cause your curls to &#x27;behave&#x27; differently!</li>
            <li> First thing I thought, \\&quot;Please don&#x27;t let me like this stuff, please!!\\&quot; For one, is because it is so expensive for shampoo and I don&#x27;t want to have to spend that much on it everytime I need it. But I ended up loving this stuff to death. No!!!!! First off, the DevaCurl line smells freaking AMAZING! I am in love with the smell, every product has a different type of smell, but along the same lines a similar smell. I swear I could spend 15 minutes just siting there and smells this amazing stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, as you most likely heard there is no lather in this, but when I use it I really feel like my hair is getting really clean. And I love rubbing this stuff all over my hair. I feel comepletely refreshed after. So here is my problem. I really like this stuff, but it&#x27;s so expensive. But I think I&#x27;m going to keep on getting it anyway. It&#x27;s good for my hair and I love it, so yeah~!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to use this as soon as it arrived. I have shoulder blade length hair and using 2tsp was enough for me. Make sure hair is evenly  wet before distributing No-Poo since it does not create foam as with typical shampoo product. I didn&#x27;t  feel like my hair was dirty like another review mentioned. The bottle size is fair for all I needed to use. I am not planning on using it everyday because I&#x27;m  going  curly  girl method and the reason I purchased in the first place.</li>
            <li> I have very curly, kinky, frizzy hair and this wasn&#x27;t for me.  on my curly days, my hair looked and felt weird and weighed down.  on my straight hair days, it didn&#x27;t feel clean.  i think the no-poo route isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair shiny and nice frizz free condition..love the curls......and even smooth I love it. it is soo shiny</li>
            <li> Once I got over the awful eucalyptus smell I loved how the product controlled my frizz. After about 2 months of use my hair started falling out in big clumps. I went back to my previous product and after a couple of days the clumping stopped. I&#x27;m going to have to get about 8 inches chopped off my hair to fix the damage. A girl who I work with had also tried this product in the past and told me that she had the same issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I was shipped the same product as all the higher star reviewers or those reviews were posted prior to long term regular use but I would advise that the moment you notice some irregular clumping, immediately stop using this product.</li>
            <li> Too bad I can&#x27;t get my money back because if I could I would. I bought for my daughter &amp; she hates it!!  I heard great things about this product &amp; a friend sells it in her salon so maybe this isn&#x27;t the original formula? Not sure, but I am sure my daughter hates it.  Waste of $30.00  Should&#x27;ve bought her the WEN, atleast I know it works &amp; what to expect.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this. After my first use, I realized I probably should  have purchased the conditioner too. My hair was so dry and bleh. I do love the smell and the tingly feeling of the peppermint oils. It feels weird not to lather my shampoo. I really don&#x27;t notice a difference in my hair being &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; or not. I guess I really will have to see if there is a difference with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Shampoo bottle packed in an envelope and much of the contents of the bottle leaked out. This should have been packed in  box to protect it. Expensive product that it largely not useable. Why would I waste my time to send back a partial bottle of shampoo. A BIG FREAKING MESS!!&lt;br /&gt;I will not order from this seller again and AMAZON needs to heed this advice as well.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for curly hair, but I also use it when I plan to blow my hair out straight. It adds lots of body!! This shampoo leaves my hair in great condition!!</li>
            <li> I notice the shampoo has brought about more improvement as the weeks go by. The hair feels softer, stronger, and frizz is gone. Certainly does not strip or damage in any way.</li>
            <li> I thought Id give the DEVA CURL NO POO a shot. Ive only tried DEVA CARE NO POO in the past and thought I would try something a little different. It works fairly well. It is  the only no poo I am using at the moment. It leaves my fine shoulder length type 3 curly hair moisturized. However I do not like the rose scent and get better detangling and even more moisture from DEVA CARE NO POO. In fact I can skip DEVA CURL ONE CONDITION with the DEVA Care and go straight to styling if I choose. I also prefer its citrus scent. Good stuff but Ill be sure to order the DEVA CARE NO POO when  I run out.</li>
            <li> use second day after low poo and it works well</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, it works wonders for hair and is the only cleanser that I can use for months and my hair not grow tired of it.</li>
            <li> Strange smell does not work well</li>
            <li> Great softening, cleaning, conditioning, and manages to keep my hair in great condition.  Glad I found it in time to help.</li>
            <li> This is the shampoo of my choice. I LOVE the scent and the creamy texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it is a shampoo, it moisturizes my hair! I don&#x27;t use it all the time. I use it about once a week. This is all the shampoo I need. Thanks Amazon and DevaCurl!</li>
            <li> I have been using the DevaCurl products for a while now.  I use the No-Poo followed by the One Condition.  After washing my hair, I use the leave-in conditioner and then the light gel.  I do think my curly hair is better managed with these products but I don&#x27;t think I have the technique down perfect yet.  I did try the Lo-Poo and didn&#x27;t like that at all.  For my hair, the No-Poo works much better.  I think everyone&#x27;s hair is different and the trick is finding what works best for you!</li>
            <li> I have a natural wave to my hair and I love this product.  My sister gave me a bottle of DevaCurl No-Poo last year for Christmas and I simply love it.  It cleans my hair well, is good for the environment, has no sulfites, and I don&#x27;t have to use a conditioner.  What a product!</li>
            <li> My only problem with this shampoo is that I find my hair is greasy the next day. But I otherwise love the shampoo, great smell and I can use it with out a conditioner.</li>
            <li> Okay, I have never tried a no lather shampoo and to be honest, I was pretty skeptical. I didn&#x27;t think it would be possible for a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t lather to properly clean your hair. Well, this has proven me wrong! It cleans you hair perfectly. You just have to make sure that once every 2 weeks you use a lathering shampoo to avoid any build up. This product has really helped get a lot of shine and health back to my hair. Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 2 years and my hair has never looked better. I have VERY curly hair. My hair never looks or feels dried out (and I swim daily in a lake over the summer), and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I only wash my hair once or twice a week, after dancing for 4 hours in a smoky lounge, etc. Most regular shampoos blow up my hair shafts (because of coloring/streaking with foils every month?). This one doesn&#x27;t have the nasty detergents that strip your hair. I use here and then when I&#x27;ve already used regular shampoo the day before, for ex. Mostly, I just massage my hair with the shower water most days. If you don&#x27;t use lots of sprays, styling gels, etc., this is fine.</li>
            <li> I had a gift certificate from Christmas and really needed some new hair products.  I bought this, the conditioner to it, and the curl holding creme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very processed hair.  I dye it regularly and high heat wave, curl, or straighten depending on my mood.  It&#x27;s shoulder length or more and somewhat thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo does not lather.  It&#x27;s not supposed to.  It&#x27;s cleansing your hair.  If I didn&#x27;t know this ahead of time, I&#x27;d  probably have freaked out and sent it back.  You work it through your hair and rinse.  I usually do this twice.  I don&#x27;t care for the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t matter because the conditioner smells great.  You work the conditioner through and leave it on as long as you need it.  A minute or ten, doesn&#x27;t matter, it just depends on how deep you want or need your conditioning.  You can rinse it and then towel dry your hair and put a bit back in to stay.  It makes your hair soft and gives more hold, but I thought doing that made my hair feel heavy, but I did try it.  The creme hold stuff smells great too.  The hold is &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34;.  That&#x27;s why the 4 stars and not 5.  I&#x27;m reviewing the 3 products as a whole system overall.  The creme smells good, feels good, and I even rubbed my hands on my face after running it through my hair.  It made such a good lotion.  I found that my curls needed the occasional touch up if I were going out, or had something going on in the evening.  I didn&#x27;t need to add more, just needed to touch up my hair a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff blows your average department store products away.  I like biolage better, but can&#x27;t afford it.  But this is better than then the Nexxus products.  The shipping was quick with Prime and on time.  Packaging was fine.  Bottle is simple, plain, not gimicky, if you know what I mean.  I would buy more, try some other of their products, and recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If anyone I knew had dry hair, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this. But I went from one extreme to the other, which is why I think this didn&#x27;t work. I used to shampoo once daily (sometimes more) with a daily clarifying shampoo. I wanted my hair to be thicker and healthier, and for it to stop getting greasy mid-afternoon. So I gave DevaCurl a try and started shampooing every other day. It&#x27;s been about 2.5 months now, and my hair is greasy even immediately after I shower. If you&#x27;re using harsh shampoos on your hair right now, maybe go to a sulfate-free shampoo every other day before diving into this. Otherwise, you&#x27;ll be like me and spend months with greasy hair wondering when it&#x27;ll go away. I&#x27;ll certainly hold on to the bottle to use every now and then, but I&#x27;ll be purchasing a sulfate-free shampoo, as DevaCurl just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is absolutely fabulous. I love using it and just purchased the conditioner as well. Thank you Deva Curl.</li>
            <li> If your hair is curly or wavy, as mine is, this is a great product. It just takes some time to get used to the no suds feel, and I mean it&#x27;s absolutely no suds. It&#x27;s like you&#x27;re washing your hair with conditioner, but it does leave your hair clean. The trick is to really use your fingers and massage the scalp as you wash. Also, make sure you really rinse well. This  will leave your hair with nice curl and no frizz. It&#x27;s very conditioning which is what curls need. I definitely recommend this product. Use it with the One Condition for best results.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff- shampoo, conditioner, both- whatever you want to call it- it&#x27;s great on my fine (but there&#x27;s tons of it), slightly dry, red-dyed hair.  If you know color, you know that red is the hardest of all colors to keep fresh and No-Poo helps my color stay so vibrant that when I went to get my hair done last week my colorist said &amp;#34;If you didn&#x27;t have roots, I&#x27;d think you had gone to someone else (for a dye job).&amp;#34;  Another thing that REALLY helps is my Aquasana Water Purifier for my shower.  It takes out all of the chlorine and other chemicals that are tough on one&#x27;s hair.  It&#x27;s made a huge difference in conjunction with the No-Poo.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for years. I love the way it smells and it leaves my hair feeling clean without a lather.</li>
            <li> Love these products. Can&#x27;t buy them where I live so I stopped using them and tried other stuff, not a good thing!  My color is Demi and Red and this product does not fade it out, it also keeps my hair cleaner longer because I need less products. You need to get used to no suds when you first use it, but the feel of your hair will keep you using it!</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair &amp; have always struggled to find good products that don&#x27;t dry out my hair.  I have been using this for about two months now &amp; I don&#x27;t know how I ever survived without it.  I plan on buying this in bulk to stock up on in case of a catastrophic event this will be the first thing I pack in my survival kit!!!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by a fellow curly-headed friend. I&#x27;ve never found anything like it. My curls have increased, and my frizziness disappeared. Since I&#x27;ve been using this product, I get compliments on my hair from colleagues and from strangers. I feared that something this good would cost too much, but it fits comfortably within my budget. Thank you, Deva Curl.</li>
            <li> made my head itch like crazy.  didn&#x27;t matter what i did.  wish i could get a refund</li>
            <li> As a curly haired woman, I love this cleansing conditioner! You will have to get used to it not lathering in your hair the way regular shampoo does but afterwards, your hair will feel great! Mine did! Nice and soft after washing it out. Not rough the way some shampoos leave your hair feeling.</li>
            <li> I have thick, grey hair that is very coarse. Usually it is just a frizzy mess. I think I have tried almost every shampoo and conditioner there is and now finally I think I have found something to help. It does not lather and even without the conditioner my hair feels better. I also purchased the Deva Curl One Conditioner. The only problem I have is getting it out of the bottle!</li>
            <li> I was excited to read all the reviews about this product and had high hopes. I didn&#x27;t work for me. I have a lot of thick, &amp;#34;botticelli&amp;#34; curls. I used a whole bottle of No-Poo and honestly didn&#x27;t notice any difference. I also didn&#x27;t get used to the fact that there is no foam. I kinda like foam...&lt;br /&gt;But the worse, really, is the smell. It smells like cheap perfume, like roses and it&#x27;s too overpowering. Not buying again.</li>
            <li> For the last 3 months I&#x27;ve used NoPoo, Deva Curl One Condition and Frizz free Volumizing mousse because they perform so well. But throughout that time I developed a low-grade cough/chest congestion that the doc said was an allergy and have been sensing the smell of dried smoke or firewood that seems to be around my hair (scent and smoke-free home). I recently skipped the Deva regimen for a couple of days (those were bad hair days!) and the problem cleared up. Hard to say definitely that it&#x27;s the products in this hot, humid summer when our HVAC and swimming pool and indoor allergens could be causing it. I hope it&#x27;s not an allergy to Deva - I love these products. I&#x27;ll repeat the test a few times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really nice product for dry curly hair. It hydrates curls and is even more moisturizing than the one condition surprisingly! After a few days the smell is making me sick though...</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel soft but not as clean as with a foaming shampoo. Will try the conditioner next</li>
            <li> Everything DevaCurl makes is fantastic! My curls have never felt so luxurious!</li>
            <li> I love it. it is a little weird washing my girls hair and not seeing any foam. But it does work and her hair is beautiful.</li>
            <li> I use this a few times a week and also use one condition and deva&#x27;s gel.  This stuff makes my hair feel strange.. dry right from rinsing  and if I don&#x27;t rinse and condition the next day my hair gets stinky which has never happend before.  Very disappointed in this product but love many others in the DevaCurl line.  On a plus, I like the smell.</li>
            <li> Love Deva Curl products!</li>
            <li> my daughter loves this stuff.  very long hair prone to breakage, mostly because she refuses to cut it, but it&#x27;s done wonders for her.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair clean and healthy!  Don&#x27;t worry if doesn&#x27;t lather; it is working.  It gives my hair more body.</li>
            <li> I am now officially a convert to No-Poo. It takes a little while to get used to not having lather and I&#x27;ll admit I do miss that nice soapy feeling while washing my hair. But it&#x27;s worth it. My hair feels so good after using this stuff and it&#x27;s less frizzy too! I also notice my scalp doesn&#x27;t get itchy anymore either - I guess cause I quit drying it out with those regular shampoos. Anyway, give this a try. I didn&#x27;t experience any of the extra oiliness that one reviewer mentioned. But my hair tends to be on the drier side.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product from a friend to control my frizz. I use it to co wash my hair every 2-3 days and Ouidad shampoo once a week which using Too Shea conditioner in between. It does a great job of getting build up gunk from my hair making it light again while not activating my frizz issue. It also has a nice minty smell to it. Once my regimen in the shower is complete, I rinse my hair out, leaving it nice and soft again. Must better than any of my old products. Give it a try if you have curls or bad frizz &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the smell at all. Some other reviewers said it smelled bad but I don&#x27;t see why. It doesn&#x27;t lather but it&#x27;s still a great way to wash your hair and my hair was super clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products to manage my curly hair. Some have worked OK, but not great. I also wanted a product that allowed me to go a couple days without washing my hair, I usually have to wash my hair everyday to activate the curls, but I have very long, thick hair that I air dry, so it takes half day for it to be completely dry, washing my hair every day is a pain!  This product gave me the best hair I ever had! I washed my hair with the Devacurl no-poo and then applied Devacurl One Condition. I rinsed the conditioner very well and then, still in the shower, I squeezed the excess water and applied a little of the Curl Angel Gel. Then I used a cotton t-shirt to &amp;#34;scrunch&amp;#34; my hair, that got ride of excess water and set my curls. Then I just let the hair air dry and I was amazed by the results. Next day I woke up and my hair was still looking great! I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair every day now!  The only thing that I am not too thrill about is the smell of the no-poo and conditioner, but the curl gel smells great and kind of mask the smell of the other products.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this product to me several years ago before moving away from the area but I only recently decided to try it out.  Maybe the formula has changed since she recommended it because while I&#x27;m sure the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; aspect of it would work out great for my naturally curly hair, the strong rose scent caused an instant headache.  I have scent sensitivities, especially with flowery scents, so the amount of fragrance in the product would have been helpful to know in advance. I would have chosen a different product.</li>
            <li> The fact that it does not lather is hard to get used to, but the hair washes nicely and does not over dry like regular shampoos.</li>
            <li> This shampoo allows my hairs natural wave and curl to come to life.  It is so gentle to my uber sensitive skin and has a very delicate, botanical fragrance that is so pleasant.  And I am very hyper-sensitive to many  fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you realize that it won&#x27;t &amp;#34;suds&amp;#34; up like other shampoos do but still leaves your hair and scalp clean it&#x27;s addicting to use.  My hair is softer than it has been in years and shiny.  People think I had a perm or a &amp;#34;glossing&amp;#34; treatment.  And color added.  Nope.  Just healthy hair.  Finally!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend reading the &amp;#34;Curly Girl&amp;#34; book that goes with this product line.  I really was convinced I had straight hair.  And needed perms for this amount of curl.  And had to keep dying my hair for shine and color (middle-aged blah hair syndrome).</li>
            <li> I purchased this by accident - wanted the devacare no-poo.  Do not buy this if you are allergic/sensitive to fragrance, which I am.  It has a very strong, chemical fragrance smell (to my nose, anyway).  I love the DevaCare which has just a mild minty fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Deva Curl products for a year now &amp; it is the first line of products that work &amp; still continue to work.  I&#x27;ve used so many products, i&#x27;m sure like a lot of us curly haired ladies have. I had my collection of products under the sink that worked for a time &amp; then just didn&#x27;t.  But I&#x27;m really impressed and although they are a bit pricey I will by them at different times &amp; when I see good deals &amp; just stock up, but the this shampoo is really great. I&#x27;ve using some &amp;#34;non sulfate&amp;#34; shampoos and either they stink or they make your hair feel weird, or they actually do suds up. This one smells great &amp; I never have any product build up, it really cleans your hair and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it.  It&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li> No more frizz! SLS-free, smells amazing, and cleans better than shampoo; it doesn&#x27;t strip my hair of its natural sheen.  I also now only have to wash my hair every few days, I can go up to 3 days without getting that &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feeling.  Wonderful change!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great for curly hair. Like many gals out there, I&#x27;ve pretty much have tried EVERYTHING, even the high price/name brand products and none work as well as curl deva. The 12 oz. bottle lasted quite a while because I would only need about a quarter size for every wash. My hair did get a little greasy at first because I was used to using the typical large glob of other brand shampoo to get a good wash. I&#x27;ve ran out and I miss it already! It leaves your hair silky smooth, helps decrease frizz and helps with styling. I think I&#x27;m a customer for life...and honestly I&#x27;m not going back. Love curl deva!</li>
            <li> Deva Curl product was doctor recommended. I have been using this for years and I love how well it works with my curly hair it makes it feel smooth and oh so soft. It’s a bit expensive but worth it. I am allergic to sulfa and Deva products are sulfa free. The No Poo is good for dry and damaged hair. Deva works great for me!!!</li>
            <li> so great for curly hair</li>
            <li> Okay, I *just* used this again today, like 3 hours ago. I&#x27;ve had it for months &amp; seriously dislike it.&lt;br /&gt;For one, it smells disgusting. It&#x27;s overpoweringly intense - like nausea/migraine inducing. Basically, it smells exactly like some cheap, vile, powdery-floral bathroom spray. Not too crazy about my head smelling like a public toilet.&lt;br /&gt;It does not do anything remotely impressive for my hair. In fact my hair feels sort of rough &amp; tangly. I have used plenty of other cheap conditioners for CO-Washing, many cone-free, and have been way more impressed with the results. (I&#x27;m talking $1 conditioners like V05 or Suave, that you can find dirt cheap at K-Mart, Target, Wal-Mart, drug stores, etc...)&lt;br /&gt;Save your money &amp; just get something else. I would never buy this again, nor would I ever recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit it--I am very hard on my hair. It&#x27;s baby fine, wavy and I bleach the hell out of it. Since it&#x27;s so fine, I typically have to wash every day, which is wreaking havoc on the condition of my hair. A co-worker who has the same problem suggested this to me and I figured it was worth a shot. I&#x27;ve only been using for a few weeks, but can already feel a bit of a difference. The biggest thing you have to get used to is the lack of lather. I&#x27;ve been conditioned to think lather&#x3D;clean, even though I know all those damaging sulfates are the only damaging my hair further. Due to this, I have a tendency to overuse the Deva Curl. I figure that will figure itself out with time. This stuff smells great, too. Overall great product.</li>
            <li> Love it! My hair feels clean &amp; hasn&#x27;t shed anywhere near as much as before.</li>
            <li> It was too heavy for my hair and i couldn&#x27;t stand the smell.  I do still use the conditioner on occasion, but using both in one wash left my curly hair looking very greasy.</li>
            <li> Love all things devacurl.</li>
            <li> This is an absolute product for anyone who has curly hair.  I am so grateful that I was told about it.</li>
            <li> The first time I used No-Poo, I had to pick the bottle up again to make sure I hadn&#x27;t grabbed conditioner by mistake. I have *always* needed heavy conditioners for my colored, Botticelli-type curls. No more! This shampoo is so gentle and moisturizing that I can use a regular conditioner and be absolutely fine. Now, it doesn&#x27;t suds up, which took some getting used to. Small price to pay for my hair being in vastly improved condition! At $18/12 oz bottle, it&#x27;s a little pricey, but very worth it to me.</li>
            <li> This product is good to have, but it&#x27;s not really worth the money.  You could use a conditioner from the drugstore that is silicone free that would be just as good for the purpose of cleansing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been curious about Wen ever since I saw my first infomercial, but I did my research and found a lot of mixed reviews which scared me off.  I didn&#x27;t want to go to the trouble of ordering and be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw a no poo formula by Salon Grafix and tried it thinking it might give me an idea of what to expect from a conditioning cleanser.  Horrible.  Absolutely horrible.  My hair was a nasty, greasy, tangly mess.  That scared me off the whole concept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then my hairdresser suggested DevaCurl No Poo after I asked her about Wen.  She&#x27;d tried DevaCurl and liked it.  Her sister, also a hairdresser, uses Wen and likes it but uses No Poo if she runs out of Wen between shipments (they sell it at their salon).  I bought a trial pack and loved it immediately.  I was told I might have to use it for a while before the buildup washed out and my hair began to respond but for me the switch had instant results.  My scalp and hair felt clean, it smells wonderful, my hair is silky and not tangled...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is baby fine and tangles easily.  I have just enough curl in it to make styling a pain - I get either a rogue wave or a shirley temple curl within hours of straightening, and I&#x27;m prone to frizz especially in humid conditions.  With No Poo, the curls that surface are actually waves I can be happy about.  I even let my hair dry naturally and the ensuing curls were soft and looked intentional!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like One Condition also except it doesn&#x27;t smell like the No Poo.  No Poo smells awesome, One Condition to me smells weird.  No idea why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly suggest giving this a try if lather shampoos and other non-lathering conditioning cleansers have left you disappointed.  A small trial size is enough to find out if it will work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference may be the absence of silicone - it seems like a lot of the other cleansing cremes are full of chems including silicone, and silicone is a pretty greasy substance, something I would think would create buildup instead of remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incidentally, I recently ran out of No Poo and tried the SG again and within two days the same results.  It went in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Great product for curly girls - no lather cleanser is important to not dry out curly hair and this product is highly recommended by my stylist so I was happy to find it on Amazon. The only thing that would have made me happier would be to find Amazon selling it directly so I could utilize my Prime membership and get free shipping.</li>
            <li> My daughter is biracial and has very tight curls, her hair doubles in length when its wet.  I am amazed how well this works for us.  I take the &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; and really work it into her hair and scalp and it&#x27;s like magic, I can run my fingers through her hair.  I follow it up with the conditioner and the gel and her hair has less frizz and the curls are defined.  It&#x27;s important to use the products as directed to see the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting used to shampooing with no suds.... I was doing the no-poo challenge but was having difficulty with my hair being incredibly greasy after just a few hours. This really seems to do the trick! Just be thorough rinsing it out from you hair, since without suds it&#x27;s difficult to tell when it&#x27;s fully rinsed out. A friend of mine with curly hair also uses it and we&#x27;ve both noticed less frizz.</li>
            <li> The no poo from Deva curl that I buy from DevaCurl doesn&#x27;t have parabens.  Other ingredients listed on thus label are different as well.  I would be skeptical about this curly ladies and gents.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell, but this shampoo does seem to clean my scalp without drying out my hair.  Doesn&#x27;t seem particularly moisturizing, but it is definitely non-stripping.</li>
            <li> Leaves a nice smell to your hair but does not weigh it down.  Makes curls behave when used with other products in this line.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used.  I have really curly hair and everything else left my hair frizzy and dry looking.  As there is no lather, this shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip the natural oils out of your hair (which curly hair has little of to start with).  It&#x27;s a bit odd at first to wash without seeing a lather and your brain wants to say \\&quot;no lather/foam &#x3D; not clean\\&quot; but it really does get your hair clean without the lather.  I use the No Poo and the Deva Curl One Conditioner.  I also chose to use the DevaCare Arc AnGell Extra Hold Conditioning Gel as it seemed my hair needed a little more hold than the regular gel provided.  The gel holds my curl without getting stiff and crunchy.  My hair has never looked or felt better than it does with these products.</li>
            <li> Works well on my wavy, not terribly curly hair.  I tried the Lo-Poo but find No-Poo give me more curl.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell but I have to admit that I love this stuff. I have wavy, corse frizzy hair and this makes it very soft especially the second day. The smell dissipates after a while. Now to find it in a bigger bottle since my hair is so thick I use quite a bit.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;* I LOVE this cleanser because it seems to clean AND moisturize without weighing my hair down or making it look super greasy - I&#x27;ve literally never used a product that manages to accomplish all of these things. (I have 2B/C waves - fine hair, a tendency toward both frizziness and greasiness) In short, this product makes my hair look absolutely fantastic.  Curly, tame, and not heavy or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;* The smell is hideous and strong.  Smells like a chemistry project.&lt;br /&gt;*  Build-up!  I do not use any styling products at all and only rarely use the One Condition (the No-Poo conditions enough for my hair) so it&#x27;s not coming from anywhere but the shampoo!  I&#x27;ve never used a project that creates this much build-up.&lt;br /&gt;* Pricey!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have no idea when this happened but it appears the formula changed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DevaCurl website shows the ingredients list as follows:&lt;br /&gt;Water (Aqua, Eau), Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Isopropyl Palmitate, Behentrimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-7, Laureth-4, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Propylene Glycol, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Triticum Aestivum (Wheat) Peptide, Avena Sativa (Oat) Peptide, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Peptide, Melissa Officinalis Extract, Humulus Lupulus (Hops) Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Menthol, Citric Acid, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Fragrance (Parfum)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this product page shows the ingredients list as:&lt;br /&gt;Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow) Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Cymbopogan Schoenanthus Extract, Humulus Lupulas (Hops) Extract, Melissa Officinalis (Lemon Balm) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Flower Extract, Isopropyl Palmitate, Cetyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Laureth 4, Grapeseed Oil, Peppermint (Leaf) Oil, Propylene Glycol, WheatAmino Acid, Soy Amino Acid, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methyl Paraben, Propyl Paraben, Menthol, Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it was still made with the older recipe because it is a much more artificial product now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might go back to my old routine.&lt;br /&gt;Acure Organics Lemongrass + Argan Stem Cell Shampoo - moisturizing AND clarifying, smells divine and is a high quality natural product&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful Curls Curl Enhancing Shea Butter Leave-in - it&#x27;s natural and smells like an absolute dream but requires a daily wash.</li>
            <li> I have really fine curly/wavy hair and the shampoo just weighed it down so much it looked greasy and weird.  I tried to use without the conditioner and it still left me with flat wavy weird hair.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fantastic for someone with much thicker hair, but it just didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I mainly use it, but once a week I use the Low Poo. They&#x27;re a great combination</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo, my hair does not get weighed down, and boy does it curl!&lt;br /&gt;great if you have a perm and want curls not frizz</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. Amazing how my hair looks. I have blonde straight medium length hair. It looks softer and very shiny. I will never buy another drug store brand.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a nice scent but it does not create suds which I knew ahead of time.  Has an odd feel to it when shampooing the hair, since there are no suds and it makes me wonder if my hair is really getting clean.  Certainly different.</li>
            <li> My hair is definitely more moisturized, even without using the conditioner. I have been using the Deva Curl Angel Light Hold Defining Gel and the two together work well. I think my next purchase is the diffuser to set the curls.</li>
            <li> I was so impressed by reviews I read about this brand that I ordered the whole line.  The only product that works well is the one condition conditioner.  I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Gentle on my hair but I need to use way more because it does not lather &amp; I have really long hair. Need 2 to 1 (shampoo vs conditioner) (i mean, no-poo).</li>
            <li> I used to have the frizziest hair, EVA! I had no idea that it was my shampoo drying out my hair! Now that I stopped shampooing and started using No Poo, my hair is no longer frizzy! I have even thrown away all of my de-frizz products (of which I had plenty!!)...</li>
            <li> This shampoo did wonders for my naturally dry, coarse, curly/wavy hair! I tried the no-poo baking soda/vinegar method for about four months, and finally getting fed up with the dandruff issues, I tried this. No more dandruff and my scalp and hair feel so clean and soft! I highly recommend this for anyone struggling with the no-poo thing. I now use this with the DevaCurl One Condition, and I&#x27;m never going back!</li>
            <li> I can use this everyday and it doesn&#x27;t strip my hair. My fine hair comes out with added body and no frizz.  Love this shampoo! It only takes a small amount, so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have grown accustom and love Deva Curls products, only con I have with the No Poo is that it is a cleanser and not a shampoo which I am accustom to. This means that there is no lather in washing hair, it is like rubbing cream for shampoo in your hair. This is my personal opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I love that the product tingles a lovely minty or citrus feeling and scent when rubbed into scalp, feels refreshing.</li>
            <li> Finally my curly hair isn&#x27;t stripped of all its moisture!  I absolutely love this product and does a great job for curly frizzy hair.  The lack of lather was concerning to me first because I&#x27;m so used to it but it left my hair cleaner than any other shampoo.  I really recommend this and I find myself having to use less product after showering to revive my curls.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and this shampoo works wonders.  It leaves my hair extra curly without the extra gel/mouse products.  I also notice that when I use it my hair doesn&#x27;t get frizzy.</li>
            <li> Love this product. and the price was great.  works great with deva conditoner</li>
            <li> No shampoo, bar none, smells as womderful. A joy to wash my hair. Great for dry curly hair.</li>
            <li> To keep my hair from frizzing, I leave conditioner in. This I can&#x27;t leave in, so I sent it back. I prefer the separate shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of good reviews of Deva No Poo. Wish more of them had mentioned the scent.  It smells (to me) like I&#x27;m washing my hair with cold cream. Ick.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, scent is a very subjective experience, and your mileage may vary.  But I personally can&#x27;t take the stuff.  I&#x27;m going back to using Jessicurl Hair Cleansing Creme, which smells FABULOUS (to me), but admittedly isn&#x27;t available on Amazon Prime.&lt;br /&gt;As for how this worked, it cleaned well without stripping.  My hair dried all FRIZZY, but I can&#x27;t very well blame that on the No Poo after just one use (frizz happens).</li>
            <li> Very odd that it doesn&#x27;t lather, but still cleaned my hair fantastically - and smells great!  I wanted it to be the last product that touched my hair because of it&#x27;s smell, but was happy that the other DevaCurl products smell equally as great - thank you DevaCurl!</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo, I wish that it didn&#x27;t smell like roses and chamomile but that is not enough to deter me from using it. It&#x27;s by far the best product I&#x27;ve ever put on my hair, way better than Wen!</li>
            <li> i absolutely love it, makes my hair feels real clean, need only small amount, not for people who think they need a lot of lather to get their hair clean</li>
            <li> Love Deva curl. Works great</li>
            <li> This is no better than VO5 Kiwi Lime Conditioner (a product I found out about from a beauty review website).  It&#x27;s simple not worth the money.  Yes, it keeps color from fading (just like VO5) and yes, it smells nice (just like VO5) but it&#x27;s expensive so why spend the money when something that&#x27;s ten times less expensive works just as well or better.  Phooey!  I&#x27;ll use up the bottle because I paid for it, but I won&#x27;t be fooled into buying another one.  I purchased 3 Deva Curl products from my stylist who insisted that all three would work together to produce awesome results.  Well, Set It Free did not control the frizz (Got2be Shine Serum works like a charm) and the Arc Angel gel didn&#x27;t hold my style (TIGI Catwalk Strong Mousse works great and isn&#x27;t crunchy at all).  All in all, I&#x27;m sorry I wasted the money and all three bottles are gathering dust in my hall closet.  Maybe someone with curly hair will come into my life and I can pawn them off on her.  What a shame!  I don&#x27;t have any idea why this line has so many good reviews.  It did absolutely nothing and I&#x27;m all the poorer for it.  I definitely don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> first time my daughter&#x27;s hair had shine</li>
            <li> My hairdresser got me a sample pack and urged me to try it. I was determined to hate the stuff - I thought I needed suds - and had to eat crow when I determined that I LOVE this stiff. I have naturally wavy/curly hair but never before could I make a daily style work - my curl was unreliable and could get frizzy. That all changed and after using the product for 4 months, I know I can never go back. Not only is my curl amazing now, I do not have to wash my hair every day like before. I can feel perfectly confident with the cleanliness of my har on day two. To top it off, I was experiencing acne style bumps in my hairline around my face which have all disappeared. I talked to an estetician and her explanation was that since my scalp and skin around the hairline were not being stripped of natural oils, they were not working overtime to replace the necessary oils which in turn let my skin settle down. I highly recommend this to anyone curly hair or not. I can&#x27;t believe the compliments I get on my curls. My hairdresser even gets inquiries about getting a \\&quot;perm\\&quot; like mine. She replies that if she could perm like that, she would be a rich woman. Thank you Deva Curl and thank you to my hairdresser for forcing me to give it a try.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t lather which is perfect.  it keeps my hair clean and not dry. so far so good.  love it!  item still hasn&#x27;t arrived after contacting the seller regarding the issue.  now, i just want a refund.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try the &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; method of washing my hair, but this didn&#x27;t work for me. It might work for other people, but this left my hair unclean and greasy. I think that your hair has to get used to these kinds of products over time. It does have a nice smell though that isn&#x27;t too overpowering.</li>
            <li> Have been using product for several years.</li>
            <li> Only used it once so far, but my curls are bouncy and shiny.  Also used their conditioner and foam.  Normally when I wake up in the mornings my hair is a frizzy mess. slept three nights in a row and my curls are still there happy and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love love love this stuff.</li>
            <li> The best and only shampoo for curly hair!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product.  Gentle on my hair.  Follow with Conditioner from Deva Curl. No more frizzies.</li>
            <li> I bought this one and the deva girl set it free. Best combo out there. It leaves hair curly and untangled for the entire day. I go to school and my hair is exposed to all sorts of weather every day and yet my hair is soft and untangled! I do use a GENEROUS amount of the shampoo on my hair. It does not create foam which one has to get used to.</li>
            <li> This tames my nappy curls-its the only thing that works for me.</li>
            <li> sadly it has wheat amino acids and I have celiac....more than allergic.  Love this product but can&#x27;t use it sadly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not gluten free and irritated the heck out of my scalp...RETURNING:/</li>
            <li> Satisfied with this product. It left my hair smelling fresh and clean and left my hair managable for it being so curly</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this no sulfate shampoo for my curly hair and I use it daily.  Buying it online saves me money from the salon price.</li>
            <li> I can tell that this shampoo is detangling and moisturizing my hair when I use it. It doesn&#x27;t smell great, but it does have a bit of a tingle on my scalp which makes me think it&#x27;s cleaning my scalp since there are no suds.</li>
            <li> Best non-stripping shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.  Wish it was a little cheaper but I guess you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> I know people always rave about DevaCurl, and I&#x27;m here to tell you there&#x27;s good reason. Honestly, it&#x27;s worth the money. My curls are healthy, happy, and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised how quickly the product came, but was disappointed to see the top broken in off of the Deva Curl No Poo...I&#x27;m sure the vendor didn&#x27;t send it off like that and it became broken in the process of delivery.  Overall, I would say the product is good so far.  I need another month or so to truly evaluate the results of this product.</li>
            <li> I think it controls the frizz but sometimes I just use a regular shampoo to feel totally clean.  I would be happier if it had no scent.</li>
            <li> I have very fine and very dry curly hair, and shampoo is too harsh for me so I tried this product and it worked perfect. It cleaned my hair nicely. I highly recommend it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I really love this product! I had only just heard about it and never tried it before until i purchased it on Amazon. it has exceeding my expectations! my hair looks and feels more purely healthy than i ever thought it could! I had to buy the conditioner too! I would not recommend using one or the other. use them together and your hair results will be better than you can even imagine! shipping was prompt and without incident.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and great product.</li>
            <li> this is a must have along with the one condition product. it smells wonderful and you don&#x27;t need very much to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I like that I can order online.  This shampoo does wonders for my hair without taking the curls away.  Hurrah!</li>
            <li> Great for dry curly swimmers hair. Wonderful scent, leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I love what the Deva Curl line is doing for my hair. I have superfine, loosely curled, over shoulder length hair that can get really dry and frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;Have used Deva Curl for a few weeks now, and after only one week noted that my hair is much shinier, softer, and has beautiful waves. I personally like the smell of the No-Poo....the conditioner, I am not such a fan of though. The No Poo leaves my scalp and hair clean, even though using a cleanser that doesn&#x27;t lather took some getting used to! I wholeheartedly recommend this product, but make sure you only use products that are compatible- I don&#x27;t think the No Poo can remove silicone based products.</li>
            <li> This shampoo (or no-poo) does work. It makes my hair frizz-free, and enhances the natural wave that I have. However, the smell is AWFUL! It actually reminds me of the smell of perm solution -- it&#x27;s very strong and chemical-like (the conditioner smells only slightly better -- like the soap in the car wash). For me, the scent of a product is equally important as whether or not it can get the job done. If you can get past the smell, it is a good product. But, I will be shopping for another sulfate-free shampoo product.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT I HAVE FOUND A PRODUCT TO CALM MY CURLY HAIR, IT IS ALSO GOOD FOR MY HAIR AS WELL.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair that has a lot of curl in the back and I&#x27;ve never been able to control the frizz until I discovered DevaCurl No-Poo and the Conditioner. I only wash my hair twice a week and I get tons of compliments! If you can get over using shampoo that is creamy and has no suds, you&#x27;ll end up loving this product. I hair no longer feels dry. Go DevaCurl!!!</li>
            <li> I really cannot say enough good things about this product. After years of battling my frizzy, dry curls, I had all but given up wearing my hair in anything other than a ponytail on a day-to-day basis. I saw amazing results after the first time I used this product-- my hair is soft and shiny and my bouncy curls look like I just stepped out of the salon, even after letting them air dry! Cannot recommend this enough to anyone who has given up on their curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 2 years now, and just recently decided to try something different.  It has convinced me beyond a doubt, that this is the best product for my hair.  It leaves it clean, soft and super curly.  I will never stray from it again.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure that this would actually work to get my hair clean and must admit that sometimes I still feel like I need a real shampoo. But on the whole this has been great for my curly, thin, and dyed hair.  Very gentle</li>
            <li> I threw this away, as my daughter had the same product.  It left her hair stringy and oily so I did not bother to use it.  I also did not return it as shipping it back would almost equal the cost of the product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for dryer hair. I have colored, blond, wavy hair and live in Southern California. This shampoo soothes the scalp, reduces frizz, smells fantastic yet natural and has no nasty parabens or sulfates. IT DOES NOT LATHER AS INTENDED. Shampoos lather as chemicals are added to do just that...they just fool you into results.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with my results. Will buy again. It didn&#x27;t make my hair feel dry. It was very soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used over literally hundreds of different hair products. Deva curl no-poo is one of the few I have yet to change out of my rotation of different products. This is the only product so far that has kept my curls looking natural and full of life - as they should. My hair is always super soft, shiny and feels silky, just from this- Not even with the conditioner yet. Highly recommended to all curly hair types.</li>
            <li> I got hooked on the DevaCurl line after my stylist recommended and used them on me.  I have fine, very curly hair that hates me and the rest of the world.  This is the only stuff that makes me look like a normal person.  The No-Poo was a little strange the first couple of times since it doesn&#x27;t produce suds, but I adjusted quickly, and my hair is definitely not dirty.  The lavender smell is divine.  The price I got on Amazon beats anything local (I can&#x27;t afford shopping local principles right now) and even in Alaska I received it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought the No Poo, DevaCare One condition and the DevaCurl Deva Care Arc Angell. This line of product definitely makes my curls look gorgeous! They&#x27;re more defined and my husband constantly tells me it looks sexy haha I get compliments from people often! My only gripe is that I believed all frizz would be eliminated but I still have quite a bit of frizz. I use the right type of dryer too (which I don&#x27;t use every single time). I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve only been using this stuff for 2 1/2 weeks and I know it takes up to 6 weeks to see a total transformation. I&#x27;m a fan of the shampoo and gel smell but I do not like the smell of the conditioner. It reminds me of my grandma&#x27;s Dove soap lol  I will continue to purchase these hair products and I&#x27;ll update my review after 6 weeks! :)</li>
            <li> Great hair cleanser. A staple product for any curly hair. A little goes a long way. try it out and you will never get shampoo again.</li>
            <li> Does not smell right at all and I have been using this shampoo for years now</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find a better No Poo for your hair...Would definitely recommend this product, and do. Very fresh &amp; clean.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair that is colored. I was using the TV brand but it&#x27;s too expensive.. This shampoo fit the bill. The pirce is good and it didn&#x27;t dry out my hair I aslso can skip conditioner</li>
            <li> This no-poo cleanser makes my curls so soft. It smells really good, and my hair actually feels clean/refreshed after I use it. I tried the baking soda method, but I gave up on it because my hair always felt weird and never clean. With this cleanser, my hair feels clean again and super moisturized.</li>
            <li> Along with the other products, conditioner and light hold, it woks great on my daughters hair, really helps with the frizziness</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for curly hair!  Love the smell and that it doesn&#x27;t have sulfates.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, but it still cleans it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote the above after I had only used this a few times.  I loved it so much at first.  Now, months later, I have stopped using it, and my hair feels better now that I&#x27;ve gotten all the no poo out.  It builds up in my fine curly hair, and makes it feel awful.  I have a friend who has similar hair, and she had the same issue with build up.</li>
            <li> Worked great on conditioning his hair!</li>
            <li> So I am a Caucasian female with fine sometimes-wavy/mostly straight hair but was looking for a &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; shampoo to avoid sulfates and other nasty chemicals. I really like this product and it leaves my hair feeling soft and clean! I&#x27;d recommend it. The smell is ok, not the best. Reminds me of cold cream.</li>
            <li> Good product for my curly hair. Gives me extra day without drying curls with shampoo. Liked the look, soft curls.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is decent but I wouldn&#x27;t staple it just yet. It does clean and lather well, but I&#x27;m still hunting for the best sulfate free poo for my hair. I could see it being amazing for someone else. To each it&#x27;s own. Eh, okay for me.    Ok, Update:  I recently tried this shampoo again and loved it...stapling. Can&#x27;t remember what I did differently but it cleaned well and didn&#x27;t leave my scalp itchy like sulfate shampoos do.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, frizzy, curly hair that I now get straightened. I decided to try this shampoo because the lady who straightens my hair recommended it. I am glad i did. It leaves my hair shiny and soft and it is helping prolong the life of the Brazilian blowout..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the product.  I like the lo-poo better.</li>
            <li> I love it.  My hair can get a little dry sometimes from blowing drying and color.&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks and feels much too.</li>
            <li> It seems to clean very well and leaves my hair feeling nice and soft. It relaxes some of my curls, but still can&#x27;t tame the frizz. I don&#x27;t really like the smell. Seems a bit matronly.</li>
            <li> It was sort of odd washing my hair with shampoo that doesnt lather. It doesnt feel like your hair is getting clean and it takes much longer to wash the product than regular shampoo. I found that this made my hair feel very greasy. It may have been because I didnt remove all of the product...it did make my hair feel really soft. But the bad out weighed the good here for me. I have very long curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy hair, a cross between curly and wavy, and got this thinking it would define my curls more. My hair is very, very thick though, and though this product did eliminate frizzies, it also weighed my hair down, making it almost flat (but curly, flat curls). It took away the body of my hair. I only used it a few times, then stopped.&lt;br /&gt;Beware if you have heavy, thick hair!</li>
            <li> Great cleaning for my 3A curls.  Makes my scalp feel fresh and clean and no frizz that I get from &#x27;real&#x27; shampoo lather.</li>
            <li> Hate the smell but it does seem to be both effective and gentle.</li>
            <li> Love the clean feel. Has a healthy feel and pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist (who trained with DevaCurl) encouraged me to try this, thinking it&#x27;d help a decade-long struggle with dandruff because maybe it was a result of a reaction to sulfates.  I know it&#x27;s best to avoid sulfates, but because they&#x27;re missing, this doesn&#x27;t lather, and I feel like it&#x27;s hard to tell when I&#x27;ve gotten it thoroughly disbursed through my very curly hair.  I&#x27;ve used Trader Joe&#x27;s sulfate-free shampoo, yet I think it still lathered a bit so it was easier to get through the hair.  Regardless, the No-Poo didn&#x27;t help my dandruff at all, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s made much of a difference in my hair in general.  Disappointing for how expensive it is.</li>
            <li> Love what this does for my fine, wavy hair.  I used to dread shampoo day but this makes it much, much less painful.  And my hair is softer too.  My hair stylist asked why use a shampoo that suds if my face cleanser doesn&#x27;t?  Good point: bubbles &#x3D; drying.  I&#x27;m converted.</li>
            <li> Works great for my hair!! Love the fresh smell</li>
            <li> This product has been great to help the condition of my dry colored hair.  The product arrived quickly and packaged well.  Was just what I expected!</li>
            <li> Great cleanser! I&#x27;ve tried all the conditioning cleansers and this one is by far my favorite.  Wen was okay, but too expensive, and it made my hair fall out after using it too much.  As I Am Coconut Co-Wash is great, too, but it left my hair feeling a little too greasy.  This one is a decent price and leaves my hair looking normal and clean. It smells great, too.</li>
            <li> Not to heavy; keep your curl and body</li>
            <li> Being sulfate-free, this product produces zero lather, which feels really strange at first.  However, this is BY FAR the BEST line of hair products I have ever purchased in my adult life.  I&#x27;ve been through Redken, Mixed Chicks, Miss Jessie&#x27;s, BioSilk, MoroccanOil, Pantene and who knows what else, but I honestly don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever been happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even after the first wash, my curls have more structure, bounce and vitality, and the ends are no longer brittle and dry.  I have less frizz and my head no longer smells like a salon, but like floral/mint/tea tree extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this shampoo in combination with the One Condition Cream conditioner and the Heaven in Hair Moisture Treatment for my current results.</li>
            <li> My hair is less frizzy with this shampoo but the smell is toxic! It makes my hair smell like it has just been dyed at the salon. I had to put my hair up and away from my face because I was getting dizzy.</li>
            <li> For the first couple of weeks of use, this product seemed like a miracle worker on my extremely dry, chemically damaged hair because it is intensely moisturizing and gentle. The scent is fantastic and it leaves my hair feeling so soft and looking great. However, this product doesn&#x27;t clean my scalp properly, causing a buildup that leads to irritating bumps, mild dandruff, and annoying itchiness. I normally don&#x27;t experience any scalp issues, so I would really caution against using this if you already have problems with your scalp. As a no-pooer, I cringe at having to strip my hair with sulfates found in ordinary shampoos, but this sulfate-free product just does not clean your hair whatsoever. It really does feel like you&#x27;re just putting more conditioner on your hair every time you wash (It&#x27;s kind of like if you were to apply moisturizer on your face for days without washing it.. yuck!). But all of the conditioning sans stripping probably explains why it makes your hair look great. I really wanted to love this product because of the all natural ingredients and lack of harmful chemicals but I&#x27;m forced to use a more clarifying shampoo soon after using this to avoid furiously scratching at my head all day. Also, although I only apply this to my scalp, I found myself having to use loads of this product on my medium thickness hair which makes this a bit pricey even for the great deal you get on Amazon. Will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Not Deva, not sure what this is. Returning for refund. Offensive smell</li>
            <li> Having extremely curly hair, I&#x27;ve been advised not to wash and use conditioner like non-curly-haired people. This product smells good and leaves my hair clean without turning it into a dried frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> I was really worried with all the other comments about this product being fake but once I smelt, felt and used it, it was just like the one from the salon. The texture is perfect and not watered down, the smell is minty and I love it!!</li>
            <li> Really cleansed my hair and conditioned it as well.  Smells like lemon cake!  The more I use this the better I like it. I will repurchase this and the One Condition in the larger sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this to my daughter, and her curly friends and mine.  I have used several what I would call luxury products, Curl Junkie, Oyin, Darcy&#x27;s Botanicals, all good.  But for everyday cleansing and moisture I will use Deva Curl.  My hair just styles and behaves better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try the jell when I re-order.</li>
            <li> I had worn my hair curly until my forties, now at 53, I have been trying to straighten my thinning hair and the result was a lot a frizz and a lot of work. A coworker recommended DevaCurl and I am hooked. I have gained back about 30 minutes of my day and I am told my curly style makes me look younger!</li>
            <li> This is not my favorite shampoo but it ranks better than any drugstore or regular store shampoo! It does have things in it that is better on curly hair so I like it!</li>
            <li> great natural product</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this product is that I can detangle my hair while washing it. It&#x27;s like magic.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use shampoo ever again. It has sulfates which strip your hair. This line is wonderful! It has no lather but leaves your hair clean and feeling extra smooth. It&#x27;s meant for curly hair but I have wavy hair and it works fantastic. I absolutely love this stuff. I recommend.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does help to keep my curls more intact and bouncy but not as clean as I would like. Also have to make sure to hydrate my hair with Rosemary oil more frequently because I noticed that after shampoo-ing it does need a little &amp;#34;pick me up&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Good for a quick clean, but is not strong enough to remove chorine, hair spray, etc.</li>
            <li> I am super frugal by nature but I will actually pay extra for this product. love the smell of it.</li>
            <li> I like the product, however - the scent is overwhelming. The shampoo does good things for my curls, but dang, it&#x27;s just so strong that if I wash my hair at night, the perfume in the shampoo keeps me up. I walked into work the next day and people 3 desks away commented on how strong it was. I&#x27;ll have to mix it with other shampoo just to get through the bottle. Unfortunately, I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> It was okay. I bought this because it was recommended by Curly Nikki but I wasn&#x27;t right for my hair.</li>
            <li> Very gentle, and does a great job with my damaged hair--it feels softer, silkier, and looks shinier after a couple weeks of using this product. It doesn&#x27;t dry it out and helps tame frizz as a result. Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> It is a nice shampoo, but I thought it would be especially good for naturally curly hair.  This week I tried using it on one side of my head and Suave ($2 for 12 oz!!) on the other side -- and can&#x27;t really see any difference.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Highly recommended for anyone with curly hair.</li>
            <li> Does nothing for my curls</li>
            <li> Makes my curly-haired 3 year old&#x27;s hair smell and look great! Keeps her curls bouncy and tame.</li>
            <li> I had been using typical drug store brands to where my curly hair was becoming a frizzy mess and not really curly anymore. I had done a lot of research and DevaCurl had a lot of really good reviews, so I picked some up. I wasn&#x27;t impressed after the first few washes - I was wanting something that would have my hair hold out for a few days before washing it - but continued to use it anyway. After about a month my hair was still looking dirty on the second day when I normally only wash my hair every other day, which I continued to do anyway. It was somewhere around the month mark that my hair started falling out in clumps when I rinsed out the shampoo. More would come out when I worked the conditioner through my ends. Few more weeks and this continued, so I threw the rest away. I use Redken Curvaceous now and love it so much more.</li>
            <li> expensive but it does work</li>
            <li> these products are great for my curly hair (I am 69 years old!!!)  wish I had found them sooner.  LOVE having fewer chemicals in my hair.</li>
            <li> It is a nice product for once or twice a week, It tended to weigh it down a bit with daily use, but it does feel great and enviromentally kind...I would have it on hand for sure!</li>
            <li> Works well on my 2b/3c curls.  I feel like it cleans my har well enough but I still use a stronger more clarifying shampoo a couple of times a month.  I like the smell but I can see how some people might find it obnoxious. Wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way my scalp feels after using this. I prefer the Evercurl conditioning shampoo. So I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
