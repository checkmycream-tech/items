    <ol>
            <li>Service on this product was excellent!  </li>
            <li>It works beautifully!!</li>
            <li>it fits perfectly in my suitcase and dries my hair when on the go.  </li>
            <li>she is very happy.</li>
            <li>It does an excellent job of drying hair over event the largest curlers.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Worked great for a year.  </li>
            <li>It works great.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job drying the hair.  </li>
            <li>good thing-</li>
            <li>As an African-American woman who uses hair products to moisturize my hair, this dryer bonnet is good to have.</li>
            <li>The price was exceptional, in the beauty supply store, that wanted $39.00 and $49.00 for a product that would not supply all my requirements.  </li>
            <li>Good product, good price  is ok for trip, working good</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>which was good, but it also wasn&#x27;t very powerful.  </li>
            <li>I like the storage for the cord and bonnet and it is quite powerful with good airflow.</li>
            <li>So its ok for the money.</li>
            <li>For years she has used ConAire dryers and had been relatively satisfied with them.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to fully use it not even ONCE before it broke.</li>
            <li>And you will also be asked to make a check for $15 for return shipping, \\&quot;handling\\&quot; and \\&quot;insurance\\&quot; -- this on top of the $40</li>
            <li>For me, this dryer has been fantastic!</li>
            <li>We had a 400 watt dryer which we were satisfied with, but had to buy the 800 watt unit because we couldn&#x27;t buy a replacement bonnet for the 400 watt bonnet</li>
            <li>Even on the highest setting, it can&#x27;t fully inflate the bonnet, even after I made sure the plastic wasn&#x27;t sticking to itself.  </li>
            <li>I did not use the dryer again for many months and when I turned it on it did not work at all.</li>
            <li>It works OK though.</li>
            <li>You will not be able to hear the tv while you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I bet that if I still had it, I could plug it in and it would work much better than this model.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used packing tape to re-attach bonnet to plastic hose receiver and used a silver pen to color over the settings so they&#x27;re more visible.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for the bonnet on it either; the bonnet has too many holes in it and the air doesn&#x27;t circulate well inside the bonnet .  </li>
            <li>Works very well and a great size</li>
            <li>This looked like a good hairdryer when I unpacked it, but the hose will not stay attached to the bonnet and if you hold it by hand, the hot air never gets to the front and top of the bonnet.  </li>
            <li>Can anyone produce anything efficient, intelligently designed, and of decent quality that lasts anymore?</li>
            <li>It worked fine but blow dryers were more efficient.  </li>
            <li>So--manufacturers out there, if you&#x27;re reading--there&#x27;s obviously a huge void to be filled here!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li>problem with both models -  the hose easily becomes detached from the bonnet while in the process of drying.</li>
            <li>This dryer is compact and easily portable.  </li>
            <li>It is light weight - easy to store and easy to travel with -</li>
            <li>Plus they&#x27;re so cheap that if you do get a bum unit, you can afford to replace it easily.</li>
            <li>But even before this happened it was always a struggle to fit the hose in and it always fell out easily.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased and when this one gives out, will purchase another one and will highly recommend to others.</li>
            <li>and I selected this one because it was more powerful.</li>
            <li>Plus they&#x27;re so cheap that if you do get a bum unit, you can afford to replace it easily.e.</li>
            <li>but I am happy with low.</li>
            <li>It worked Ok in the first 5 uses and the it just fell apart till it died.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve wound up using it on the cool setting.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipment.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it not fully inflating (even with my \\&quot;super glued\\&quot; holes).  </li>
            <li>I love it: highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I also find that it is very hot</li>
            <li>Even on medium it gets very hot.  </li>
            <li>Even the \\&quot;Low\\&quot; setting is very hot.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so very NOISY!!  </li>
            <li>This dryer is great, It is a little noisy but that I dont mind.</li>
            <li>But the model she prefers isn&#x27;t available any more, and a similar unit has proved to be mechanically unreliable.    </li>
            <li>Better to spend the money and buy professional.  </li>
            <li>the bonnet really is a nice big one.</li>
            <li>The unit is ok (after 3 uses) but the bonnet is so cheap that the plastic connector pulled away from the bonnet on the second use.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy with this hair dryer and therefore expected the same results from a newer hot tools hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
            <li>and it melted, because it started to emit a chemical smell right before the plastic ring fell out of the bonnet.  </li>
            <li>so far nothing I see is really any better.</li>
            <li>In general, I&#x27;ve been really happy with the performance of the old ones, but I figured getting one new could only be better.  </li>
            <li>The dryer worked great the two times I used it ( the ionic part was terrific - dried my hair very quickly) and then it broke.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this dryer is HOT.</li>
            <li>So HOT that children shouldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>but it does gets really hot.</li>
            <li>She wishes there were an intermediate temperature setting, but overall is pleased with the amount of drying air the machine provides.  </li>
            <li>It also leaks hot air where the hose attaches to unit.  </li>
            <li>If it gets to hot for my head</li>
            <li>This hair dryer was exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>I would not recommend anybody to purchase this item, but if you do, please  use it regularly (to make sure it&#x27;s going to keep working) before the 30 day return period has lapsed.</li>
            <li>but I too hot</li>
            <li>I only use this one when I travel and absolutely love the convenience and practicality...</li>
            <li>The dryer on hot gets way too hot.  </li>
            <li>and when it is on hot, it is hot</li>
            <li>The Hot Tools hair dryer works wonders.</li>
            <li>I have owned a hot tools hair dryer -  model 30001 -  but could no longer use it because the bonnet attachment to the hose broke.  </li>
            <li>-  the thermostat setting is too too hot..  </li>
            <li>It gets really hot which at first</li>
            <li>I thought was a plus but the dryer than got so hot that the plastic started to melt.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money for a reputable manufacturer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if my unit is &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s by Hot Tools and looks almost identical.</li>
            <li>And the results are mediocre at best.</li>
            <li>There is a positive, the bonnet is much better than one from a prior Hot Tools purchase.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think it heated my whole head, but it does.</li>
            <li>I wanted one that had more than 3 levels - on-off-heat, I wanted on-off-low-high, this works better for me since I have long hair and have to stay under the dryer for long period of time.  </li>
            <li>The Hot Tools Prof. 800 Watt Ionic Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer is too hot on high and too cool on</li>
            <li>This may not be the dryer for people who set their hair with large rollers as this fits snug against my head with just twists.</li>
            <li>The hose is pretty long and easily stores inside the unit, along with the bonnet.</li>
            <li>But other than that small limitation, this has been the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>Those things are workhorses, and they come with really neat \\&quot;hatbox\\&quot; type cases for storage.  </li>
            <li>Those things are workhorses, and they come with really neat \\&quot;hatbox\\&quot; type cases for storage.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not as powerful as the old bonnet dryers I remember from my youth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very portable and convenient.  </li>
            <li>I would really like the hose to be longer.  </li>
            <li>The dryer does get very but with 4 heist settings I keep lower it after 10-15 minutes then every five.</li>
            <li>The heat helps products to penetrate deeply, gets hot quickly and to put it away is a dream - everything has its place within the dryer itself; no concerns about misplacing a piece somewhere.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>I think they better evaluate their quality if they want to sell other products.</li>
            <li>In fact, her original one finally wore out and she wanted another one.</li>
            <li>My hair is quite long but fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In addition to this the new dryer is very nosy - almost has a whistle to it.  </li>
            <li>If they make one with a decent bonnet, I&#x27;m there</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly like it, but since I purchased it, I will use it for awhile.</li>
            <li>highly recommend finding a vintage bonnet dryer in a thrift store or on Ebay.</li>
            <li>the dryer is neither particularly quiet nor powerful.</li>
            <li>It does dry well under the medium setting but gets too hot under the higher setting.  </li>
            <li>Then I just fiddle with the hose to get it to fit and try to sit extremely still so it doesn&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li>and I have resisted getting a new dryer.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it there was an unusual odor, but I thought it was because the bonnet was new and was giving off a strange plastic smell.</li>
            <li>Bought this as my old hair dryer dried my hair in more ways than one.</li>
            <li>I just turn it to cool for 5 mins then back to low or high.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t anyone make a reliable, hot, and quiet soft-bonnet dryer these days?</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t  believe I will try a Hot Tools product again the future.</li>
            <li>This is my third Hot Tools bonnet dryer in 25 years.</li>
            <li>This dryer gets very hot on the middle setting but doesn&#x27;t dry very well.</li>
            <li>- Despite the fact that I overall don&#x27;t care for this unit, there are some positive things about it.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty fast and have only had to use it on low heat.</li>
            <li>With the exception of the hose being a little short - this is a great little hair dryer that has 4 temps.  </li>
            <li>Too bad as the dryer is very good and compact.  </li>
            <li>I bought this dryer as a temporary dryer until I can afford to mount a professional dryer from the ceiling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s LOUD and the hose does keep falling out.</li>
            <li>I found this hair dryer to be loud.</li>
            <li>got this for my mom, her old hair dryer stopped.</li>
            <li>I could kick myself for throwing away my old bonnet hair dryer twenty years ago.  </li>
            <li>I like the Hot Tools so much that I ended up replacing the broken string and \\&quot;super gluing\\</li>
            <li>The power cord is long enough, and the hose connecting the unit with the bonnet is adequate in length and durability.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought several old ones for around $6-$8 over the past several years, and have ended up giving some away to friends who liked them, and using others until they died.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s now able to dry her hair in about two hours as opposed to the four it took with previous machines.    </li>
            <li>I agree that the dryer gets really hot on the \\&quot;High\\&quot; setting but, the Low setting is totally tolerable.  </li>
            <li>High heat would work faster obviously</li>
            <li>I am currently searching for a new soft bonnet dryer and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a new dryer with a soft bonnet after my last Vidal Sasson dryer broke.  </li>
            <li>the job done&amp;#34; by starting on the middle setting as long as I can stand it and then switching to the cool setting  and then manually pulling  the bonnet to a peak over my curlers.  </li>
            <li>I cannot use it at all on high  setting and barely on the middle setting -  </li>
            <li>It is very, very noisy and limits where in the house I can use the hair dryer so as not to interrupt other family member activities.</li>
            <li>I brought this and it dry my hair fast</li>
            <li>short - I am not happy with the new dryer - do you have another model with more heat settings?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, the dryer is not very tall, but has a really large footprint.</li>
            <li>It worked fine the first time, but the smell was almost suffocating.</li>
            <li>The portable hairdryer works wonderfully; however, the bonnet is not very sturdy and has already started coming apart where the hose attaches to the bonnet (disappointed with bonnet durability).</li>
            <li>The bonnet is very flimsy and doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li>You also need to be careful to not pull the whole thing onto the floor.  </li>
            <li>old dryer is no longer being manufactured and this was the only alternative I could find.</li>
            <li>The hear produced is higher than any she&#x27;s previously used.  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer has four settings - Off, Low (no heat), Scorch and Torch, a most disappointing purchase from Hot Tools.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply not long enough unless you&#x27;re sitting up aginst the unit and not moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> and it melted, because it started to emit a chemical smell right before the plastic ring fell out of the bonnet.  </li>
            <li> so far nothing I see is really any better.</li>
            <li> In general, I&#x27;ve been really happy with the performance of the old ones, but I figured getting one new could only be better.  </li>
            <li> The dryer worked great the two times I used it ( the ionic part was terrific - dried my hair very quickly) and then it broke.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this dryer is HOT.</li>
            <li> So HOT that children shouldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> but it does gets really hot.</li>
            <li> She wishes there were an intermediate temperature setting, but overall is pleased with the amount of drying air the machine provides.  </li>
            <li> It also leaks hot air where the hose attaches to unit.  </li>
            <li> If it gets to hot for my head</li>
            <li> This hair dryer was exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I would not recommend anybody to purchase this item, but if you do, please  use it regularly (to make sure it&#x27;s going to keep working) before the 30 day return period has lapsed.</li>
            <li> but I too hot</li>
            <li> I only use this one when I travel and absolutely love the convenience and practicality...</li>
            <li> The dryer on hot gets way too hot.  </li>
            <li> and when it is on hot, it is hot</li>
            <li> The Hot Tools hair dryer works wonders.</li>
            <li> I have owned a hot tools hair dryer -  model 30001 -  but could no longer use it because the bonnet attachment to the hose broke.  </li>
            <li> -  the thermostat setting is too too hot..  </li>
            <li> It gets really hot which at first</li>
            <li> I thought was a plus but the dryer than got so hot that the plastic started to melt.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money for a reputable manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my unit is &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s by Hot Tools and looks almost identical.</li>
            <li> And the results are mediocre at best.</li>
            <li> There is a positive, the bonnet is much better than one from a prior Hot Tools purchase.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think it heated my whole head, but it does.</li>
            <li> I wanted one that had more than 3 levels - on-off-heat, I wanted on-off-low-high, this works better for me since I have long hair and have to stay under the dryer for long period of time.  </li>
            <li> The Hot Tools Prof. 800 Watt Ionic Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer is too hot on high and too cool on</li>
            <li> This may not be the dryer for people who set their hair with large rollers as this fits snug against my head with just twists.</li>
            <li> The hose is pretty long and easily stores inside the unit, along with the bonnet.</li>
            <li> But other than that small limitation, this has been the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> Those things are workhorses, and they come with really neat \\&quot;hatbox\\&quot; type cases for storage.  </li>
            <li> Those things are workhorses, and they come with really neat \\&quot;hatbox\\&quot; type cases for storage.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not as powerful as the old bonnet dryers I remember from my youth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very portable and convenient.  </li>
            <li> I would really like the hose to be longer.  </li>
            <li> The dryer does get very but with 4 heist settings I keep lower it after 10-15 minutes then every five.</li>
            <li> The heat helps products to penetrate deeply, gets hot quickly and to put it away is a dream - everything has its place within the dryer itself; no concerns about misplacing a piece somewhere.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> I think they better evaluate their quality if they want to sell other products.</li>
            <li> In fact, her original one finally wore out and she wanted another one.</li>
            <li> My hair is quite long but fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In addition to this the new dryer is very nosy - almost has a whistle to it.  </li>
            <li> If they make one with a decent bonnet, I&#x27;m there</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like it, but since I purchased it, I will use it for awhile.</li>
            <li> highly recommend finding a vintage bonnet dryer in a thrift store or on Ebay.</li>
            <li> the dryer is neither particularly quiet nor powerful.</li>
            <li> It does dry well under the medium setting but gets too hot under the higher setting.  </li>
            <li> Then I just fiddle with the hose to get it to fit and try to sit extremely still so it doesn&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li> and I have resisted getting a new dryer.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it there was an unusual odor, but I thought it was because the bonnet was new and was giving off a strange plastic smell.</li>
            <li> Bought this as my old hair dryer dried my hair in more ways than one.</li>
            <li> I just turn it to cool for 5 mins then back to low or high.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t anyone make a reliable, hot, and quiet soft-bonnet dryer these days?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t  believe I will try a Hot Tools product again the future.</li>
            <li> This is my third Hot Tools bonnet dryer in 25 years.</li>
            <li> This dryer gets very hot on the middle setting but doesn&#x27;t dry very well.</li>
            <li> - Despite the fact that I overall don&#x27;t care for this unit, there are some positive things about it.  </li>
            <li> Works pretty fast and have only had to use it on low heat.</li>
            <li> With the exception of the hose being a little short - this is a great little hair dryer that has 4 temps.  </li>
            <li> Too bad as the dryer is very good and compact.  </li>
            <li> I bought this dryer as a temporary dryer until I can afford to mount a professional dryer from the ceiling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s LOUD and the hose does keep falling out.</li>
            <li> I found this hair dryer to be loud.</li>
            <li> got this for my mom, her old hair dryer stopped.</li>
            <li> I could kick myself for throwing away my old bonnet hair dryer twenty years ago.  </li>
            <li> I like the Hot Tools so much that I ended up replacing the broken string and \\&quot;super gluing\\</li>
            <li> The power cord is long enough, and the hose connecting the unit with the bonnet is adequate in length and durability.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several old ones for around $6-$8 over the past several years, and have ended up giving some away to friends who liked them, and using others until they died.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s now able to dry her hair in about two hours as opposed to the four it took with previous machines.    </li>
            <li> I agree that the dryer gets really hot on the \\&quot;High\\&quot; setting but, the Low setting is totally tolerable.  </li>
            <li> High heat would work faster obviously</li>
            <li> I am currently searching for a new soft bonnet dryer and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a new dryer with a soft bonnet after my last Vidal Sasson dryer broke.  </li>
            <li> the job done&amp;#34; by starting on the middle setting as long as I can stand it and then switching to the cool setting  and then manually pulling  the bonnet to a peak over my curlers.  </li>
            <li> I cannot use it at all on high  setting and barely on the middle setting -  </li>
            <li> It is very, very noisy and limits where in the house I can use the hair dryer so as not to interrupt other family member activities.</li>
            <li> I brought this and it dry my hair fast</li>
            <li> short - I am not happy with the new dryer - do you have another model with more heat settings?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the dryer is not very tall, but has a really large footprint.</li>
            <li> It worked fine the first time, but the smell was almost suffocating.</li>
            <li> The portable hairdryer works wonderfully; however, the bonnet is not very sturdy and has already started coming apart where the hose attaches to the bonnet (disappointed with bonnet durability).</li>
            <li> The bonnet is very flimsy and doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> You also need to be careful to not pull the whole thing onto the floor.  </li>
            <li> old dryer is no longer being manufactured and this was the only alternative I could find.</li>
            <li> The hear produced is higher than any she&#x27;s previously used.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer has four settings - Off, Low (no heat), Scorch and Torch, a most disappointing purchase from Hot Tools.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply not long enough unless you&#x27;re sitting up aginst the unit and not moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this dryer, since my previous experiences with bonnet dryers were with ones from the 1960s and 70s that I found used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried rearranging it, and finally have found that the only way to dry my hair on all sides is to rotate the bonnet regularly, defeating any \\&quot;convenience\\</li>
            <li> The dryer sounds like a small  airplane with a very noisy engine.</li>
            <li> The plastic is just flat against it.</li>
            <li> The settings are on a black dial with tiny raised letters that I can barely see; and the dial is on the opposite end of the unit from where the hose comes out; so I have to pick it up and turn it on</li>
            <li> I want my hair to dry as quickly as possible.  </li>
            <li> The low setting while cooler doesn&#x27;t dry your hair.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t want to try to use it if I were actually trying to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> With a conventional standing dryer, the back of my head does not dry evenly with the rest of the hair, but this bonnet gives me all around coverage, drying my hair in 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> She refuses to use the hard-bonnet type of hair dryer, and her hair takes so long to dry that hand-held dryers are out of the question.    </li>
            <li> Then the bonnet stretched so that the hose would not say in.  </li>
            <li> True, it&#x27;s quieter than a regular hair dryer, but the air output is absolutely lousy.  </li>
            <li> I had to turn it down repeatedly to the cooler setting, then when it lost the heat, turn the control back up to the low setting.</li>
            <li> respect the opinion of the other person who wrote a review, but I have to differ on several points--</li>
            <li> Heat distributes evenly and my shoulder length relaxed hair is dry in 50 minutes.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t get my hair completely dry.  </li>
            <li> I also find the style convenient; when I want to relax and dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Also, the unit kicks out a decent amount of heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - Weak airflow and short tube.</li>
            <li> Not worth $40 total.</li>
            <li> So, I came on Amazon looking to replace this disappointing piece of garbage; but it appears that there aren&#x27;t any other brands that deliver satisfying results either.</li>
            <li> the front of the bonnet hardly gets any hot air; so there is an uneven distribution of heat.</li>
            <li> Before I know it, my hair is dry!</li>
            <li> I wrote a terrible review for this after my first use but now I&#x27;m feeling better about it.</li>
            <li> The product is under a 1 yr limited warranty, however if you choose to return it to the manufacturer for repair it will cost you money to ship to the repair center.</li>
            <li> I had trouble getting the bonnet to attach to the hose, but finally got it one there after 10 minutes of struggling.  </li>
            <li> + you&#x27;ve probably already spent on it.     </li>
            <li> If you are standing up doing your makeup you have to be really careful to not pull the hose out of the bonnet.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only loud but irritating with its raspy whine.  </li>
            <li> This dryer also makes loud straining noises, which I am hoping doesn&#x27;t mean the motor is about to quit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i would certainly not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> if you use the regular level take a long,  I prefer to used mu hard hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I  thought the exessive heat would make your hair  dry in half the time</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t dry after I sit under it for a half hour.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> other point</li>
            <li> I am not sure what my next step is going to be, but I cannot recommend   this product.</li>
            <li> It is really loud, does not blow very hard.</li>
            <li> I have a hard bonnet dryer for regular use.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> This product is not worth the 40something dollars I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I have to put a big thick towel around my neck</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll break down and get another unit.      </li>
            <li> It really stinks bad the first time you use it, but after that, it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> The cap never got tight as i wanted it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s survived both my tightly packed suitcases, and my weekly toss into the cupboard when I&#x27;m through.</li>
            <li> several were very negative on this product,but i thought that i&#x27;d give it a try</li>
            <li> Simply put, this product is poorly made.</li>
            <li> inorder for my hair to get dried.  </li>
            <li> This dryer is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This model is such poor quality</li>
            <li> The bonnet detached from the round piece of plastic where the hose attaches.</li>
            <li> The hood is stiff and is coming apart at the hose.  </li>
            <li> I found because of the weak airflow, the front of my head gets getting absolutely NO air.  </li>
            <li> It is compact, which means it takes up very little space.</li>
            <li> No more air - didn&#x27;t drop it or do anything to it, it just stopped working.  </li>
            <li> Also the cord compartment is too small for the length of the cord.</li>
            <li> atleast 2 and was not pleased with their selections or their prices.  </li>
            <li> I usually put it on at night while I lay on the couch and watch TV, or when I am working on the computer.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that has gone bad - probably due to abuse - is the bonnet.  </li>
            <li> After I rolled my hair, it was hard to put the cap on my head.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, there&#x27;s not much of a choice but to continue to use this unit.    </li>
            <li> I have thick, kinky hair and this dryer</li>
            <li> Hose too short and IMPOSSIBLE to keep to the bonnet.</li>
            <li> This entire unit is poorly designed and awkward to use.</li>
            <li> Little uncomfortable but works.</li>
            <li> Not a good design.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several, and have never been disappointed in the settings, airflow, or performance.</li>
            <li> She has very thick hair</li>
            <li> The string has broken and the bonnet itself tore.  </li>
            <li> A poor purchase</li>
            <li> It is uncomfortable to use it.  </li>
            <li> I would hate for anybody else to waste money like I have.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically useless.</li>
            <li> i ever wrong.</li>
            <li> Unless I tie the opening on the bonnet around the hose, the dryer is now useless.</li>
            <li> Disappointing product.  </li>
            <li> This product was just bad.  </li>
            <li> So this product was just bad.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed.</li>
            <li> So disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked that someone would even sell it!  </li>
            <li> It makes this awful noise when drying my hair.  </li>
            <li> Very annoying.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had trouble getting the bonnet to attach to the hose, but finally got it one there after 10 minutes of struggling.  The dryer worked great the two times I used it ( the ionic part was terrific - dried my hair very quickly) and then it broke. No more air - didn&#x27;t drop it or do anything to it, it just stopped working.  Returned it for refund, but what a pain in the neck that was.  Anyway, I do not recommend this dryer to anyone.  I am currently searching for a new soft bonnet dryer and so far nothing I see is really any better.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer as a temporary dryer until I can afford to mount a professional dryer from the ceiling. Anyway, this dryer is HOT. So HOT that children shouldn&#x27;t use it. I have to put a big thick towel around my neck otherwise I get burned. It&#x27;s LOUD and the hose does keep falling out. Other than that, it&#x27;s OK. I&#x27;m just trying to hold on until I can get rid of it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for a backup to my hooded dryer.  I agree with reviewers that the hose detaxhes from the bonnet but I place a rubber band on the hose and connect the bonnet before using.  It does a good job drying the hair.  Heat distributes evenly and my shoulder length relaxed hair is dry in 50 minutes. I like the storage for the cord and bonnet and it is quite powerful with good airflow.</li>
            <li> It is really loud, does not blow very hard. but it does gets really hot. So its ok for the money.</li>
            <li> With the exception of the hose being a little short - this is a great little hair dryer that has 4 temps.  It is light weight - easy to store and easy to travel with - I recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> Service on this product was excellent!  Quick shipment.  However, the actual product is not what I had hoped.  It is very, very noisy and limits where in the house I can use the hair dryer so as not to interrupt other family member activities.</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE!!! This hair dryer has four settings - Off, Low (no heat), Scorch and Torch, a most disappointing purchase from Hot Tools.  There is a positive, the bonnet is much better than one from a prior Hot Tools purchase. Hoping for a short life span for this hair dryer, so that I can buy another brand.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer for my wife.  She refuses to use the hard-bonnet type of hair dryer, and her hair takes so long to dry that hand-held dryers are out of the question.    For years she has used ConAire dryers and had been relatively satisfied with them.  But the model she prefers isn&#x27;t available any more, and a similar unit has proved to be mechanically unreliable.    In desperation, I tried purchasing this model.  It&#x27;s about the same size as dryers she&#x27;s used before.  The power cord is long enough, and the hose connecting the unit with the bonnet is adequate in length and durability.    The hear produced is higher than any she&#x27;s previously used.  She wishes there were an intermediate temperature setting, but overall is pleased with the amount of drying air the machine provides.  She&#x27;s now able to dry her hair in about two hours as opposed to the four it took with previous machines.    The biggest point of dissatisfaction is the noise level.  If the heat produced is twice the amount of earlier models, so is the noise level.  It&#x27;s not only loud but irritating with its raspy whine.  Sadly, there&#x27;s not much of a choice but to continue to use this unit.    Can&#x27;t anyone make a reliable, hot, and quiet soft-bonnet dryer these days?</li>
            <li> Simply put, this product is poorly made. I wasn&#x27;t able to fully use it not even ONCE before it broke. The dryer hose no longer attaches to the bonnet. The product is under a 1 yr limited warranty, however if you choose to return it to the manufacturer for repair it will cost you money to ship to the repair center. And you will also be asked to make a check for $15 for return shipping, \\&quot;handling\\&quot; and \\&quot;insurance\\&quot; -- this on top of the $40+ you&#x27;ve probably already spent on it.     I am really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it. She has very thick hair and I selected this one because it was more powerful. Works great.</li>
            <li> It worked Ok in the first 5 uses and the it just fell apart till it died. When working heat in the bonnet was not equally distributed.</li>
            <li> After 3 uses, the bonnet ripped away from the where the air hose attaches.  I sent an e-mail and called company&#x27;s 800 number and got NO response.  It also leaks hot air where the hose attaches to unit.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been looking all over for this type of hair dryer and finally found it here.  It works beautifully!!</li>
            <li> Hose too short and IMPOSSIBLE to keep to the bonnet. Falls out repeatedly until you want to scream!! Junk. Not worth $40 total.</li>
            <li> For me, this dryer has been fantastic! I have had it for 3 months and use it 3 or 4 times a week; and, I have no problems with it at all. It is compact, which means it takes up very little space. I would recommend it, based on my experience.</li>
            <li> The portable hairdryer works wonderfully; however, the bonnet is not very sturdy and has already started coming apart where the hose attaches to the bonnet (disappointed with bonnet durability).</li>
            <li> This product was just bad.  After I rolled my hair, it was hard to put the cap on my head.  The strings were supposed to tighten, but that was easier said than done.  The cap never got tight as i wanted it.  So this product was just bad.</li>
            <li> Connection between hose and bonnet loosens when operating. Also the cord compartment is too small for the length of the cord. We had a 400 watt dryer which we were satisfied with, but had to buy the 800 watt unit because we couldn&#x27;t buy a replacement bonnet for the 400 watt bonnet</li>
            <li> The attachment to the hair bonnet does not hold well.  Other than that, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this dryer, since my previous experiences with bonnet dryers were with ones from the 1960s and 70s that I found used. I&#x27;ve bought several old ones for around $6-$8 over the past several years, and have ended up giving some away to friends who liked them, and using others until they died. In general, I&#x27;ve been really happy with the performance of the old ones, but I figured getting one new could only be better.  Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I respect the opinion of the other person who wrote a review, but I have to differ on several points-- the dryer is neither particularly quiet nor powerful. True, it&#x27;s quieter than a regular hair dryer, but the air output is absolutely lousy.  Even on the highest setting, it can&#x27;t fully inflate the bonnet, even after I made sure the plastic wasn&#x27;t sticking to itself.  I found because of the weak airflow, the front of my head gets getting absolutely NO air.  The plastic is just flat against it. I&#x27;ve tried rearranging it, and finally have found that the only way to dry my hair on all sides is to rotate the bonnet regularly, defeating any \\&quot;convenience\\&quot; this product might have had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other point I must disagree with is about the length of the tube. It&#x27;s simply not long enough unless you&#x27;re sitting up aginst the unit and not moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - Despite the fact that I overall don&#x27;t care for this unit, there are some positive things about it.  The cord, tube, and bonnet store inside the actual unit.  The tube is sturdy. Also, the unit kicks out a decent amount of heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - Weak airflow and short tube. Not worth the price. Also, the dryer is not very tall, but has a really large footprint. It takes up about a square foot of space on my counter. It&#x27;s larger than any of the even the clunkiest vintage dryers I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend finding a vintage bonnet dryer in a thrift store or on Ebay. I&#x27;ve owned several, and have never been disappointed in the settings, airflow, or performance. Those things are workhorses, and they come with really neat \\&quot;hatbox\\&quot; type cases for storage.  Plus they&#x27;re so cheap that if you do get a bum unit, you can afford to replace it easily.e.

            <li> Bought this as my old hair dryer dried my hair in more ways than one. This dryer is great, It is a little noisy but that I dont mind. Works pretty fast and have only had to use it on low heat. My hair is quite long but fine. High heat would work faster obviously but I am happy with low. If it gets to hot for my head I just turn it to cool for 5 mins then back to low or high.</li>
            <li> The Hot Tools Prof. 800 Watt Ionic Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer is too hot on high and too cool on low/cool.  It is uncomfortable to use it.  I am not sure what my next step is going to be, but I cannot recommend   this product.</li>
            <li> Disappointing product.  Works but started coming apart shortly after purchase. The hood is stiff and is coming apart at the hose.  I think they better evaluate their quality if they want to sell other products.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the 1st hair dryer, contacted Amazon and they sent another.  This hair dryer was exactly what I wanted, I had another dryer similiar, but I had it for years and it just gave out.  I had gone to the beauty supply stores, atleast 2 and was not pleased with their selections or their prices.  I wanted one that had more than 3 levels - on-off-heat, I wanted on-off-low-high, this works better for me since I have long hair and have to stay under the dryer for long period of time.  I like the bonnet, because I don&#x27;t have to stay in one place inorder for my hair to get dried.  The price was exceptional, in the beauty supply store, that wanted $39.00 and $49.00 for a product that would not supply all my requirements.  I am very pleased and when this one gives out, will purchase another one and will highly recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer over one year ago and only used it once. The first time I used it there was an unusual odor, but I thought it was because the bonnet was new and was giving off a strange plastic smell. It worked fine the first time, but the smell was almost suffocating. I did not use the dryer again for many months and when I turned it on it did not work at all. I called Amazon and there&#x27;s nothing they can do. It has been well over a year since I purchased it, so I cannot get any type of refund. I would not recommend anybody to purchase this item, but if you do, please  use it regularly (to make sure it&#x27;s going to keep working) before the 30 day return period has lapsed. I would hate for anybody else to waste money like I have.</li>
            <li> I wrote a terrible review for this after my first use but now I&#x27;m feeling better about it. In fact, I&#x27;m using it as I write this. At first I didn&#x27;t think it heated my whole head, but it does. It&#x27;s just not as powerful as the old bonnet dryers I remember from my youth. It works OK though. I can&#x27;t seem to alter my rating but I&#x27;d give it three stars instead of two.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price  is ok for trip, working good but I too hot if you use the regular level take a long,  I prefer to used mu hard hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I found this hair dryer to be loud. You will not be able to hear the tv while you&#x27;re using it. It does dry well under the medium setting but gets too hot under the higher setting.  I do like the fact that it&#x27;s portable.</li>
            <li> I bought it in the middle of December 2006.  Today June 18, 2007, I turned it on to use it and it burned out and smoke was coming from the vents.  The plastic around the slot the tube goes into broke twice..had no choice but to stitch it with thread to keep it attached to the plastic cap.  So disappointed with this product.  Don&#x27;t buy it.  Better to spend the money and buy professional.  This product is not worth the 40something dollars I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I agree that the dryer gets really hot on the \\&quot;High\\&quot; setting but, the Low setting is totally tolerable.  I alternate between these two settings becuase I want my hair to dry as quickly as possible.  I have a hard bonnet dryer for regular use.  I only use this one when I travel and absolutely love the convenience and practicality... it fits perfectly in my suitcase and dries my hair when on the go.  Love it!</li>
            <li> mom is  94 and loves this product. In fact, her original one finally wore out and she wanted another one. she is very happy.</li>
            <li> The bonnet is very flimsy and doesn&#x27;t last long.  Too bad as the dryer is very good and compact.  If they make one with a decent bonnet, I&#x27;m there but this lasted about 6 uses and the bonnet broke off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for about 3 years.  The only thing that has gone bad - probably due to abuse - is the bonnet.  The string has broken and the bonnet itself tore.  I purchased the Conair to replace it, but the hose came apart and I ended up giving it away.  I like the Hot Tools so much that I ended up replacing the broken string and \\&quot;super gluing\\&quot; the bonnet to patch up the hole and I have resisted getting a new dryer. If I could find a bonnet replacement, I would buy it - but I can&#x27;t so I&#x27;ll break down and get another unit.      I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it not fully inflating (even with my \\&quot;super glued\\&quot; holes).  I also find that it is very hot and I sometimes have to put it on medium.  The hose is pretty long and easily stores inside the unit, along with the bonnet. It&#x27;s very portable and convenient.  I usually put it on at night while I lay on the couch and watch TV, or when I am working on the computer.  Before I know it, my hair is dry!</li>
            <li> Worked great for a year.  Then the bonnet stretched so that the hose would not say in.  I don&#x27;t  believe I will try a Hot Tools product again the future.</li>
            <li> I would really like the hose to be longer.  If you are standing up doing your makeup you have to be really careful to not pull the hose out of the bonnet.  You also need to be careful to not pull the whole thing onto the floor.  The dryer on hot gets way too hot.  Even on medium it gets very hot.  I&#x27;ve wound up using it on the cool setting.  One good thing- the bonnet really is a nice big one.</li>
            <li> The dryer sounds like a small  airplane with a very noisy engine. The noise is unbearable so I seldom use it. DIdn&#x27;t return it because it was needed timely. A poor purchase</li>
            <li> just what I wonted. love it I can move around and sleep in it.</li>
            <li> As an African-American woman who uses hair products to moisturize my hair, this dryer bonnet is good to have. The heat helps products to penetrate deeply, gets hot quickly and to put it away is a dream - everything has its place within the dryer itself; no concerns about misplacing a piece somewhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a new dryer with a soft bonnet after my last Vidal Sasson dryer broke.  This dryer gets very hot on the middle setting but doesn&#x27;t dry very well. The low setting while cooler doesn&#x27;t dry your hair. I  thought the exessive heat would make your hair  dry in half the time but it doesn&#x27;t. This dryer also makes loud straining noises, which I am hoping doesn&#x27;t mean the motor is about to quit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old dryer is no longer being manufactured and this was the only alternative I could find. What can you do.</li>
            <li> I brought this and it dry my hair fast and I love it.</li>
            <li> This is my third Hot Tools bonnet dryer in 25 years. I love it: highly recommend it. I, too had the bonnet constantly unhooking from the hose but realized after the second dryer that the bonnet has a notch inside the ring that clicks to keep the connected to the bonnet. The dryer does get very but with 4 heist settings I keep lower it after 10-15 minutes then every five.</li>
            <li> I use this bonnet hair dryer when I condition my hair.  I put a lot of conditioner on my head and then sit under the dryer for 30 minutes to activate the conditioner.  It works great.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems.  It really stinks bad the first time you use it, but after that, it&#x27;s fine.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to try to use it if I were actually trying to dry my hair.  My hair is only shoulder length and it isn&#x27;t dry after I sit under it for a half hour.  It&#x27;s still damp, but it&#x27;s not a problem for me because I&#x27;m just trying to activate the conditioner -- then I rinse it out anyway.</li>
            <li> got this for my mom, her old hair dryer stopped. she loves this one. and when it is on hot, it is hot</li>
            <li> The Hot Tools hair dryer works wonders. It&#x27;s so easy to use. All you have to do is attach it to the nozzle of your blow dryer and you can deep condition or set your hair. With a conventional standing dryer, the back of my head does not dry evenly with the rest of the hair, but this bonnet gives me all around coverage, drying my hair in 20 minutes. I&#x27;ve had this dryer for close to 8 months and I&#x27;ve used it every week after I wash and style my hair. It&#x27;s survived both my tightly packed suitcases, and my weekly toss into the cupboard when I&#x27;m through. This may not be the dryer for people who set their hair with large rollers as this fits snug against my head with just twists. But other than that small limitation, this has been the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> Gets a lot hotter than i thought it would.  Have to use medium setting.</li>
            <li> I have owned a hot tools hair dryer -  model 30001 -  but could no longer use it because the bonnet attachment to the hose broke.  I was very happy with this hair dryer and therefore expected the same results from a newer hot tools hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;However -  the thermostat setting is too too hot..  I cannot use it at all on high  setting and barely on the middle setting -  I have  managed to &amp;#34;get the job done&amp;#34; by starting on the middle setting as long as I can stand it and then switching to the cool setting  and then manually pulling  the bonnet to a peak over my curlers.  My Model 30001 had five heat settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to this the new dryer is very nosy - almost has a whistle to it.  The bonnet is heavier and not as flexible.&lt;br /&gt;In short - I am not happy with the new dryer - do you have another model with more heat settings?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A problem with both models -  the hose easily becomes detached from the bonnet while in the process of drying.</li>
            <li> This looked like a good hairdryer when I unpacked it, but the hose will not stay attached to the bonnet and if you hold it by hand, the hot air never gets to the front and top of the bonnet.  It&#x27;s basically useless.</li>
            <li> i read several comments on this product. several were very negative on this product,but i thought that i&#x27;d give it a try anyway.was i ever wrong. even on the lowest setting it was too hot.the tubing won&#x27;t stay on. i would certainly not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer about two years ago, and I used it for deep conditioning my hair after washing.  I have thick, kinky hair and this dryer didn&#x27;t get my hair completely dry.  They dryer was quiet which was good, but it also wasn&#x27;t very powerful.  About a year ago the plastic ring that attached the hose to the bonnet began separating from the bonnet. It eventually came apart entirely. Unless I tie the opening on the bonnet around the hose, the dryer is now useless.</li>
            <li> I like the dryer because I can move around the room while my hair is drying. I also find the style convenient; when I want to relax and dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift - seems to like it.</li>
            <li> Little uncomfortable but works.</li>
            <li> This dryer is a waste of money. It gets really hot which at first I thought was a plus but the dryer than got so hot that the plastic started to melt. The hose and bonnet started to burn and turn brown and eventually the burnt hose cracked and became unusable. Do Not Buy this dryer.</li>
            <li> I could kick myself for throwing away my old bonnet hair dryer twenty years ago.  It worked fine but blow dryers were more efficient.  I bet that if I still had it, I could plug it in and it would work much better than this model.  This model is such poor quality I&#x27;m shocked that someone would even sell it!  The unit is ok (after 3 uses) but the bonnet is so cheap that the plastic connector pulled away from the bonnet on the second use.  I suspect that the glue they use is not heat resistant and it melted, because it started to emit a chemical smell right before the plastic ring fell out of the bonnet.  Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money for a reputable manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my unit is &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s by Hot Tools and looks almost identical. Like others have stated in their reviews--the front of the bonnet hardly gets any hot air; so there is an uneven distribution of heat. The hose will no longer connect properly to the bonnet. The bonnet detached from the round piece of plastic where the hose attaches. But even before this happened it was always a struggle to fit the hose in and it always fell out easily.  This entire unit is poorly designed and awkward to use. The settings are on a black dial with tiny raised letters that I can barely see; and the dial is on the opposite end of the unit from where the hose comes out; so I have to pick it up and turn it on it&#x27;s end to see or change settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used packing tape to re-attach bonnet to plastic hose receiver and used a silver pen to color over the settings so they&#x27;re more visible. Then I just fiddle with the hose to get it to fit and try to sit extremely still so it doesn&#x27;t fall out. But obviously, this is a lot of rigamarole to go through and should not be necessary! And the results are mediocre at best. So, I came on Amazon looking to replace this disappointing piece of garbage; but it appears that there aren&#x27;t any other brands that deliver satisfying results either. So--manufacturers out there, if you&#x27;re reading--there&#x27;s obviously a huge void to be filled here! Can anyone produce anything efficient, intelligently designed, and of decent quality that lasts anymore? And would you mind making it in the USA?</li>
            <li> This dryer is compact and easily portable.  It does an excellent job of drying hair over event the largest curlers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like it, but since I purchased it, I will use it for awhile. I&#x27;m going to replace it!  It&#x27;s so very NOISY!!  It makes this awful noise when drying my hair.  I don&#x27;t care for the bonnet on it either; the bonnet has too many holes in it and the air doesn&#x27;t circulate well inside the bonnet .  I would not purchase it again nor would I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Works very well and a great size</li>
            <li> Despite rotating the hose until it clicked solidly in the bonnet, the hose constantly fell off when I tried to use it. To reattach, you have to remove the bonnet from your head, and redo the connection.  Very annoying.  Heat:  Even the \\&quot;Low\\&quot; setting is very hot.  I had to turn it down repeatedly to the cooler setting, then when it lost the heat, turn the control back up to the low setting. Not a good design.</li>
