            <li>just make sure you use the softer side of the scrubber!</li>

            <li>&quot;  - water flows through - easy to clean  - feels good when in use (to me)  </li>
            <li>and it is a wonderful back scrubber.  </li>
            <li>This body scrubber is the solution for that problem and many more.</li>
            <li>Gets into all those nooks and crannies better than any wash cloth that I&#x27;ve ever used, and durable too.</li>
            <li>but okay.</li>
            <li>I love how well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having to add more soap.</li>
            <li>The material creates a lot of lather, and I am pleased with how it stimulates my skin when using it.  </li>
            <li>This body scrubber is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love it for three reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>dad was so impressed with the body scrubber that he asked me to purchase one for his personal use (he goes on business trips with some regularity).</li>
            <li>I love using it too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order some more as gifts.</li>
            <li>This was a bit spendy, but I think it will serve me for many years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is without reservation the best back scrubber I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>but I love the sturdier side for me...</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Now thinking of getting for my kids too. :)</li>
            <li>It is a superb product and is the last one you&#x27;ll ever need.</li>
            <li>This product is truly anti-bacterial and is very easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>but I loved this item so much</li>
            <li>i am still using my second one -- it&#x27;s been 1.5 years now and it still is in good shape!</li>
            <li>Cleans easy and dries well.</li>
            <li>- Easy to use  - keeps soap in the \\&quot;hexagons\\</li>
            <li>it also drys very quickly ...</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Soap lathers up easily in and on the scrubber and then rinses out when you&#x27;re finished using it.  </li>
            <li>Dries easily for a gym bag.</li>
            <li>Really strong and durable.</li>
            <li>how strong you want to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>they are easy to keep clean and do a fantastic job at keeping the skin exfoliated and healthier looking.</li>
            <li>and it is extremely effective yet gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>- You don&#x27;t feel like bacteria will collect since it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Hope you enjoy it too ...</li>
            <li>This has been such a great product for the skin.</li>
            <li>I use it on my entire body, works great..</li>
            <li>It does a great job on your back.</li>
            <li>but very worth it</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;very happy with this item ... and as long as it&#x27;s available ...</li>
            <li>and I have tried many types of body scrubbers and this is by far my favorite...</li>
            <li>Awesome product up reach all those hard to get at areas.</li>
            <li>It is a bit rough, but I believe it does a great job of exfoliating your skin.  </li>
            <li>so I guess all that NASA astronaut stuff was true because&lt;</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d give a good review of ALL of it at the same time ...</li>
            <li>But it suds up quickly and rinses clean quickly.</li>
            <li>would take more soap), and I may have used the facial sponge once, but more for trying it out than anything.</li>
            <li>This really does a great job on your back, feet - everything.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>For a fun and thorough all over clean, this is the right tool.</li>
            <li>I bought it less than a year ago, and it was working great.</li>
            <li>I found the scrubber very invigorating and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It holds up for years and even after it started tearing into the fourth year of use, it still did its job for one more year!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>but he liked the overall feel of it</li>
            <li>It is quite fun to put a lot of body wash and cover yourself in bubbles with this.</li>
            <li>ok, I just feel the mitt does good enough and to use the back scrubber</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>I love how it leaves the back squeeky clean very easy to use for unreachable areas on your back.</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of exfoliation.</li>
            <li>These have the perfect amount of roughness, enough to really get a good scrub and feel clean but not so much they&#x27;re uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li>but so far it seems to work wonders for my skin and is perfect for the hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li>After a year of use, it still looks, smells, and feels brand new, completely free of tears.</li>
            <li>.it does an amazing job of making a shower FAST and easy.&lt;br /&gt;You can use this to scrub a leg in 4 strokes .. gets to back ..</li>
            <li>and it drys super fast too ...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 250lbs. of shower loving man, and this product has changed my whole approach to my daily splash time.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean, to wash back</li>
            <li>No more wash cloths as the soft side is great for exfoliating your face and the other side is great for the rest of your body.  </li>
            <li>It is very worth the investment instead of getting ten cheap loofas.</li>
            <li>Top contender for Christmas gifts this year since it is relatively inexpensive, but makes a guy feel pampered in the shower.</li>
            <li>I would prefer to have the same honeycomb material in a more manageable form.</li>
            <li>An added plus is the fact that its naturally antifungal, antibacterial and allergen free.</li>
            <li>love this scrubber to death, it gets all nooks and crannies on your back and anywhere else you want to!</li>
            <li>; out .. in a semi-circle grip&lt;br /&gt;I am female ... 5&#x27;7&amp;#34; .. love this ...</li>
            <li>Pretty scratchy -</li>
            <li>My first one lasted about five years (though in all honesty I should&#x27;ve replaced it after four).</li>
            <li>My personal favorite is Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soap; just a few drops (approx. 8-10) followed by repeated squeezing movements, and it&#x27;s good to go.</li>
            <li>It is a bit tricky to hold onto, but I love the invigorated feeling I have after I have scrubbed my entire body</li>
            <li>not sorry I bought it at all...</li>
            <li>one side is a little softer than the other and my husband likes that side the best...</li>
            <li>One side scrubs the other side polishes leaving your back feeling great</li>
            <li>, how easy it is to rinse out, and how much more natural it feels to scrub down with a glove than a poofy ball (loofa).</li>
            <li>well worth it since it is naturally antifungal, antibacterial and mildew resistant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this seems to be a very well engineered item (I have an engineering degree</li>
            <li>It makes my back feel so smooth.  </li>
            <li>so Much I bought another one.</li>
            <li>However, it does have a drawback, which is that it doesn&#x27;t lather very well.</li>
            <li>Now, I use it to gently exfoliate my whole body, but never my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really well-made.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of arthritis and can&#x27;t reach very well...</li>
            <li>Far better than a traditional scrub brush!</li>
            <li>I originally started out with the facial sponge which worked really well for areas that have been waxed/shaved.</li>
            <li>Unlike many other items it is anti-bac and anti-fungal.</li>
            <li>The scrubber has 2 different textures; one pretty scratchy (great for back and feet),  the other side is softer.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt so tingly and clean after using this on my back.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and this claimer was the Number 1 reason that I was willing to pay the price for it.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t even last a full year of being so-called resistant.</li>
            <li>i just wish it came with free shipping so that i can buy it for everyone i know who has back acne or sensitive skin.     </li>
            <li>the main rectangle is 22&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>it is ok for a back to scratch it, but too short in length.  </li>
            <li>Almost not purchased due to the higher price point, but worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone ...</li>
            <li>I recommend this highly..</li>
            <li>Love this body scrubber.. just does wonders, soft on one side and exfoliating on the other..</li>
            <li>I mainly use the mitt, rarely use the back scrubber</li>
            <li>it is worth the extra money ...</li>
            <li>Scrubs the entire back easily and can be used for all over the body even the face.</li>
            <li>It still looks brand new</li>
            <li>Both look brand new.</li>
            <li>These dry out quickly after use, faster than some of the luffa-based scrubbers, which doesn&#x27;t give mildew a chance to form.</li>
            <li>I bought the three-piece gift set since I wanted the mitt and back scrubber and that way you basically get the facial sponge for free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been slowly Looking around for a good back scrubber...</li>
            <li>First time I tried this and now it is the only one I will buy again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for the past 2 months and it works way better than any luffa I ever owned.  </li>
            <li>it takes a little bit of liquid soap and EASILY suds up</li>
            <li>I like this better then the face mitt because this scrubber has two sides: one side is a soft scrub and the other is an extra scrub.</li>
            <li>in the 3 years that i own it, NO MORE BACK ACNE!</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t completely get your back clean unless you get a back facial daily-who can really do this?</li>
            <li>I use it for my whole body because it has a soft side on it to so you can alternate</li>
            <li>This CLEARLY states &amp;#34;antifungal, antimicrobial, and mildew resistant&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The length of the scrubber was much too short for him</li>
            <li>at the time I ordered this ... it had some text about it being developed by NASA for astronauts to use ...</li>
            <li>It was developed by N.A.S.A. Mine</li>
            <li>This is one back (or body) scrubber you really should buy.</li>
            <li>The cost was a bit pricey, but I chose to buy it anyway because of its claims that it is naturally Antifungal, Antibacterial and Mildew Resistant.  </li>
            <li>The soft side I use on the rest of my body.</li>
            <li>I love the device has soft (white) and harder (blue) side.</li>
            <li>just so you know, the more you use it the color of the scrubber will look duller but that doesn&#x27;t mean it stops working.</li>
            <li>If the price was to come down slightly, I would be a more willing purchaser in the future.</li>
            <li>Actually a great scrubber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can pull on this and it gives a little for the elasticity inherent in design and materials, and I realize that I do not have to pull it very hard to get that aggressive scrubbing (unlike the old loofah style).  </li>
            <li>This is a great product for anyone who is tired of soft scrubbers typically sold in stores.</li>
            <li>At first, I used the rougher green side liberally for the body, but my enthusiasm was misguided; now I know that too much scrubbing leads to irritation.</li>
            <li>I think it will last a long time and be plenty worth the money...</li>
            <li>I wanted a slightly scratchy feel when I scrubbed, and loofah and crocheted-hemp back scrubbers felt too smooth.</li>
            <li>I bought four different Back Scrubbers, hoping I liked at least one of them.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I can put some soap on a loofa and have plenty to cover my whole body and still have enough left to take some time to rinse out when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>Bought the whole set (Facial, Mitt and Back).</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t mold and you could leave it wet all morning and night if you wanted to!</li>
            <li>Every now &amp; then, I just put it in a detergent and hot water scrub it a little &amp; let it sit for 1/2 hour.</li>
            <li>it really doesn&#x27;t need replacing, i only replaced it because the other one was trashed in with dust and dirt while moving.</li>
            <li>No signs of mildew or anything in the first few months I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li>After switching to the more delicate blue side, everything went back to normal in a few days.</li>
            <li>To minimize waste, I fold the body scrubber in half twice; that way no soap leaks through it before becoming lather (the process also works with solid bar soap).</li>
            <li>We had gone through 3 different back brushes, always with the same end result: it was hard to keep them clean, and eventually they would get mold.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not long enough to &amp;#34;step&amp;#34;&amp;#34; into or over ...</li>
            <li>If your a larger person you will probably find yourself having to bend your arms a little too much.</li>

            <li> but I love the sturdier side for me...</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Now thinking of getting for my kids too. :)</li>
            <li> It is a superb product and is the last one you&#x27;ll ever need.</li>
            <li> This product is truly anti-bacterial and is very easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> but I loved this item so much</li>
            <li> i am still using my second one -- it&#x27;s been 1.5 years now and it still is in good shape!</li>
            <li> Cleans easy and dries well.</li>
            <li> - Easy to use  - keeps soap in the \\&quot;hexagons\\</li>
            <li> it also drys very quickly ...</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Soap lathers up easily in and on the scrubber and then rinses out when you&#x27;re finished using it.  </li>
            <li> Dries easily for a gym bag.</li>
            <li> Really strong and durable.</li>
            <li> how strong you want to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> they are easy to keep clean and do a fantastic job at keeping the skin exfoliated and healthier looking.</li>
            <li> and it is extremely effective yet gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> - You don&#x27;t feel like bacteria will collect since it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Hope you enjoy it too ...</li>
            <li> This has been such a great product for the skin.</li>
            <li> I use it on my entire body, works great..</li>
            <li> It does a great job on your back.</li>
            <li> but very worth it</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;very happy with this item ... and as long as it&#x27;s available ...</li>
            <li> and I have tried many types of body scrubbers and this is by far my favorite...</li>
            <li> Awesome product up reach all those hard to get at areas.</li>
            <li> It is a bit rough, but I believe it does a great job of exfoliating your skin.  </li>
            <li> so I guess all that NASA astronaut stuff was true because&lt;</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give a good review of ALL of it at the same time ...</li>
            <li> But it suds up quickly and rinses clean quickly.</li>
            <li> would take more soap), and I may have used the facial sponge once, but more for trying it out than anything.</li>
            <li> This really does a great job on your back, feet - everything.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> For a fun and thorough all over clean, this is the right tool.</li>
            <li> I bought it less than a year ago, and it was working great.</li>
            <li> I found the scrubber very invigorating and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It holds up for years and even after it started tearing into the fourth year of use, it still did its job for one more year!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> but he liked the overall feel of it</li>
            <li> It is quite fun to put a lot of body wash and cover yourself in bubbles with this.</li>
            <li> ok, I just feel the mitt does good enough and to use the back scrubber</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love how it leaves the back squeeky clean very easy to use for unreachable areas on your back.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of exfoliation.</li>
            <li> These have the perfect amount of roughness, enough to really get a good scrub and feel clean but not so much they&#x27;re uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> but so far it seems to work wonders for my skin and is perfect for the hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li> After a year of use, it still looks, smells, and feels brand new, completely free of tears.</li>
            <li> .it does an amazing job of making a shower FAST and easy.&lt;br /&gt;You can use this to scrub a leg in 4 strokes .. gets to back ..</li>
            <li> and it drys super fast too ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 250lbs. of shower loving man, and this product has changed my whole approach to my daily splash time.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean, to wash back</li>
            <li> No more wash cloths as the soft side is great for exfoliating your face and the other side is great for the rest of your body.  </li>
            <li> It is very worth the investment instead of getting ten cheap loofas.</li>
            <li> Top contender for Christmas gifts this year since it is relatively inexpensive, but makes a guy feel pampered in the shower.</li>
            <li> I would prefer to have the same honeycomb material in a more manageable form.</li>
            <li> An added plus is the fact that its naturally antifungal, antibacterial and allergen free.</li>
            <li> love this scrubber to death, it gets all nooks and crannies on your back and anywhere else you want to!</li>
            <li> ; out .. in a semi-circle grip&lt;br /&gt;I am female ... 5&#x27;7&amp;#34; .. love this ...</li>
            <li> Pretty scratchy -</li>
            <li> My first one lasted about five years (though in all honesty I should&#x27;ve replaced it after four).</li>
            <li> My personal favorite is Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soap; just a few drops (approx. 8-10) followed by repeated squeezing movements, and it&#x27;s good to go.</li>
            <li> It is a bit tricky to hold onto, but I love the invigorated feeling I have after I have scrubbed my entire body</li>
            <li> not sorry I bought it at all...</li>
            <li> one side is a little softer than the other and my husband likes that side the best...</li>
            <li> One side scrubs the other side polishes leaving your back feeling great</li>
            <li> , how easy it is to rinse out, and how much more natural it feels to scrub down with a glove than a poofy ball (loofa).</li>
            <li> well worth it since it is naturally antifungal, antibacterial and mildew resistant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this seems to be a very well engineered item (I have an engineering degree</li>
            <li> It makes my back feel so smooth.  </li>
            <li> so Much I bought another one.</li>
            <li> However, it does have a drawback, which is that it doesn&#x27;t lather very well.</li>
            <li> Now, I use it to gently exfoliate my whole body, but never my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really well-made.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of arthritis and can&#x27;t reach very well...</li>
            <li> Far better than a traditional scrub brush!</li>
            <li> I originally started out with the facial sponge which worked really well for areas that have been waxed/shaved.</li>
            <li> Unlike many other items it is anti-bac and anti-fungal.</li>
            <li> The scrubber has 2 different textures; one pretty scratchy (great for back and feet),  the other side is softer.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt so tingly and clean after using this on my back.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and this claimer was the Number 1 reason that I was willing to pay the price for it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even last a full year of being so-called resistant.</li>
            <li> i just wish it came with free shipping so that i can buy it for everyone i know who has back acne or sensitive skin.     </li>
            <li> the main rectangle is 22&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> it is ok for a back to scratch it, but too short in length.  </li>
            <li> Almost not purchased due to the higher price point, but worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone ...</li>
            <li> I recommend this highly..</li>
            <li> Love this body scrubber.. just does wonders, soft on one side and exfoliating on the other..</li>
            <li> I mainly use the mitt, rarely use the back scrubber</li>
            <li> it is worth the extra money ...</li>
            <li> Scrubs the entire back easily and can be used for all over the body even the face.</li>
            <li> It still looks brand new</li>
            <li> Both look brand new.</li>
            <li> These dry out quickly after use, faster than some of the luffa-based scrubbers, which doesn&#x27;t give mildew a chance to form.</li>
            <li> I bought the three-piece gift set since I wanted the mitt and back scrubber and that way you basically get the facial sponge for free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been slowly Looking around for a good back scrubber...</li>
            <li> First time I tried this and now it is the only one I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for the past 2 months and it works way better than any luffa I ever owned.  </li>
            <li> it takes a little bit of liquid soap and EASILY suds up</li>
            <li> I like this better then the face mitt because this scrubber has two sides: one side is a soft scrub and the other is an extra scrub.</li>
            <li> in the 3 years that i own it, NO MORE BACK ACNE!</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t completely get your back clean unless you get a back facial daily-who can really do this?</li>
            <li> I use it for my whole body because it has a soft side on it to so you can alternate</li>
            <li> This CLEARLY states &amp;#34;antifungal, antimicrobial, and mildew resistant&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The length of the scrubber was much too short for him</li>
            <li> at the time I ordered this ... it had some text about it being developed by NASA for astronauts to use ...</li>
            <li> It was developed by N.A.S.A. Mine</li>
            <li> This is one back (or body) scrubber you really should buy.</li>
            <li> The cost was a bit pricey, but I chose to buy it anyway because of its claims that it is naturally Antifungal, Antibacterial and Mildew Resistant.  </li>
            <li> The soft side I use on the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> I love the device has soft (white) and harder (blue) side.</li>
            <li> just so you know, the more you use it the color of the scrubber will look duller but that doesn&#x27;t mean it stops working.</li>
            <li> If the price was to come down slightly, I would be a more willing purchaser in the future.</li>
            <li> Actually a great scrubber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can pull on this and it gives a little for the elasticity inherent in design and materials, and I realize that I do not have to pull it very hard to get that aggressive scrubbing (unlike the old loofah style).  </li>
            <li> This is a great product for anyone who is tired of soft scrubbers typically sold in stores.</li>
            <li> At first, I used the rougher green side liberally for the body, but my enthusiasm was misguided; now I know that too much scrubbing leads to irritation.</li>
            <li> I think it will last a long time and be plenty worth the money...</li>
            <li> I wanted a slightly scratchy feel when I scrubbed, and loofah and crocheted-hemp back scrubbers felt too smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought four different Back Scrubbers, hoping I liked at least one of them.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I can put some soap on a loofa and have plenty to cover my whole body and still have enough left to take some time to rinse out when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> Bought the whole set (Facial, Mitt and Back).</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t mold and you could leave it wet all morning and night if you wanted to!</li>
            <li> Every now &amp; then, I just put it in a detergent and hot water scrub it a little &amp; let it sit for 1/2 hour.</li>
            <li> it really doesn&#x27;t need replacing, i only replaced it because the other one was trashed in with dust and dirt while moving.</li>
            <li> No signs of mildew or anything in the first few months I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li> After switching to the more delicate blue side, everything went back to normal in a few days.</li>
            <li> To minimize waste, I fold the body scrubber in half twice; that way no soap leaks through it before becoming lather (the process also works with solid bar soap).</li>
            <li> We had gone through 3 different back brushes, always with the same end result: it was hard to keep them clean, and eventually they would get mold.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not long enough to &amp;#34;step&amp;#34;&amp;#34; into or over ...</li>
            <li> If your a larger person you will probably find yourself having to bend your arms a little too much.</li>
            <li> first off, i get horrible back acne and the back brush scrubber irritates my acne and skin more than normal and the  brush also collects mold!</li>
            <li> It is soft on one side and rougher on the other side.</li>
            <li> I am a big guy but the scrubber is long enough for even me.</li>
            <li> You need very little shower gel, it really lathers up.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but the other reviews are right.  </li>
            <li> It might dry you out a bit, especially if you use it every day.</li>
            <li> I am now able to scrub areas of my back which I previously found difficult to reach.</li>
            <li> I have back acne and have tried different methods like baking soda and sea salt scrubbing and other scrubbers.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time, doesn&#x27;t get funky, doesn&#x27;t decay.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not a soft brush feel on your skin, It has some bite to it.</li>
            <li> You dont have to use a lot of soap it retains the lather for a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s generously long and stretchy.  </li>
            <li> Previously I used a number of different handled back scrubbers with brush or loofah heads.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it!</li>
            <li> I bought several back scrubbers recently, and I was not completely satisfied until I got this one.</li>
            <li> The only reason I am getting a replacement is because my old one is tearing in a few spots because I pull on it really hard when I exfoliate my back.  </li>
            <li> Previous body scrubbers/back scrubbers only lasted a month or so for me.  </li>
            <li> I am older and have some chronic serious illness which causes me fatigue ...</li>
            <li> I put it through the washing machine and there&#x27;s still some black mold left.</li>
            <li> Good buy to painful moldy loofahs!</li>
            <li> My skin gradually became smoother and helped with my back acne a little bit.</li>
            <li> i had to replace the brush every other month and although the brush was about $5 to $10 each time, the price adds up and it was a hassel to keep searching for the \\&quot;right\\&quot; one that doesn&#x27;t collect mold... and believe you me</li>
            <li> plus the smoother side works well on other body areas.</li>
            <li> - Seems extremely durable  </li>
            <li> One side is \\&quot;rougher\\&quot; to exfoliate and the other side is \\&quot;smoother.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> The same amount of soap on these starts to wane after I&#x27;m about 1/4-way through scrubbing down, and usually by the time I&#x27;m halfway to 3/4 of the way done</li>
            <li> The other day I noticed black mold on the bottom hanging end.</li>
            <li> This is bigger but less useful--I find it bulky and hard to use due to its size.</li>
            <li> you will never stop because of those hard to get to places on your back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a small to medium build and it seems a little short.</li>
            <li> sooo my back is hard to get to...</li>
            <li> I use body liquid soap,  a little line of it down the center and off I go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Guys, the ladies have been keeping these exfoliators a secret long enough.</li>
            <li> Either way, there are no visible dark patches on it, even upon close examination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We soap it up and it rinses well and doesn&#x27;t get sour or mildew-y.  </li>
            <li> Just in case, I&#x27;ve been careful to shake it out after every shower, and it&#x27;s never grown any fungus or algae, although I&#x27;m not sure if this is due to my habits or the body scrubber itself.</li>
            <li> with this tool ... it cuts a shower time in half .. and the &amp;#34;effort needed&amp;#34; is slashed ...</li>
            <li> A little soap makes mad-crazy lather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit it is a little pricey but trust me, you will not have to buy another one.  </li>
            <li> I wish it were a little longer because of my arthritis</li>
            <li> I know this body exfoliator is a little costly.</li>
            <li> hasn&#x27;t complained of dry skin all winter!</li>
            <li> After using it for a few days now, he said it&#x27;s &amp;#34;the</li>
            <li> I am partly disabled and this makes things a lot easier.  </li>
            <li> I used a heavy duty Supracor MItt for washing my horses for years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used loofah style bands that had string handles that you could pull hard to scrub hard and they lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> It is tough material and holds up a long time.  </li>
            <li> thus, showering is a big chore and difficult now ..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would last me a couple of years since it is somewhat expensive for a body scrubber.</li>
            <li> Yet to see any discoloring and deterioration after some hard scrubbing.</li>
            <li> No mildew or icky smell.  </li>
            <li> Go slowly and find what works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> It works up a thick lather in seconds.</li>
            <li> Other scrubber strips always had water retention that was cold when used.</li>
            <li> yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but</li>
            <li> and I think that text got me off the fence to buy what IS an expensive item ...</li>
            <li> I see now that the NASA text of this product&#x27;s advertising seems to have been removed .. which is too bad ... because it is well engineered</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, mine looks too nasty to use.  </li>
            <li> Even so, I prefer this to a loofa, but it is annoying and wasteful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for a year and am reordering today.  Previous body scrubbers/back scrubbers only lasted a month or so for me.  I roll it up to make a body loofah type thing, then unroll it to get my back.  Lasts a long time, doesn&#x27;t get funky, doesn&#x27;t decay.  The only reason I am getting a replacement is because my old one is tearing in a few spots because I pull on it really hard when I exfoliate my back.  Excellent product.  Top contender for Christmas gifts this year since it is relatively inexpensive, but makes a guy feel pampered in the shower.</li>
            <li> I bought four different Back Scrubbers, hoping I liked at least one of them.&lt;br /&gt;This one does the best job. I like it for the scrubbing performance, it&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;If it was 6 to 9 inches longer it would be super awesome (because it is to short).&lt;br /&gt;But it still works great even if it is short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ralph Sommerstedt</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it! Scubs like nothing I have ever used. Scrubs the entire back easily and can be used for all over the body even the face. I like this better then the face mitt because this scrubber has two sides: one side is a soft scrub and the other is an extra scrub.</li>
            <li> first off, i get horrible back acne and the back brush scrubber irritates my acne and skin more than normal and the  brush also collects mold! yuck! i had to replace the brush every other month and although the brush was about $5 to $10 each time, the price adds up and it was a hassel to keep searching for the \\&quot;right\\&quot; one that doesn&#x27;t collect mold... and believe you me, they eventually start to mold within a month or two.     well, one day my back ance got out of hand and i went to get a \\&quot;back-facial\\&quot;. the nice lady at the spa counter introduced me to this honeycomb body scrubber... it was the best yet. yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but well worth it since it is naturally antifungal, antibacterial and mildew resistant. in the 3 years that i own it, NO MORE BACK ACNE! that&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t collect mold and it is extremely effective yet gentle on my skin. all the acne scars are now gone and i have only replaced it once when i moved to a different apartment. it really doesn&#x27;t need replacing, i only replaced it because the other one was trashed in with dust and dirt while moving. just so you know, the more you use it the color of the scrubber will look duller but that doesn&#x27;t mean it stops working. i just wish it came with free shipping so that i can buy it for everyone i know who has back acne or sensitive skin.     i am still using my second one -- it&#x27;s been 1.5 years now and it still is in good shape! i haven&#x27;t tried the honeycomb bath mitt or facial sponge because this honeycomb body scrubber can also scrub my face! just make sure you use the softer side of the scrubber!</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t anointed this the best body product I&#x27;ve ever owned, I will say that it works nicely to smooth out skin. It might dry you out a bit, especially if you use it every day. It is a good item, though, and does its job well.  I would say that if you are thinking about this or the glove, you should go for the glove. This is bigger but less useful--I find it bulky and hard to use due to its size. I would prefer to have the same honeycomb material in a more manageable form.</li>
            <li> I originally started out with the facial sponge which worked really well for areas that have been waxed/shaved. It exfoliated my skin so well that I had no ingrown hairs or anything.  So i opted to buy the body scrubber. I&#x27;ve only used it for about a week now but so far it seems to work wonders for my skin and is perfect for the hard to reach areas.  An added plus is the fact that its naturally antifungal, antibacterial and allergen free. Winner.</li>
            <li> I bought several back scrubbers recently, and I was not completely satisfied until I got this one. I wanted a slightly scratchy feel when I scrubbed, and loofah and crocheted-hemp back scrubbers felt too smooth. This Stimulite body scrubber has that scratchiness on the rougher side (ahhh!!!) plus the smoother side works well on other body areas. A little soap makes mad-crazy lather.</li>
            <li> First time I tried this and now it is the only one I will buy again. I&#x27;ve used loofah style bands that had string handles that you could pull hard to scrub hard and they lasted a long time. I bought one of those again from Amazon. It fell apart almost immediately. Evidence of a company that cut corners for profit.  I&#x27;ve been slowly Looking around for a good back scrubber...found it! Actually a great scrubber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can pull on this and it gives a little for the elasticity inherent in design and materials, and I realize that I do not have to pull it very hard to get that aggressive scrubbing (unlike the old loofah style).  I use body liquid soap,  a little line of it down the center and off I go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the cost.  Cleans easy and dries well. Other scrubber strips always had water retention that was cold when used.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 6&#x27;4 husband who wanted something with a &amp;#34;rougher&amp;#34; surface.   The length of the scrubber was much too short for him but he liked the overall feel of it so he added a 12&amp;#34; loop of rope to one handle.   After using it for a few days now, he said it&#x27;s &amp;#34;the best he&#x27;s ever had.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This has to be the holy grail of back scrubbers.  I was skeptical at first but the other reviews are right.  This probably will the final backscrubber I will ever buy (I have purchased plenty).    - Easy to use  - keeps soap in the \\&quot;hexagons\\&quot;  - water flows through - easy to clean  - feels good when in use (to me)  - Seems extremely durable  - You don&#x27;t feel like bacteria will collect since it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Good buy to painful moldy loofahs! This is an investment you will never regret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this scrubber to death, it gets all nooks and crannies on your back and anywhere else you want to! My skin gradually became smoother and helped with my back acne a little bit. It really doesn&#x27;t mold and you could leave it wet all morning and night if you wanted to! It is quite fun to put a lot of body wash and cover yourself in bubbles with this.</li>
            <li> This is the second stimulite body scrubber I have owned.  This replaces the one I wore out after about 4 years of using it. These dry out quickly after use, faster than some of the luffa-based scrubbers, which doesn&#x27;t give mildew a chance to form.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would not grow mold. We had gone through 3 different back brushes, always with the same end result: it was hard to keep them clean, and eventually they would get mold. When I bleached them, the bristles would then weaken and fall out. This is just what we needed. It still looks brand new and it&#x27;s been over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a soft brush feel on your skin, It has some bite to it. But it suds up quickly and rinses clean quickly.</li>
            <li> the main rectangle is 22&amp;#34; x 6&amp;#34; and the handles are then attached on to that ... an additional 3.5&amp;#34; out .. in a semi-circle grip&lt;br /&gt;I am female ... 5&#x27;7&amp;#34; .. love this ... it &amp;#34;claimed&amp;#34; a lot ... at the time I ordered this ... it had some text about it being developed by NASA for astronauts to use ... I did not believe until I got it .. it takes a little bit of liquid soap and EASILY suds up&lt;br /&gt;fully ... it has soft exfoliate side and harder side ... i use the white (softer) side .. .it does an amazing job of making a shower FAST and easy.&lt;br /&gt;You can use this to scrub a leg in 4 strokes .. gets to back .. I throw over shoulder ..it&#x27;s not long enough to &amp;#34;step&amp;#34;&amp;#34; into or over ... I am&lt;br /&gt;very happy with this item ... and as long as it&#x27;s available ... I will come back to buy again ... if current one ever goes out ... which it seems&lt;br /&gt;like it won&#x27;t .. it also drys very quickly ... I just hang it on the shower knob .... so I guess all that NASA astronaut stuff was true because&lt;br /&gt;this seems to be a very well engineered item (I have an engineering degree so I do tend to be a demanding customer) ... I know you only&lt;br /&gt;asked about size but I loved this item so much I thought I&#x27;d give a good review of ALL of it at the same time ... since I was already spending&lt;br /&gt;the time here. Hope you enjoy it too ... if you buy it .. and I have no affiliation with this product ... I am just a verified customer ... I am older and have some chronic serious illness which causes me fatigue ... thus, showering is a big chore and difficult now .. with this tool ... it cuts a shower time in half .. and the &amp;#34;effort needed&amp;#34; is slashed ... the shower water shows the dirt that has been removed .. it really is an amazing product  ... and it drys super fast too ... I see now that the NASA text of this product&#x27;s advertising seems to have been removed .. which is too bad ... because it is well engineered and I think that text got me off the fence to buy what IS an expensive item ... but the text was actually telling the truth .. it is worth the extra money ... and I am a frugal buyer .... I would highly recommend it to anyone ...</li>
            <li> Loved this. I have the Mitt and Smaller hand scrubber to.</li>
            <li> Awesome product up reach all those hard to get at areas.</li>
            <li> this is great does a great job of exfoliating my back</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant that this would work since it&#x27;s made of plastic netting-like stuff.  But....it&#x27;s great.  The soap suds up nicely and it is a wonderful back scrubber.  Best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend. One side scrubs the other side polishes leaving your back feeling great he uses it all the time and now he doesn&#x27;t have pimples on his back.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for anyone who is tired of soft scrubbers typically sold in stores. It hadles great and gives you a chance to get a full body rub. If the price was to come down slightly, I would be a more willing purchaser in the future.</li>
            <li> I already own of these and I think everybody should have one. You really can&#x27;t completely get your back clean unless you get a back facial daily-who can really do this? This body scrubber is the solution for that problem and many more. Once you start using this body srubber you will never stop because of those hard to get to places on your back. It also feels amazing. Unlike many other items it is anti-bac and anti-fungal. It was developed by N.A.S.A. Mine has withstood the test of time and it does not show any signs of mildew or wear and tear.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. No mildew buildup. Gets into all those nooks and crannies better than any wash cloth that I&#x27;ve ever used, and durable too. Guys, the ladies have been keeping these exfoliators a secret long enough. I&#x27;m 250lbs. of shower loving man, and this product has changed my whole approach to my daily splash time. For a fun and thorough all over clean, this is the right tool. Get your own!</li>
            <li> I found the scrubber very invigorating and easy to use.  I am now able to scrub areas of my back which I previously found difficult to reach.</li>
            <li> it is ok for a back to scratch it, but too short in length.  I got regret that I did buy it.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this!.  It makes my back feel so smooth.  You need very little shower gel, it really lathers up.</li>
            <li> Pretty scratchy - but okay.</li>
            <li> This is the second body scrubber I&#x27;ve bought from this manufacturer. My first one lasted about five years (though in all honesty I should&#x27;ve replaced it after four). It suds up wonderfully and I have no problem using it to clean all parts of my body. It holds up for years and even after it started tearing into the fourth year of use, it still did its job for one more year! Excellent product and well worth the money:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for the past 2 months and it works way better than any luffa I ever owned.  I&#x27;ll admit it is a little pricey but trust me, you will not have to buy another one.  Really strong and durable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a small to medium build and it seems a little short. If your a larger person you will probably find yourself having to bend your arms a little too much. No signs of mildew or anything in the first few months I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li> This has been such a great product for the skin. This is one of three in our home...they are easy to keep clean and do a fantastic job at keeping the skin exfoliated and healthier looking.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this scrubber...hasn&#x27;t complained of dry skin all winter!</li>
            <li> Works great!  Far better than a traditional scrub brush!</li>
            <li> I loved this body scrubber so Much I bought another one. You dont have to use a lot of soap it retains the lather for a long time. Your skin feels exhilarated afterwards. It is easy to clean, to wash back you have to throw it over shoulders as shown. All in all Love it!</li>
            <li> OMG! My skin felt so tingly and clean after using this on my back. This is one back (or body) scrubber you really should buy. I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> Love this body scrubber.. just does wonders, soft on one side and exfoliating on the other.. Finally a product that I can use without trying to use a brush on my back.. I recommend this highly.. I use it on my entire body, works great.. buy one, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This body scrubber is very handy. One side is \\&quot;rougher\\&quot; to exfoliate and the other side is \\&quot;smoother.\\&quot;  Soap lathers up easily in and on the scrubber and then rinses out when you&#x27;re finished using it.  I am a big guy but the scrubber is long enough for even me.</li>
            <li> These have the perfect amount of roughness, enough to really get a good scrub and feel clean but not so much they&#x27;re uncomfortable to use. I bought the three-piece gift set since I wanted the mitt and back scrubber and that way you basically get the facial sponge for free. I mainly use the mitt, rarely use the back scrubber (it works ok, I just feel the mitt does good enough and to use the back scrubber would take more soap), and I may have used the facial sponge once, but more for trying it out than anything. I love how well it scrubs, how easy it is to rinse out, and how much more natural it feels to scrub down with a glove than a poofy ball (loofa). However, it does have a drawback, which is that it doesn&#x27;t lather very well. I can put some soap on a loofa and have plenty to cover my whole body and still have enough left to take some time to rinse out when I&#x27;m done. The same amount of soap on these starts to wane after I&#x27;m about 1/4-way through scrubbing down, and usually by the time I&#x27;m halfway to 3/4 of the way done I&#x27;m having to add more soap. I also have to keep flipping it or scrubbing with the back of my hand, because the soap is constantly pushed out to the side opposite the side I&#x27;m using. Even so, I prefer this to a loofa, but it is annoying and wasteful.</li>
            <li> This really does a great job on your back, feet - everything.  It is a bit rough, but I believe it does a great job of exfoliating your skin.  I am partly disabled and this makes things a lot easier.  I&#x27;m tempted to get one to just use as a back scratcher!</li>
            <li> These scrubbers are the best!! I use both the mitt and the body scrubber, and have had them for over a year. Both look brand new. They do not mold or mildew and rinse totally clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to give them to friends as Christmas gifts this year and am looking forward to their comments!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean and fresh,&lt;br /&gt;Happy customer</li>
            <li> The material creates a lot of lather, and I am pleased with how it stimulates my skin when using it.  I wish it were a little longer because of my arthritis but this is not a deal breaker.  The cost was a bit pricey, but I chose to buy it anyway because of its claims that it is naturally Antifungal, Antibacterial and Mildew Resistant.  I have extremely sensitive skin and this claimer was the Number 1 reason that I was willing to pay the price for it. Reviewers say they have not had any problems and have had theirs for years.  Unfortunately, mine looks too nasty to use.  It made my bathroom look unclean too.  I contacted the seller and was told they would contact the manufacturer.  That&#x27;s been months ago and I haven&#x27;t heard a word since.  This is a deal breaker!</li>
            <li> Oddly enough I found myself thinking of buy a $30 shower accessory, if you are in the same boat, this is it. The number of 4&amp;5 star reviews are there for a reason.</li>
            <li> This body scrubber is fantastic! I love it for three reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. At first, I used the rougher green side liberally for the body, but my enthusiasm was misguided; now I know that too much scrubbing leads to irritation. After switching to the more delicate blue side, everything went back to normal in a few days. Now, I use it to gently exfoliate my whole body, but never my face. Go slowly and find what works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It works up a thick lather in seconds. My personal favorite is Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soap; just a few drops (approx. 8-10) followed by repeated squeezing movements, and it&#x27;s good to go. To minimize waste, I fold the body scrubber in half twice; that way no soap leaks through it before becoming lather (the process also works with solid bar soap). I&#x27;ve saved money this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s really well-made. After a year of use, it still looks, smells, and feels brand new, completely free of tears. Just in case, I&#x27;ve been careful to shake it out after every shower, and it&#x27;s never grown any fungus or algae, although I&#x27;m not sure if this is due to my habits or the body scrubber itself. Either way, there are no visible dark patches on it, even upon close examination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dad was so impressed with the body scrubber that he asked me to purchase one for his personal use (he goes on business trips with some regularity). I&#x27;d recommend it to just about anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my son has bacne and I thought it would help exfoliate his skin.  I love using it too.  It has a softer side and a rougher side so you have a choice for what fits your need.  We soap it up and it rinses well and doesn&#x27;t get sour or mildew-y.  It&#x27;s generously long and stretchy.  I&#x27;m going to order some more as gifts.</li>
            <li> I have back acne and have tried different methods like baking soda and sea salt scrubbing and other scrubbers. I have been using this product a couple weeks now and this seems to work the best. It is very worth the investment instead of getting ten cheap loofas. I love how it leaves the back squeeky clean very easy to use for unreachable areas on your back. I use it for my whole body because it has a soft side on it to so you can alternate how strong you want to exfoliate. I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews but this product is so awesome I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The scrubber has 2 different textures; one pretty scratchy (great for back and feet),  the other side is softer.  I soap it up and use it like a washcloth.  It is a bit tricky to hold onto, but I love the invigorated feeling I have after I have scrubbed my entire body down.&lt;br /&gt;It dries quickly.  No mildew or icky smell.  I used a heavy duty Supracor MItt for washing my horses for years.  It is tough material and holds up a long time.  This was a bit spendy, but I think it will serve me for many years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more stinking washcloths!</li>
            <li> Terrific.  No more wash cloths as the soft side is great for exfoliating your face and the other side is great for the rest of your body.  They only last about a year or two but I think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I really liked this. I bought it less than a year ago, and it was working great. I have it hanging off of a shower caddy, and I rinse it thoroughly after each use and then it dries as it hangs. The other day I noticed black mold on the bottom hanging end. What the heck!? This CLEARLY states &amp;#34;antifungal, antimicrobial, and mildew resistant&amp;#34;. I put it through the washing machine and there&#x27;s still some black mold left. I&#x27;m very disappointed. It didn&#x27;t even last a full year of being so-called resistant. I was hoping it would last me a couple of years since it is somewhat expensive for a body scrubber. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll replace it.</li>
            <li> I  wish every product I purchased made me this happy. Previously I used a number of different handled back scrubbers with brush or loofah heads. This is without reservation the best back scrubber I&#x27;ve ever used. Almost not purchased due to the higher price point, but worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This one is pricey... but very worth it... I have a lot of arthritis and can&#x27;t reach very well... sooo my back is hard to get to... and I have tried many types of body scrubbers and this is by far my favorite... not sorry I bought it at all... one side is a little softer than the other and my husband likes that side the best... but I love the sturdier side for me... I think it will last a long time and be plenty worth the money... I am already thrilled with it!!!</li>
            <li> Love this. Just the right amount of exfoliation. Dries easily for a gym bag.</li>
            <li> This really scrubs wonderfully well. It is easy to rinse too! Yet to see any discoloring and deterioration after some hard scrubbing. Bought the whole set (Facial, Mitt and Back). Now thinking of getting for my kids too. :)</li>
            <li> I know this body exfoliator is a little costly. It is a superb product and is the last one you&#x27;ll ever need. It is soft on one side and rougher on the other side. It does a great job on your back. The soft side I use on the rest of my body. This product is truly anti-bacterial and is very easy to keep clean. Every now &amp; then, I just put it in a detergent and hot water scrub it a little &amp; let it sit for 1/2 hour. The product comes out like the day you bought it. This one is for the second bathroom.</li>
            <li> I love the device has soft (white) and harder (blue) side. It is a bit pricy and I was hesitant because of that BUT I will buy another one! Just because I am thrifty I will watch for a sale or a coupon next time. If you are looking for a quality back scrubber this is it.</li>
