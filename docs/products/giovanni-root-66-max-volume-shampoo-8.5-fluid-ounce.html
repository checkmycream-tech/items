            <li>Avalon Organics Shampoo, Biotin B-Complex, Thickening, 14 Ounce]] - the two combined packs a great punch for all-day volume and cleansing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would even say it is every bit as good as Wen for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>Its a good unisex smell.</li>
            <li>Giovanni&#x27;s Root 66 Max Volume shampoo delivers a very impressive performance for those with fine hair looking for some more volume.</li>
            <li>My favorite!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Giovanni&#x27;s Root 66 does exactly that for me, and I especially love that it is 100% cruelty free, and it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li>My hair feels amazing and doesn&#x27;t get greasy.  </li>
            <li>amazing.</li>
            <li>I loved it except that it is runnier than most shampoo.</li>
            <li>i have tried so many, and this is amazing.</li>
            <li>The soft floral scent is very pleasant.</li>
            <li>the rest of the day and still have most of the benefits to my hair.  </li>
            <li>It saves time and gave my hair more volume than the rinse-away one.  </li>
            <li>This is 1000 times better than Dove.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo isn&#x27;t any better than any sulfate-free drugstore variety.</li>
            <li>Love everything about it.  </li>
            <li>and unfortuatly it made it break even more.</li>
            <li>and she had me order her 2 more bottles.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband&#x27;s thinning hair and it does a better job than the over priced Nioxin</li>
            <li>i love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Gives my hair a healthy look and feel.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is like no other!Hair becomes more resilient to breakage.</li>
            <li>Thought it was a good opportunity to find a more natural alternative.  </li>
            <li>I use it for my daughter&#x27;s fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day because it&#x27;s extremely fine (and color-treated)</li>
            <li>This watery consistency allows for better rinsing and no build up so this shampoo is ideal for those of us with oily hair and wash daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had previously been using Biolage Volumatherapie shampoo and after using Giovanni&#x27;s Root 66 shampoo coupled with the conditioner I am a convert.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t make my hair smooth like Tresemme.</li>
            <li>but you can&#x27;t expect a sodium lauryl sulfate free product to lather as well as the harsher products.</li>
            <li>I switched my shampoo, detergent, soaps, everything to SLS free products.</li>
            <li>LOVE this shampoo (and the conditioner) for my straight fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I settled on this one as my favorite for how it gave my hair much needed volume and got my hair clean without stripping it.  </li>
            <li>Unlike most all natural shampoos this one acutally gets my hair clean!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve not to wind up with a palm full of the stuff.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re full of volume now.</li>
            <li>&quot; It is a good value, even though I wish it came in bigger bottles.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good conditioner.</li>
            <li>I feel it strips my hair of any moisture that it has, even if i use adequate amount of conditioner.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product along with the conditioner to anyone looking for more volume and those that want to kick the synthetic tripe to the trash.</li>
            <li>After two years of continuous use, I have had some regrowth of my hair, my hair grows faster and looks much more healthy, and for the first time in years I have been able to grow my hair out past my shoulders without damage.</li>
            <li>I have to use a little more of the product than I had to when using the Biologe salon shampoo line, but I feel so much better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this shampoo would work good for some people, but it striped and dried my hair out and made it break alot, my hair is fine and dry</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if other folks aren&#x27;t noticing (because so far my hair had still looked great) or this doesn&#x27;t happen to everyone.</li>
            <li>But much better than a moisturizing or regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>Kinda let too much spill out first time</li>
            <li>Smells great, made with organic/natural ingredients, adds volume, cleans deeply without drying or adding weight, nice lather, not too expensive.  </li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo from a local health food store and thought I loved it, it left my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair light clean and fluffy.  </li>
            <li>Shampoo is very watery</li>
            <li>Thanks, Giovanni.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tad runny, but not so much that I wouldn&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li>I also have a problem with having too much oil.</li>
            <li>I have very thing hair but can see results with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>bought my 8.5 oz bottle of Giovanni Root 66 shampoo at Whole Foods for $7.99, though do check out TJ Maxx and Marshalls</li>
            <li>But I probarly will not be buying this product again, but the price was good and that was why I didnt rate it poorly.</li>
            <li>My issue is my hair seems to be falling out a lot more than usual, it&#x27;s making my head itch</li>
            <li>, so I need a shampoo that will clean it thoroughly enough to go a couple of days without washing it and give it enough volume to style it, which means it can&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
            <li>A definite A+, if you are going to go all natural try this one first.</li>
            <li>I have fine, limp hair that gets oily by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>I gave my 86 year old mother some</li>
            <li>The soft an shiny part is harder to achieve, since I live in the desert, and the water is kind of hard.</li>
            <li>After trying other products without success I found the Giovanni line of products.</li>
            <li>If you really want to try it go for it but check very carefully after the first 2 or so uses that your hairline looks the same.  </li>
            <li>The creamy consistency makes the conditioner easy to apply, and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There is no off-putting smell like some natural shampoos have, this stuff actually has a fruity, floral, coconut scent, not in a way that is overly feminine.</li>
            <li>I grew up near historic US Highway 66, so I appreciate the pun in the name of this product, \\&quot;Root</li>
            <li>This product definitely accomplishes the first objective, making it easy to comb through my thick tresses and braid them, while they are still wet.</li>
            <li>I pulled up my daughters bangs and saw little tiny short hairs at the hairline where she used to have full length hair.  </li>
            <li>buy conditioner for two reasons: 1) to de-tangle my long hair and 2) to make it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>And my hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry the way it did with another all natural shampoo/conditioner that I tried.  </li>

            <li> And my hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry the way it did with another all natural shampoo/conditioner that I tried.  </li>
            <li> SLS causes me to break out in hives in the short term and long term exposure causes male pattern hair loss.</li>
            <li> This left my hair limp and flat using the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have very damaged hair from the years of sulfate exposure, with bald patches, and it was very dull and lifeless.</li>
            <li> It helps with volume, but not as much as expected.  </li>
            <li> My biggest issue is the amount of waste - no squeezing needed here; the design of this shampoo bottle is such that it just pours out.</li>
            <li> I use a conventional styling product and blow dry and straighten my hair</li>
            <li> We have hard water and previously have used somewhat &amp;#34;stripping&amp;#34; shampoos so maybe our hair was more vulnerable to damage from this.  </li>
            <li> Idk if it will help other types of hair but this just wasnt a hit and run for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my go-to shampoo, especially in the summertime when the heat makes my hair even lankier than usual.</li>
            <li> Giovanni makes a number of other shampoos and conditioners tailored to each hair type, so find yours and give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair feels lifeless and dry and i usually have a greasy scalp and dry ends.</li>
            <li> and I felt like I lost half of it in my hands transferring to my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tired several other cheaper ones in the past but they did not work.</li>
            <li> I just got this and the conditioner a few days ago</li>
            <li> and so far I&#x27;m not impressed.  </li>
            <li> Very few shampoos work for me.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not OK with itchy, dull, falling out hair.</li>
            <li> doesnt mean it wouldnt work for someone else.</li>
            <li> - I bought a 33.8 oz bottle of the conditioner there for a measly $12.99.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy. :-(</li>

            <li> It helps with volume, but not as much as expected.  But much better than a moisturizing or regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make my hair smooth like Tresemme. Shampoo is very watery and I felt like I lost half of it in my hands transferring to my hair.</li>
            <li> I went from using salon shampoos to using this one. When I realized that salon shampoos were contributing to my headaches and fuzziness feelings, I finally looked for non-allergenic shampoos. After trying other products without success I found the Giovanni line of products. Every one I tried had the non-allergic properties I needed.  I settled on this one as my favorite for how it gave my hair much needed volume and got my hair clean without stripping it.  I have to use a little more of the product than I had to when using the Biologe salon shampoo line, but I feel so much better the rest of the day and still have most of the benefits to my hair.  I also tried the matching rinse, but decided on the leave-in rinse instead.  It saves time and gave my hair more volume than the rinse-away one.  With the Giovanni line of hair products, you don&#x27;t have to suffer to be beautiful.</li>
            <li> LOVE this shampoo (and the conditioner) for my straight fine hair.  My favorite!  Was devoted to Dove for years and then they switched their formula and I was no longer a fan.  Thought it was a good opportunity to find a more natural alternative.  This is 1000 times better than Dove.  My hair feels amazing and doesn&#x27;t get greasy.  Even after days of not washing and conditioning!  And my hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry the way it did with another all natural shampoo/conditioner that I tried.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this product. Unlike most all natural shampoos this one acutally gets my hair clean! Not only that but it actually does give my hair body!! It&#x27;s a miracle! Sometimes I lather, rinse and repeat because I feel like there is not enough lather but you can&#x27;t expect a sodium lauryl sulfate free product to lather as well as the harsher products. A definite A+, if you are going to go all natural try this one first.</li>
            <li> This shampoo isn&#x27;t any better than any sulfate-free drugstore variety. My biggest issue is the amount of waste - no squeezing needed here; the design of this shampoo bottle is such that it just pours out. It&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve not to wind up with a palm full of the stuff. I would not recommend or repurchase.</li>
            <li> I have fine, limp hair that gets oily by the end of the day.  Very few shampoos work for me.  This shampoo ROCKS.  Smells great, made with organic/natural ingredients, adds volume, cleans deeply without drying or adding weight, nice lather, not too expensive.  Love everything about it.  Thanks, Giovanni.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this shampoo would work good for some people, but it striped and dried my hair out and made it break alot, my hair is fine and dry so it breaks alot already and unfortuatly it made it break even more. But it might have different effects on different people, just cause it didnt work for me doesnt mean it wouldnt work for someone else. But I probarly will not be buying this product again, but the price was good and that was why I didnt rate it poorly.</li>
            <li> I just got this and the conditioner a few days ago and so far I&#x27;m not impressed.  I will keep using it for a week or so to allow my hair to adjust, but I&#x27;m not hopeful.  I do like the way it smells.  It&#x27;s a tad runny, but not so much that I wouldn&#x27;t use it.  My issue is my hair seems to be falling out a lot more than usual, it&#x27;s making my head itch and my hair feels drier and and looks duller.  I bought this because I&#x27;m cleaning up my act and looking for &amp;#34;greener&#x27; personal care products, and I fully expect a  transition time...a detox of sorts.  But I&#x27;m not OK with itchy, dull, falling out hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff utterly fried my already damaged hair.  Used only ONCE. Very unhappy. :-(</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo after reading reviews about it in a magazine. It works well. I gave my 86 year old mother some and she had me order her 2 more bottles. We&#x27;re full of volume now. It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband&#x27;s thinning hair and it does a better job than the over priced Nioxin and it&#x27;s organic.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have a severe allergic reaction to sodium lauryl/laureth sulfates. SLS causes me to break out in hives in the short term and long term exposure causes male pattern hair loss. I went years losing my hair and no doctor could tell me why until a friend clued me in on SLS sensitivity. I switched my shampoo, detergent, soaps, everything to SLS free products. This formula does wonders on my hair. I would even say it is every bit as good as Wen for a fraction of the cost. There is no off-putting smell like some natural shampoos have, this stuff actually has a fruity, floral, coconut scent, not in a way that is overly feminine. Its a good unisex smell. I have very damaged hair from the years of sulfate exposure, with bald patches, and it was very dull and lifeless. I also have a problem with having too much oil. This formula, along with the conditioner of the same formula, gives my hair shine, body, and life. After two years of continuous use, I have had some regrowth of my hair, my hair grows faster and looks much more healthy, and for the first time in years I have been able to grow my hair out past my shoulders without damage. I will never stop using this. Love it!</li>
            <li> I use it for my daughter&#x27;s fine hair.  The shampoo leaves it looking thicker and voluminous.</li>
            <li> I loved it except that it is runnier than most shampoo. Kinda let too much spill out first time cause I was not expecting this</li>
            <li> I have used this product twice. Each time wishing for a different result. I was drawn by this line since it is 100% vegetarian.  I feel it strips my hair of any moisture that it has, even if i use adequate amount of conditioner. My hair feels lifeless and dry and i usually have a greasy scalp and dry ends. I will be switching as soon as possible. Idk if it will help other types of hair but this just wasnt a hit and run for me.</li>
            <li> amazing. i love this shampoo. i have tried so many, and this is amazing.</li>
            <li> Good product! After reading about it couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere that&#x27;s why I had to buy it online. Gives my hair a healthy look and feel.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. It&#x27;s my go-to shampoo, especially in the summertime when the heat makes my hair even lankier than usual. I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day because it&#x27;s extremely fine (and color-treated), so I need a shampoo that will clean it thoroughly enough to go a couple of days without washing it and give it enough volume to style it, which means it can&#x27;t leave any residue. Giovanni&#x27;s Root 66 does exactly that for me, and I especially love that it is 100% cruelty free, and it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li> I have very thing hair but can see results with this shampoo. I&#x27;ve tired several other cheaper ones in the past but they did not work. I intent to use it in the future. I&#x27;m on my third bottle.</li>
            <li> Giovanni&#x27;s Root 66 Max Volume shampoo delivers a very impressive performance for those with fine hair looking for some more volume. The shampoo is made up of 100% vegetarian ingredients as well as a blend of organic oils - the star ingredient is horsetail extract, which has numerous benefits for the hair including adding volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is fruity and refreshing and the consistency is somewhat closer to \\&quot;watery\\&quot; so be wary to avoid squeezing when applying to the hands. This watery consistency allows for better rinsing and no build up so this shampoo is ideal for those of us with oily hair and wash daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had previously been using Biolage Volumatherapie shampoo and after using Giovanni&#x27;s Root 66 shampoo coupled with the conditioner I am a convert. This all-natural product outdoes the synthetic shampoos in every category. I highly recommend this product along with the conditioner to anyone looking for more volume and those that want to kick the synthetic tripe to the trash. Giovanni makes a number of other shampoos and conditioners tailored to each hair type, so find yours and give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally like to mix this shampoo with [[ASIN:B0016BC2BM Avalon Organics Shampoo, Biotin B-Complex, Thickening, 14 Ounce]] - the two combined packs a great punch for all-day volume and cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my 8.5 oz bottle of Giovanni Root 66 shampoo at Whole Foods for $7.99, though do check out TJ Maxx and Marshalls - I bought a 33.8 oz bottle of the conditioner there for a measly $12.99.</li>
            <li> I grew up near historic US Highway 66, so I appreciate the pun in the name of this product, \\&quot;Root 66.\\&quot; It is a good value, even though I wish it came in bigger bottles. The soft floral scent is very pleasant. The creamy consistency makes the conditioner easy to apply, and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy conditioner for two reasons: 1) to de-tangle my long hair and 2) to make it soft and shiny. This product definitely accomplishes the first objective, making it easy to comb through my thick tresses and braid them, while they are still wet. The soft an shiny part is harder to achieve, since I live in the desert, and the water is kind of hard. Overall, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good conditioner.</li>
            <li> I needed something that would help restore moisture to my hair. This shampoo with the conditioner too seems to be working well.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is awesome</li>
            <li> This left my hair limp and flat using the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo from a local health food store and thought I loved it, it left my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair light clean and fluffy.  But after 1 week of use I pulled my hair back with a headband and noticed my hairline had moved up my forehead and towards my scalp.  I pulled up my daughters bangs and saw little tiny short hairs at the hairline where she used to have full length hair.  So I threw it out. I researched before buying it and it has rave reviews,except for one I found specifically by googling root 66 hair loss that mentions this same issue.  I don&#x27;t know if other folks aren&#x27;t noticing (because so far my hair had still looked great) or this doesn&#x27;t happen to everyone. We have hard water and previously have used somewhat &amp;#34;stripping&amp;#34; shampoos so maybe our hair was more vulnerable to damage from this.  I use a conventional styling product and blow dry and straighten my hair but my daughter just air dries hers so that can&#x27;t be it.  We also used a different brand of conditioner maybe the root 66 conditioner is designed to avoid this but then they should only sell them as a set!  If you really want to try it go for it but check very carefully after the first 2 or so uses that your hairline looks the same.  Neither of us noticed extra hair in the shower drain or in her brush so I don&#x27;t know where it all went!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is like no other!Hair becomes more resilient to breakage.In 2weeks you can see and feel the difference.A bit pricey but that doesn&#x27;t matter when you see the massive results!</li>
