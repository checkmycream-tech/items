            <li>I love design essential products..</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny and really work on my hair.  </li>
            <li>The sheen wasn&#x27;t shinny enough for me though, and after reading the ingredients, it&#x27;s mostly just silicones which I avoid in hair products for my hair, hence the reason for the 3 stars.  </li>

            <li>Makes my hair very manageable and soft with light sheen.  </li>

            <li>This product is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised that I could get it  without buying it from a salon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many \\&quot;shine\\&quot; products in the past (both expensive/inexpensive) and found none that gives this product&#x27;s result!</li>
            <li>It a gave decent sheen, and sealed my hair once I ran the flat iron over it after spraying this on.</li>
            <li>I used this just prior to applying heat from flat iron to my hair and get very \\&quot;silky\\&quot; straight results from my extremely coily/kinky hair.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, but like to blow it out and flat iron it from time to time.</li>

            <li> I love design essential products.. Enough said!</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair and it is difficult to find a product that brings that reflective pretty sheen to my finished styled hair.  I&#x27;ve used many \\&quot;shine\\&quot; products in the past (both expensive/inexpensive) and found none that gives this product&#x27;s result! WOW! This product is excellent!</li>
            <li> Great product will re-order when time</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product i totally cannot do without it .....leaves her nice and shinny with out weighing it down</li>
            <li> This is great for shine and luster.  Is not sticky and helps hair to look healthier.  The price is so  much better than you will get at any salon.  Been using this for years.  Loves it.</li>
            <li> I love the sheen and luster it gives my hair. The smell is a &amp;#34;just stepped out of the salon&amp;#34; scent. I use it after I have blow dried and fat ironed my hair. This is part of my hair grooming to go bag.</li>
            <li> Light and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down. I like that it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out. I have been a fan of this product for years</li>
            <li> This liquid shine is a perfect product from Design Essentials. My beautician no longer carries the product so I was very happy to find it on Amazon. It is a non greasy product that does not weigh your hair down. It gives your hair a nice lustrous shine that lasts all day and has a nice light scent to it. I highly recommend this product. Get your shine on!!</li>
            <li> Great product with a refreshing smell. Very light so it doesn&#x27;t leave buildup. Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this light weight oil. It smells good and it does not weigh the hair down. I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It goes on easily and is not greasy. It also adds a lot of shine.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist uses this and makes my hair shine which is why I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Tried many of the cheaper spray shines.  Nothing works like this to give shine &amp; body to my &amp;#34;hard to straighten&amp;#34; hair.  I spray it on each strand as I use my straightener.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Nice shine you only need to spray lightly</li>
            <li> Great product. Smells wonderful. Arrived on time and in great condition.</li>
            <li> it came early the packaging was awesome a nice hard box with foam around it to keep the contents from spilling. I love the product and I would definitely be ordering it again</li>
            <li> Love the shine and how it helps complete your desired look</li>
            <li> Reflection Liquid Shine (RLS) keep my hair easy to manage and looking great.  Before using RLS my hair was stringy and would not hold curls.  It is worth every penny and really work on my hair.  I high recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair very manageable and soft with light sheen.  Prompt delivery and good price.  Normally 17.00 to 18.00 dollars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before, and loved i.. I was surprised that I could get it  without buying it from a salon.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It only takes very little of this product for desired results.  I used this just prior to applying heat from flat iron to my hair and get very \\&quot;silky\\&quot; straight results from my extremely coily/kinky hair.</li>
            <li> It came just in time; perfect!</li>
            <li> Does not make my African kinky hair shine.  Just greasy.  I purchased it because of the reviews, however it did not work for me.  Will not purchase this product again</li>
            <li> I use this spray before I straighten and its wonderful.  Besides not being heavy on my hair, the spray has a lovely smell.  A little goes a long way and when paired with the other products its a hit.</li>
            <li> This product along with Moroccan Hair Mask makes my natural coily hair so straight and soft.  This product is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.  With three daughters this is the product we all love.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, but like to blow it out and flat iron it from time to time. I have a friend who&#x27;s hair dresser uses this on her hair, and so I thought I would try it. It a gave decent sheen, and sealed my hair once I ran the flat iron over it after spraying this on. The sheen wasn&#x27;t shinny enough for me though, and after reading the ingredients, it&#x27;s mostly just silicones which I avoid in hair products for my hair, hence the reason for the 3 stars.  It&#x27;s still sitting in the cabinet under my bathroom sink. Wasn&#x27;t overly impressed.</li>
            <li> Great product and name brand. First introduced to this product at beauty salons. Then I started purchasing it a few years ago. Leaves great shine and silkiness on relaxed hair without weighing hair down. You only need a small spritz on each parted section of hair for flat ironing hair.</li>
            <li> Loved this product.  It is not greasy at all and very light on your hair.  All you need is about the size of a dime to put in your hair no matter what length you have.  The rest of Design Essential products are also great.</li>
