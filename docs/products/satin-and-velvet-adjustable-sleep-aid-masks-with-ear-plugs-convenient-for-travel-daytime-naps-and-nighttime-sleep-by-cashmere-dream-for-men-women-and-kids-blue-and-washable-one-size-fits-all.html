            <li>I have gone through many sleep mask and</li>
            <li>Really love this sleep mask.  </li>
            <li>Someone gave this to me as a gift and have been sleeping more sound ever since!</li>

            <li>It keeps out all light!</li>
            <li>I love this eyemask.</li>
            <li>just makes me feel better..</li>
            <li>I do wish the strap was maybe 1&amp;#34; longer, I like the head band fairly loose, but all and all its the best 1 I have ever had very comfortable</li>
            <li>Also, I am excited to know that I have a companion for when I travel!</li>
            <li>I love this masks and this really is FABULOUS.</li>
            <li>It blocks out all the light to help me sleep better.</li>
            <li>The Cashmere eye mask and bonus comfortable ear plugs have given me restful nights and much more energy during the day.  </li>
            <li>Great product, I was waking up early every morning and couldn&#x27;t figure out why.</li>
            <li>These are really cool!</li>
            <li>was) easily disturbed at night and sometimes didn&#x27;t get the REM sleep I need.  </li>
            <li>The soft ear plugs with holder are a nice bonus!</li>
            <li>They are soft and comfortable and block light about as good as it gets around the nose.</li>
            <li>It even has an adjustable strap so it will fit anyone.</li>
            <li>It blocks out all light.</li>
            <li>These are quite comfortable, and do the job well.</li>
            <li>but it said buy one get one free</li>
            <li>They block out all the light, I can&#x27;t sleep without them now.</li>
            <li>And the earplugs block out the sound.</li>
            <li>It is so light and comfortable</li>
            <li>Mask feels like butter and fits comfortable around my face.</li>
            <li>The material is light and comfy.  </li>
            <li>When I want a good sleep and to feel rich and sexy, I definitely want to be wearing this mask.</li>
            <li>The inside of this mask is a very soft fabric which is nice.  </li>
            <li>This seemed to be soft and nice quality.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to wear and blocks the light really well.</li>
            <li>The lip near the nose lets more light in than it blocks.</li>
            <li>This is a decent mask for the price, but there are better ones out there.</li>
            <li>I had ordered a wonderful mask on Amazon that is no longer sold on the site (and alas, I can&#x27;t remember the name), that was huge, silky, plushy and cheaper.</li>
            <li>just as expected, nice mask!</li>
            <li>A little larger and cushier would be nice, but for the price these are great... comfortable and sturdy.</li>
            <li>First night I put them on, I was asleep in 6 minutes!</li>
            <li>Really blocks out the light.  </li>
            <li>this by far is my favorite.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;cashmere&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;velvet&amp;#34; reference made me think this would be a nice, big,  plushy mask.</li>
            <li>I can now block out any light at night and sleep soundly at the same time!  </li>
            <li>Not only does it block out the light and sound....</li>
            <li>I slept with it on last night and it was very comfortable</li>
            <li>This is the first one I have that is adjustable.  </li>
            <li>Very lightweight so comfortable, but totally blocks light.</li>
            <li>, I needed a sleep aid that provided a long lasting great feel and works to keep unwanted noise out when I need  quality sleep.</li>
            <li>The wide band with velcro makes it easy to adjust the mask for a snug fit.  </li>
            <li>It is also not large enough, in my opinion again, to block out all the light, as during sleep the elastic band moves, and I end up &amp;#34;seeing&amp;#34; the light at dawn more times than not.</li>
            <li>Such a simple product to be so effective &amp; appreciated!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure an individual with a different size and shaped nose than my own might have a better or worse opinion.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sleeping that really provides cashmere dreams...</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price, but I should have spend a little more and gotten a bigger one.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t cover the light as expected</li>
            <li>I bought this for a fellow scuba/travel buddy due to their inability to sleep with light streaming in the room.  </li>
            <li>Packaged very professional.</li>
            <li>The mask itself seems a bit small and has to be pulled rather tight in order to block out most of the light.</li>
            <li>Cozy comfortable mask.</li>
            <li>This mask is very well made and will last for years!</li>
            <li>Literally like the elastic was too old and just gave way.</li>
            <li>Wow the Cashmere Dream</li>
            <li>and I have no trouble sleeping during the day as I use this mask along with the earplugs.</li>
            <li>This had often left me tired during the day to the point where I would need to take a nap, (if I was even able to)!  </li>
            <li>Soft, lightproof; wish it was larger.</li>

            <li> I have to have it dark to sleep so I like sleep masks.  This is the first one I have that is adjustable.  The wide band with velcro makes it easy to adjust the mask for a snug fit.  The inside of this mask is a very soft fabric which is nice.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> These are really cool! Helps tremendously when falling asleep becomes difficult.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought a set of these for my husband and myself. They are soft and comfortable and block light about as good as it gets around the nose. I&#x27;m sure an individual with a different size and shaped nose than my own might have a better or worse opinion.We have no problems with them. They do the trick.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Very lightweight so comfortable, but totally blocks light.</li>
            <li> The mask came in on time and looks very nice and feels comfortable. The ear plugs that came with mine weren&#x27;t great but I didn&#x27;t buy it for that. Mask stayed on majority of the night at some point fell off but I have 0 complaints :)</li>
            <li> This mask is very well made and will last for years! It even has an adjustable strap so it will fit anyone. I slept with it on last night and it was very comfortable, it didn&#x27;t bother me in any way, I could hardly tell I was wearing it.</li>
            <li> Cozy comfortable mask. It&#x27;s adjustable and fit perfectly. It blocks out all light. I have gone through many sleep mask and this by far is my favorite.</li>

            <li> Really love this sleep mask.  It is comfortable to wear and blocks the light really well.</li>
            <li> The strap popped after just a few night.... Literally like the elastic was too old and just gave way. I&#x27;ve already replaced it with a different product.</li>
            <li> I love this masks and this really is FABULOUS.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t cover the light as expected</li>
            <li> Nice product but it said buy one get one free and I only got one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, so the band will not go straight back without hitting my ears. The satin on the front and velcro on the band are not friends. The velcro snags the satin. Not bad for the price, but I should have spend a little more and gotten a bigger one.</li>
            <li> just as expected, nice mask!</li>
            <li> This seemed to be soft and nice quality. It came in a cheap, plastic bag which I was a little disappointed which since it was for a gift.</li>
            <li> First night I put them on, I was asleep in 6 minutes! They block out all the light, I can&#x27;t sleep without them now.</li>
            <li> This mask is amazing! It blocks out all the light to help me sleep better. And the earplugs block out the sound. I know what I&#x27;m gonna be buying a lot of my tense, sleep deprived friends for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I can now block out any light at night and sleep soundly at the same time!  Also, I am excited to know that I have a companion for when I travel!</li>
            <li> Wow the Cashmere Dream Sleeping Aid Eye Mask is just what the doctor ordered.  I am a very light sleeper and so I am (was) easily disturbed at night and sometimes didn&#x27;t get the REM sleep I need.  This had often left me tired during the day to the point where I would need to take a nap, (if I was even able to)!  The Cashmere eye mask and bonus comfortable ear plugs have given me restful nights and much more energy during the day.  Thank you for this great product.</li>
            <li> Great product, I was waking up early every morning and couldn&#x27;t figure out why. Someone gave this to me as a gift and have been sleeping more sound ever since! It is so light and comfortable that I didn&#x27;t even know it was there!! Must have!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  I bought this for a fellow scuba/travel buddy due to their inability to sleep with light streaming in the room.  Such a simple product to be so effective &amp; appreciated!  The ear buds are a definite bonus!</li>
            <li> I love this! I&#x27;ve been sleeping so much better.</li>
            <li> This was a great Eye mask. I work nights and I have no trouble sleeping during the day as I use this mask along with the earplugs. Thanks</li>
            <li> I bought two of these! One for my husband and one for myself! It keeps out all light!</li>
            <li> The perfect solution for undisturbed sleep that offers amazing wear comfort. The remedy I was looking for with a schedule as demanding as mine, I needed a sleep aid that provided a long lasting great feel and works to keep unwanted noise out when I need  quality sleep. The soft ear plugs with holder are a nice bonus! It&#x27;s sleeping that really provides cashmere dreams...</li>
            <li> comfy and helpful for a good night&#x27;s sleep!</li>
            <li> I have been on a search for the perfect sleep mask so I purchased several different brands, This one, unfortunately, was the exact same as a couple other masks. The only difference being the logo. The mask itself seems a bit small and has to be pulled rather tight in order to block out most of the light. The lip near the nose lets more light in than it blocks. I can also feel the mask against my eyelashes. This is a decent mask for the price, but there are better ones out there.</li>
            <li> Best sleep I&#x27;ve had in a while ! Packaged very professional. Mask feels like butter and fits comfortable around my face. The ear plugs were amazing and I loved how they came with their own compartment attached to the mask to prevent losing them :) great job on this :)</li>
            <li> Really blocks out the light.  The material is light and comfy.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like it would work as great as it does, but it does!</li>
            <li> Another perfect gift for the holidays.  I love this eyemask.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;cashmere&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;velvet&amp;#34; reference made me think this would be a nice, big,  plushy mask. Unfortunately, that was not, in my opinion, the case. I find the mask stiff and actually uncomfortable. It is also not large enough, in my opinion again, to block out all the light, as during sleep the elastic band moves, and I end up &amp;#34;seeing&amp;#34; the light at dawn more times than not. I had ordered a wonderful mask on Amazon that is no longer sold on the site (and alas, I can&#x27;t remember the name), that was huge, silky, plushy and cheaper. I wish I could find it again. I can&#x27;t recommend this mask. A waste of money, but too much of a hassle to send it back.</li>
            <li> When I want a good sleep and to feel rich and sexy, I definitely want to be wearing this mask. Not only does it block out the light and sound.... but the silky feel ...just makes me feel better..</li>
            <li> Only used it for one cross country trip but it did the trick. Earplugs came in handy.</li>
            <li> Great for blocking out all aspects of surrounding lights.</li>
            <li> Quality was good.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> I do wish the strap was maybe 1&amp;#34; longer, I like the head band fairly loose, but all and all its the best 1 I have ever had very comfortable</li>
