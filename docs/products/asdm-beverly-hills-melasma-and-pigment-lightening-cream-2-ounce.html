            <li>I tried so many products and none of them work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m now using it on my hands, knees and elbows, just to make sure this was not a fluke.</li>
            <li>all continues to go well, I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>mostly didn&#x27;t notice it when I cover it with makeup-since using this people</li>
            <li>Okay so I have been using this product for 3 days on my face and my elbows.</li>
            <li>Great product really does work still trying to get it to work on a stubborn spot on my cheek.</li>
            <li>I used the Beverly Hills cream for a week and the difference was astonishing.  </li>
            <li>and I am much more</li>
            <li>love love LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>Mostly twice a day.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it for one day and tried again and saw better results afterwards.</li>
            <li>I have tried many bleaching creams and nothing seemed to work.</li>
            <li>I am on day 20 and my skin is looking better and better.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>Loved it, when it&#x27;s the right cream ordered.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m very excited that I took a chance on this lightening cream.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really work loved it.....</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not even using this product consistently has still resulted in amazing lightening.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use, goes on smoothly and has not irritated my skin at all.</li>
            <li>Seems like working out fine, my freckles are not that noticeable after applying for 2 weeks</li>
            <li>As for my knees they were peeling from time to time and its not lightening up as quick as my elbows did, because the melanin on my knees are more darker.</li>
            <li>amazingly the melasma on my cheeks is much much lighter.</li>
            <li>When I purchased this item several months ago I was so happy because there weren&#x27;t any poison ingredients.</li>
            <li>Honestly This product is really  working.</li>
            <li>It made my problem areas problem free.</li>
            <li>You need to be precise.</li>
            <li>Both good for your skin and natural lighteners.  </li>
            <li>This cream smells good and it feels soo soft.</li>
            <li>and yes it really works!!!.  </li>
            <li>My melasma has been faded significantly (now unnoticeable).</li>
            <li>Now, my ethnicity is Polish and Irish., both very white skin types, so I don&#x27;t know if fair skin is better with this kind of cream</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the one right there!...</li>
            <li>This product is s dream come true.........</li>
            <li>You have to use it regularly to get good results.</li>
            <li>recommend a good facial sunblock, SFP 50</li>
            <li>The advertising was so bold I didn&#x27;t believe it would help..</li>
            <li>When I look in the mirror I can smile and think pretty soon I&#x27;ll be able to walk out of this bathroom without a trace of make up on this pretty face</li>
            <li>Okay so this cream has done a amazing job for the dark spots on my face!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been using just freshly squeezed lime juice on my face and that has helped as well.</li>
            <li>, I had a smile on my face the size of the sun.</li>
            <li>It is very important to only put the cream on the intended spots because it does work.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first, bec.</li>
            <li>First time buying it  </li>
            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>For the first time in my life I see hope.</li>
            <li>My ance is clearing 95% , my skin is so smooth and soft, the darkness it disappearing.</li>
            <li>The spots on my face will most likely take time so thats no surprise.</li>
            <li>This cream has lightened it so dramatically that for the first time in years I was able to run to the grocery store with no make up last week.  </li>
            <li>This is the first product I tried for my malasma and it started working within the first week of use.</li>
            <li>Pretty face in my youth,</li>
            <li>This cream did what exactly said it was going to do.</li>
            <li>Amazing, the only cream in this planet that is able to remove my stubborn dark spots of my face.. Thank you !!</li>
            <li>I think certain spots are easier to lighten on my body and my elbows happen to be one of them</li>
            <li>I always put it on at night after washing my face because it does have a tendency to leave your skin a little orange, but leave it on for 15-30 min&#x27;s and rinse with luke warm water (do not use any face wash</li>
            <li>I did a little more digging on natural stuff that will not harm your skin and of course there are so many natural things that you can do that</li>
            <li>It is really a miracle in a bottle ,see improvement on my melasma problem in just two weeks.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;d have to do it almost once a month to really see results.  </li>
            <li>I know is it really works</li>
            <li>So, I just dumped the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>I bought this product and I am very happy.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>However, I have discovered something that works better and costs considerably less.</li>
            <li>It did not touch my melasma,nothing happened and the main ingredient is hydroquinone which was banned already in Europe because of danger of cancer.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s just not worth risking my health to remove some facial imperfections; there has to be a better way!  </li>
            <li>and I have seen a 85% improvement so far!!</li>
            <li>When the cream finished i gave it about a months gap and started applying serum instead of cream but wasnt happy with results so thought ill gonback to cream again.</li>
            <li>( most likely due to the fact that my thighs touch)</li>
            <li>it worked the first time and not second time?????</li>
            <li>but I am willing to keep trying it, simply because I bought it!</li>
            <li>the dark discoloration on my arms has lightened significantly.  </li>
            <li>Anyhow, I know how self conscious I feel about my skin</li>
            <li>Plus my skin is so sensitive to any products.</li>
            <li>Wow is all I can say.</li>
            <li>Follow the directions and apply lightly to sensitive skin .</li>
            <li>It has to be applied at night, it feels weird when it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s stuck to the face, not in a good way.  </li>
            <li>first day applying I did put a little to much on and had some redness.</li>
            <li>After a few more tries it just did not work.</li>
            <li>I had big blotches on my left cheek and they are completely gone~ ~!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used other bleaching creams in the past; fair and white, black and white, but neither lightened my cheek areas (which were really dark compared to the rest of my face)</li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other bleaching creams in the past; fair and white, black and white, but neither lightened my cheek areas (which were really dark compared to the rest of my face)</li>
            <li> I was careful with this cream aware of the poor packaging (mixing hydroquinone with certain ingredients can cause it to breakdown</li>
            <li> I am a african american female and its really hard for me to find a product that really lightens the skin.</li>
            <li> When I contacted the company with my complaint the knew exactly what it was and why it was doing it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not knocking the product because I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to see if there were any results, however, after doing research about it&#x27;s ingredients, I decided not to proceed with it.</li>
            <li> Every Monday I applied a microdermabrasion treatment with derma-crystals from OLAY regenerist to clear the minor peeling and then I applied a heavy coat of facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m taking a break from it for a little bit because I do not want my skin to get sensitive to sunlight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve struggled with Melasma for over 10 years and it&#x27;s gotten so bad in the last 6 that I&#x27;ve had photofacials and most recently a series of chemical peels to deal with it.  </li>
            <li> and I hope anyone who tries it can find the same encouraging results.  </li>
            <li> In less than 3 weeks i noticed a major results..</li>
            <li> It does dry your skin and minor peeling might occur.</li>
            <li> only a few weeks in and one of my dark spots is considerably lighter</li>
            <li> I am not new to melasma creams as I have been dealing with it for years.</li>
            <li> Covering dark spots or covering red swollen skin?</li>
            <li> You only have to use a little bit.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase--money well spent.</li>
            <li> It took few weeks to receive the next cream.</li>
            <li> Or I&#x27;m in deep trouble.</li>
            <li> When I received the product the seal on the container was broke and the cream was on the outer packaging, I&#x27;m not sure of the offecitvness of the product yet only used a couple days, pleasent smell.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not even small enough.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream because one of it&#x27;s active ingredients is kojic acid.</li>
            <li> Did not do anything to reduce dark spots for me.</li>
            <li> breaking up the dark dark spots on my face....!grateful</li>
            <li> I will never use anything else ever for my dark spot and hyperpigmentation issues.</li>
            <li> but if I do the container will last at least a year.</li>
            <li> Threw it away as it started to make my dark patches appear darker and it has taken me years to get this point.</li>
            <li> I have dark spots/scarring on my chin from picking ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Dark spots on my cheeks are gone.</li>
            <li> her dark spots turned darker after using the product.</li>
            <li> Your face is your introduction to the world and when you have to hide behind your (insecurities)-( imperfections) , it can be an emotional lonely place.</li>
            <li> I am black and Caramel in color.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for less than a month and some of my melasma is going away.</li>
            <li> I wear less make up now.</li>
            <li> I started noticing the difference in less than 7 days.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but it only took a week for me to see dramatic results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 47 years old and the prospect of constant chemical peels or heavy makeup all the time was depressing...</li>
            <li> I have used it for a little over two weeks now and see no difference ...</li>
            <li> It took 3 days for their cream to DARKEN my face and hand, AND a little over two weeks for time to reverse the damage that this did to my face and hand.</li>
            <li> So half of my life was spent peeling and unable to go in public!  </li>
            <li> I bought this cream for my very dark elbow.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It is a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> My skin looks smoother and smoother everyday.</li>
            <li> Dont know yet how this product works as I have to use it for a few weeks to determine results.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Then my mom tried a little on her melasma and we both had red painful swollen patches.</li>
            <li> if it could manage the pigmentation like the $150 cream, at least it&#x27;d be cheaper, I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> They said it was a common side effect to an ingredient to the cream.</li>
            <li> no good  </li>
            <li> Between acne and Melasma I&#x27;ve been hiding my face behind caked on coverup  </li>
            <li> What was worse?</li>
            <li> me much worse discoloration</li>
            <li> I was skeptical</li>
            <li> This is antifreeze, and I sadly will now search else where for skin brightener.</li>
            <li> you wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> Re-ordered, but received the wrong cream.</li>
            <li> My condition was so bad I didn&#x27;t go under water swimming with my family in fear I would be exposed</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have Melasma bad at all people</li>
            <li> I have bad Melasma... or \\&quot;had\\&quot; bad Melasma.  </li>
            <li> This stuff BURNED my skin- in a bad way.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything bad about this.</li>
            <li> I had really bad melasma</li>
            <li> iM disappointed for the price I paid for it</li>
            <li> and it gave me a rash :(</li>
            <li> This product contains hydroquinone :(</li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> With the chemical peels come a week of recovery... peely, awful skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never need another evil chemical peel again.  </li>
            <li> This is the worst cream I have used.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I WAS HOSPITALIZED IN JANUARY FOR A QUAD BYPASS. UPON RETURNING HOME IN&lt;br /&gt;MARCH (ABOUT 45 DAYS) THE CREME HAD TURNED BROWN. IT HAS THE SAME TEXTURE&lt;br /&gt;BUT IT DOESN&#x27;T APPEAR TO HAVE ANY OF THE HYDROQUINONE BENEFITS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;0</li>
            <li> Hydroquinone ingredient is banned in every country except the US.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks.  I&#x27;ve seen the melasma lighten some, but it&#x27;s not gone yet.  It is definitely better than before.  I&#x27;ll continue to use this product and hope for continued lightening.  It is easy to use, goes on smoothly and has not irritated my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about the potential for skin cancers and because I wanted to get rid of the melasma I went ahead, paid the $30 and purchased it. I hesitantly tried it about 5 times..then stopped. I had to come to terms that it&#x27;s just not worth risking my health to remove some facial imperfections; there has to be a better way!  I wanted to get rid of it, but not by risking my life. I&#x27;m not knocking the product because I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to see if there were any results, however, after doing research about it&#x27;s ingredients, I decided not to proceed with it. I did a little more digging on natural stuff that will not harm your skin and of course there are so many natural things that you can do that will NOT be harmful to your skin. Turmeric &amp; Lime or Lemon Juice!!! That&#x27;s the one right there!...Both good for your skin and natural lighteners.  You just have to be patient though and I&#x27;m learning to do that. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about 3 weeks now...amazingly the melasma on my cheeks is much much lighter. I always put it on at night after washing my face because it does have a tendency to leave your skin a little orange, but leave it on for 15-30 min&#x27;s and rinse with luke warm water (do not use any face wash this will remove the nutrients of the turmeric &amp; lime juice and you want those ingredients to penetrate into your pores overnight). I&#x27;ve also been using just freshly squeezed lime juice on my face and that has helped as well. Anyhow, I know how self conscious I feel about my skin so I can relate to others. Try it, you have nothing to lose except Melasma! :)</li>
            <li> I bought this product to try for my melasma in my face. I was hesitant at first, bec. I tried so many products and none of them work. I have the melasma  in my face for 4 years now. I tried this product for 3 weeks now, and i can see the hyperpigmention is fading already. Plus my skin is so sensitive to any products. I have an asian skin. I will update you after 7 weeks.</li>
            <li> I received this product seven nights ago and after night one I saw results!&lt;br /&gt;By night four, I had a smile on my face the size of the sun. My skin has never been so clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other bleaching creams in the past; fair and white, black and white, but neither lightened my cheek areas (which were really dark compared to the rest of my face) the way this cream does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now using it on my hands, knees and elbows, just to make sure this was not a fluke. LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If all continues to go well, I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I have seen a difference in just a couple of weeks. I am very happy with the product. Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this at the end of Christmas and by mid January my malasma is almost gone. I use it 2 times a day..morning and at night. You only have to use a little bit.</li>
            <li> I am really happy about this cream it&#x27;s really work loved it.....</li>
            <li> First time buying it  no good  would not recomend</li>
            <li> It really works!  I have used this for a short period of time and the dark discoloration on my arms has lightened significantly.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase--money well spent.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream for my very dark elbow.  After using it for about a week, I started to see the difference.  Now I use the cream at night and lotion during the day.  Works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t feel or see anything</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t  work for me.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a little over two weeks now and see no difference ... iM disappointed for the price I paid for it</li>
            <li> Between acne and Melasma I&#x27;ve been hiding my face behind caked on coverup  24/7 from everyone/ everywhere, for over ten years. My condition was so bad I didn&#x27;t go under water swimming with my family in fear I would be exposed, I have never let anyone see me with out cover up, ( not even my children) I sleep in it. For the first time in my life I see hope. My ance is clearing 95% , my skin is so smooth and soft, the darkness it disappearing. When I look in the mirror I can smile and think pretty soon I&#x27;ll be able to walk out of this bathroom without a trace of make up on this pretty face😉☺️ and years of self-consciousness can finally heal. Your face is your introduction to the world and when you have to hide behind your (insecurities)-( imperfections) , it can be an emotional lonely place. This product is s dream come true.........</li>
            <li> Seems like working out fine, my freckles are not that noticeable after applying for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I would not buy this gain.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> No noticeable results for hyperpigmentation on face or hands after several weeks of use. Cannot speak to effectiveness with prolonged use.  Will be trying a dermaroller with hyaluronic acid or vitamin C serum next.  These products seem to work for a number of people.</li>
            <li> This is very good product and i like it</li>
            <li> It is a waste of time and money. I used it for 10 weeks with no difference at all. I am black and Caramel in color.</li>
            <li> When I received the product the seal on the container was broke and the cream was on the outer packaging, I&#x27;m not sure of the offecitvness of the product yet only used a couple days, pleasent smell.</li>
            <li> So far the cream is working great!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product based off of reviews.  I used it two nights following the directions and it made my spots NOTICELBLY darker!!! I don&#x27;t have Melasma bad at all people mostly didn&#x27;t notice it when I cover it with makeup-since using this people have asked me what&#x27;s on my face!!! I wish I  never bought this! Also, I&#x27;ve read one of the ingredients listed is toxic for you Hydroquinone.  I don&#x27;t understand how something that is supposed to lighten made mine darker!!!</li>
            <li> It is really a miracle in a bottle ,see improvement on my melasma problem in just two weeks.</li>
            <li> Its very good product. Amazing results</li>
            <li> In just 3 weeks my friends noticed the difference. Great product</li>
            <li> I have several chemical peels didn&#x27;t work on me but this cream is doing the job</li>
            <li> Just not working for me. Ive seen no difference</li>
            <li> This has done nothing for my brown spots.  Also, as others reviewers pointed out, the cream starts to turn color.  I threw away the money I used to buy this.  Never again!</li>
            <li> Okay so I have been using this product for 3 days on my face and my elbows. I noticed within the 3 days my elbows have gotten lighter! I can not believe it! I am a african american female and its really hard for me to find a product that really lightens the skin. I think certain spots are easier to lighten on my body and my elbows happen to be one of them lol. The spots on my face will most likely take time so thats no surprise. I&#x27;m currently trying it out on my knees and butt. I&#x27;ll update if I do see improvement.      Follow up: Okay so this cream has done a amazing job for the dark spots on my face! As for my knees they were peeling from time to time and its not lightening up as quick as my elbows did, because the melanin on my knees are more darker. My elbows are perfect now and I can not believe it! I&#x27;ve tried this on my inner thighs and I had a allergic reaction in that area and it gave me a rash :( ( most likely due to the fact that my thighs touch) My butt is getting there and I definitely am seeing results. I&#x27;m taking a break from it for a little bit because I do not want my skin to get sensitive to sunlight.</li>
            <li> Great product really does work still trying to get it to work on a stubborn spot on my cheek. I had big blotches on my left cheek and they are completely gone~ ~!  You have to use it regularly to get good results. It did take about 2 months is the only downside . BUT DONT GIVE UP ~!</li>
            <li> Confused&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this cream aplied for six weeks and saw improvment in pigmentation. When the cream finished i gave it about a months gap and started applying serum instead of cream but wasnt happy with results so thought ill gonback to cream again. It took few weeks to receive the next cream. By now my pigmnetation was fully back and now im applying the cream as per instructions but im not seeing any reduction or improvment. So i dnt knwhow comes it worked the first time and not second time?????</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve struggled with Melasma for over 10 years and it&#x27;s gotten so bad in the last 6 that I&#x27;ve had photofacials and most recently a series of chemical peels to deal with it.  With the chemical peels come a week of recovery... peely, awful skin.  And I&#x27;d have to do it almost once a month to really see results.  So half of my life was spent peeling and unable to go in public!  Then I was prescribed a lightening cream that managed the darkening... and it was only $150 for 2 oz.  Geesh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran out of that overpriced cream from my doctor and decided to see what else was out there and stumbled upon this product on Amazon.  The advertising was so bold I didn&#x27;t believe it would help..just another gimmick, but if it could manage the pigmentation like the $150 cream, at least it&#x27;d be cheaper, I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I used the Beverly Hills cream for a week and the difference was astonishing.  I have bad Melasma... or \\&quot;had\\&quot; bad Melasma.  This cream has lightened it so dramatically that for the first time in years I was able to run to the grocery store with no make up last week.  A skin doctor told me once it looked like I had a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow and the pigmentation on my forehead always looked like I&#x27;d just been to an Ash Wednesday solemnity.  Not to mention my cheeks, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not even using this product consistently has still resulted in amazing lightening.  I&#x27;m thrilled. I&#x27;ll never need another evil chemical peel again.  This product is life changing for me.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about piling on make up to cover it and I am much more confident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend a good facial sunblock, SFP 50+.  It helps maintain the progress the Beverly Hills cream produces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love love LOVE this product.  It&#x27;s truly been a miracle.  I was skeptical but now I&#x27;m just thrilled. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS... to address those who think I&#x27;m being paid to say this or something... I&#x27;m just over-excited because I&#x27;ve been struggling with melasma for over a decade and my skin doctor told me I&#x27;d have to spend my life in the shadows, avoiding sun (I&#x27;m a landscape photographer and need to be outside) and getting chemical peels or one of those $1000 laser treatments.  So I&#x27;m very excited that I took a chance on this lightening cream. I was skeptical at first but it only took a week for me to see dramatic results.  I&#x27;m 47 years old and the prospect of constant chemical peels or heavy makeup all the time was depressing... layers of make up  just make me look older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll see if there&#x27;s a way to post a before and after picture here, or maybe a link to a picture.  Now, my ethnicity is Polish and Irish., both very white skin types, so I don&#x27;t know if fair skin is better with this kind of cream but all I know is it really works and I hope anyone who tries it can find the same encouraging results.  I just hope they don&#x27;t stop making this someday.  Or I&#x27;m in deep trouble.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for less than a month and some of my melasma is going away. I use it twice daily!  I have already seen a difference! I will continue using it!</li>
            <li> Did not do anything to reduce dark spots for me.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this item several months ago I was so happy because there weren&#x27;t any poison ingredients. As I was going to repurchase I noticed glycol propylene. This is antifreeze, and I sadly will now search else where for skin brightener.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting there...breaking up the dark dark spots on my face....!grateful</li>
            <li> Amazing, the only cream in this planet that is able to remove my stubborn dark spots of my face.. Thank you !!</li>
            <li> It has to be applied at night, it feels weird when it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s stuck to the face, not in a good way.  This has to be applied at night because wandering around town with on my face didn&#x27;t work.  I don&#x27;t know if the product actually lightens sun spots but I am willing to keep trying it, simply because I bought it!</li>
            <li> Yes!  Honestly This product is really  working. I will never use anything else ever for my dark spot and hyperpigmentation issues. In less than 3 weeks i noticed a major results.. im very satisfied and happy. I wear less make up now. My skin looks smoother and smoother everyday. And thank  you for the great service.</li>
            <li> This stuff turned my face and hand (the one I applied the cream with) a darker color. When I contacted the company with my complaint the knew exactly what it was and why it was doing it. They said it was a common side effect to an ingredient to the cream. I returned the product the next day! It took 3 days for their cream to DARKEN my face and hand, AND a little over two weeks for time to reverse the damage that this did to my face and hand.</li>
            <li> It did not touch my melasma,nothing happened and the main ingredient is hydroquinone which was banned already in Europe because of danger of cancer. So, I just dumped the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> very satisfying  good</li>
            <li> This product works my face is looking great. It does dry your skin and minor peeling might occur. I used it 3 times a week at night for 3 weeks. Every Monday I applied a microdermabrasion treatment with derma-crystals from OLAY regenerist to clear the minor peeling and then I applied a heavy coat of facial moisturizer.  Use facial sunblock! I&#x27;m still using it for some pigmented scars and they have peeled but I exfoliate the skin and the peeling skin is gone.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product. I am not new to melasma creams as I have been dealing with it for years. This stuff BURNED my skin- in a bad way. Then my mom tried a little on her melasma and we both had red painful swollen patches. It took over a week to heal- which we attributed to the product being &amp;#34;powerful&amp;#34;. After a few more tries it just did not work. What was worse? Covering dark spots or covering red swollen skin? AND within 30 days my cream turned brown. Which should NOT happen. I blame the packaging. The ingredients aren&#x27;t supposed to be exposed to oxygen- it causes a premature breakdown of the hydroquinone. I was careful with this cream aware of the poor packaging (mixing hydroquinone with certain ingredients can cause it to breakdown/turn brown too. But at the end of the day the exposure to oxygen ruined the product. This is the worst cream I have used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy. This is the first product I tried for my malasma and it started working within the first week of use. I hopefully won&#x27;t need to continue to use it but if I do the container will last at least a year.</li>
            <li> Threw it away as it started to make my dark patches appear darker and it has taken me years to get this point. Would not recommend!</li>
            <li> This works wonders.. It&#x27;s advisable though that you do it at night sftere showering and exfoliating the area. It made my problem areas problem free.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any change in pigmentation.</li>
            <li> The cream is fantastic, I have battled with melasma for decades, but is one cream that changed my face for good. Iused to be Miss Pretty face in my youth, and I got compliments and stares. Well, I am geting those kind of stares once again. It&#x27;s not comletely done, but I can shout out and say this cream does a good job. Excellent is the word!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything bad about this. It&#x27;s a good product that does what it says it will do. However, I have discovered something that works better and costs considerably less.</li>
            <li> Warning! This product contains hydroquinone :( it will go to the trash can...cancinogen</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the cream for over a month. Mostly twice a day. Once daily (nighttime) if I were going to be in the sun. I saw a change in a week. I was astounded. It is very important to only put the cream on the intended spots because it does work. It will lighten wherever you put it. You need to be precise. I use a Q-tip. That&#x27;s not even small enough. I have dark spots/scarring on my chin from picking ingrown hairs. I expect even tone within the next month. I hope to post before and after photos. I took one the day I started using the cream.</li>
            <li> Wow is all I can say. I take very good care of my skin and as im getting older anytime I go in the sun with sunblock I am affected with malasma. I bought this product and I am very happy.&lt;br /&gt;The first day applying I did put a little to much on and had some redness. Follow the directions and apply lightly to sensitive skin . I have only used this product for about 2 weeks and I have seen a 85% improvement so far!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for 8 weeks. My melasma has been faded significantly (now unnoticeable). Dark spots on my cheeks are gone. After 4 weeks of using the cream I saw the improvement. I have used the cream only at night. Now I am happy with the results. I had been on tretinoin (retin-a generic version) and lytera for 8 months before I began using this cream. Lytera helped even out my skin tone but the melasma was still visible. I bought this cream because one of it&#x27;s active ingredients is kojic acid. I wear a hat when I go out during the day, even in winter in the east coast. Be patient in using cream against melasma. I wanted to give up on the cream after 2 weeks, because my face seemed to have some irritation. I stopped using it for one day and tried again and saw better results afterwards.</li>
            <li> Dont know yet how this product works as I have to use it for a few weeks to determine results.</li>
            <li> it seems to be working.  only a few weeks in and one of my dark spots is considerably lighter</li>
            <li> I have tried many bleaching creams and nothing seemed to work. I had really bad melasma and I couldn&#x27;t get rid of it. I tried peels, kojic soap, meladerm and even went to a dermatologist and he recommended hydroquinone. NOTHING WORKED. I decided to try this last cream as a last resort. I am sooo happy that I did. This cream smells good and it feels soo soft. I started noticing the difference in less than 7 days. I am on day 20 and my skin is looking better and better. I no longer have to put layers upon layers of makeup to cover my melasma. This cream did what exactly said it was going to do. My face looks amazing and I have this lightening cream to thank. Try it! you wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me I do not see any improvement.... causes my skin to break out in pimples.&lt;br /&gt;give me much worse discoloration</li>
            <li> Loved it, when it&#x27;s the right cream ordered. My Melasma cleared up in a month. Re-ordered, but received the wrong cream.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my friend as a gift. Didn&#x27;t work for her. her dark spots turned darker after using the product. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Been using ASDM for about a month, haven&#x27;t noticed a change in my melasma. This is the 5th type of treatment I have tried for melasma. Was hoping this would work. Disappointed</li>
            <li> I love this cream. I have hyperpigmentation I have been using this for over a month and yes it really works!!!.  I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing the results after two month.  I will update you after the two month period.  I&#x27;m getting the results that the ad states.</li>
