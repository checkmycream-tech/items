            <li> Recently I was out shopping with my Mom and we were looking for some Red Charlie perfume; none of the stores seemed to carry it. We thought it was a seasonal thing, but after some online research, I found out that they no longer produce Red Charlie in North America. It&#x27;s still being produced in Europe, so no worries there, but I really liked the shipping and price on this. Two large bottles of Red Charlie for about 20 bucks. Not bad at all. It still smells as amazing as I remember. :)</li>
            <li> Great buy! These were Christmas presents and I was very pleased with the price and delivery options. The product came quickly and was well received by all of my girls. Will certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li> Charlie Red is the best, it smells so goooood. My Husband loves it . When I wear the product in stores or any where I get people asking what I am wearing and they like it.&lt;br /&gt;This would make any women a very nice gift</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom for her birthday. She really loved it. It&#x27;s her favorite fragrance. It was packaged well and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Once again excellent perfume. I would recommend to anyone. Amazon always comes through with things I need to purchase. Thank you</li>
            <li> I used to wear this in middle school and high school. After the store I used to buy it at closed, i couldn&#x27;t find it in town anywhere. I have tried to find it for a long time, so when I saw it on her I was excited. But.... It smells differently than it used to. Not a huge difference, but it was my favorite perfume so it is a little disappointing. You do get a large bottle though, so that is a good thing. I just wished it smelt the same.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume.  This was an inexpensive, convenient way to purchase it.</li>
            <li> This is like the original Red that I bought and I like it...</li>
            <li> Nice To Finally Have This Again!  Good Price For The Size!!</li>
            <li> Charlie Red is just an excellent scent. Very soft and not overpowering. I&#x27;m glad I found this one and will continue to use it</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells. I use it everyday &amp; take it whenever I go on a trip.  Let me just say I get compliments all the time on how good it smells.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sort of like a Red Door or Giorgio fragrance.  Just cheaper....which is nice.  It is very smooth with a fruity musky smell.</li>
            <li> A classic perfume at a perfect price!</li>
