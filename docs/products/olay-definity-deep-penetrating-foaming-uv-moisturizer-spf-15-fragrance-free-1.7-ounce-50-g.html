            <li>I hope they still make it - it was the best.</li>
            <li>This is without a doubt the best daytime moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and I have used it for five weeks now, twice a day, and I am so happy with the appearance and feel of my skin.  </li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer for me with \\&quot;mature\\&quot; skin.  </li>
            <li>I had gotten a free sample in the mail of their cream and it was wonderful.    </li>
            <li>So my skin is in good shape</li>
            <li>My face is beautiful, clear and just wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>but it really worked out to be a very wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>I have used a lot and liked.</li>
            <li>(by the way, I have very fair, very sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li>Glad Amazon carries it.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many beauty products that don&#x27;t \\&quot;deliver\\&quot;; this is not one of them.  </li>
            <li>w/out being too light to be effective.  </li>
            <li>I am NOT going to buy any more</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m on a hunt to find a better moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better, plus my skin is protected from the sun.</li>
            <li>My skin looks more supple and the brown spots look lighter than before.  </li>
            <li>Over all i&#x27;m greatful to OLAY for placing such an excellent product on the market!!!!!</li>
            <li>Because of the foaming dispenser, I ended up dispensing more than I wanted to.  </li>
            <li>I was able to spread it evenly on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I find I am able to go without foundation because my skin tone is more even.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s so impressive about Definity is that it shows benefit above and beyond everything else that I&#x27;m doing.  </li>
            <li>Its a foam &amp; it, at first, comes off kinda greasy but rubs in nicely...</li>
            <li>made my face break out in huge bumps for a week.</li>
            <li>I like how it goes on, it feels smooth, but it does NOT absorb into the skin.</li>
            <li>It just sits on the skin in a smooth sticky layer UNTIL you put on your make-up.</li>
            <li>its genuinely from Olay.  </li>
            <li>Results are striking and evident even faster than promised.</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading the Good Housekeeping review on several products.</li>
            <li>&quot; but the product really delievered what it promised, more luminous skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need any make up because my skin is in such good condition  </li>
            <li>The product came promptly and was a good price however two weeks or so later, I couldn&#x27;t get any out of the spray bottle.  </li>
            <li>Contacted Amazon and they in turn contacted the co. where they issued a full refund immediately.</li>
            <li>It felt fine at first, and then I noticed I became itchy in some spots.  </li>
            <li>The moisturizer is light and non greasy perfect for my oily skin which BTW has decreased in the amount of oilyness  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is worth $9,000  -</li>
            <li>Similarly, whenever I hear a cosmetic company present data that X% of women show this-or-that kind of improvement in their skin, I know that the study sample they use is filled with woman who do nothing for skin care (so just starting something, anything, including the test-product, has to produce good effect)    </li>
            <li>its been about 2 months since i have been using products from the olay definity line and this is by far my favorite, my skin has changed noticeably and i am beginning to recieve lots of compliments on how clear and fresh my skin looks!</li>
            <li>the first one (can&#x27;t remember the name right now...</li>
            <li>although a little pricey,it&#x27;s a good moisturizer with sunscreen</li>
            <li>it has actually made my skin look dryer and wrinkles more predominant</li>
            <li>This product is quite light with no greasy feel and my skin feels soft and supple after application.</li>
            <li>After the first month of use.......  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft and smooth to touch  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it does.  </li>
            <li>goes on kind of thick, with a strong sunscreen smell, but that fades, and the product seems to absorb well.  </li>
            <li>I have had problems with a slight reddening of my fair skin as I&#x27;ve grown older and</li>
            <li>I would prefer a different type of dispenser since even a light press dispenses more than I need, but that is a minor thing.</li>
            <li>alot does come out of the pump dispenser, but spread it onto your neck and the total amount is fine.</li>
            <li>I take very good care of my skin and use really expensive (Perricone, Esstee, etc.)</li>
            <li>it felt very sticky and made my skin feel sticky all day, and gave me breakouts.</li>
            <li>and I really see a noticeable result.  </li>
            <li>this product, in combination with the night cream, eye treatment, and cream and mousse cleansers from the Definity line has made a real difference.</li>
            <li>The product also felt like I had a layer on my skin and did not feel like it was absorbed completely.  </li>
            <li>Then later when I am putting on my makeup, in places it looks like my skin is peeling because it leaves a residue that when brushed with powder, kind of comes off like peeling skin.</li>
            <li>That was unusual to me as most skincare products are made in other places like Canada, Ireland, etc.  </li>
            <li>I love the moisturizer but the container stopped pumping out the product before it was half gone.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m older</li>
            <li>I bought Definity on a whim and didn&#x27;t have high expectation after reading \\&quot;made in China\\</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s intriguing to apply a foam moisturizer, but it&#x27;s not quite moisturizing enough for my combination skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is normal to oily.  </li>
            <li>Maybe that was because the cream/lotion/foamy stuff,whatever it is called, did not last for any length of time.&lt;br /&gt;First of all,every time I pressed the nozzle a huge amount shot out, and in the first few weeks I kept forgetting and would gaily press the nozzle and would end up with loads of this stuff slathered all over me, with only one press of the nozzle!!&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>Yes, Well what little I got of it, I liked the cream well enough although it DID NOT make the slightest bit of difference to a freckle I have on my cheek.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d try a new moisturizer for aging skin and bought this stuff.</li>
            <li>(2x per day), and my skin is brighter, my dark splotches are lighter, and my fine lines are just a bit finer.      </li>
            <li>I have typical T-zone issues - nice to find a product that works on my dry cheeks</li>
            <li>Purchased the product from Direct Super Center (DAB Nutrition) - was shipped through buybelowsale.com.  </li>
            <li>Professional Pro-X Age Repair Lotion\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;which</li>
            <li>So beware of the pump action on the moisturizer container.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s).  </li>
            <li>Looked at the bottom for a expiration date and found it to be over two years old.   </li>
            <li>and i like it so far (using it for about 2 weeks).  </li>
            <li>I am always  very skeptical of beauty products with such grand claims, and I don&#x27;t know if this actually penetrates 10 layers of skin or whatever, but I can say - LOVE this moisturizer!  </li>
            <li>I now have half a container full of moisturizer and cannot get it out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I use Bare Escentuals and the powder foundation just cakes with this stuff.</li>
            <li>This is the second NEW Oil of Olay moisturizer I have recently used....</li>

            <li> I am not sure if in the first couple of weeks I just inadvertently went through far too much of this cream, or if the spraying mechanism of the container is broken, because when I shake it, it definitely feels like there is still some left in there, but either way after a short time of using it, there is no more cream coming out of this container, and I feel unhappy with the product&#x27;s packaging and presentation and will probably go back to using&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Olay</li>

            <li> The problem other people has had with the dispenser is non existent to me as i&#x27;ve had no problems at all    </li>
            <li> After following the instructions on application, I noted the product smelled like sunscreen and the foam was thick like mousse, but felt even thicker as you apply it.  </li>
            <li> Also, no matter how I apply it, the product flakes off, leaving my skin covered with little flakes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble finding this product -- hit and miss in stores.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure yet</li>

            <li> It is too expensive of a product to waste half a bottle.</li>

            <li> but lately I&#x27;ve been noticing subtle signs of aging...</li>
            <li> sorry)</li>
            <li> Sorry Olay.</li>
            <li> and not so expensive</li>
            <li> (I follow the product with a foundation powder, perhaps that&#x27;s a bad combination).  </li>
            <li> horrible product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s AWFUL.</li>
            <li> I had a horrible reaction to the stuff and now this one which just coats the face with a sticky film is going in the garbage too....</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble finding this product -- hit and miss in stores.   Glad Amazon carries it.   Good moisturizer for me with \\&quot;mature\\&quot; skin.  Facelift will have to be next tho!</li>
            <li> I love the moisturizer but the container stopped pumping out the product before it was half gone.  I now have half a container full of moisturizer and cannot get it out of the bottle.  So beware of the pump action on the moisturizer container.  It is too expensive of a product to waste half a bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the only Olay Definity product I&#x27;ve found that is fragrance-free and has UV protection, a necessity for my morning routine.  It&#x27;s intriguing to apply a foam moisturizer, but it&#x27;s not quite moisturizing enough for my combination skin.  Also, no matter how I apply it, the product flakes off, leaving my skin covered with little flakes.  (I follow the product with a foundation powder, perhaps that&#x27;s a bad combination).  I&#x27;m back to Olay Total Effects.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many beauty products that don&#x27;t \\&quot;deliver\\&quot;; this is not one of them.  Results are striking and evident even faster than promised.</li>
            <li> I am always  very skeptical of beauty products with such grand claims, and I don&#x27;t know if this actually penetrates 10 layers of skin or whatever, but I can say - LOVE this moisturizer!  I have typical T-zone issues - nice to find a product that works on my dry cheeks w/out being greasy and on the forehead/nose/chin area w/out being too light to be effective.  My once per month breakouts are almost non-existent now - BONUS!I I would prefer a different type of dispenser since even a light press dispenses more than I need, but that is a minor thing.</li>
            <li> it felt very sticky and made my skin feel sticky all day, and gave me breakouts. horrible product.</li>
            <li> I was eager to try the Olay Definity line. I had gotten a free sample in the mail of their cream and it was wonderful.    However, when I got the Foaming Moisturizer (it comes out like shaving cream does), it has a different texture. It feels sticky after you put it on. Then later when I am putting on my makeup, in places it looks like my skin is peeling because it leaves a residue that when brushed with powder, kind of comes off like peeling skin. Yukk! I am NOT going to buy any more that&#x27;s for sure. I looked for just the regular cream version at Walgreens and they don&#x27;t have it. I hope they still make it - it was the best.</li>
            <li> I have used Oil of Olay Complete moisturizer with UV protection forever (I see they have even changed the formula of that now! :( ). Since I&#x27;m older I thought I&#x27;d try a new moisturizer for aging skin and bought this stuff. I absolutely hate it! I like how it goes on, it feels smooth, but it does NOT absorb into the skin. It just sits on the skin in a smooth sticky layer UNTIL you put on your make-up. I use Bare Escentuals and the powder foundation just cakes with this stuff. It&#x27;s AWFUL. I&#x27;ve used that makeup for years and it has never caked up over my moisturizer. You can actually rub this stuff off in sticky flakes. This is the second NEW Oil of Olay moisturizer I have recently used....the first one (can&#x27;t remember the name right now...sorry) made my face break out in huge bumps for a week. I had a horrible reaction to the stuff and now this one which just coats the face with a sticky film is going in the garbage too....I cannot recommend this. Sorry Olay. Now I&#x27;m on a hunt to find a better moisturizer.</li>
            <li> its been about 2 months since i have been using products from the olay definity line and this is by far my favorite, my skin has changed noticeably and i am beginning to recieve lots of compliments on how clear and fresh my skin looks!</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the Good Housekeeping review on several products. Its a foam &amp; it, at first, comes off kinda greasy but rubs in nicely...i have a couple wrinkles on my forehead that I am attempting to treat, I am not 100% convinced that this product is treating them but I bought it so I am going to continue using it...</li>
            <li> it feels like i am putting hair mousse on my face.  been using 3 weeks, throwing the rest away.  it has actually made my skin look dryer and wrinkles more predominant</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer. I have oily, acne prone skin so I thought I never could use a moisturizer but this never made my skin anymore oily than it already was and did not cause breakouts.I purchased this for the SPF and to help minimize discoloration caused by acne which left dark marks on my skin. Just after 4 weeks the acne marks faded noticiably and after 8 weeks they were almost gone. My skin has never looked better, plus my skin is protected from the sun.</li>
            <li> I have been using Definity foaming moisturizer for about a month and I really see a noticeable result.  My skin looks more supple and the brown spots look lighter than before.  I&#x27;ve been using Shiseido and Clinique skin products for years but lately I&#x27;ve been noticing subtle signs of aging... dry skin, brown spots, and look of tiredness (I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s).  I bought Definity on a whim and didn&#x27;t have high expectation after reading \\&quot;made in China\\&quot; but the product really delievered what it promised, more luminous skin.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best daytime moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. I have had problems with a slight reddening of my fair skin as I&#x27;ve grown older and this product, in combination with the night cream, eye treatment, and cream and mousse cleansers from the Definity line has made a real difference. This product is quite light with no greasy feel and my skin feels soft and supple after application. Use of these products has eliminated all my dry skin issues and improved the feel, texture and appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> Since purchasing this product I could not be happier with the changes I see in my skin.   After the first month of use.......  My complexion is clearer and brighter  My skin is soft and smooth to touch  I don&#x27;t need any make up because my skin is in such good condition  The moisturizer is light and non greasy perfect for my oily skin which BTW has decreased in the amount of oilyness  The uneveness of my skin has cleared 90% already  My pores are a bit smaller  The problem other people has had with the dispenser is non existent to me as i&#x27;ve had no problems at all    Over all i&#x27;m greatful to OLAY for placing such an excellent product on the market!!!!!</li>
            <li> I stocked up on this for my wife. Price is about 40% less then local stores.</li>
            <li> The product came promptly and was a good price however two weeks or so later, I couldn&#x27;t get any out of the spray bottle.  Looked at the bottom for a expiration date and found it to be over two years old.   Contacted Amazon and they in turn contacted the co. where they issued a full refund immediately.</li>
            <li> Purchased the product from Direct Super Center (DAB Nutrition) - was shipped through buybelowsale.com.  Product came as described.. but I&#x27;m suspicious as to where the company came up with this product.  The packaging was already opened (a disclaimer was contained in the packaging explaining this but not on the product&#x27;s description online) and the package itself was a reused UPS envelope.  I can&#x27;t tell if the product&#x27;s been used already or not, or if in fact its genuinely from Olay.  I can only think of the $10-$30 goods that often are stolen in mass quantities from businesses like Walgreens, Rite Aid, Walmart, etc, then resold.  Just think, how could a company buy previously opened products IN BULK from main distributors? Probably not likely...</li>
            <li> I bought this locally in Hawaii on sale.  Upon opening the package, I noticed that it was made in China.  That was unusual to me as most skincare products are made in other places like Canada, Ireland, etc.  After following the instructions on application, I noted the product smelled like sunscreen and the foam was thick like mousse, but felt even thicker as you apply it.  Because of the foaming dispenser, I ended up dispensing more than I wanted to.  I was able to spread it evenly on my skin.  It felt fine at first, and then I noticed I became itchy in some spots.  My skin is normal to oily.  The product also felt like I had a layer on my skin and did not feel like it was absorbed completely.  I also think there might be silica bits in this product too, which I guess adds to the \\&quot;luminousity\\&quot; factor.    I&#x27;m not sure yet if I like this product.  Since I have only used it once, we&#x27;ll see how it improves my skin.  I am leery since it is made in China, and at the same time I feel irritated that the product more on the expensive side even though it is made in China.</li>
            <li> although a little pricey,it&#x27;s a good moisturizer with sunscreen and i like it so far (using it for about 2 weeks).  goes on kind of thick, with a strong sunscreen smell, but that fades, and the product seems to absorb well.  alot does come out of the pump dispenser, but spread it onto your neck and the total amount is fine.</li>
            <li> I recently went on a trip and forgot the expensive moisturizer that I purchased from my NY dermatologist. I purchased this and I have used it for five weeks now, twice a day, and I am so happy with the appearance and feel of my skin.  My skin looks fresher and younger. I find I am able to go without foundation because my skin tone is more even. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it does.  I&#x27;ve been using it a week (2x per day), and my skin is brighter, my dark splotches are lighter, and my fine lines are just a bit finer.      I always wonder, when I see a review like mine, if the person writing it were doing anything to their skin before this product.  Similarly, whenever I hear a cosmetic company present data that X% of women show this-or-that kind of improvement in their skin, I know that the study sample they use is filled with woman who do nothing for skin care (so just starting something, anything, including the test-product, has to produce good effect)    What&#x27;s so impressive about Definity is that it shows benefit above and beyond everything else that I&#x27;m doing.  I take very good care of my skin and use really expensive (Perricone, Esstee, etc.) and not so expensive (Burt&#x27;s Bees, etc) products.  I&#x27;ve even used emu oil (allergic reaction).  So my skin is in good shape (by the way, I have very fair, very sensitive skin).  Definity only added to everything.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Someone needs to fix the price.  I don&#x27;t think this is worth $9,000  - Maybe for a Face Lift, but no a facial moisturizer.  LOL</li>
