    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The brush does an excellent job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the best electric toothbrush from Braun/Oral-b.</li>
            <li>the best tooth brush I used.&lt;br /&gt;till</li>
            <li>Awesome toothbrush!</li>
            <li>The display which I thought would be of no use is the best thing</li>
            <li>Definitely a good investment in oral health!</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone that is looking for a device that is durable, flexible (features) and provides a great cleaning.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Happy with that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good one.  </li>
            <li>Seems to do a good job cleaning.  </li>
            <li>now so good, I am hopping</li>
            <li>/&gt;they are on, and weather they get a &amp;#34;smiley face&amp;#34; for doing a good job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This brush has more bells and whistles than I need, but is really nice!  </li>
            <li>The gum massage setting is great but each time I finish brushing my teeth have that \\&quot;fresh from the dentist&#x27;s cleaning\\&quot; feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Brush is great, travel case is stellar.</li>
            <li>I bought the one with the most bells and whistles (I think) and am extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li>-B also has a better method of replacing the brush heads, so it&#x27;s more future-proof:</li>
            <li>thing to note is with most electric toothbrushes</li>
            <li>but now I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>And while I say this let me add that I have used power toothbrushes for more than 10 years now and have gone through many brands to safely make that comparison.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I could be satisfied than I am.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I was happy with my old one</li>
            <li>but the family loves it and more importantly uses it.</li>
            <li>so far after about 1 year this brush works great.</li>
            <li>am giving it a rating of 4 stars, as I love the toothbrush, but really didn&#x27;t need all the cute gismo&#x27;s that came with it.</li>
            <li>together with the ability to use many different kinds of brush heads, this toothbrush is simply the best!</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about the timer</li>
            <li>My teeth get that just from the dentist feeling of clean.</li>
            <li>I also like to use a waterPik to get a really clean feel.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t come close to the clean achieved w the Phillips Soniccare tooth brush.</li>
            <li>I have had several good electric toothbrushes over the years, and I have found that I prefer the Oral-B versions over the Sonicare ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cool thing is you can be in another room</li>
            <li>The cool thing is you can be in another room</li>
            <li>Better than an older version.</li>
            <li>The cleaning is incredible compared to the older single speed model.</li>
            <li>I personally prefer the circular motion as that gives you a more focused clean, but for those who don&#x27;t want to spend that much time, or prefer this style of motion instead, I like this Oral-B more than its Sonicare counterparts.</li>
            <li>cleaning in the cycle.&lt;br /&gt;I opted not to use the little print out window that comes with the unit, but it would be great for kids so they can watch which level</li>
            <li>It was worth the wait and cost.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful and leaves your teeth very clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can always tell a difference in the brush strength right after I charge it than when I leave it for a day or two</li>
            <li>If all of the hype is true that these are supposed to be better than a manual toothbrush, all the better (can you tell I am not confident in what I read?).  </li>
            <li>it, does a powerful job of cleaning your teeth, The speed is amazing, and my teeth feel really cleaned even at the 3rd level</li>
            <li>/&gt;The new model, however, is fantastic.</li>
            <li>My wife like my original Braun with the new type brushes.</li>
            <li>They are more prone to lemons and batteries weakening too early(as short as three months).&lt;br /&gt;Oral</li>
            <li>It is exactly as stated, recommend to all.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The unit allows you to use multiple brush heads, keeps a close eye on the pressure being applied &amp; my favorite feature, the timer.</li>
            <li>is investing in another brush we expect to last more than a decade.  </li>
            <li>A little suspicious but the brush does a great job overall.</li>
            <li>This brush has accomplished what my sonicare couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I would suggest this to anyone whom wants a quality toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I have been thinking about purchasing an electronic/rechargeable toothbrush for some time and labored over how much to spend on it.  </li>
            <li>I do, however, brush for 3 minutes on the deep sweep clean</li>
            <li>I love the blue tooth display since it really makes sure that I brush for at least two minutes.</li>
            <li>Finally I decided to go for a solid product that got good reviews (even though it was more expensive than I originally intended to spend) and this product is what I picked.  </li>
            <li>main difference between this particular model versus most other Oral-B&#x27;s is that while the others have a circular motion mainly concentrating on each individual tooth, this one has a longer brush head and sweeps back and forth to cover more area.</li>
            <li>Replacing my old Oral-B, similar model, and my teeth feel good, but I think that could happen with a lot of other electric products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are 4 brushing modes: daily clean, deep clean, sensitive, and whitening.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are 4 brushing modes: daily clean, deep clean, sensitive, and whitening.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>previous model worked much better.</li>
            <li>This particular model doesn&#x27;t seem &amp;#34;sonic.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Bought this to replace an older version from 9-10 years ago.</li>
            <li>The strength of the motor will gradually weaken to the point where you end up having to charge them daily or every two days(as opposed to the description on most saying they can last up to a week).</li>
            <li>the main sets for the teeth surface, and the in-between sets to reach in-between</li>
            <li>Had an old Oral B for many years - at least 10 - decided it was no longer efficient - love this one especially with all the cleaning features and clock</li>
            <li>/&gt;Literally dentist clean feel and extremely comfortable when brushing hard to reach parts of the mouth.</li>
            <li>new high end product, i cant feel the difference with the predecessor in function, but hey you gotta catch up with technology.</li>
            <li>The visual unit for lets you see your count down (or count up) with a smiley face is cute, I don&#x27;t have much need for it</li>
            <li>Also, my roommate got the same exact brush but the handle of his</li>
            <li>NO BATTERY INFO ON THE HANDLE LIKE THE OLD MODEL!</li>
            <li>but I like the brushing action.  </li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve gone as far away as 50 feet</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve gone as far away as 50 feet</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s loud but does the job.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it, and really appreciate all of the added features such as the timer, beeps, speed settings, etc.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, this particular model has 3 &amp;#34;sets&amp;#34; of bristles: the top set is for those hard to reach back teeth,</li>
            <li>The deep sweep brush took a while to get used to - bristles a little stiffer than my other brush, but the cleaning feels more thorough!</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that I can change from the tri-action brush  to the normal rotary brush that I have been used to for the last 10 years.</li>
            <li>My last Oral-B died a natural death of old age.</li>
            <li>I purchased this Oral B since my old Oral B&#x27;s battery (after 10 years) was starting to show signs of old age.</li>
            <li>several times with Sonicare as new models come out, I found myself unable to use my current brush heads at that time and had to switch to newer heads, so with this method you can save more and not have to worry about buying new brush heads and wasting your old ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li>its quadrant guides help you brush for the recommended 2 minutes (3 minutes with Deep Clean Mode) and it lights up to tell you when you are brushing too hard.</li>

            <li> For some reason I have a hard time stopping early and disappointing the little happy face.</li>
            <li> We have our last oral-b brush for over 10 years, we only replaced due to the part it breaking (the locking mechanism for keeping the brush attached) -</li>
            <li> is grey and mine</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> A little bit deceiving in that it tells you it comes with 1 replacement head, but that is the only head it comes with.</li>
            <li> I use the little monitor each time and feel there has been a big improvement in the health of my gums.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> It waas also always giving a false reading of too much force.</li>
            <li> My first expensive electric toothbrush and I must say it lives up to the hype.</li>
            <li> As compared to other brands and even oral B lower models, this one has no comparison.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would rather have the price down by $5.-$10.</li>
            <li> A little pricey.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t compromise your teeth with a little savings on your electric bill</li>
            <li> The timer takes a little getting use too</li>
            <li> is green.</li>
            <li> Not happy that It seems to only work on 120volts when we have 240volts here in Australia.</li>
            <li> i was very disappointed to pay that much for a piece of plastic that is so much smaller than i expected</li>
            <li> No big deal; but if you are expecting 2 heads like I was, you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Expensive.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about spending almost $150 on a toothbrush</li>
            <li> BAD DESIGN!</li>

            <li> Yes, I like it.  It&#x27;s a good one.  A little pricey.  If all of the hype is true that these are supposed to be better than a manual toothbrush, all the better (can you tell I am not confident in what I read?).  This particular model doesn&#x27;t seem &amp;#34;sonic.&amp;#34;  In fact, I don&#x27;t believe it is sonic - but I like the brushing action.  Seems to do a good job cleaning.  Four stars - price.  Expensive.</li>
            <li> This brush has accomplished what my sonicare couldn&#x27;t. It gets between my front teeth at the gum line which has always been a problem.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace an older version from 9-10 years ago. However, it appears that the charger was the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new model, however, is fantastic. The cleaning is incredible compared to the older single speed model. I still floss, but I am getting nothing! The brush does an excellent job. I do, however, brush for 3 minutes on the deep sweep clean setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best electric toothbrush from Braun/Oral-b. AND, it&#x27;s made in Germany, NOT China!</li>
            <li> the best tooth brush I used.&lt;br /&gt;till now so good, I am hopping it will continue to work, because some review mentioned it stooped working after some time.</li>
            <li> Had an old Oral B for many years - at least 10 - decided it was no longer efficient - love this one especially with all the cleaning features and clock</li>
            <li> Brush is great, travel case is stellar. A little bit deceiving in that it tells you it comes with 1 replacement head, but that is the only head it comes with. Also, my roommate got the same exact brush but the handle of his is grey and mine is green. Oh and we both got different heads. A little suspicious but the brush does a great job overall.</li>
            <li> This Oral-B toothbrush must be my 3rd Oral B product. My last Oral-B died a natural death of old age. This model, when I first&lt;br /&gt;used it, does a powerful job of cleaning your teeth, The speed is amazing, and my teeth feel really cleaned even at the 3rd level&lt;br /&gt;of cleaning in the cycle.&lt;br /&gt;I opted not to use the little print out window that comes with the unit, but it would be great for kids so they can watch which level&lt;br /&gt;they are on, and weather they get a &amp;#34;smiley face&amp;#34; for doing a good job.&lt;br /&gt;I am giving it a rating of 4 stars, as I love the toothbrush, but really didn&#x27;t need all the cute gismo&#x27;s that came with it.</li>
            <li> My first expensive electric toothbrush and I must say it lives up to the hype. I bought the one with the most bells and whistles (I think) and am extremely satisfied. The gum massage setting is great but each time I finish brushing my teeth have that \\&quot;fresh from the dentist&#x27;s cleaning\\&quot; feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I know it is not going to take the place of dental cleaning and flossing it does work well and when used with a polishing toothpaste and the polishing head makes a noticeable improvement in whiteness as well.</li>
            <li> I have had several good electric toothbrushes over the years, and I have found that I prefer the Oral-B versions over the Sonicare ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main difference between this particular model versus most other Oral-B&#x27;s is that while the others have a circular motion mainly concentrating on each individual tooth, this one has a longer brush head and sweeps back and forth to cover more area. I personally prefer the circular motion as that gives you a more focused clean, but for those who don&#x27;t want to spend that much time, or prefer this style of motion instead, I like this Oral-B more than its Sonicare counterparts. I found that the Sonicare toothbrushes just don&#x27;t last very long. They are more prone to lemons and batteries weakening too early(as short as three months).&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B also has a better method of replacing the brush heads, so it&#x27;s more future-proof: several times with Sonicare as new models come out, I found myself unable to use my current brush heads at that time and had to switch to newer heads, so with this method you can save more and not have to worry about buying new brush heads and wasting your old ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note is with most electric toothbrushes, you have to realize and beware that the battery don&#x27;t last very long. In fact, I have never had an electric toothbrush that can hold a charge over two years. The strength of the motor will gradually weaken to the point where you end up having to charge them daily or every two days(as opposed to the description on most saying they can last up to a week). Don&#x27;t compromise your teeth with a little savings on your electric bill - just charge it every 1 or 2 days. I can always tell a difference in the brush strength right after I charge it than when I leave it for a day or two uncharged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, this particular model has 3 &amp;#34;sets&amp;#34; of bristles: the top set is for those hard to reach back teeth, the main sets for the teeth surface, and the in-between sets to reach in-between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;There are 4 brushing modes: daily clean, deep clean, sensitive, and whitening.&lt;br /&gt;Also included is the Oral-B Wireless SmartGuide, which provides real-time guidance - its quadrant guides help you brush for the recommended 2 minutes (3 minutes with Deep Clean Mode) and it lights up to tell you when you are brushing too hard. It is wall mountable and includes the tape and mount so you don&#x27;t need to buy anything. It also doubles as a clock! The cool thing is you can be in another room and it will still be connected - I&#x27;ve gone as far away as 50 feet and they both still sync.n-between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;There are 4 brushing modes: daily clean, deep clean, sensitive, and whitening.&lt;br /&gt;Also included is the Oral-B Wireless SmartGuide, which provides real-time guidance - its quadrant guides help you brush for the recommended 2 minutes (3 minutes with Deep Clean Mode) and it lights up to tell you when you are brushing too hard.

            <li> I purchased this Oral B since my old Oral B&#x27;s battery (after 10 years) was starting to show signs of old age. I was happy with my old one so I stuck with the same brand. I love the blue tooth display since it really makes sure that I brush for at least two minutes. For some reason I have a hard time stopping early and disappointing the little happy face. I also like the fact that I can change from the tri-action brush  to the normal rotary brush that I have been used to for the last 10 years. It is exactly as stated, recommend to all.</li>
            <li> Awesome toothbrush! A bit pricey but the family loves it and more importantly uses it. I would suggest this to anyone whom wants a quality toothbrush. This is built to last!</li>
            <li> new high end product, i cant feel the difference with the predecessor in function, but hey you gotta catch up with technology.</li>
            <li> This was never intended for use in Australia as 110 could not be used could not be used. Complete waste of money. I am hoping to get reimbursed</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted. My teeth get that just from the dentist feeling of clean. The unit allows you to use multiple brush heads, keeps a close eye on the pressure being applied &amp; my favorite feature, the timer.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about spending almost $150 on a toothbrush but now I am glad I did. As compared to other brands and even oral B lower models, this one has no comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Literally dentist clean feel and extremely comfortable when brushing hard to reach parts of the mouth. The display which I thought would be of no use is the best thing ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All together with the ability to use many different kinds of brush heads, this toothbrush is simply the best! And while I say this let me add that I have used power toothbrushes for more than 10 years now and have gone through many brands to safely make that comparison.</li>
            <li> We have our last oral-b brush for over 10 years, we only replaced due to the part it breaking (the locking mechanism for keeping the brush attached) - so there is no problem is investing in another brush we expect to last more than a decade.  The visual unit for lets you see your count down (or count up) with a smiley face is cute, I don&#x27;t have much need for it but the kid&#x27;s like it.</li>
            <li> i was very disappointed to pay that much for a piece of plastic that is so much smaller than i expected</li>
            <li> My wife like my original Braun with the new type brushes. It waas also always giving a false reading of too much force. So I upgraded to this model and I really like it. I use the little monitor each time and feel there has been a big improvement in the health of my gums. I also like to use a waterPik to get a really clean feel.</li>
            <li> Better than an older version. Works as expected.</li>
            <li> I have been thinking about purchasing an electronic/rechargeable toothbrush for some time and labored over how much to spend on it.  Finally I decided to go for a solid product that got good reviews (even though it was more expensive than I originally intended to spend) and this product is what I picked.  I don&#x27;t think I could be satisfied than I am.  It was worth the wait and cost.  At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about the timer but it adds quite a bit of value to this item. I recommend this to anyone that is looking for a device that is durable, flexible (features) and provides a great cleaning.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come close to the clean achieved w the Phillips Soniccare tooth brush. Save your money.&lt;br /&gt;/trust m e....</li>
            <li> so far after about 1 year this brush works great.</li>
            <li> Love it! Very powerful and leaves your teeth very clean.&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s loud but does the job. I owned a Sonicare since 1999 and&lt;br /&gt;It finally died. I was hesitant about purchasing a different brand but decided to take a chance&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;m glad I did.  The timer takes a little getting use too and I find I do brush longer&lt;br /&gt;Using the timer. I would recommend this brush, go for it!</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift. And I&#x27;m still getting a daily &#x27;thank-you&#x27;. Now i&#x27;ll need one for myself as well.</li>
            <li> This brush has more bells and whistles than I need, but is really nice!  The deep sweep brush took a while to get used to - bristles a little stiffer than my other brush, but the cleaning feels more thorough! Definitely a good investment in oral health!</li>
            <li> this product delivers as advertised.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it, and really appreciate all of the added features such as the timer, beeps, speed settings, etc.</li>
            <li> Somehow disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;The previous model worked much better.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER seen so many expensive Gimmicks come with an appliance that should be so simple. Replacing my old Oral-B, similar model, and my teeth feel good, but I think that could happen with a lot of other electric products.  It took me 20 minutes just to unpack all the c--p, and I have a Ph.D.  What are they trying to do?  I give up!  I would rather have the price down by $5.-$10. dollars.  AND...I had to pry open the lids on the gimmicks with pliers! NO BATTERY INFO ON THE HANDLE LIKE THE OLD MODEL! What on earth were they thinking?  BAD DESIGN! THREW AWAY ALL THE NONSENSE!  &amp;#34;KEEP IT SIMPLE, STUPID!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  The only reason it does not get 5 stars is because the tray/stand that holds the brushes and unit gets kinds of slimy  and has to be cleaned every couple of days.</li>
            <li> It has just arrived so haven&#x27;t tried it yet. Sent to me in Australia. Happy with that. Not happy that It seems to only work on 120volts when we have 240volts here in Australia. It&#x27;s a hurdle I will have to overcome. Thought the charger would be for international use.</li>
            <li> Be careful. The amazon description of \\&quot;What&#x27;s in the box?\\&quot; is incorrect. You do not get 2 refill heads, only the 1 Deep Sweep head. The \\&quot;What&#x27;s in the Box?\\&quot; description and the Product description don&#x27;t match. No big deal; but if you are expecting 2 heads like I was, you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
