            <li>This is the lightest dryer I have ever owned, and I loved it.  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer is a good size and not too noisy;  it folds to a good size for a 25 inch suitcase.</li>
            <li>This light weight hair dryer is the best.  </li>

            <li>very pleased with this vendor.</li>
            <li>Nice powerful compact- perfect</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Did not bring the top side !</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I bought this for our trip to Europe, and was so glad that I did!</li>
            <li>I borrowed this blow dryer from my neighbor (when mine went ka-put) and I fell in love!</li>
            <li>The folding handle is a nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Instead, I have put it in my camper&#x27;s bathroom where everyone can use it rather than bring their own.</li>
            <li>- good, looks like Revlon but better grip on switch to low/high/off</li>
            <li>Liked the fact that it could be used either in US or Europe without a converter.</li>
            <li>The size is nice and compact, it packs a lot of drying power.</li>
            <li>Please have a screwdriver handy to change the voltage.</li>
            <li>Nice size.  </li>
            <li>nice dryer.</li>
            <li>Great size and powerful!  </li>
            <li>Nice size, easily storable, good power.</li>
            <li>I wanted one that folded as well as had a cool shot button, both of which this does, and came at a great price.</li>
            <li>It is quiet, has a good temperature range and the perfect amount of air to style my hair.  </li>
            <li>I needed up getting the Conair 1600 watt Compact dryer instead - super compact and works great.</li>
            <li>Fairly light-weight, and a bit more drying power than most travel blow dryers.</li>
            <li>Also the force of air is very strong.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle  and lightweight!  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li>Worked great for my first trip.</li>
            <li>We bought it to use in Chile, and it surprisingly dries as well as my full sized dryer.</li>
            <li>This dryer is HUGE!  </li>
            <li>so I just ended up using a seprate converter thinking it would be ok even though I couldn&#x27;t turn the knob.  </li>
            <li>I would have used the dryer more often on my 12 day stay</li>
            <li>and this really fit the bill!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a hair dryer with more power</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer though.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to all my friends and they all love it too.</li>
            <li>Love this dryer.</li>
            <li>Was so glad to be able to get another just like the one I had...</li>
            <li>I have been buying this model for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I was able to use it in the UK.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received many compliments on it -</li>
            <li>so if I need to plug into a wall socket I don&#x27;t have to crouch for the dryer to reach the top of my head.</li>
            <li>Love that I can fold it and put in my vanity draw.  </li>
            <li>great but found Babyliss much lighter</li>
            <li>Folds up nicely in your travel bag and light weight.</li>
            <li>I went online and ordered two more</li>
            <li>Love the dual voltage which lets me fold and pack with me on all my trips overseas.  </li>
            <li>I am 100% sure it is second-handed.</li>
            <li>handy, light and works well.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I was expecting something compact - this thing will take up way more room in my suitcase</li>
            <li>and I think this one is one of the nicer, more affordable ones.</li>
            <li>much better</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>LOVE its size.</li>
            <li>My favorite hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>on top of that, it&#x27;s so inexpensive, why would I buy another?  </li>
            <li>I used the correct settings and even made sure that the voltage was correct.</li>
            <li>I used a transformer to make sure that it wouldn&#x27;t kill the dryer but no dice.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>love it.  </li>
            <li>Has way more power than most hotel hairdryers.  </li>
            <li>The best price on the Remington was direct from Remington&#x27;s website (significantly lower price than Amazon).</li>
            <li>size &amp; weight very good but could use a high COOL setting.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!!</li>
            <li>Love this strong hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Light weight, dual voltage very powerful and a handy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To make up for the temperature being warm, rather than hot, this baby will blow you out of the room!</li>
            <li>The unit itself felt pretty good in the hand and felt sturdy and not at all cheap.</li>
            <li>The size was more important for the trip than the functionality.</li>
            <li>It gives me fast drying that i want from a good hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Powerful and nice compact travel hairdryer.</li>
            <li>Very powerful and efficient, and I&#x27;m glad I found it.  </li>
            <li>If your suitcase is tight on space - this might not be the best solution since there are more compact ones on the market.</li>
            <li>Great!  Compact and lighter than other travel hair dryers.</li>
            <li>Sweet!</li>
            <li>I bought this for my trip to Europe because it folds up and is easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>BUT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had purchased this specifically to take with me to europe since I know you could suposidly easily adjust the wattage.  </li>
            <li>Easily fits in a 3.5 inch depth drawer.</li>
            <li>It has been 3 months going strong.</li>
            <li>Although the hotels we were staying in often provided a blowdryer, this one was by far more superior.</li>
            <li>Strong yet compact.</li>
            <li>I would have liked it to me a little more compact but it drys hair great.</li>
            <li>Not too noisy and love the cool setting to set the style.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice the barrel doesn&#x27;t get as hot.</li>
            <li>The new one was good in that it folds easily</li>
            <li>worked fine.</li>
            <li>I took the hair dryer apart today and noticed that everything works fine.</li>
            <li>elegant, powerful, but fingers could easily slip fancy roundish</li>
            <li>but it has helped all my hair drying troubles so far on low perfectly  (which again is the perfect setting to dry hair in because it feels like a medium-high).</li>
            <li>This is a handy little dryer that&#x27;s great for travel.</li>
            <li>It is the strongest, most powerful one I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>The model she had is no longer available.  </li>
            <li>but those are so cheap.</li>
            <li>but they said to keep it so I will enjoy it at home.  </li>
            <li>Fits nicely in my luggage and doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li>Perfect for traveling and everyday use.</li>
            <li>had to get this LIGHT WEIGHT ...</li>
            <li>Cheap and efficient.</li>
            <li>It worked great once, but the next day I couldn&#x27;t get it to even turn on.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll be buying a new one; I should have known $15 was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>Light, compact, and very powerful</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy to say the thing works exactly like the old one.</li>
            <li>light weight, powerful, easy to use</li>
            <li>It is powerful and light weight and drys your hair very quickly.</li>
            <li>Revlon Perfect Heat 1875W Fast Dry Compact Dryer (0.8lbs)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful but extremely light weight and folds easily.</li>
            <li>If the knob was user friendly</li>
            <li>It stopped blowing hot air at the appropriate rate on 9/22/14.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for traveling since it&#x27;s small in size and the handle folds in.</li>
            <li>great little dryer, love it</li>
            <li>Directions say to clean the lint filter but don&#x27;t say how to find it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, small size yet very effective at drying hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>it is very powerful and dries your hair quickly.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how great it would be for dry time!</li>
            <li>This little dryer is really incredible.</li>
            <li>I use the cool button every time.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the handle folds in and it has a cool shot.</li>
            <li>- good airflow but 1600w and looks a bit like standard hotel dryers</li>
            <li>blow dryer is light weight, it is powerful and it lasts.  </li>
            <li>Price is fair enough.</li>
            <li>I needed a true travel-sized hair dryer.</li>
            <li>If any criticism, it would be that the air temp is at best warm, not hot as are our other 1875W dryers.</li>
            <li>My wife loves the quick drying capabilities and the ease of handling.</li>
            <li>Very power and comfortable fit in tl my arthritic hands.  </li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s compact and also dries your hair super quickly AND</li>
            <li>The sound of the hair dryer is higher than that of the others that I ever used.</li>
            <li>and it took less time than I&#x27;m accustomed to, and my hair looked great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that is probably better on your hair in the long run, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li>Good size, not too hot, basic dryer.</li>
            <li>Small, lightweight with good drying power!  </li>
            <li>Great power for a little hair dryer.</li>
            <li>GREAT and POWERFUL for a little hair dryer...</li>
            <li>Great little powerful dryer that we bought for traveling.</li>
            <li>Decent size and easily portable....</li>
            <li>It is quite powerful and served the purpose it was bought for</li>
            <li>However, since the key feature she liked was the compact size, I&#x27;m giving it 4</li>
            <li>It is compact but powerful</li>
            <li>Still worth the price I think.</li>
            <li>Works perfect for my thin hair.  </li>
            <li>This was just a bit larger than I would have liked.</li>
            <li>Run hot or cool.</li>
            <li>Powerful and compact.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s pretty powerful and dries your hair quickly</li>
            <li>Love this, its very strong when on high and the cord is long.</li>
            <li>Good think alot of the other hotels had a dryer of their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then i switched it to 220v right away and packed it.</li>
            <li>I was pretty surprised that it was able to handle that abuse.</li>
            <li>I plugged it in to see how hot it will get - hot!</li>
            <li>This is a great little hair dryer, it works better than the larger one i have.  </li>
            <li>Great quality for a small hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty powerful for the size.</li>
            <li>It folds nicely and I like to take it with me when I go on long trips.</li>
            <li>PURE JUNK!</li>
            <li>Exactly the right size blow dryer I needed and wanted to take when I travel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good primary or secondary hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I wish that I was a bit smaller but overall, it is a great item.</li>
            <li>It drys quickly and doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li>It is very good, but haven&#x27;t had it very long, so I am reserving one star for the long haul.</li>
            <li>for the heat of the air coming out of the unit, the low was warm, while the high was very hot and effective in drying very wet hair.</li>
            <li>Good little hairdryer.</li>
            <li>For comparison, I plugged in my full size Bayliss Ceramix Xtreme hairdryer and turned it on high.</li>
            <li>Good dryer, works well, pretty lightweight, a little noisy</li>
            <li>The first one lasted about a month and just died without incident.  </li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend it!</li>
            <li>Order the first one which lasted 7 months.  </li>
            <li>so it does not take up much space at all!</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Very lightweight and powerful.</li>
            <li>it folds up which is pretty neat.</li>
            <li>Cricket Pro 7144 Professional Friction Free Dual Voltage Travel Hair Dryer,… (1lb)</li>
            <li>Loud and kinda cheap feeling.</li>
            <li>perfect power for such a small hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It finally bit the dust after many years of service.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ll give this unit a recommendation because it has a smaller adapter than most.</li>
            <li>Plenty of hot air.</li>
            <li>VERY noisy!</li>
            <li>Its still pumping out hot air each time we use it.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>from the first use you know it will die soon.</li>
            <li>It shorted out the lights on the first use, and it doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li>I was amazed that it was pretty powerful and not weak like the ones at gyms or at hotels.</li>
            <li>Perhaps some people would be happy with the size, but I was looking for something very small and packable in a backpack.</li>
            <li>The only con is that the head is a little longer (an inch or so) than those of the conair snub nose travel dryers but having the full size cord and the cool shot is most important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I try to do mine every time I run the vacuum in the bathroom which keeps it very clean.</li>
            <li>Although it is one of the more compact dryers and the smallest I could find with a reasonable rating, it is a bit bigger than the one</li>
            <li>Although a bit bigger than our former travel dryer, this unit operates well and have good air volume.</li>
            <li>Babyliss Bambino Nano Titanium Ulta Lightweight Hair Dryer, 1000 Watt (0.6lb) - soooo light, 1000Watt but quiet powerful, almost like an 1875&lt;br /&gt;5.  </li>
            <li>when I have it on high the heater had to take a break and blows cooler air (not cold- just cooler)</li>
            <li>Great if not using it every single day as it&#x27;s small and can be stored out of the way easily.</li>
            <li>The outlook is really cool, love the black.</li>
            <li>- loud high pitch sound 1600Watts&lt;</li>
            <li>but if I want it hot I have to run it on high and that is way too much &#x27;blow&#x27;!&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>The low is too low with luke warm air and the high will blow your head off and isn&#x27;t very hot.  </li>
            <li>I should have spent more money on a higher quality one</li>
            <li>and this certainly had it.  </li>
            <li>Was amazed how potent it is and how fast I could get my hair dry.</li>
            <li>but I have short and fine hair</li>
            <li>It worked fine on my European trip and in the US too.</li>
            <li>The length of the chord is good, it&#x27;s still high powered even though it&#x27;s small.</li>
            <li>Will not take up much room when traveling.</li>
            <li>I had gone to one hotel in Florence and was in a rush to get ready</li>
            <li>I still use it since I go on frequent mini get aways and it just wasn&#x27;t worth the return.</li>
            <li>This dryer works really well</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much quieter.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li>really like this dryer and like using it.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer the Remington 5000 hairdryer which has three heat settings and three speeds.  </li>
            <li>It was really loud/noisy.</li>
            <li>with most items I purchase on Amazon, I checked the reviews of others carefully before purchase.  </li>
            <li>Thanks folks, and thanks, Amazon.</li>
            <li>In NY the HIGH kept turning off the power outlet!</li>
            <li>I wanted to pack light with only a carry on.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer didn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>So much for quality control.</li>
            <li>I brought this hair dryer to Europe with me and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>Very forceful - i really like it.</li>
            <li>Does not require much room when packing.  </li>
            <li>I have a professional hair dryer at home and this one seems just a powerful.</li>
            <li>Bought for wife and she really likes.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair really fast</li>
            <li>Arrived fast.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for home or travel!</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s shoulders have been causing too much pain to finish drying her hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got enough wattage to dry hair quckly and is comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This little guy is VERY strong.</li>
            <li>Way too much power on the high setting which made my hair knotty as I styled it.  </li>
            <li>It gets really noisy when turned to the high speed but that don&#x27;t seem to be bothering at all to me.</li>
            <li>Overall, good for occasional use, but wouldn&#x27;t recommend for daily use.</li>
            <li>I especially like the cool air option.  </li>
            <li>Based on this dryer&#x27;s good reviews, I thought it might be a similar, or even better, product; unfortunately, that was not the case at all.</li>
            <li>Yes, it blows very forcefully (perhaps too forcefully) on high, but the heat delivered on the high setting is not as high as I would like.  </li>
            <li>I love it and it folds in half</li>
            <li>I now use this for my regular hair dryer because it works better than my big one!</li>
            <li>But it is a decent hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Decent hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I will be using this as my regular dryer back in the states! :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a problem with the loudness of the noise, it was the pitch when I was using the high heat setting.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use it on high.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t turn it on high because it didn&#x27;t like that</li>
            <li>but the next setting down was more than adequate to dry my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>Note well, while it is a little bit larger than the one she liked so much, it is a bit stronger in terms of air velocity and heat output.  </li>
            <li>This little hair dryer is more powerful than my big one, which was a feature I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Dries much faster than his old one did</li>
            <li>It works just as good as my big one, if not better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful, small, light.  </li>
            <li>But beware, the high setting is VERY loud.</li>
            <li>I only dry my hair at the most 2 times a week</li>
            <li>And the high setting was so strong it starts to smell like something is burning and the back part lights up very orange due to the veryyyy high heat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t get a fifth star because it&#x27;s a little bigger than I would have liked.  </li>
            <li>two weeks ago it burnt out on me, so I came online and purchased from here to get a new one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong and dries my hair in less than 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Love this little hair dryer!</li>
            <li>Great - High Powered - Travel Dryer - Small and compact - takes up little room in my suitcase</li>
            <li>Words very fast, and is very quiet for a blow dryer.</li>
            <li>very loud and have burning smell.</li>
            <li>The full size on high was the same level of loudness as the low on the Vidal Sassoon unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some dryers barely blow your hair but this fan really pushes the air through.</li>
            <li>I had one of these in the past and i am so glad Amazon had one.  </li>
            <li>This is our second Vidal Sassoon blow dryer, the first one lasted well over 5 years.</li>
            <li>Be aware that when using at 250 volts, you can only use the &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; setting.  </li>
            <li>I like it but the low speed never gets too hot.....</li>
            <li>At first I thought that would be a problem, but once I got used to it, it cut my drying time by a third.</li>
            <li>I was traveling abroad and needed dual hair drier strong enough to dry my course curly hair, and compact to carry.</li>
            <li>Reason for the 4 is that high air means high heat with no option for high air low heat</li>
            <li>Sure it&#x27;s not a full size drier, but its certainly not small enough in my book.</li>
            <li>I know the large plug is necessary, but I don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li>It came and had a wiring issue that caused it to fluctuate between low and high heat when on the high heat setting.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s portable and get my really long hair dry very quickly.</li>
            <li>This is much too heavy and too large for me to use it as a &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; dryer, as it would take up too much room in my suitcase.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful little dryer.</li>
            <li>Very powerful little hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It is loud</li>
            <li>I had to replace my old one</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem as gentle as my home dryer, but I don&#x27;t use this often enough to fry my hair.</li>
            <li>She says its lighter than her old one.  </li>
            <li>There is nothing anywhere near as compact as what she had been using.  </li>
            <li>Personally I like it because it does not hurt my hair that much.</li>
            <li>I took this blower to Italy and even using the LOW setting, as soon as I turned the blower on, it blew out and the whole unit was fried.</li>
            <li>Lastly, it is extremely loud.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really kinda big (in my opinion) for travel.</li>
            <li>product arrived early.</li>
            <li>It has as much, if not more, power than the full size dryers.</li>
            <li>I concluded that it is worth replacing this relatively inexpensive item every year because it is so much easier to use than any other dryer I have owned.</li>
            <li>My wife had a fabulous (and very small, very compact) hair drier.  </li>
            <li>It is, in fact, too large and heavy for me to be willing to use it at home.  </li>
            <li>Since the folding handle was where my previous model broke, I&#x27;m playing it safe and leaving it open for daily use.  </li>
            <li>There are two settings low and high.  </li>
            <li>but I found that LOW was too low, and HIGH too high.  </li>
            <li>The low setting basically works as if it were a high setting.</li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for, light, small and compact</li>
            <li>Huge - not sure why they call it &amp;#34;travel.&amp;#34;  Fairly light weight, but not at all small.  </li>
            <li>small and light ...perfect for travel.</li>
            <li>Ours had been in daily use for a couple of months now and shows no negative signs of wear.</li>
            <li>Very powerful for a small hairdryer</li>
            <li>In the past, I had a babyliss travel hair dryer that worked well and was very powerful.</li>
            <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t make it much smaller especially with the cord and the ground</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the other review is talking about because you get exactly what is pictured.  </li>
            <li>Conair 1875 Watt Folding Handle Compact Hair Dryer (1lb) - feels heavier than other 1lb dryers even if exact weight</li>
            <li>It also has a little screw that can easily be set with a screwdriver to accomodate the European 250 voltage, as well as American 125 voltage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small enough to pack or stores easily at home.  </li>
            <li>Works way faster than the bigger, professional grade one my friend gave me just after I bought it.</li>
            <li>By the fourth time, the dryer stopped working completely.</li>
            <li>I liked this dryer when we first received, but after using for only 2 weeks it would only blow cold air.</li>
            <li>Kind of scary looks like its going to blow up...</li>
            <li>It has survived multiple international baggage handlers and still functions like new.</li>
            <li>I use it at home but will need a smaller less powerful dryer for travel.</li>
            <li>However, the Sassoon 1875w Stylist Traveler is at the extreme opposite end of the spectrum for sound: it must be at least 110 decibels of screaming, whining, buzzing NOISE, right up next to one&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>Small enough to fit in any bag but big on power.</li>
            <li>this little dryer was, much faster than her semi professional dryer at home.</li>
            <li>It has three settings: hot, cold, and off, and a button to press that essentially collapses the top, and a cord to wrap around.</li>
            <li>DO NOT DRY YOUR RABBIT WITH THIS DEATH MACHINE</li>
            <li>small and convenient, powerful and lite would order again.</li>
            <li>While traveling in Europe my wife was commenting how unbelievable powerful</li>
            <li>I love that it folds down and is small enough to carry around.</li>
            <li>I have super thick, long hair that takes forever to dry but on the lowest setting you can really feel this dryer work.</li>
            <li>This is one terrific and powerful little travel dryer!  </li>
            <li>It folds right away and takes up very little space.</li>
            <li>and I suspect uses less energy than the hair dryers from the past - at least the lights dont dim when it is in operation - always a good sign.  </li>
            <li>It does the exact same job as a heavy hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>On the 250V setting the \\&quot;High\\&quot; position of the switch is mechanically blocked which means that the fan does have only one position if set to 250V (&#x3D; always on \\&quot;High\\&quot; due to the voltage or respectively the \\&quot;Low\\&quot; setting performs the high output).</li>
            <li>So nothing is broken, everything is fine</li>
            <li>and it gets my hair dry just as fast as any other.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I borrowed this blow dryer from my neighbor (when mine went ka-put) and I fell in love!</li>
            <li> The folding handle is a nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Instead, I have put it in my camper&#x27;s bathroom where everyone can use it rather than bring their own.</li>
            <li> - good, looks like Revlon but better grip on switch to low/high/off</li>
            <li> Liked the fact that it could be used either in US or Europe without a converter.</li>
            <li> The size is nice and compact, it packs a lot of drying power.</li>
            <li> Please have a screwdriver handy to change the voltage.</li>
            <li> Nice size.  </li>
            <li> nice dryer.</li>
            <li> Great size and powerful!  </li>
            <li> Nice size, easily storable, good power.</li>
            <li> I wanted one that folded as well as had a cool shot button, both of which this does, and came at a great price.</li>
            <li> It is quiet, has a good temperature range and the perfect amount of air to style my hair.  </li>
            <li> I needed up getting the Conair 1600 watt Compact dryer instead - super compact and works great.</li>
            <li> Fairly light-weight, and a bit more drying power than most travel blow dryers.</li>
            <li> Also the force of air is very strong.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle  and lightweight!  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> Worked great for my first trip.</li>
            <li> We bought it to use in Chile, and it surprisingly dries as well as my full sized dryer.</li>
            <li> This dryer is HUGE!  </li>
            <li> so I just ended up using a seprate converter thinking it would be ok even though I couldn&#x27;t turn the knob.  </li>
            <li> I would have used the dryer more often on my 12 day stay</li>
            <li> and this really fit the bill!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a hair dryer with more power</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer though.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to all my friends and they all love it too.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer.</li>
            <li> Was so glad to be able to get another just like the one I had...</li>
            <li> I have been buying this model for years and love it.  </li>
            <li> I was able to use it in the UK.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received many compliments on it -</li>
            <li> so if I need to plug into a wall socket I don&#x27;t have to crouch for the dryer to reach the top of my head.</li>
            <li> Love that I can fold it and put in my vanity draw.  </li>
            <li> great but found Babyliss much lighter</li>
            <li> Folds up nicely in your travel bag and light weight.</li>
            <li> I went online and ordered two more</li>
            <li> Love the dual voltage which lets me fold and pack with me on all my trips overseas.  </li>
            <li> I am 100% sure it is second-handed.</li>
            <li> handy, light and works well.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I was expecting something compact - this thing will take up way more room in my suitcase</li>
            <li> and I think this one is one of the nicer, more affordable ones.</li>
            <li> much better</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> LOVE its size.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> on top of that, it&#x27;s so inexpensive, why would I buy another?  </li>
            <li> I used the correct settings and even made sure that the voltage was correct.</li>
            <li> I used a transformer to make sure that it wouldn&#x27;t kill the dryer but no dice.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> love it.  </li>
            <li> Has way more power than most hotel hairdryers.  </li>
            <li> The best price on the Remington was direct from Remington&#x27;s website (significantly lower price than Amazon).</li>
            <li> size &amp; weight very good but could use a high COOL setting.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!!</li>
            <li> Love this strong hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Light weight, dual voltage very powerful and a handy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To make up for the temperature being warm, rather than hot, this baby will blow you out of the room!</li>
            <li> The unit itself felt pretty good in the hand and felt sturdy and not at all cheap.</li>
            <li> The size was more important for the trip than the functionality.</li>
            <li> It gives me fast drying that i want from a good hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Powerful and nice compact travel hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Very powerful and efficient, and I&#x27;m glad I found it.  </li>
            <li> If your suitcase is tight on space - this might not be the best solution since there are more compact ones on the market.</li>
            <li> Great!  Compact and lighter than other travel hair dryers.</li>
            <li> Sweet!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my trip to Europe because it folds up and is easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> BUT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had purchased this specifically to take with me to europe since I know you could suposidly easily adjust the wattage.  </li>
            <li> Easily fits in a 3.5 inch depth drawer.</li>
            <li> It has been 3 months going strong.</li>
            <li> Although the hotels we were staying in often provided a blowdryer, this one was by far more superior.</li>
            <li> Strong yet compact.</li>
            <li> I would have liked it to me a little more compact but it drys hair great.</li>
            <li> Not too noisy and love the cool setting to set the style.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice the barrel doesn&#x27;t get as hot.</li>
            <li> The new one was good in that it folds easily</li>
            <li> worked fine.</li>
            <li> I took the hair dryer apart today and noticed that everything works fine.</li>
            <li> elegant, powerful, but fingers could easily slip fancy roundish</li>
            <li> but it has helped all my hair drying troubles so far on low perfectly  (which again is the perfect setting to dry hair in because it feels like a medium-high).</li>
            <li> This is a handy little dryer that&#x27;s great for travel.</li>
            <li> It is the strongest, most powerful one I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> The model she had is no longer available.  </li>
            <li> but those are so cheap.</li>
            <li> but they said to keep it so I will enjoy it at home.  </li>
            <li> Fits nicely in my luggage and doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li> Perfect for traveling and everyday use.</li>
            <li> had to get this LIGHT WEIGHT ...</li>
            <li> Cheap and efficient.</li>
            <li> It worked great once, but the next day I couldn&#x27;t get it to even turn on.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll be buying a new one; I should have known $15 was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Light, compact, and very powerful</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy to say the thing works exactly like the old one.</li>
            <li> light weight, powerful, easy to use</li>
            <li> It is powerful and light weight and drys your hair very quickly.</li>
            <li> Revlon Perfect Heat 1875W Fast Dry Compact Dryer (0.8lbs)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful but extremely light weight and folds easily.</li>
            <li> If the knob was user friendly</li>
            <li> It stopped blowing hot air at the appropriate rate on 9/22/14.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for traveling since it&#x27;s small in size and the handle folds in.</li>
            <li> great little dryer, love it</li>
            <li> Directions say to clean the lint filter but don&#x27;t say how to find it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice, small size yet very effective at drying hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> it is very powerful and dries your hair quickly.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how great it would be for dry time!</li>
            <li> This little dryer is really incredible.</li>
            <li> I use the cool button every time.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the handle folds in and it has a cool shot.</li>
            <li> - good airflow but 1600w and looks a bit like standard hotel dryers</li>
            <li> blow dryer is light weight, it is powerful and it lasts.  </li>
            <li> Price is fair enough.</li>
            <li> I needed a true travel-sized hair dryer.</li>
            <li> If any criticism, it would be that the air temp is at best warm, not hot as are our other 1875W dryers.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the quick drying capabilities and the ease of handling.</li>
            <li> Very power and comfortable fit in tl my arthritic hands.  </li>
            <li> The fact that it&#x27;s compact and also dries your hair super quickly AND</li>
            <li> The sound of the hair dryer is higher than that of the others that I ever used.</li>
            <li> and it took less time than I&#x27;m accustomed to, and my hair looked great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that is probably better on your hair in the long run, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li> Good size, not too hot, basic dryer.</li>
            <li> Small, lightweight with good drying power!  </li>
            <li> Great power for a little hair dryer.</li>
            <li> GREAT and POWERFUL for a little hair dryer...</li>
            <li> Great little powerful dryer that we bought for traveling.</li>
            <li> Decent size and easily portable....</li>
            <li> It is quite powerful and served the purpose it was bought for</li>
            <li> However, since the key feature she liked was the compact size, I&#x27;m giving it 4</li>
            <li> It is compact but powerful</li>
            <li> Still worth the price I think.</li>
            <li> Works perfect for my thin hair.  </li>
            <li> This was just a bit larger than I would have liked.</li>
            <li> Run hot or cool.</li>
            <li> Powerful and compact.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s pretty powerful and dries your hair quickly</li>
            <li> Love this, its very strong when on high and the cord is long.</li>
            <li> Good think alot of the other hotels had a dryer of their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then i switched it to 220v right away and packed it.</li>
            <li> I was pretty surprised that it was able to handle that abuse.</li>
            <li> I plugged it in to see how hot it will get - hot!</li>
            <li> This is a great little hair dryer, it works better than the larger one i have.  </li>
            <li> Great quality for a small hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty powerful for the size.</li>
            <li> It folds nicely and I like to take it with me when I go on long trips.</li>
            <li> PURE JUNK!</li>
            <li> Exactly the right size blow dryer I needed and wanted to take when I travel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good primary or secondary hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I wish that I was a bit smaller but overall, it is a great item.</li>
            <li> It drys quickly and doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li> It is very good, but haven&#x27;t had it very long, so I am reserving one star for the long haul.</li>
            <li> for the heat of the air coming out of the unit, the low was warm, while the high was very hot and effective in drying very wet hair.</li>
            <li> Good little hairdryer.</li>
            <li> For comparison, I plugged in my full size Bayliss Ceramix Xtreme hairdryer and turned it on high.</li>
            <li> Good dryer, works well, pretty lightweight, a little noisy</li>
            <li> The first one lasted about a month and just died without incident.  </li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Order the first one which lasted 7 months.  </li>
            <li> so it does not take up much space at all!</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Very lightweight and powerful.</li>
            <li> it folds up which is pretty neat.</li>
            <li> Cricket Pro 7144 Professional Friction Free Dual Voltage Travel Hair Dryer,… (1lb)</li>
            <li> Loud and kinda cheap feeling.</li>
            <li> perfect power for such a small hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It finally bit the dust after many years of service.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ll give this unit a recommendation because it has a smaller adapter than most.</li>
            <li> Plenty of hot air.</li>
            <li> VERY noisy!</li>
            <li> Its still pumping out hot air each time we use it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> from the first use you know it will die soon.</li>
            <li> It shorted out the lights on the first use, and it doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li> I was amazed that it was pretty powerful and not weak like the ones at gyms or at hotels.</li>
            <li> Perhaps some people would be happy with the size, but I was looking for something very small and packable in a backpack.</li>
            <li> The only con is that the head is a little longer (an inch or so) than those of the conair snub nose travel dryers but having the full size cord and the cool shot is most important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I try to do mine every time I run the vacuum in the bathroom which keeps it very clean.</li>
            <li> Although it is one of the more compact dryers and the smallest I could find with a reasonable rating, it is a bit bigger than the one</li>
            <li> Although a bit bigger than our former travel dryer, this unit operates well and have good air volume.</li>
            <li> Babyliss Bambino Nano Titanium Ulta Lightweight Hair Dryer, 1000 Watt (0.6lb) - soooo light, 1000Watt but quiet powerful, almost like an 1875&lt;br /&gt;5.  </li>
            <li> when I have it on high the heater had to take a break and blows cooler air (not cold- just cooler)</li>
            <li> Great if not using it every single day as it&#x27;s small and can be stored out of the way easily.</li>
            <li> The outlook is really cool, love the black.</li>
            <li> - loud high pitch sound 1600Watts&lt;</li>
            <li> but if I want it hot I have to run it on high and that is way too much &#x27;blow&#x27;!&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> The low is too low with luke warm air and the high will blow your head off and isn&#x27;t very hot.  </li>
            <li> I should have spent more money on a higher quality one</li>
            <li> and this certainly had it.  </li>
            <li> Was amazed how potent it is and how fast I could get my hair dry.</li>
            <li> but I have short and fine hair</li>
            <li> It worked fine on my European trip and in the US too.</li>
            <li> The length of the chord is good, it&#x27;s still high powered even though it&#x27;s small.</li>
            <li> Will not take up much room when traveling.</li>
            <li> I had gone to one hotel in Florence and was in a rush to get ready</li>
            <li> I still use it since I go on frequent mini get aways and it just wasn&#x27;t worth the return.</li>
            <li> This dryer works really well</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much quieter.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> really like this dryer and like using it.  </li>
            <li> I much prefer the Remington 5000 hairdryer which has three heat settings and three speeds.  </li>
            <li> It was really loud/noisy.</li>
            <li> with most items I purchase on Amazon, I checked the reviews of others carefully before purchase.  </li>
            <li> Thanks folks, and thanks, Amazon.</li>
            <li> In NY the HIGH kept turning off the power outlet!</li>
            <li> I wanted to pack light with only a carry on.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer didn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> So much for quality control.</li>
            <li> I brought this hair dryer to Europe with me and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> Very forceful - i really like it.</li>
            <li> Does not require much room when packing.  </li>
            <li> I have a professional hair dryer at home and this one seems just a powerful.</li>
            <li> Bought for wife and she really likes.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair really fast</li>
            <li> Arrived fast.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for home or travel!</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s shoulders have been causing too much pain to finish drying her hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got enough wattage to dry hair quckly and is comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This little guy is VERY strong.</li>
            <li> Way too much power on the high setting which made my hair knotty as I styled it.  </li>
            <li> It gets really noisy when turned to the high speed but that don&#x27;t seem to be bothering at all to me.</li>
            <li> Overall, good for occasional use, but wouldn&#x27;t recommend for daily use.</li>
            <li> I especially like the cool air option.  </li>
            <li> Based on this dryer&#x27;s good reviews, I thought it might be a similar, or even better, product; unfortunately, that was not the case at all.</li>
            <li> Yes, it blows very forcefully (perhaps too forcefully) on high, but the heat delivered on the high setting is not as high as I would like.  </li>
            <li> I love it and it folds in half</li>
            <li> I now use this for my regular hair dryer because it works better than my big one!</li>
            <li> But it is a decent hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Decent hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I will be using this as my regular dryer back in the states! :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a problem with the loudness of the noise, it was the pitch when I was using the high heat setting.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use it on high.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t turn it on high because it didn&#x27;t like that</li>
            <li> but the next setting down was more than adequate to dry my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> Note well, while it is a little bit larger than the one she liked so much, it is a bit stronger in terms of air velocity and heat output.  </li>
            <li> This little hair dryer is more powerful than my big one, which was a feature I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Dries much faster than his old one did</li>
            <li> It works just as good as my big one, if not better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful, small, light.  </li>
            <li> But beware, the high setting is VERY loud.</li>
            <li> I only dry my hair at the most 2 times a week</li>
            <li> And the high setting was so strong it starts to smell like something is burning and the back part lights up very orange due to the veryyyy high heat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t get a fifth star because it&#x27;s a little bigger than I would have liked.  </li>
            <li> two weeks ago it burnt out on me, so I came online and purchased from here to get a new one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong and dries my hair in less than 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> Love this little hair dryer!</li>
            <li> Great - High Powered - Travel Dryer - Small and compact - takes up little room in my suitcase</li>
            <li> Words very fast, and is very quiet for a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> very loud and have burning smell.</li>
            <li> The full size on high was the same level of loudness as the low on the Vidal Sassoon unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some dryers barely blow your hair but this fan really pushes the air through.</li>
            <li> I had one of these in the past and i am so glad Amazon had one.  </li>
            <li> This is our second Vidal Sassoon blow dryer, the first one lasted well over 5 years.</li>
            <li> Be aware that when using at 250 volts, you can only use the &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; setting.  </li>
            <li> I like it but the low speed never gets too hot.....</li>
            <li> At first I thought that would be a problem, but once I got used to it, it cut my drying time by a third.</li>
            <li> I was traveling abroad and needed dual hair drier strong enough to dry my course curly hair, and compact to carry.</li>
            <li> Reason for the 4 is that high air means high heat with no option for high air low heat</li>
            <li> Sure it&#x27;s not a full size drier, but its certainly not small enough in my book.</li>
            <li> I know the large plug is necessary, but I don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li> It came and had a wiring issue that caused it to fluctuate between low and high heat when on the high heat setting.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s portable and get my really long hair dry very quickly.</li>
            <li> This is much too heavy and too large for me to use it as a &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; dryer, as it would take up too much room in my suitcase.  </li>
            <li> Very powerful little dryer.</li>
            <li> Very powerful little hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It is loud</li>
            <li> I had to replace my old one</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem as gentle as my home dryer, but I don&#x27;t use this often enough to fry my hair.</li>
            <li> She says its lighter than her old one.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing anywhere near as compact as what she had been using.  </li>
            <li> Personally I like it because it does not hurt my hair that much.</li>
            <li> I took this blower to Italy and even using the LOW setting, as soon as I turned the blower on, it blew out and the whole unit was fried.</li>
            <li> Lastly, it is extremely loud.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really kinda big (in my opinion) for travel.</li>
            <li> product arrived early.</li>
            <li> It has as much, if not more, power than the full size dryers.</li>
            <li> I concluded that it is worth replacing this relatively inexpensive item every year because it is so much easier to use than any other dryer I have owned.</li>
            <li> My wife had a fabulous (and very small, very compact) hair drier.  </li>
            <li> It is, in fact, too large and heavy for me to be willing to use it at home.  </li>
            <li> Since the folding handle was where my previous model broke, I&#x27;m playing it safe and leaving it open for daily use.  </li>
            <li> There are two settings low and high.  </li>
            <li> but I found that LOW was too low, and HIGH too high.  </li>
            <li> The low setting basically works as if it were a high setting.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for, light, small and compact</li>
            <li> Huge - not sure why they call it &amp;#34;travel.&amp;#34;  Fairly light weight, but not at all small.  </li>
            <li> small and light ...perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> Ours had been in daily use for a couple of months now and shows no negative signs of wear.</li>
            <li> Very powerful for a small hairdryer</li>
            <li> In the past, I had a babyliss travel hair dryer that worked well and was very powerful.</li>
            <li> but it really doesn&#x27;t make it much smaller especially with the cord and the ground</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the other review is talking about because you get exactly what is pictured.  </li>
            <li> Conair 1875 Watt Folding Handle Compact Hair Dryer (1lb) - feels heavier than other 1lb dryers even if exact weight</li>
            <li> It also has a little screw that can easily be set with a screwdriver to accomodate the European 250 voltage, as well as American 125 voltage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to pack or stores easily at home.  </li>
            <li> Works way faster than the bigger, professional grade one my friend gave me just after I bought it.</li>
            <li> By the fourth time, the dryer stopped working completely.</li>
            <li> I liked this dryer when we first received, but after using for only 2 weeks it would only blow cold air.</li>
            <li> Kind of scary looks like its going to blow up...</li>
            <li> It has survived multiple international baggage handlers and still functions like new.</li>
            <li> I use it at home but will need a smaller less powerful dryer for travel.</li>
            <li> However, the Sassoon 1875w Stylist Traveler is at the extreme opposite end of the spectrum for sound: it must be at least 110 decibels of screaming, whining, buzzing NOISE, right up next to one&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> Small enough to fit in any bag but big on power.</li>
            <li> this little dryer was, much faster than her semi professional dryer at home.</li>
            <li> It has three settings: hot, cold, and off, and a button to press that essentially collapses the top, and a cord to wrap around.</li>
            <li> DO NOT DRY YOUR RABBIT WITH THIS DEATH MACHINE</li>
            <li> small and convenient, powerful and lite would order again.</li>
            <li> While traveling in Europe my wife was commenting how unbelievable powerful</li>
            <li> I love that it folds down and is small enough to carry around.</li>
            <li> I have super thick, long hair that takes forever to dry but on the lowest setting you can really feel this dryer work.</li>
            <li> This is one terrific and powerful little travel dryer!  </li>
            <li> It folds right away and takes up very little space.</li>
            <li> and I suspect uses less energy than the hair dryers from the past - at least the lights dont dim when it is in operation - always a good sign.  </li>
            <li> It does the exact same job as a heavy hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> On the 250V setting the \\&quot;High\\&quot; position of the switch is mechanically blocked which means that the fan does have only one position if set to 250V (&#x3D; always on \\&quot;High\\&quot; due to the voltage or respectively the \\&quot;Low\\&quot; setting performs the high output).</li>
            <li> So nothing is broken, everything is fine</li>
            <li> and it gets my hair dry just as fast as any other.</li>
            <li> It blows not super hard but has good power for a small dryer.  </li>
            <li> , when you notice there is dust/lint on the screen at the back, take the nozzle of your vacuum and suck that off.</li>
            <li> So powerful for such a small machine!</li>
            <li> While I think this is too big and heavy for travel (at least for a guy without much hair) it performs very well</li>
            <li> Small and works very well.</li>
            <li> Not horribly loud, but not quiet.</li>
            <li> hint to make it last a very long time</li>
            <li> It does dry my hair quicker than my larger hair dryer though!</li>
            <li> so this is not very much usage no matter the low price!</li>
            <li> It lasts a very long time with constant use (4 long haired women and 2 long haired dogs!).</li>
            <li> Product as described, bigger than expected, but foldable, still a travel size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Stylist for a long time.</li>
            <li> Bigger than expected so had to return.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not on that long anyway.  </li>
            <li> The on/off button failed in my original</li>
            <li> Comparing this to other travel dryers… was going to use for travel with 220v where typically only &amp;#34;low heat&amp;#34; can be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I have long brown hair!)</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these for my boss a year ago with several other brands.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of very long, hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> It gets my hair dry in minutes.  </li>
            <li> In no time, my hair is dry and styled.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long the motor will last, as occasionally</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely loud, but I&#x27;ve tried some of the &amp;#34;quiet&amp;#34; dryers in the past, and they just don&#x27;t do the hair-drying job as well as the Vidal Sassoon Stylist Travel Dryer.  </li>
            <li> I always buy an extra whenever I get down to one</li>
            <li> The second one blew black smoke out of the handle while it was running.</li>
            <li> I was expecting that this is really small, but almost the same size that the one I use at home which is regular size dryer...</li>
            <li> Solid little travel dryer.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve always wanted a hairdryer that has a folding handle - this is just what i expected.</li>
            <li> I bought it for a trip to Destin, FL, but I now use it everyday since my big dryer went belly up.  </li>
            <li> Did not work as expected.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Works and all, but not very &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I had to toss it and spent my month abroad drying my hair with a fan.</li>
            <li> It is not nearly as powerful as it needs to be, which makes the drying time very, very long.</li>
            <li> using it now as back up for other travels and everyday use.</li>
            <li> We took it on vacation and other trips and wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> it folds up and has a foreign adaptor.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know why other manufacturers have begun shorting their cord lengths</li>
            <li> The wind is warn, not hot.</li>
            <li> Small, portable, and like other reviewers have stated, this was actually stronger than my full-sized hair dryer at home!  </li>
            <li> Not much to say!</li>
            <li> My travel hair dryer out performs any other I have used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep it for an emergency (Like of my other blow dryer breaks)</li>
            <li> This looked small, but was the same size as the one I already have for home use.</li>
            <li> If you want a fairly small yet quiet hair dryer, keep looking, this one is NOT it.</li>
            <li> Having long hair, it dried almost in no time.</li>
            <li> I was afraid a smaller blow dryer wouldn&#x27;t have the power my large one does.</li>
            <li> It is hard to fold; you have to jiggle it and give it a big push in order to get it to fold.  </li>
            <li> Not worth returning for what it cost, but would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> If you have long and thick hair, it might take a little while to thoroughly dry it</li>
            <li> Folded down compactly for suitcase packing.  </li>
            <li> Used them occasionally (average about once every two days or less)</li>
            <li> I thought my hair was dry and spent a small fortune on creams and conditioners!</li>
            <li> Compact and powerful, hasn&#x27;t failed on me yet!</li>
            <li> I have returned two travel dryers (one Conair and one Revlon) already because the cord lengths were less than 5 feet.</li>
            <li> Stylist Travel Dryer, Black (1lb) -</li>
            <li> The handle folds in half</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had this less than a year</li>
            <li> I used it less than 10 times.</li>
            <li> tall I am in need of a cord that is at least 67-68in long</li>
            <li> Not much to say, its a small, compact and inexpensive hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I have really long and thick hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little misleading to call it a Travel Dryer as it&#x27;s not really all that small.  </li>
            <li> I had the hardest time turning that damn little knob.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too noisy for the Salon.</li>
            <li> A lot of power for a little dryer.  </li>
            <li> But I will be a little bit noisy when you select &amp;#34;high&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the little things.  </li>
            <li> This little thing amazed my.</li>
            <li> wadded up and stuck inside the body of the hair dryer that was a little burnt from my one use.</li>
            <li> It has a cold setting that she really wanted.</li>
            <li> but I have a few of these because they get the job done</li>
            <li> I dried my hair every day while on vacation</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> everyday use at home.</li>
            <li> My previous travel drier (from sharper image) was truly quite small</li>
            <li> My wife had ruined a few dryers in the past because she used them on 220V without switching the volt setting on the dryer.</li>
            <li> And no kidding I don&#x27;t even need a conditioner since I started using this little powerhouse!</li>
            <li> This little dryer packs a punch!</li>
            <li> which is just what I wanted for my small 1/2 bathroom.</li>
            <li> It folds up small for storage and travel.</li>
            <li> I needed this for a trip to the Caribbean, so small was a must.</li>
            <li> For a small thing, it packs a lot of power.</li>
            <li> A small, efficient dryer without all the bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> it takes all the abuse you can give and is small and compact, too.  </li>
            <li> Not quite as small and compact as I thought it would be</li>
            <li> Small and convenient.</li>
            <li> It appears that they don&#x27;t make a really small travel dryer now.  </li>
            <li> I was embarrased to say the least.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer 5 months ago and it no longer works, it only blows cold air.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> note that these always seem to come with that VERY irritating adapter (there is absolutely no reason for that in my opinion).  </li>
            <li> A lot of power for a small hair dryer!  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed that it was like a regular size dryer.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the switch broke after 6 month of use (cold setting does not work any longer, probably a minor mechanical issue but still</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t even have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> its small, and has power woohoo!!</li>
            <li> I suppose that will be a bad thing when I&#x27;m using it to remove stickers from stuff, but for drying my hair and other body parts, it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It needs minus 10 stars!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was SSOO wrong.</li>
            <li> Turned out, she was operating it with the wrong 220V setting.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong with Vidal Sassoon</li>
            <li> Sadly, that model is discontinued.  </li>
            <li> scary and was without one because of it .</li>
            <li> I found a ball of paper with really weird cutouts/markings (so I know it&#x27;s not mine)</li>
            <li> you will never go wrong with this item.</li>
            <li> Cold air works well.  </li>
            <li> Cold air works on both voltages by the way (separate switch).</li>
            <li> I will be so sad if this model every gets discontinued!</li>
            <li> The option to switch the voltage between what works in Europe/what works in the U.S. was difficult to find on the hair dryer, but trust me, you will find it!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing, I will either return it or donate it.  </li>
            <li> Ridiculous!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a worthless hairdryer!</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst hair dryers I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This was a terrible product.</li>

            <li> DO NOT DRY YOUR RABBIT WITH THIS DEATH MACHINE YOUR RABBIT WILL DIE!</li>
            <li> Light, compact and powerful-worked great!</li>
            <li> Bought two of these.  Used them occasionally (average about once every two days or less) The first one lasted about a month and just died without incident.  The second one blew black smoke out of the handle while it was running. PURE JUNK!</li>
            <li> GREAT and POWERFUL for a little hair dryer...which is just what I wanted for my small 1/2 bathroom. Will not take up much room when traveling. If you have long and thick hair, it might take a little while to thoroughly dry it but I have short and fine hair so it&#x27;s perfect for me. It&#x27;s a good primary or secondary hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer. Some dryers barely blow your hair but this fan really pushes the air through. It is loud but I have a few of these because they get the job done FAST!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One hint to make it last a very long time, when you notice there is dust/lint on the screen at the back, take the nozzle of your vacuum and suck that off. It helps keep the dryer from overheating and will prolong the life of your dryer. I try to do mine every time I run the vacuum in the bathroom which keeps it very clean.</li>
            <li> Small, but minimal power so if you have a full head of hair this might be a problem.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my trip to Europe because it folds up and is easy to travel with. I didn&#x27;t realize how great it would be for dry time! I now use this for my regular hair dryer because it works better than my big one! I give this a 5 out of 5 for its size and power! Great product!</li>
            <li> So the blow dryer itself works well.  It blows not super hard but has good power for a small dryer.  Decent size and easily portable....BUT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had purchased this specifically to take with me to europe since I know you could suposidly easily adjust the wattage.  Ummm, yeah, I had the hardest time turning that damn little knob.  I would have had to get a screw driver to possibly turn it.  I had gone to one hotel in Florence and was in a rush to get ready so I just ended up using a seprate converter thinking it would be ok even though I couldn&#x27;t turn the knob.  The power went out on our floor!  I was embarrased to say the least.  And yes I know you have to use a different wattage and I used a back up.  If the knob was user friendly I would have used the dryer more often on my 12 day stay but I didn&#x27;t.  Good think alot of the other hotels had a dryer of their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I am back in the states I still use it since I go on frequent mini get aways and it just wasn&#x27;t worth the return.</li>
            <li> Great!  Compact and lighter than other travel hair dryers.</li>
            <li> Good for a travel hair dryer!</li>
            <li> Very powerful for a small hairdryer</li>
            <li> Nice size, easily storable, good power.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting, but this hairdryer wasn&#x27;t much smaller than my regular one.  Returned.</li>
            <li> Works way faster than the bigger, professional grade one my friend gave me just after I bought it.</li>
            <li> Great power!  It DOES fold, for easier packing.</li>
            <li> Great - High Powered - Travel Dryer - Small and compact - takes up little room in my suitcase</li>
            <li> Good product..light weight, powerful, easy to use</li>
            <li> Perfect travel size hair dryer that does an amazing job drying and styling hair. I would absolutely recommend it! I&#x27;ve owned a Vidal Sassoon hair dryer before and loved it. Extremely happy that this hair dryer lived up to those standards.</li>
            <li> Product as described, bigger than expected, but foldable, still a travel size. Cold air works well.  I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> I thought my hair was dry and spent a small fortune on creams and conditioners! Who knew all I needed to do was replace my hair dryer! And no kidding I don&#x27;t even need a conditioner since I started using this little powerhouse! Love it!!</li>
            <li> Order the first one which lasted 7 months.  Amazon replaced it and it has lasted only 1 month.  I&#x27;m giving up this one.  Time to move on.</li>
            <li> This dryer works really well and the cost was Great! I had to replace my old one and this really fit the bill!</li>
            <li> I will continuing buying this item in multiples. It lasts a very long time with constant use (4 long haired women and 2 long haired dogs!). I keep a spare in case it goes out (which happens about every 2 years). It has as much, if not more, power than the full size dryers. It folds up small for storage and travel. Over the years, the model numbers have changed, but the basic dryer has remained the same. I will be so sad if this model every gets discontinued!</li>
            <li> I have owned this before, lasts for years.  Small, lightweight with good drying power!  I have a lot of very long, hair.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a hair dryer with more power and this certainly had it.  There are two settings low and high.  The low is too low with luke warm air and the high will blow your head off and isn&#x27;t very hot.  Way too much power on the high setting which made my hair knotty as I styled it.  Sent it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband - he thinks it&#x27;s great.  Dries much faster than his old one did and it&#x27;s much quieter.</li>
            <li> Bought this for use at the gym at work. Not horribly loud, but not quiet. Doesn&#x27;t seem as gentle as my home dryer, but I don&#x27;t use this often enough to fry my hair. Overall, good for occasional use, but wouldn&#x27;t recommend for daily use.</li>
            <li> I know, I know. It&#x27;s a hair dryer. I don&#x27;t have a problem with the loudness of the noise, it was the pitch when I was using the high heat setting. The pitch caused ringing in my ears. For comparison, I plugged in my full size Bayliss Ceramix Xtreme hairdryer and turned it on high. The full size on high was the same level of loudness as the low on the Vidal Sassoon unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the heat of the air coming out of the unit, the low was warm, while the high was very hot and effective in drying very wet hair. The unit itself felt pretty good in the hand and felt sturdy and not at all cheap. The folding handle is a nice feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this would have been a keeper had it not caused ringing in my ears.</li>
            <li> Compact and powerful, hasn&#x27;t failed on me yet!</li>
            <li> Bought a Conair 1875 hairdryer but it doesn&#x27;t even come close to the output and force of the Vidal Sassoon. I have very long hair and this is the only hairdryer that dries my hair in a record short amount of time.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve always wanted a hairdryer that has a folding handle - this is just what i expected. it&#x27;s portable and get my really long hair dry very quickly. It gets really noisy when turned to the high speed but that don&#x27;t seem to be bothering at all to me. would definitely recommend it!!</li>
            <li> My son loves the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I take hair drier this to go to the pool. Small and works very well. It&#x27;s strong and dries my hair in less than 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> Burst into flames second use.</li>
            <li> I needed this for a trip to the Caribbean, so small was a must. I was afraid a smaller blow dryer wouldn&#x27;t have the power my large one does. I was SSOO wrong. This lil dryer packs a punch! It&#x27;s great I love it and it folds in half so it does not take up much space at all! Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer 5 months ago and it no longer works, it only blows cold air.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for, light, small and compact</li>
            <li> This is a handy little dryer that&#x27;s great for travel. It&#x27;s got enough wattage to dry hair quckly and is comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the deal is here, but this is NOT burning hot like almost all of the hair dryers I&#x27;ve ever owned. I suppose that will be a bad thing when I&#x27;m using it to remove stickers from stuff, but for drying my hair and other body parts, it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make up for the temperature being warm, rather than hot, this baby will blow you out of the room! I&#x27;m sure that is probably better on your hair in the long run, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two fan speeds, a folding button, and a dual voltage screw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s hope it last longer than the Conair 1875 Watt Folding Handle Compact Hair Dryer I bought that made it only 2 1/2 years.</li>
            <li> My Husband and I both use it- It is powerful and light weight and drys your hair very quickly. We took it on vacation and other trips and wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> It works great and is a good size. I wish that I was a bit smaller but overall, it is a great item.</li>
            <li> This is the lightest dryer I have ever owned, and I loved it.  It was out of warranty about two months when the motor quit, but I am replacing it.  I concluded that it is worth replacing this relatively inexpensive item every year because it is so much easier to use than any other dryer I have owned.</li>
            <li> I have had this hair dryer for over 4 years and two weeks ago it burnt out on me, so I came online and purchased from here to get a new one.  I don&#x27;t know what the other review is talking about because you get exactly what is pictured.  I love this hair dryer though.  It is the strongest, most powerful one I&#x27;ve ever used and yet it&#x27;s so tiny! It gets my hair dry in minutes.  I even took it to Europe (it has the dual voltage) and it worked perfect over there too.  It folds up and is so great for traveling.  I recommend this to all my friends and they all love it too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hairdryer because I needed it to be compact - which it is.  I know the large plug is necessary, but I don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li> Perfect, collapsable!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is a good size and not too noisy;  it folds to a good size for a 25 inch suitcase.</li>
            <li> The quality is excellent.  It is quiet, has a good temperature range and the perfect amount of air to style my hair.  Zero complaints on the operational side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t get a fifth star because it&#x27;s a little bigger than I would have liked.  Although it is one of the more compact dryers and the smallest I could find with a reasonable rating, it is a bit bigger than the one it replaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this dryer and like using it.  I just wish it were a bit smaller.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer. I use the cool button every time.</li>
            <li> Good size, not too hot, basic dryer. Great if not using it every single day as it&#x27;s small and can be stored out of the way easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little misleading to call it a Travel Dryer as it&#x27;s not really all that small.  But it is a decent hair dryer.  Like that it folds up and has a foreign adaptor.</li>
            <li> Light weight, dual voltage very powerful and a handy. Great value for money does the job and then some.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an identical one I have had for several years.  The on/off button failed in my original so I looked for something to replace it...Was so glad to be able to get another just like the one I had...It&#x27;s a nice, small size yet very effective at drying hair quickly.  Folds for travel.  Highly recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> Although a bit bigger than our former travel dryer, this unit operates well and have good air volume. If any criticism, it would be that the air temp is at best warm, not hot as are our other 1875W dryers.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this model for years and love it.  I always buy an extra whenever I get down to one so I have an extra on hand, or for company to use.  It&#x27;s lightweight but has great power.  It&#x27;s small enough to pack or stores easily at home.  I recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> This light weight hair dryer is the best.  It does the exact same job as a heavy hair dryer.  When it dies whenever I will buy another one.</li>
            <li> Great price and I was able to use it in the UK. It is quite powerful and served the purpose it was bought for</li>
            <li> This is a lot of hair dryer for the money.  I would have liked it to me a little more compact but it drys hair great.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a trip overseas and ended up not using it there. Instead, I have put it in my camper&#x27;s bathroom where everyone can use it rather than bring their own. I&#x27;ve received many compliments on it - it is very powerful and dries your hair quickly. It folds right away and takes up very little space. Sweet!</li>
            <li> This is a great little hair dryer, it works better than the larger one i have.  It gives me fast drying that i want from a good hair dryer.  I had one of these in the past and i am so glad Amazon had one.  Thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I have returned two travel dryers (one Conair and one Revlon) already because the cord lengths were less than 5 feet. At 5ft. 10in. tall I am in need of a cord that is at least 67-68in long so if I need to plug into a wall socket I don&#x27;t have to crouch for the dryer to reach the top of my head. At 68 inches, this is it. Additionally, the handle folds in and it has a cool shot. Also the force of air is very strong. The only con is that the head is a little longer (an inch or so) than those of the conair snub nose travel dryers but having the full size cord and the cool shot is most important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why other manufacturers have begun shorting their cord lengths but this VS travel dryer suits my needs perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I think Amazon in their specification should indicate the cord length on hair dryers.</li>
            <li> I plugged it in to see how hot it will get - hot! Then i switched it to 220v right away and packed it. Also ordered plug in adapters.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted.  Delivered on time and works great.  Love that I can fold it and put in my vanity draw.  Very lightweight and powerful.</li>
            <li> She is happy.  A happy wife equals a happy life.  She says its lighter than her old one.  it folds up which is pretty neat.</li>
            <li> I bought it because of all the favorable reviews...a mistake.  Yes, it blows very forcefully (perhaps too forcefully) on high, but the heat delivered on the high setting is not as high as I would like.  I much prefer the Remington 5000 hairdryer which has three heat settings and three speeds.  The Remington is also compact, but does not fold.  The best price on the Remington was direct from Remington&#x27;s website (significantly lower price than Amazon).</li>
            <li> I bought it for a trip to Destin, FL, but I now use it everyday since my big dryer went belly up.  It works just as good as my big one, if not better.  For a small thing, it packs a lot of power.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works great. It has good heat, and the fan settings are just what you want. I also like the folding handle, as it makes it easier to store.</li>
            <li> Bought this for traveling but might use it at home too. Worked great for my first trip. Very powerful little dryer.</li>
            <li> Great power for a little hair dryer. No complaints. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Comparing this to other travel dryers… was going to use for travel with 220v where typically only &amp;#34;low heat&amp;#34; can be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ended up returning - found something that&#x27;s lighter and just feels almost as powerful… went for Babyliss Nano Titanium&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;foldable&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;1lb (babyliss nano titanium at 0.6lb)&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;1lb but feels lighter to hold compared to ConAir&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;powerful heat&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;good low hum (not low noise, but lower than most)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;1lb (found 0.6lb - babyliss nano titanium)&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;bigger than babyliss&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the products tested… ended up keeping Babyliss.  See specific Pros/Cons with each review but here&#x27;s the highlight:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Cricket Pro 7144 Professional Friction Free Dual Voltage Travel Hair Dryer,… (1lb) - loud high pitch sound 1600Watts&lt;br /&gt;2.  Vidal Sassoon Vsdr5523 1875w Stylist Travel Dryer, Black (1lb) - great but found Babyliss much lighter&lt;br /&gt;3.  Conair 1875 Watt Folding Handle Compact Hair Dryer (1lb) - feels heavier than other 1lb dryers even if exact weight&lt;br /&gt;4.  Babyliss Bambino Nano Titanium Ulta Lightweight Hair Dryer, 1000 Watt (0.6lb) - soooo light, 1000Watt but quiet powerful, almost like an 1875&lt;br /&gt;5.  Revlon Perfect Heat 1875W Fast Dry Compact Dryer (0.8lbs) - looks elegant, powerful, but fingers could easily slip fancy roundish low/off/high switch&lt;br /&gt;6.  Vidal Sasson VS784 1875W Travel Dryer (0.8lbs) - good, looks like Revlon but better grip on switch to low/high/off&lt;br /&gt;7.  Andis Micro Turbo 1600 Watt Dual Voltage Hair Dryer - White (33805) (0.8lbs) - good airflow but 1600w and looks a bit like standard hotel dryers</li>
            <li> Returned unit.  It was really loud/noisy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great hair dryer for travel or home. I have really long and thick hair and it gets my hair dry just as fast as any other.</li>
            <li> This dryer is a workhorse!  I purchased it as a replacement for the same model that I have had for about 8 years.  It gets the job done and folds up for travel.</li>
            <li> It is very good, but haven&#x27;t had it very long, so I am reserving one star for the long haul.</li>
            <li> Loud and kinda cheap feeling. I wish there was a diffuser with it. I should have spent more money on a higher quality one</li>
            <li> Great for traveling and even for use at home - good airflow and heat for wife&#x27;s hair.  Getting daily use out of it.</li>
            <li> perfect power for such a small hair dryer. awesome for dorm rooms</li>
            <li> My wife had a fabulous (and very small, very compact) hair drier.  It finally bit the dust after many years of service.  So we went looking.  She looked in all the local stores and I searched the web extensively.  The model she had is no longer available.  There is nothing anywhere near as compact as what she had been using.  This was the closest we could find.  Note well, while it is a little bit larger than the one she liked so much, it is a bit stronger in terms of air velocity and heat output.  However, since the key feature she liked was the compact size, I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also note that these always seem to come with that VERY irritating adapter (there is absolutely no reason for that in my opinion).  However, I&#x27;ll give this unit a recommendation because it has a smaller adapter than most.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great power and great for traveling! Folds up nicely in your travel bag and light weight. Great price too!</li>
            <li> perfect for travel. Does the job!</li>
            <li> Great for travel!  Taking my Vidal Sassoon to Italy this week.  Great quality for a small hair dryer.  I will purchase another one for my younger sister to take to college.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Stylist for a long time. This is the dryer I use at home. I have thick hair. It drys quickly and doesn&#x27;t take up much space. It&#x27;s a little too noisy for the Salon. Great for travel too!</li>
            <li> size &amp; weight very good but could use a high COOL setting.  that would make it perfect</li>
            <li> My last blow dryer like this lasted over five years.  When It finally died in a puff of smoke I went online and ordered two more just like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blow dryer is light weight, it is powerful and it lasts.  Definitely worth the price!!</li>
            <li> great little dryer, love it</li>
            <li> Huge - not sure why they call it &amp;#34;travel.&amp;#34;  Fairly light weight, but not at all small.  The handle folds in half but it really doesn&#x27;t make it much smaller especially with the cord and the ground fault protection plug.  My home hairdryer is smaller than this one.</li>
            <li> Price is fair enough.The wind is warn, not hot. Personally I like it because it does not hurt my hair that much.</li>
            <li> A lot of power for a little dryer.  We bought it to use in Chile, and it surprisingly dries as well as my full sized dryer.</li>
            <li> Liked the fact that it could be used either in US or Europe without a converter. Did need an adapter in Europe but those are so cheap.</li>
            <li> The outlook is really cool, love the black. But I will be a little bit noisy when you select &amp;#34;high&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on August 12, 2014.  It stopped blowing hot air at the appropriate rate on 9/22/14.</li>
            <li> The sound of the hair dryer is higher than that of the others that I ever used. But it is still a good item.</li>
            <li> Words very fast, and is very quiet for a blow dryer. This is our second Vidal Sassoon blow dryer, the first one lasted well over 5 years.</li>
            <li> works perfectly.  good price.</li>
            <li> Small, portable, and like other reviewers have stated, this was actually stronger than my full-sized hair dryer at home!  I dried my hair every day while on vacation and it took less time than I&#x27;m accustomed to, and my hair looked great.  Perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li> small and convenient, powerful and lite would order again. My wife loves the quick drying capabilities and the ease of handling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful, small, light.  Best of all, inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with most items I purchase on Amazon, I checked the reviews of others carefully before purchase.  Thanks folks, and thanks, Amazon.</li>
            <li> I had one of these travel hair dryers before - bought about 10 years ago.  The new one was good in that it folds easily but I found that LOW was too low, and HIGH too high.  In NY the HIGH kept turning off the power outlet!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hair dryer. Not much to say! The service was great. It came on time and performed as it was advertised.</li>
            <li> Did not bring the top side !</li>
            <li> Larger than I had hoped.</li>
            <li> A small, efficient dryer without all the bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> I was traveling abroad and needed dual hair drier strong enough to dry my course curly hair, and compact to carry. This was the best drier to satisfy my needs. A great buy.</li>
            <li> Exactly the right size blow dryer I needed and wanted to take when I travel.</li>
            <li> Love the dual voltage which lets me fold and pack with me on all my trips overseas.  Not too noisy and love the cool setting to set the style.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a travel dryer and it was heavier than the one I already had.  I planned to send it back but they said to keep it so I will enjoy it at home.  It works well.</li>
            <li> My travel hair dryer out performs any other I have used.  I especially like the cool air option.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This worked great for my trip to Europe. I wanted to pack light with only a carry on. This hair dryer didn&#x27;t take up much space. It is not the best hair dryer but for a couple of days it was fine. The size was more important for the trip than the functionality.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer for the price.  Purchased for use on recent try to Italy.  Folded down compactly for suitcase packing.  dual voltage selector for US or Europe use.</li>
            <li> Love this little hair dryer! I used it when we traveled to the UK and Italy, and it worked no problem! It is compact but powerful (I have long brown hair!) All you need is the plug adapter to change the plug and you are good to go in any country!</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these for my boss a year ago with several other brands. He liked this brand the best and had me order him more.</li>
            <li> I am 100% sure it is second-handed. Although the dryer functions well, I found scratches on the surface and the screws are worn out.</li>
            <li> Light weight and great power! Just what I hoed for!</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer for traveling.  My need was a for dual voltage, lightweight, dryer to take on an international trip.  This worked great - with an adapter (power converter not needed).  Be aware that when using at 250 volts, you can only use the &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; setting.  Also note that you need a screwdriver, or something similar, to change the voltage setting - and plan accordingly.</li>
            <li> Nice powerful compact- perfect</li>
            <li> Compact - just wished I could have found one even smaller.  It worked fine on my European trip and in the US too.</li>
            <li> This little hair dryer is more powerful than my big one, which was a feature I was looking for.I have always bought Vidal Sassoon hair dryers but can&#x27;t find them in the stores anymore. The folding handle makes it an added feature which is great for traveling. I have had the best luck with Vidal Sassoon and would buy this again.</li>
            <li> handy, light and works well.</li>
            <li> Plenty of hot air. Very inexpensive. Easily fits in a 3.5 inch depth drawer. Bought a warehouse opened box -- no problems. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Small enough to fit in any bag but big on power. Love it.</li>
            <li> Decent hair dryer. I wanted one that folded as well as had a cool shot button, both of which this does, and came at a great price. I&#x27;m not sure how long the motor will last, as occasionally when I have it on high the heater had to take a break and blows cooler air (not cold- just cooler) and I don&#x27;t even have very thick hair. Still worth the price I think.</li>
            <li> This dryer is HUGE!  I read the specifications before I purchased it, but the dimensions must be listed for the dryer when the handle is folded.  This is much too heavy and too large for me to use it as a &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; dryer, as it would take up too much room in my suitcase.  It is, in fact, too large and heavy for me to be willing to use it at home.  I will be returning it and purchasing something smaller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the little things.  I bought one of these over 10 years ago to take to the gym.  I recently cracked the plug and the wires were exposed and the dryer had been threatening to short out.  This is a beast - it takes all the abuse you can give and is small and compact, too.  I was so happy to see that they were still made, I purchased it immediately.  Arrived 2 days later and I&#x27;m happy to say the thing works exactly like the old one.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use it on high. It breaks it. Great for traveling otherwise.</li>
            <li> Great little powerful dryer that we bought for traveling.</li>
            <li> took to Europe....worked fine. small and light ...perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> This little dryer is really incredible. It outranks all the others in performance and power. I am so happy to have it.</li>
            <li> good trave hair dryer</li>
            <li> Never even plugged it in - so can&#x27;t tell you how it performs because it&#x27;s going back. It&#x27;s way too big for a travel hairdryer. I was expecting something compact - this thing will take up way more room in my suitcase then I was expecting it to. I needed up getting the Conair 1600 watt Compact dryer instead - super compact and works great. I wish I could post a picture showing the difference in sizes. If your suitcase is tight on space - this might not be the best solution since there are more compact ones on the market.</li>
            <li> This little dryer packs a punch! I have super thick, long hair that takes forever to dry but on the lowest setting you can really feel this dryer work. It is usable overseas but I haven&#x27;t tested that yet. It folds nicely and I like to take it with me when I go on long trips. Fits nicely in my luggage and doesn&#x27;t take up much space. I did my research before buying a portable dryer and I think this one is one of the nicer, more affordable ones.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time. I took this blower to Italy and even using the LOW setting, as soon as I turned the blower on, it blew out and the whole unit was fried. So much for quality control.</li>
            <li> Light, compact, and very powerful</li>
            <li> The dryer works well but I wanted a shorter barrel and the picture looked like it was.  I was disappointed that it was like a regular size dryer.</li>
            <li> VERY noisy! I&#x27;ll keep it for an emergency (Like of my other blow dryer breaks) but otherwise, probably won&#x27;t use it. Not worth returning for what it cost, but would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This little thing amazed my. My wife had ruined a few dryers in the past because she used them on 220V without switching the volt setting on the dryer. While traveling in Europe my wife was commenting how unbelievable powerful this little dryer was, much faster than her semi professional dryer at home. Turned out, she was operating it with the wrong 220V setting. I was pretty surprised that it was able to handle that abuse. After setting it to 220V it still functioned well. Great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> Did not work as expected.</li>
            <li> Works perfect for my thin hair.  Very power and comfortable fit in tl my arthritic hands.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. The size is nice and compact, it packs a lot of drying power.</li>
            <li> I needed a true travel-sized hair dryer. This was just a bit larger than I would have liked. Perhaps some people would be happy with the size, but I was looking for something very small and packable in a backpack.</li>
            <li> Very powerful little hair dryer. Perfect for traveling and everyday use.</li>
            <li> Works with dual voltage which was needed for our international adventure. Ours had been in daily use for a couple of months now and shows no negative signs of wear. Its still pumping out hot air each time we use it. It has survived multiple international baggage handlers and still functions like new.</li>
            <li> Great product. It is perfect for traveling since it&#x27;s small in size and the handle folds in. The length of the chord is good, it&#x27;s still high powered even though it&#x27;s small. On time shipping. I would definitely reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> I received the blowdryer and it was just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> had to get this LIGHT WEIGHT ...much better</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had this less than a year and it no longer works. We had a similar model before t that lasted 10 years! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It died on me after six months.</li>
            <li> Bigger than expected so had to return. Needed it for my gym bag.</li>
            <li> Like it, but larger that I thought</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected. This product worked perfect and worth the money.</li>
            <li> I brought this hair dryer to Europe with me and it worked very well. The option to switch the voltage between what works in Europe/what works in the U.S. was difficult to find on the hair dryer, but trust me, you will find it! Please have a screwdriver handy to change the voltage.</li>
            <li> So goo I order another!</li>
            <li> I like it but the low speed never gets too hot.....maybe good for some but if I want it hot I have to run it on high and that is way too much &#x27;blow&#x27;!&lt;br /&gt;Good hair dryer and YES......I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> A lot of power for a small hair dryer!  Not quite as small and compact as I thought it would be but still good for travelling.  It does dry my hair quicker than my larger hair dryer though!</li>
            <li> This is a worthless hairdryer! I bought one end of july and it lasted just 29days so they replaced it and now this one has lasted not even 3 months! It is garbage! I only dry my hair at the most 2 times a week so this is not very much usage no matter the low price! Ridiculous!!!! It needs minus 10 stars!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Gets the job done. Use as hair-dryer or setting nail polish. Run hot or cool.</li>
            <li> good dryer. can&#x27;t go wrong with Vidal Sassoon</li>
            <li> Fairly light-weight, and a bit more drying power than most travel blow dryers. At first I thought that would be a problem, but once I got used to it, it cut my drying time by a third. That&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call this a &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; dryer... there are smaller ones out there.  Bigger than what I was looking to replace.</li>
            <li> Good operation and value.  I am pleased with the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I returned it, the noise is unbearable.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer. Cheap and efficient. It is the one I always buy.</li>
            <li> Very forceful - i really like it.</li>
            <li> I returned it. I was expecting that this is really small, but almost the same size that the one I use at home which is regular size dryer...</li>
            <li> Great size and powerful!  Does not require much room when packing.  Easy to handle  and lightweight!  Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> It will not turn on. I&#x27;ve tried it in 4 different electrical outlets and it does not work.</li>
            <li> Works Great! Perfect size!</li>
            <li> Bought it since we travel to Europa a lot. Good hairdryer. Unfortunately the switch broke after 6 month of use (cold setting does not work any longer, probably a minor mechanical issue but still annoying).&lt;br /&gt;Correction on 01/25/2015: I want to correct my initial review: The switch did NOT break! I took the hair dryer apart today and noticed that everything works fine. On the 250V setting the \\&quot;High\\&quot; position of the switch is mechanically blocked which means that the fan does have only one position if set to 250V (&#x3D; always on \\&quot;High\\&quot; due to the voltage or respectively the \\&quot;Low\\&quot; setting performs the high output). In the the 125V position the hair dryer works on both, \\&quot;Low\\&quot; and \\&quot;High\\&quot;. So nothing is broken, everything is fine but it was just nowhere described how they resolved the voltage settings. Cold air works on both voltages by the way (separate switch).</li>
            <li> Small and convenient. But beware, the high setting is VERY loud.</li>
            <li> I ordered this dryer sight unseen after reading several reviews on Amazon. Was amazed how potent it is and how fast I could get my hair dry.</li>
            <li> Good dryer, works well, pretty lightweight, a little noisy</li>
            <li> I was looking for something compact to take to the Gym because their hair dryers always get stolen. I found this one on amazon and it was a really good price at $15. I was amazed that it was pretty powerful and not weak like the ones at gyms or at hotels. I have a professional hair dryer at home and this one seems just a powerful. It has been 3 months going strong. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Bought for wife and she really likes. It has a cold setting that she really wanted. Reason for the 4 is that high air means high heat with no option for high air low heat</li>
            <li> traveling to Europe is not a problem with this dryer! LOVE its size. Would recommend it to anyone needing a traveling hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It appears that they don&#x27;t make a really small travel dryer now.  This looked small, but was the same size as the one I already have for home use.</li>
            <li> I have to replace my very quiet Vidal Sassoon model #VS759 &amp;#34;Quiet Traveler&amp;#34;.  Sadly, that model is discontinued.  I had hoped that the Sassoon 1875w Stylist Traveler would be similar.  However, the Sassoon 1875w Stylist Traveler is at the extreme opposite end of the spectrum for sound: it must be at least 110 decibels of screaming, whining, buzzing NOISE, right up next to one&#x27;s head. Very disappointing, I will either return it or donate it.  If you want a fairly small yet quiet hair dryer, keep looking, this one is NOT it.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly.  Nice size.  It&#x27;s pretty powerful for the size.</li>
            <li> Dryer quit working properly the third time used.  It blows air, but not warm/hot air.</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst hair dryers I have ever used. In the past, I had a babyliss travel hair dryer that worked well and was very powerful. Based on this dryer&#x27;s good reviews, I thought it might be a similar, or even better, product; unfortunately, that was not the case at all. This dryer has no concentrator, so the air just blows everywhere. It is not nearly as powerful as it needs to be, which makes the drying time very, very long. Lastly, it is extremely loud. I had to return this product.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this folds for storage and it also has a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; button.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair dryer.  You can&#x27;t beat it.  The fact that it&#x27;s compact and also dries your hair super quickly AND on top of that, it&#x27;s so inexpensive, why would I buy another?  It&#x27;s definitely loud, but I&#x27;ve tried some of the &amp;#34;quiet&amp;#34; dryers in the past, and they just don&#x27;t do the hair-drying job as well as the Vidal Sassoon Stylist Travel Dryer.  These dryers last for years, even with daily usage.  A truly great buy!</li>
            <li> Works and all, but not very &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34;. My previous travel drier (from sharper image) was truly quite small and I was expecting this to be a similar size, but it&#x27;s really kinda big (in my opinion) for travel. Sure it&#x27;s not a full size drier, but its certainly not small enough in my book.</li>
            <li> So powerful for such a small machine!</li>
            <li> I ordered this, thinking that it had good reviews. It came and had a wiring issue that caused it to fluctuate between low and high heat when on the high heat setting. I returned it and ordered a replacement. The replacement had the same problem. I&#x27;m thinking it must be a widespread problem with this model. I&#x27;m moving on to another brand/model now. Two with the same problem is enough for me!</li>
            <li> Love this, its very strong when on high and the cord is long. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;8&amp;#34; and works for me.</li>
            <li> This thing almost caught fire in Europe and it was on the correct setting  scary and was without one because of it .</li>
            <li> This was a terrible product. It worked twice. I bought this for my trip to Europe. I used the correct settings and even made sure that the voltage was correct. I used a transformer to make sure that it wouldn&#x27;t kill the dryer but no dice. By the fourth time, the dryer stopped working completely. I had to toss it and spent my month abroad drying my hair with a fan.</li>
            <li> nice dryer. Bought it for my aqua aerobics class and it does the trick.</li>
            <li> its A Blow Dryer  It works and Does what it needs to do what else is there to say</li>
            <li> I love it. It dries my hair really fast</li>
            <li> I bought this for our trip to Europe, and was so glad that I did! Although the hotels we were staying in often provided a blowdryer, this one was by far more superior. Having long hair, it dried almost in no time. I will be using this as my regular dryer back in the states! :)</li>
            <li> Worked perfect in Africa with a $8 AC Plug Converter I purchased!</li>
            <li> This is one terrific and powerful little travel dryer!  And you can&#x27;t beat the price.  It has three settings: hot, cold, and off, and a button to press that essentially collapses the top, and a cord to wrap around. It also has a little screw that can easily be set with a screwdriver to accomodate the European 250 voltage, as well as American 125 voltage. Very powerful and efficient, and I&#x27;m glad I found it.  In no time, my hair is dry and styled.  Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Quit working after a week!</li>
            <li> I liked this dryer when we first received, but after using for only 2 weeks it would only blow cold air.</li>
            <li> Solid little travel dryer.</li>
            <li> Took it to London and Paris and it was wonderful.  Strong yet compact.</li>
            <li> Worked once, then never again. I never could get it to work in my bathroom outlet, so I had to use it in the bedroom. It worked great once, but the next day I couldn&#x27;t get it to even turn on. Directions say to clean the lint filter but don&#x27;t say how to find it. I found a ball of paper with really weird cutouts/markings (so I know it&#x27;s not mine) wadded up and stuck inside the body of the hair dryer that was a little burnt from my one use. No idea how that got in there, but it&#x27;s a definite fire hazard. Possibly blew a fuse or something. I still can&#x27;t get it to work so I&#x27;ll be buying a new one; I should have known $15 was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> great price. good hair dryer.  love it.  product arrived early. very pleased with this vendor.</li>
            <li> I got this for a cruise I was taking.  It worked well.  No complaints.  Has way more power than most hotel hairdryers.  Definitely recommend for travel as it folds up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s noisy but I don&#x27;t mind, it&#x27;s pretty powerful and dries your hair quickly so it&#x27;s not on that long anyway.  It is hard to fold; you have to jiggle it and give it a big push in order to get it to fold.  Since the folding handle was where my previous model broke, I&#x27;m playing it safe and leaving it open for daily use.  So far so good. It&#x27;s nice the barrel doesn&#x27;t get as hot.</li>
            <li> Used this in the UK.  I couldn&#x27;t turn it on high because it didn&#x27;t like that but the next setting down was more than adequate to dry my hair quickly.  Will definitely take this with me on my next trip to Costa Rica.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast.  Love this strong hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Powerful and nice compact travel hairdryer. I took it on an overnight conference and it works great. Not much to say, its a small, compact and inexpensive hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for vacationing in peru. I love that it folds down and is small enough to carry around. This little guy is VERY strong. The low setting basically works as if it were a high setting. And the high setting was so strong it starts to smell like something is burning and the back part lights up very orange due to the veryyyy high heat. Kind of scary looks like its going to blow up... but it has helped all my hair drying troubles so far on low perfectly  (which again is the perfect setting to dry hair in because it feels like a medium-high). using it now as back up for other travels and everyday use.</li>
            <li> I borrowed this blow dryer from my neighbor (when mine went ka-put) and I fell in love! I purchased another dryer for home but bought this one for travel. It&#x27;s powerful but extremely light weight and folds easily. By keeping it in my travel bag all the time, I never forget my blow dryer! Highly recommended for home or travel!</li>
            <li> It is a good dryer and does the job but I want a smaller hair dryer for travel.</li>
            <li> works great but at times when i turn on it cuts out</li>
            <li> Mine lasted about two months. I used it less than 10 times. Junk.</li>
            <li> Good quality hair dryer and affordable price you will never go wrong with this item.</li>
            <li> Good little hairdryer. I use it for dusting out my computers. its small, and has power woohoo!!</li>
            <li> Very light weight, folds great, good air flow - all as described</li>
            <li> Powerful and compact.  Exactly what I was looking for.  Great for travel as well as everyday use at home.</li>
            <li> GREAT for its size GOOD power.......</li>
            <li> very loud and have burning smell. from the first use you know it will die soon.</li>
            <li> Perfect lightweight. My wife&#x27;s shoulders have been causing too much pain to finish drying her hair. This is almost like holding no weight up!</li>
            <li> It shorted out the lights on the first use, and it doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li> While I think this is too big and heavy for travel (at least for a guy without much hair) it performs very well and I suspect uses less energy than the hair dryers from the past - at least the lights dont dim when it is in operation - always a good sign.  I use it at home but will need a smaller less powerful dryer for travel.</li>
