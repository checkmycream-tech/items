            <li>I love this product..</li>
            <li>I have tried many products to repair or conceal them.</li>
            <li>that ,just okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad this was on here</li>
            <li>Better than Botox.</li>
            <li>Good product ,I enjoy the cool feeling of this product ,no problems purchasing  as I am in Australia.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i have severe dark circles and it makes my eye so bright when I put this on lol</li>
            <li>Nothing special but okay</li>
            <li>I love the texture and cool applicator.</li>
            <li>I Love the cool touch tip on the tube.  </li>
            <li>feels smooth when apply, easy absorb by the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and just as described!</li>
            <li>This is the best little gadget and it truly does always feel cool on your eyes when you use it.  </li>
            <li>I originally was going to purchase this from Macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Many thanks kay</li>
            <li>The tip is cool</li>
            <li>The ceramic applicator tip is so cooling and easy on sensitive eye tissues.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I was at first reluctant to purchase it because of the reduced price, but it turned out to be unwarranted.</li>
            <li>It gives a great cool massage on my morning, tired eyes.</li>
            <li>When I tried to open the lid, it just came off easily.</li>
            <li>Does absolutely nothing at all to decrease the puffiness.</li>
            <li>I can always find it on Amazon at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>It really seems to help, and gives a lighter glow on the eyes.  </li>
            <li>It might help for those with dark lines but nothing more... a bit dissapointed.</li>
            <li>The description on the webpage said its a new product.</li>
            <li>I am not sure that this product has any long term benefits, but it does a good job at cooling and reducing the appearance of puffiness and brightens the eye area.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of the product, and this vendor has it for a savings over direct retail.  </li>
            <li>I cannot speak for how well it covers up dark circles, because I don&#x27;t really have an issue with that, only with the first morning puffiness, but it does brighten that area up.</li>
            <li>A general, not expected</li>
    </ol>

            <li> A general, not expected</li>
            <li> This product is a favorite and so expensive on other sites.  </li>
            <li> The ceramic applicator was a lot cooler than I expected it to be, especially when I just leave mine out on the bathroom counter all of the time, and I do not refrigerate it.</li>
            <li> I like how it lightens up my dark undereye circles, especially after concealer.</li>
            <li> will recommend it to other people</li>
            <li> I use it below the eyebrow, to the other edge, and tap a bit under th eye on outer edge.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is that I can&#x27;t wear eyeliner on my lower lashline, because it won&#x27;t stay put with this product on.</li>
            <li> I have severe dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money no results</li>
            <li> Since this is a gift, I am not sure how it feels.</li>
            <li> I use this over Olay Pro-X eye  restoration complex.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I do use this product and do recommend at least a try to see it if works for others.</li>
            <li> and it was less expensive.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s always cold, but the cream doesn&#x27;t do anything for my puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>

            <li> I love the texture and cool applicator. It makes my undereye area look and feel better. The only negative is that I can&#x27;t wear eyeliner on my lower lashline, because it won&#x27;t stay put with this product on.</li>
            <li> I keep coming back to re-supplying with the Cooling Eye Illuminator.  Aging, I have seen darkening areas beneath both eyes, regardless of enough sleep at night.  I use this over Olay Pro-X eye  restoration complex.  Between the two products, my eye area, within the orbital bones, have a brightness and skin tone that mother nature alone can not longer assure.  The ceramic applicator tip is so cooling and easy on sensitive eye tissues.  Yes, I do use this product and do recommend at least a try to see it if works for others.</li>
            <li> This is the best little gadget and it truly does always feel cool on your eyes when you use it.  It is a great addition to the cover my bags collection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the product, and this vendor has it for a savings over direct retail.  I use with with Daywear BB.</li>
            <li> Good product ,I enjoy the cool feeling of this product ,no problems purchasing  as I am in Australia.Many thanks kay</li>
            <li> I Love the cool touch tip on the tube.  It gives a great cool massage on my morning, tired eyes.</li>
            <li> Good for the price! I like how it lightens up my dark undereye circles, especially after concealer.</li>

            <li> very good effective product</li>
            <li> The price is the cheapest that I never saw it online. Since this is a gift, I am not sure how it feels.</li>
            <li> I love this product..&lt;br /&gt;i have severe dark circles and it makes my eye so bright when I put this on lol&lt;br /&gt;love it !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i tried to buy this at macy&#x27;s but it was over $65 with tax....&lt;br /&gt;soooo this was such a good deal for me :D</li>
            <li> I have severe dark circles under my eyes. I have tried many products to repair or conceal them. To no prevail. Until now!! I love this product!!</li>
            <li> Horrible. Looks like I have raccoon eyes</li>
            <li> Nothing special but okay</li>
            <li> The description on the webpage said its a new product. I received this product without any box (Not packed in Estee Lauder box). My invoice showed, new-no box. When I tried to open the lid, it just came off easily. It looked like it had been used before.</li>
            <li> cooling ceramic tip applicator that ,just okay.The effectiveness of the cream and refrigerate about.The effect is not obvious.A general, not expected</li>
            <li> I originally was going to purchase this from Macy&#x27;s but they wanted triple the cost.  I&#x27;m glad this was on here and it was less expensive.  The product overall has been doing well for me.  My circles have lightened up a tad bit.</li>
            <li> I like the head of this tube as it&#x27;s made of some kind of ceramic so it&#x27;s always cold, but the cream doesn&#x27;t do anything for my puffy eyes. It might help for those with dark lines but nothing more... a bit dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Great product!!!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing:)</li>
            <li> Not worth the money no results</li>
            <li> No cooling effect noticed.  Pigment contained in the eye cream exacerbates the appearance of puffiness under the eyes instead of minimizing it.</li>
            <li> I like it very much. feels smooth when apply, easy absorb by the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend it to other people</li>
            <li> Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder is the only cream I&#x27;ll ever use. Better than Botox.</li>
            <li> My second reorder, and plan to keep on.  It really seems to help, and gives a lighter glow on the eyes.  I use it below the eyebrow, to the other edge, and tap a bit under th eye on outer edge.  Gives illusion of brighter eyes.</li>
            <li> The ceramic applicator was a lot cooler than I expected it to be, especially when I just leave mine out on the bathroom counter all of the time, and I do not refrigerate it. It feels great on my baggy morning eyes and the coolness of it does help reduce the appearance of the under-eye puffies. The actual product is a shimmery lotion that has a skin-color tint. It does make the under-eyes appear brighter and \\&quot;illuminated\\&quot;. I cannot speak for how well it covers up dark circles, because I don&#x27;t really have an issue with that, only with the first morning puffiness, but it does brighten that area up. I am not sure that this product has any long term benefits, but it does a good job at cooling and reducing the appearance of puffiness and brightens the eye area.</li>
            <li> Excellent product at a very good price. I was at first reluctant to purchase it because of the reduced price, but it turned out to be unwarranted.</li>
            <li> Nice cooling treatment.</li>
    </ol>
