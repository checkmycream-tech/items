            <li>Great product and value for $</li>
            <li>I messed with an a couple pimples :P</li>
            <li>really good btw</li>
            <li>This product smells so good.  </li>
            <li>always says I smell good.  </li>
            <li>It worked amazing.</li>
            <li>I have acute acne</li>
            <li>Love this, leave my wifes face smooth without feeling oily and the smell is great</li>
            <li>This cream is very light weight and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I started seeing my skin become more even toned after one week of use.</li>
            <li>Takes awhile to work (like most things).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for the most part.</li>
            <li>What I love is the smell and texture.  </li>
            <li>I think it will be ok</li>
            <li>and I love the smell and how easily it goes on.  </li>
            <li>The most important area - and for Anybody (even Men) IS.</li>
            <li>I was getting these mags for free (did not ask for them)</li>
            <li>(I traced the primary suspect), but I didn&#x27;t want to continue any skin experiments before my face healed.  </li>
            <li>Well after one day of using this my skin was smooth, soft, and felt so good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fresh and is somewhere between a gel and a lotion.  </li>
            <li>but I do experience severe dark spots as I have very fair skin.</li>
            <li>It is a cream with a mild pleasant odor, use it with caution for your skin especially at night, protect yourself from the sun and follow the instructions.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and light weigh and not greasy, but I guess I need to give it more time to see if it will lighten my dark spots.</li>
            <li>Your face is the most important place as far as Any spots, blemishes, etc, so</li>
            <li>and I have seen tremendous improvement.</li>
            <li>My face is so much more clear.</li>
            <li>But I can safely say thus far.  </li>
            <li>First time using.  </li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin along with some light marks from a recent razor rash</li>
            <li>Everything isn&#x27;t clear but I am pleased with the amount of dark spots it has cleared.</li>
            <li>Bought it for my acne scars on the face.. but seems like my skin is too sensitive, since it irritated my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have now been using for 3 months and the &amp;#34;scab&amp;#34; is almost completely cleared.  </li>
            <li>but they Naturally fade apparently.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m half Japanese and prone to dark spots from blemishes that take longer to clear than others with more Caucasian skin.</li>
            <li>Too early to give a final star rating.</li>
            <li>This lotion lightens those spots much faster than other skin care products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>These were from a few of their mags, I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other things and did Not want to waste any more money (esp.only a fixed income!)</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have not seen any big change in lighting my dark spots, but perhaps I have not used it long enough.</li>
            <li> My face began peeling and a sore even developed just after a few applications Once I stopped, it all cleared up.</li>
            <li> Not only do I have dark age spots</li>
            <li> in terms of results is still too early to talk about it, so I finish review after using it for at least two weeks.</li>
            <li> Be careful what you buy.</li>
            <li> For starters, I bought it due to a Glamour recommend page.  </li>
            <li> I have two dark spots in my face on my cheeks</li>
            <li> Not sure how long I will have to use it.</li>
            <li> Evened out my skin tone and lighten some dark spots some, but they are not gone, yet.</li>
            <li> Nothing would help it until I used Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula Eventone Dark Spot Corrector.  </li>
            <li> Dark spots have faded some also.  </li>
            <li> I see a little improvement.</li>
            <li> Not dark Circles - dark SPLOTCHES, but bad just the same.  </li>
            <li> , anyway, a monthly recommend product page Did have a few things that I Have tried and Know work.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I found this product to be too harsh for my face.</li>
            <li> However, I happened to be using this cream during an exceptionally bad breakout/allergic reaction, so I had to stop using it and go back to tried-and-tested products while my skin calmed down.  </li>
            <li> Thought it was at least working on some arm spots</li>
            <li> BUT I began to use this on a scar on my leg, and while I didn&#x27;t experience and dramatic evening out of skin tone, my skin did become softer.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed, don&#x27;t waste your $.  </li>
            <li> Over $20 freakin dollars on a lousy ONE ounce!  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> This cream is very light weight and gets the job done. I started seeing my skin become more even toned after one week of use.</li>
            <li> My face is so much more clear. It worked amazing. Who knew!!!!!!! I would recommend this product to anyone. Actually I have already recommended it to my friends</li>
            <li> Love this, leave my wifes face smooth without feeling oily and the smell is great</li>
            <li> Bought it for my acne scars on the face.. but seems like my skin is too sensitive, since it irritated my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It smells really good btw, I gave it away in hopes it worked for someone else..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over two weeks. I have two dark spots in my face on my cheeks an can&#x27;t seem to get rid of it. I&#x27;ve tried this product and I still have the spots. Not sure how long I will have to use it. But I can safely say thus far.  Didn&#x27;t work for me ...  Be careful what you buy. Not everything works</li>
            <li> Takes awhile to work (like most things). I saw a bit of a difference after several weeks. It&#x27;s okay for the most part.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half Japanese and prone to dark spots from blemishes that take longer to clear than others with more Caucasian skin. This lotion lightens those spots much faster than other skin care products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin along with some light marks from a recent razor rash I messed with an a couple pimples :P Well after one day of using this my skin was smooth, soft, and felt so good. And I visibly seen improvement after only one use!</li>
            <li> This product smells so good.  I use it at night on my face and husband always says I smell good.  I believe it has helped my skin.  Evened out my skin tone and lighten some dark spots some, but they are not gone, yet.</li>
            <li> For starters, I bought it due to a Glamour recommend page.  I was getting these mags for free (did not ask for them), anyway, a monthly recommend product page Did have a few things that I Have tried and Know work.  These were from a few of their mags, I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other things and did Not want to waste any more money (esp.only a fixed income!), so I Did have some confidence.  Not again!!  Thought it was at least working on some arm spots but they Naturally fade apparently.  The most important area - and for Anybody (even Men) IS. YOUR. EYES!!!  Not dark Circles - dark SPLOTCHES, but bad just the same.  Didn&#x27;t do a dam# thing!!  Very disappointed, don&#x27;t waste your $.  Over $20 freakin dollars on a lousy ONE ounce!  RIP OFF!!  I was also hoping for results on area around the nostrils of my nose.  This is a genetic thing, so wasn&#x27;t as confidence but again, Nothing!  Your face is the most important place as far as Any spots, blemishes, etc, so, just say NO to Palmer&#x27;s.  #Nottryinganythingelse  #whotheheckcanaffordit !!</li>
            <li> Too early to give a final star rating. Only been two weeks. I see a little improvement. Let you know after 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> What I love is the smell and texture.  It&#x27;s very fresh and is somewhere between a gel and a lotion.  However, I happened to be using this cream during an exceptionally bad breakout/allergic reaction, so I had to stop using it and go back to tried-and-tested products while my skin calmed down.  Probably not Palmer&#x27;s that gave me the reaction (I traced the primary suspect), but I didn&#x27;t want to continue any skin experiments before my face healed.  BUT I began to use this on a scar on my leg, and while I didn&#x27;t experience and dramatic evening out of skin tone, my skin did become softer.  Sidenote - there was something shimmery in mine, so I wouldn&#x27;t wear this outside in the sun.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks and I love the smell and how easily it goes on.  I have not seen any big change in lighting my dark spots, but perhaps I have not used it long enough.</li>
            <li> Tried it for about 1month no change whatsoever!</li>
            <li> First time using.  I think it will be ok will just take some time to take effect</li>
            <li> For the price, this product does the job.  I did not .see immediate improvement but after using for several months, I can see some correction</li>
            <li> Not only do I have dark age spots I had a spot the size of a nickel that looked like a scab.  Nothing would help it until I used Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula Eventone Dark Spot Corrector.  Have now been using for 3 months and the &amp;#34;scab&amp;#34; is almost completely cleared.  I continue to use.  Dark spots have faded some also.  Great product and value for $</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t notice any difference with age spots, but I still like using this product as daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have acute acne but I do experience severe dark spots as I have very fair skin. I have been using this product with Palmers Daily Moisturizer in the same skin care line and I have seen tremendous improvement. Everything isn&#x27;t clear but I am pleased with the amount of dark spots it has cleared. I have been using this product for 2-3 weeks now.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be too harsh for my face. My face began peeling and a sore even developed just after a few applications Once I stopped, it all cleared up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and light weigh and not greasy, but I guess I need to give it more time to see if it will lighten my dark spots. My face does seem to have a smoother texture though.</li>
            <li> It is a cream with a mild pleasant odor, use it with caution for your skin especially at night, protect yourself from the sun and follow the instructions. in terms of results is still too early to talk about it, so I finish review after using it for at least two weeks.</li>
