    <ol>
            <li>and I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Works great!  </li>
            <li>She seems happy with it and her customers are happy with the results it provides.</li>
            <li>and I believe it could be a good replacement for my Emis (Ellmis?) product.  </li>
            <li>I found at-home chemical peel works the best for reducing the size of large pores and scaring from pimples.&lt;br</li>
            <li>very grateful and happy!!!!</li>
            <li>but the item was not allowed to return for security purpose as per Amazon customer service, but Amazon kindly fully refunded.  </li>
            <li>but I liked the results..</li>
            <li>Very easy to do .</li>
            <li>I have tried everything I know and have not been able to reach these people to ask them if I may have additional time to try this product.  </li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t done a thing to help my face look better.  </li>
            <li>Nuface Trinity does the work a lot more, yet I found combining those two therapy devices promotes more effects on lifting.  </li>
            <li>and I feel better to check my face skin every morning.</li>
            <li>I get better results if I use it twice a day.</li>
            <li>:-)&lt;br</li>
            <li>The plumping effect is greater,</li>
            <li>the more you press.</li>
            <li>I have purchased many items from Amazon over the years, but have never written a review until now.  </li>
            <li>I Just love this LED light therapy....</li>
            <li>the skin therapy kit is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It looks fine</li>
            <li>but I have read great things about red light therapy for collagen stimulation.</li>
            <li>I am an in school studying to be an esthetician and am learning about the benefits of light therapy.  </li>
            <li>Everything about this product including as box and instruction, it looks cheaply made for the price.</li>
            <li>wanted to try light therapy for its claimed benefits for lifting and hyper pigmentation from sun damage and started using this along with dermaroller and Nuface Trinity twice a day almost every day, and it has been for 2 months.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s because the light kills the acne-causing bacteria in the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The fit of the replacable lights is too lose.</li>
            <li>I have to hold a thumb on the light for it to work and keep working.</li>
            <li>Did not do any of the things it said it would,,except light up.</li>
            <li>yes, the LED light therapy for skin does work.</li>
            <li>I notice a difference right away, my skin looks smoother and more even toned.</li>
            <li>highly recommend for u!!!!</li>
            <li>In my case, probably one hour a day divided into two sessions, but well worth it!</li>
            <li>How surprised and pleased I was to truly see results after just one week of treatment!  </li>
            <li>Better than I expected,  I would recommend to anyone red light is the best for anti aging.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, I found my face skin got brighter next morning.</li>
            <li>For tightening, I found occasional chemical peel at home and daily use of vitamin C serum work very best.</li>
            <li>It is recommended that you use a clear gel to better transmit the light into the skin.</li>
            <li>They have a huge light system that covered the whole face</li>
            <li>of use and has multiple uses so am very pleased.</li>
            <li>so the little g-maher works great for me.  </li>
            <li>so I figure its better to start now than to wait until the fine lines turn to deep wrinkles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That means that you need to sit within reach of an electrical outlet and move the light around your face the whole session.</li>
            <li>I love the versatility of this and the different types of light therapy.  </li>
            <li>My smile lines and forehead lines are noticeably smoother.  </li>
            <li>I treat my face with green light in the morning, and red light in the evening, otherwise the time commitment would be just to great for one treatment</li>
            <li>I use the red light on my forehead and around my eyes for fine lines.</li>
            <li>One night, I applied whitening lotion and good quality face cream and applied green light followed by blue light before going to bed.</li>
            <li>Maybe I have to use it for several more weeks, but don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to do a thing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The light is large enough to cover a decent-sized area.&lt;br /&gt;Reliable -- I don&#x27;t have to remember to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Red light helped my skin to increase elasticity.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of different light therapy products.</li>
            <li>Light therapy works but for acne you have to use the blue light religiously.</li>
            <li>light is too big for sunken areas or corners.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a problem when using the red light because it plumps up the skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this LED kit because I was going to the esthetician for blue light therapy and they charged $100 for every session which was about 15 minutes each.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really have any feedback for that.</li>
            <li>I also notice that my skin look better and the dark spot has gone away.</li>
            <li>The blinking light is bothering especially at night when not using the eye cover that cannot allow me any other things to do, and I don&#x27;t enjoy the plastic face hitting on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>so far i have not seen any difference, even minor in fine lines or pore size.</li>
            <li>can do other things while using this light.</li>
            <li>I wanted to use red light for wrinkles and skin firming purpose, so I purchased another set of a similar product</li>
            <li>The light therapy made sense to me, different colors, different wave lengths, and the price of the product was well under what a laser treatment would cost, so I made the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it give you all three lights for different situations, I do notice sight change with the red light which I use more then the other two, nothing happens over night with any product I am willing to be patient, time will tell I have only been using it for a short period of time.</li>
            <li>Red light came as defective and light did not turn on while green and blue lights were working normally.  </li>
            <li>With the red light, on the other hand, consistent use is not so critical.</li>
            <li>My primary reason for this purchase is the green lens.</li>
            <li>This product was the price of one professional session.</li>
            <li>Have contacted g-Maher about options for replacement but so far no reply.</li>
            <li>So far no return unit or acknowledgement.</li>
            <li>Crows feet are softened, and most unbelievably, my melasma is fading!  </li>
            <li>The same product is sold on Amazon with different name for higher price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have only used the green light a couple times for my freckles</li>
            <li>Would recommend first month use every day to see changes first then maybe drop down to every other day.</li>
            <li>Major issue of my face skin was dark spots caused by being outside without sunscreen when I was a kid and low teenager even under intense summer sunlight, and I tend to be outside for excercise even recent years..</li>

            <li> By now I&#x27;ve probably spent hours dragging these lights around my face without realizing that they&#x27;d gone out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this Led skin therapy kit at the end of other treatments, that is because I could skip it when I don&#x27;t feel like.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the least expensive ones for LED light therapy.</li>
            <li> I found no effects to reduce the color of dark spots, but it does for reducing the redness of skin for hours.</li>
            <li> eye protection is black cloth, not the plastic tanning bed goggles.</li>
            <li> I have always had cystic acne and being 44 and approaching menopause it has gotten worse, but once I started this regimen</li>
            <li> my acne disapeared after 3 weeks heavy using twice a day.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even use it everyday.</li>
            <li> i use everyday</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the green light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> small but a difference so time will</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if its doing anything</li>
            <li> I have had three fraxel laser treatments in the past and have been underwhelmed by the results.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had for approximately 2 months, use every other day.</li>
            <li> had read that I shouldn&#x27;t expect results for at least 6-8 weeks.  </li>
            <li> This unit however has questionable long term quality and could fail on you within 60 days of use leaving you with nothing including no support from distributor.</li>
            <li> it was completely worthless as a facial device</li>
            <li> Suspect I just need to replace the cord but very disappointed with the quality.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been ill and have not been able to use it.  I have tried everything I know and have not been able to reach these people to ask them if I may have additional time to try this product.  It looks fine and I believe it could be a good replacement for my Emis (Ellmis?) product.  If you know how I may reach them please let me know.</li>
            <li> Works for me. It&#x27;s not for everyone but I see results when I use it. Would recommend first month use every day to see changes first then maybe drop down to every other day. Key is consistency. Do not expect to use one time and your skin changes. Doesn&#x27;t work like that. Consistency is key here.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t done a thing to help my face look better.  I feel like I&#x27;m wasting my time every time I use it.  Maybe I have to use it for several more weeks, but don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to do a thing.</li>
            <li> I Just love this LED light therapy....I am an in school studying to be an esthetician and am learning about the benefits of light therapy.  Let me tell you I notice a difference right away, my skin looks smoother and more even toned. I have always had cystic acne and being 44 and approaching menopause it has gotten worse, but once I started this regimen my acne is all but gone and the acne scars are fading!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  very grateful and happy!!!!</li>
            <li> Well made and works as advertised. I bought this so my fiance could use it in her skin care business. She seems happy with it and her customers are happy with the results it provides.</li>
            <li> 5 star with me !!! my acne disapeared after 3 weeks heavy using twice a day. I also notice that my skin look better and the dark spot has gone away. highly recommend for u!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this kit for about 3 weeks and I am very happy with the results. I can definitely tell a big difference in skin texture tone and overall appearance.</li>
            <li> Went out after about 6 months of use. I didn&#x27;t even use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it give you all three lights for different situations, I do notice sight change with the red light which I use more then the other two, nothing happens over night with any product I am willing to be patient, time will tell I have only been using it for a short period of time.</li>

The same product is sold on Amazon with different name for higher price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try light therapy for its claimed benefits for lifting and hyper pigmentation from sun damage and started using this along with dermaroller and Nuface Trinity twice a day almost every day, and it has been for 2 months.  I use this Led skin therapy kit at the end of other treatments, that is because I could skip it when I don&#x27;t feel like.  The blinking light is bothering especially at night when not using the eye cover that cannot allow me any other things to do, and I don&#x27;t enjoy the plastic face hitting on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected blue works for hyper pigmentation. I found no effects to reduce the color of dark spots, but it does for reducing the redness of skin for hours. Red light helped my skin to increase elasticity.  It plumps, also.  Nuface Trinity does the work a lot more, yet I found combining those two therapy devices promotes more effects on lifting.  Although any of those immediate effects on ski are temporally, my skin feel smoother and tighter throughout day. I found at-home chemical peel works the best for reducing the size of large pores and scaring from pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 4 months, last time I used was over a month ago. I am not motivated to use this any longer. Instead, I use a facial steamer and Clarisonic for improving skin tone. For tightening, I found occasional chemical peel at home and daily use of vitamin C serum work very best.</li>
            <li> Works great!  i use everyday and i definitely see a difference in my skin.  cleared acne on my jawline and my pores are smaller.</li>
            <li> Red light came as defective and light did not turn on while green and blue lights were working normally.  I tried to return the producet but the item was not allowed to return for security purpose as per Amazon customer service, but Amazon kindly fully refunded.  Since I had working green and blue lights in my hand, I tested them.  Major issue of my face skin was dark spots caused by being outside without sunscreen when I was a kid and low teenager even under intense summer sunlight, and I tend to be outside for excercise even recent years.. One night, I applied whitening lotion and good quality face cream and applied green light followed by blue light before going to bed. Surprisingly, I found my face skin got brighter next morning. I used three nights now and I feel better to check my face skin every morning. They look like \\&quot;just colored lights\\&quot; but actually work! I wanted to use red light for wrinkles and skin firming purpose, so I purchased another set of a similar product and I am waiting for them to come in.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected,  I would recommend to anyone red light is the best for anti aging. Very easy to do .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of different light therapy products. Light therapy works but for acne you have to use the blue light religiously. One missed session and I get zits. That&#x27;s because the light kills the acne-causing bacteria in the skin. I get better results if I use it twice a day. With the red light, on the other hand, consistent use is not so critical. The healing that&#x27;s already happened doesn&#x27;t get undone. I haven&#x27;t tried the green light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This specific device is handheld and mains powered. That means that you need to sit within reach of an electrical outlet and move the light around your face the whole session. It is recommended that you use a clear gel to better transmit the light into the skin. Aloe gel works and contributes to the healing of scars and inflamed skin. When the gel gets sticky, squirt some water on the skin, and some on the light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advantages&lt;br /&gt;I can do other things while using this light. Like writing a review on Amazon. :-)&lt;br /&gt;The light is large enough to cover a decent-sized area.&lt;br /&gt;Reliable -- I don&#x27;t have to remember to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Major Drawback&lt;br /&gt;The fit of the replacable lights is too lose. I have to hold a thumb on the light for it to work and keep working. By now I&#x27;ve probably spent hours dragging these lights around my face without realizing that they&#x27;d gone out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawback for Red Light&lt;br /&gt;The light is too big for sunken areas or corners. That&#x27;s a problem when using the red light because it plumps up the skin. The plumping effect is greater, the more you press. So if you press it against a dimple on your chin, the dimple will become deeper as the areas around the depression plump up. You may not have a dimple, but the same effect occurs where the nose meets the face. You get fatter nostril wings but the fold around them doesn&#x27;t heal.</li>
            <li> the skin therapy kit is easy to use. i would definitely put the eye protection on prior to using. eye protection is black cloth, not the plastic tanning bed goggles. i cannot decide if it is working. i bought this for anti aging.  so far i have not seen any difference, even minor in fine lines or pore size. i&#x27;ve had for approximately 2 months, use every other day. it does take 20 minutes to use this.</li>
            <li> I love the versatility of this and the different types of light therapy.  I am seeing results.  Consistency is key.</li>
            <li> My primary reason for this purchase is the green lens. I have Poikiloderma  on my neck. this can not be treated with the red lens as heat is the cause and heat will only worsen. I have been using for a few weeks now and I believe it is making a difference. small but a difference so time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;Ease of use and has multiple uses so am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Did not see any appreciable difference.</li>
            <li> I bought this LED kit because I was going to the esthetician for blue light therapy and they charged $100 for every session which was about 15 minutes each. I don&#x27;t have the means to keep up with that but I liked the results.. They have a huge light system that covered the whole face but I only break out on my chin anyway so the little g-maher works great for me.  This product was the price of one professional session. I haven&#x27;t had a break out since I started using it.&lt;br /&gt; I use the red light on my forehead and around my eyes for fine lines. I&#x27;m not sure if its doing anything but I have read great things about red light therapy for collagen stimulation. I&#x27;m 31 so I figure its better to start now than to wait until the fine lines turn to deep wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt; I have only used the green light a couple times for my freckles but I don&#x27;t really have any feedback for that.</li>
            <li> Did not do any of the things it said it would,,except light up. it was completely worthless as a facial device</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife. She likes it alot and has noticed a difference in her skin. However, have had it for only 2 months and it has stopped working! Won&#x27;t turn on. Suspect I just need to replace the cord but very disappointed with the quality. Have contacted g-Maher about options for replacement but so far no reply. Bottom line - yes, the LED light therapy for skin does work. This unit however has questionable long term quality and could fail on you within 60 days of use leaving you with nothing including no support from distributor. Keep looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: 08/06/2014&lt;br /&gt;I did receive a reply and RMA from g-Maher on my defective unit after a second website request for customer service. I sent the unit in - USPS tracking shows delivered to them on 07/25/2014. So far no return unit or acknowledgement. Will keep posted.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many items from Amazon over the years, but have never written a review until now.  I recently purchased the G-Maher Led Skin Therapy after researching products on the web.  I have had three fraxel laser treatments in the past and have been underwhelmed by the results.  The light therapy made sense to me, different colors, different wave lengths, and the price of the product was well under what a laser treatment would cost, so I made the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read that I shouldn&#x27;t expect results for at least 6-8 weeks.  How surprised and pleased I was to truly see results after just one week of treatment!  I treat my face with green light in the morning, and red light in the evening, otherwise the time commitment would be just to great for one treatment time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results:  My red acne scars have diminished by 50%.  My jowls are tighter.  My smile lines and forehead lines are noticeably smoother.  Crows feet are softened, and most unbelievably, my melasma is fading!  This is after just one week!  My G-Maher has already outperformed and paid for itself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.  You must make the time commitment.  In my case, probably one hour a day divided into two sessions, but well worth it!</li>
