    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Im from Dominican Republic, so when i used it for first time it was for 2001, now i found this fantastic fragance. And so i think i will be so happy with it.... its just fantastic....</li>
            <li> I felt in love with this fragance in the very first time i smelt it.. Is a clean, soft and sexy touch for men, u can see the people ducking you around jijiji  i just has a recommendation for all review readers; the scent really dont last at all but is ok for me. The scent change when the each person skin chemistry   It takes over 15-20 minutes after applies on skin for you smell the real scent.   It really worth the money!!!!</li>
            <li> Large size bottle for a great price!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne for a long time and was surprised to find it online cheaper than at a Banana Republic store.  Even with shipping I spent around ten dollars less than if I had gone into the store to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I bought BR&#x27;s Classic at their outlet store. The 4.2 oz was about 40 dollars, so a good bargain. I had never tried it before then, but after the first spray I was hooked. I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this cologne for men, and would HIGHLY recommend you purchasing it. The cologne is a light, citrusy-aquatic fragrance. It&#x27;s filled with lime, grapefruit, florals and a beachy-aquatic feel to it. It isn&#x27;t feminine, and wears very well on a man. My skin type can take everything from hard 80&#x27;s powerhouse musk colognes to Issey Miyake, so this cologne can truly be worn by just about any skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The complexity is straight forward; what you initially smell is what you smell throughout. There isn&#x27;t much change in the drydown. It&#x27;s very pleasant, though, to the olfactories, relaxes and smells classy. There is nothing cheap about this inexpensive cologne. It has a truly wonderful scent that will make you sniff your wrist throughout the day, as well as receive comments from those around you (if you care). The only neutral aspect about it to me is the longevity......it fades into the background within an hour-2. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, you can still smell it, but it&#x27;s gonna be a very close-to-the-skin smell. If you have a gal, she&#x27;ll be able to smell it upon getting up close to you, but this isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d say one should wear to a bar trying to get noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Classic does its name justice. Wonderful manly scent that is a bargain and will just make you feel very fresh and alive!</li>
            <li> Love the clean, crisp fragrance.</li>
            <li> I purchased Classic by Banana Republic for a friend who did not use the gift until after thirty-(30) days, past the sellers return policy; however, the cologne when compared to Classic by Banana Republic sold from the actual store did not even remotely smell the same.  The cologne provided by this seller had an alcohol scent and even though we exceeded the return policy, the seller allowed for this item to be returned.  I would recommend this seller and will consider another cologne product offered.</li>
            <li> He loved it... I would buy everyone of these...</li>
            <li> Love the fresh, clean scent of this fragrance!!!</li>
            <li> Ordered this item plus many others from Amazon. Got all the other items ordered quickly except this one. Had to contact the seller after about a month for them to issue a refund. If i hadn&#x27;t sent the seller an email I would never have gotten a response and I believe that i would still have been billed. (actually need to check my credit card bill for this item.)</li>
            <li> Not happy with the product. I am a big fan of the Classic fragrance, but this smells like a an imitation. I will make the drive to the store the next time to make sure I am getting the true product.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this product for years.  It is a very clean fresh out of the shower smell.  I have issues with perfumes and allergies and this is one of the few that don&#x27;t completely set my allergies off.  If you like very light, clean smells this is a good one.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Favorite smell.</li>
            <li> I chose this brand/scent based on reviews I read.  While I love the scent, it DOES NOT LAST.&lt;br /&gt;Since making this purchase I have read that some colognes were copied and sold to retailers.  The article said that some of the toilette sprays were labeled and sold as the full blown colognes.  I think this was one of them.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE NOTE:  This is a personal opinion and in no way is meant to belittle Amazon.  I love doing business with them...and this type of shopping fits perfectly into my lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GW</li>
            <li> Love Classic, with such a classic light fragrance</li>
            <li> Love BR products and this one adds to the list. Wear this at work, parties, games etc and get loads of compliments. Stays for long and worth the $$$.    Have been using amazon since 7 years consistently now and am a big fan of Amazon.com. Have never been disappointed. Great price on most of the products, deliveries are fast and of course a secured site! Just love it...</li>
            <li> I simply love the smell of Banana Republic Classic for Men. If you hate the citrus/orange smell type of fragrance, then you should probably stay away from this. The scent is refreshing and very clean. You can wear this for work or for a more formal event. The only reason why I am taking away one star is because the smell does NOT last! You&#x27;ll be lucky if it lasts for half the day on you, even with 3-4 sprays.</li>
            <li> My husband wanted this cologne for Christmas....at the last minute...I found it on Amazon at a great price AND free shipping. It was at the house before we got back from our trip!</li>
            <li> The shipping time was great and I was excited to open this up and try it on, when it came I about puked because of the bad smell!! OMG it smelled like old cologne that had been sitting for years and changed the fragrance from age. I read other reviews that had some bad comments as well but I wanted to take a chance on the product. I am seeing how I can get rid of this or a replacement bottle, I will see how I am treated and update my review, don&#x27;t buy this unless you like a nasty smell.</li>
            <li> this scent managed to do something I thought a man&#x27;s fragrance would not be able to accomplish .its fruity and masculine at the same time. I love it .I use it for work. I just wish the scent would last longer could be due to the fact that it is eau de toilette. well that is the reason actually. regardless I&#x27;m buying another bottle as soon as this one finishes.</li>
            <li> The product was available, my son was very pleased to recieve the gift he asked for and was very pleased with the larger size I purchased.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent for way less than it would be in store.  Deal!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the original what a disappointment. First and last time I buy from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Like product and great seller.</li>
            <li> Great scent. However, can fade after a while.</li>
            <li> not overpowering smell, really fits the name - it is a classic, timeless scent, subtle, but not feminine.</li>
            <li> The very best in scents, a real classic fragrance that will sooth the soul. You must try this at least once, then you&#x27;ll be hooked.</li>
            <li> fast shipping..love the product</li>
            <li> Shipped the wrong item and Yamanni customer service only offered a minimal price reduction. I will not use this Yamanni again.[[ASIN:B0020MM79I Banana Republic Classic by Banana Republic for Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 4.2-Ounces]]</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this eau de toilette. it&#x27;s very fresh</li>
            <li> Perfect timing.... All good.</li>
            <li> THIS PEFUME IS 100% imitation. Do not waste your money! I really regret buying this! I have smelled this perfume at the store many times and trust me it smells nothing like this perfume! The original smells very soapy and clean. This straight out smells like a heavy musky cologne. I also ordered 4.2 ounces and received 3.4. In a way I&#x27;m glad that I got a smaller size because I will not be wearing this at all!</li>
            <li> It smells nice and not overpowering</li>
            <li> On a trip, my granddaughter and I both fell in love with this scent ( CLASSIC ) only to find out it was both for men and women. It&#x27;s hard to find so I order it.</li>
            <li> Good Service from Amazon.. And Great Product, Love it.</li>
