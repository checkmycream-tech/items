            <li>Love!!</li>
            <li>My lashes haven&#x27;t looked this good in</li>
            <li>This was a good deal, so I tried it.</li>
            <li>It does not lengthen or provide any kind of volume.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love, love, love this mascara!!</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing mascara I have ever used</li>
            <li>though it&#x27;s a great product, thanks!</li>
            <li>.....B.E.Domination..Topped what i have used for over 6 yrs!2 coats or more if u want ..</li>
            <li>I am so glad I listened to her.</li>
            <li>After a couple days trying it, I purchased more.</li>
            <li>and it helps looking nice quick and easy!</li>
            <li>This was such a great deal considering</li>
            <li>So far, so good...</li>
            <li>but 1 to travel with and full size for home..</li>
            <li>There has been days when I don&#x27;t want a full face of makeup</li>
            <li>Very good mascara especially for long eye lashes</li>
            <li>Love bare minerals.</li>
            <li>I first got this mascara in a kit for Christmas 2 years ago and ever since I started using it</li>
            <li>and I have used so many different brands that they are not countable.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Very drying and irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li>Not to sound like a jerk, but the only thing is that this product offered 2 day prime shipping and didn&#x27;t live up to it.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to get this formula rather than any other BE formula!</li>
            <li>Makes your lashes full and long without clumping or smudging.</li>
            <li>When I was considering this purchase I commented to my daughter, &amp;#34;Maybe later.&amp;#34; She told me no, not later, right now.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long.</li>
            <li> It takes numerous wipes with make-up remover to come off and it leaves a black film under the eyes.  </li>
            <li> It also does nothing for the eyelashes other than darken them.  </li>
            <li> I like other bareMinerals&#x27; mascaras (Curl &amp; Lengthen).</li>
            <li> I am so sad, I really really was hoping this would work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> Makes for dramatic and thick lashes whereas the other formulas just don&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> but it smudges and makes my skin look black under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I usually buy one of them at Sephora for about $20.  </li>
            <li> I dont know what I am doing wrong</li>
            <li> This mascara is difficult to remove.  </li>
            <li> People often ask me if I&#x27;m wearing  false lashes!</li>
            <li> Awkward wand handle.</li>
            <li> Worse of all, it horribly irritates my eyes.  </li>

            <li> Absolutely love, love, love this mascara!! Makes your lashes full and long without clumping or smudging.</li>
            <li> Best there is for amazing prime price! when i have always only used B.E. Or Mally Mascara.....B.E.Domination..Topped what i have used for over 6 yrs!2 coats or more if u want ..but 1 to travel with and full size for home..Love!!</li>
            <li> This was a greatly priced bargain!!  One for my counter &amp; one for my purse!!  So far, so good... even though it doesn&#x27;t say waterproof, I&#x27;ve had no problems.  Seems to last with no smudges and no irritation to my eyes!!</li>
            <li> This was such a great deal considering I usually buy one of them at Sephora for about $20.  Not to sound like a jerk, but the only thing is that this product offered 2 day prime shipping and didn&#x27;t live up to it.  Not a big deal though it&#x27;s a great product, thanks!</li>
            <li> I dont know what I am doing wrong but it smudges and makes my skin look black under my eyes. I am so sad, I really really was hoping this would work.</li>

            <li> Very good mascara especially for long eye lashes</li>
            <li> This mascara is difficult to remove.  It takes numerous wipes with make-up remover to come off and it leaves a black film under the eyes.  It also does nothing for the eyelashes other than darken them.  It does not lengthen or provide any kind of volume.  Worse of all, it horribly irritates my eyes.  I tossed it.</li>
            <li> I loooooove this mascara! I first got this mascara in a kit for Christmas 2 years ago and ever since I started using it I get tons of compliments. People often ask me if I&#x27;m wearing  false lashes!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the cost.  Goes on clumpy</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing mascara I have ever used and I have used so many different brands that they are not countable. When I was considering this purchase I commented to my daughter, &amp;#34;Maybe later.&amp;#34; She told me no, not later, right now. I am so glad I listened to her. My lashes haven&#x27;t looked this good in I don&#x27;t know how long. After a couple days trying it, I purchased more. Never know when you&#x27;re going to run out and this is one piece of makeup I don&#x27;t want to run out of. There has been days when I don&#x27;t want a full face of makeup and I use only this mascara and it helps looking nice quick and easy! Do it, buy it!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I like other bareMinerals&#x27; mascaras (Curl &amp; Lengthen). This was a good deal, so I tried it. Very drying and irritated my eyes. Awkward wand handle. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Love bare minerals.</li>
            <li> Make sure to get this formula rather than any other BE formula! Makes for dramatic and thick lashes whereas the other formulas just don&#x27;t do much.</li>
