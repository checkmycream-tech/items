            <li>I also really liked that it&#x27;s lightweight and doesn&#x27;t fatigue my arm, but that the plastic housing isn&#x27;t brittle or fragile.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair nice and silky</li>

            <li>hair dryer itself is light!</li>
            <li>This is the nicest, most efficient hair dryer I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>but after I got the label to return it, I tried it one more time</li>
            <li>I love this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Very impressed with this dryer and totally thrown off track when I get an email from the company with tips on how to get results I like along with a PDF with tips on use as well as how to preserve it&#x27;s longentivity.  </li>
            <li>It involves a smoothing agent, better for your hair.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I paid more this time</li>
            <li>Because I’m an Amazon Top Reviewer, I was offered this ProDryer free in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad to have bought it-</li>
            <li>then I was satisfied.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The extra-long power cord is fantastic and will come in handy in any environment - at home or the salon.  </li>
            <li>At only $59.99 I am extremely impressed by the quality that went into its manufacture</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t be any more satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I asked her how many stars she would give it</li>
            <li>My favorite feature is the removable screen</li>
            <li>but I wish it had a better defuser as I have curly hair .</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super satisfied with with the dryer and its price! :)</li>
            <li>dryer!I did order it through a special promotion to try it and share my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there may be some hotter, faster, etc., but for what we need, without spending a total fortune, this has been ideal. :)</li>
            <li>She says it is the best hair dryer she&#x27;s ever had because it gets her long hair</li>
            <li>It is beyond worth it!!</li>
            <li>So I was offered this Ionic Ceramic Hair Dryer from PRODRYER for a great deal to share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered one.  </li>
            <li>Very light weight compare to the more familiar brands out there.</li>
            <li>I love that I can stand comfortably before my mirror...and not risk pulling the plug out from the wall</li>
            <li>The item was delivered fast and in good shape as advertised.</li>
            <li>The hook to hang the dryer is handy as well because if you set the dryer on the counter while its on it blows itself off the counter; its that powerful.</li>
            <li>and it really feels good with its ease of use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I love that the vent is removable so it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I like the hair dryer it is strong with its heat</li>
            <li>Dries hair quickly, and very comfortable to work with.</li>
            <li>Wow I never tried a blow dryer as amazing as this one for this price!</li>
            <li>I love the cool air blast to set my curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is hot to do lots of hair and has nice features.</li>
            <li>The ProDryer 2800 is hands DOWN the best I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
            <li>My hair dries quickly and no more fly aways, its ionic system is really great.</li>
            <li>I like the cooler option which works fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair SO straight, smooth and shiny!!</li>
            <li>Dries the hair real fast and its very light weight.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it a particularly comfortable or light grip...</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair smooth and shiny, and the 2100 watts of power dries my hair in just a couple of minutes.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Nice heavy blow dryer, a great improvement over the cheap dryer I had before this one.</li>
            <li>So rare that it was delightfully refreshing to see customer service like it use to be.</li>
            <li>ProDryer fit all the criteria she talked about.</li>
            <li>ProDryer fit all the criteria she talked about.</li>
            <li>This is a great dryer that I would definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great for directing the flow to specific areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although a bit heavy, the unit provides an excellent range of heat and air flow.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a great purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I finally realized the value in a good dryer.</li>
            <li>No where near as good as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>She says it gets nice and hot for a quick drying experience.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very powerful and dries hair quickly, even on warm, instead of hot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used a variety of hairdryers over the years and most of them cause my hair to look frizzy and damaged right away.</li>
            <li>But having used it and appreciated how nice my hair turned out, I&#x27;ll have to say it&#x27;s worth the price!  </li>
            <li>It really works!!!</li>
            <li>This is a very powerful hair dryer.</li>
            <li>This prodryer has far more effective and useful settings which are easy and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>First of all its very light in weight</li>
            <li>I used the medium heat setting and my hair curled quickly and easily with a metal barreled brush.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product, highly recommend it to anyone and everyone..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was offered this product at a promotional price to share my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>I found the hot setting to be way too hot for my hair, but I&#x27;m sure there are people whose hair needs more heat.  </li>
            <li>I love the different attachments, perfect for different size brushes.  </li>
            <li>well worth every penny at full price!</li>
            <li>so I can easily clean out accumulated lint at the air intake.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with both nozzles, I am able to dry and style at the same time!</li>
            <li>but well worth the money in the quick results you&#x27;ll get!</li>
            <li>very good quality, very effective with its results, the blow dry stays for a long time and it dries the hair extremely fast.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say if this is really any better than the others on the market in this price range, but for me, it did the job, and it did it</li>
            <li>Maybe a better dryer would be a real help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If anyone has successfully removed the fumes please comment on this and let me know how long it took you and how you did it.</li>
            <li>Actually, my hair looked good after drying.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about paying this much, but when it arrived I thought sometimes you just have to pay for quality.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not BAD, but it doesn&#x27;t stand out in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have owned several hair dryers, but this is my first professional hair dryer, and this is the BEST hair dryer I have ever owned!!!  </li>
            <li>It drys quickly  </li>
            <li>Worked quickly without leaving my hair frizzy.</li>
            <li>Dries hair quickly without leaving ends looking frazzled.  </li>
            <li>the seller sent my dryer really quickly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to purchase this product if you have hair and like to style it :)</li>
            <li>Easy to control temperature and speed, nice long cord, lightweight.</li>
            <li>It blows very hot if you want (I don&#x27;t) and will blast your hair.  </li>
            <li>It also has a cool shot button that is useful for locking in your curls and sealing the hair cuticle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great salon dryer for its price, by far a great investment and very strong motor which competes with all the other 2100 blowdryer but half its price !</li>
            <li>Another perk was that my hair was nice and smooth and FLAT!!</li>
            <li>Thanks for a super hair care product!</li>
            <li>received a complimentary Prodryer for testing and review purposes.  </li>
            <li>powerful industrial grade hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I really liked that it came with two handles, so that&#x27;s a big plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li>is everything I expected from a good hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Good and delivered as was expected</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a great Hair Dryer, I definitely suggest buying this Ionic Ceramic Professional Hair Dryer from PRODRYER.</li>
            <li>The seller has also been in touch and provided additional useful tips.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m enjoying my hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Im stylist I needed a powerful dryer</li>
            <li>If you need a long-lasting, heavy-duty, professional hair-salon-style blow dryer, then this is an outstanding value for the price.</li>
            <li>powerful and well made</li>
            <li>The dryer is right for the price</li>
            <li>It arrived and I was thrilled to see that there were 2 different attachments (honestly not sure what, but like a vacuum, I&#x27;m sure it great), and a cool shot for styling.</li>
            <li>My old dryer that I was tried to get rid off, has better hot air after 6 years of use.</li>
            <li>The cord is also nice and long so you don’t feel restricted at all.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best hair dryers that I have used personally and I&#x27;ve used quite a few.</li>
            <li>I do have short hair, so that may be a help to achieve a short drying time, but it would be a great dryer for longer hair as well.  </li>
            <li>The customer service was outstanding, and proactively emailed a few times to make sure customers know the features.  </li>
            <li>Its pretty Quite, the air flow is powerful and I love all the different heat settings!  </li>
            <li>I recently received this hair dryer and I was instantly impressed with how much nicer it is than my last &#x27;professional&#x27; hair dryer -</li>
            <li>dry quicker yet gently &amp; her hair looks great afterwards (no frizzing, not dried out,...).  </li>
            <li>It also has a variety of settings, so I was able to choose a cool setting and a nozzle that directed the airflow in the exact right direction to keep the cuticles and surface of my hair closed and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>when I first used it, which often happens with heat devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first sight</li>
            <li>I received this hair dryer the first thing I noticed</li>
            <li>I thought it would not work when I first plugged it in</li>
            <li>I bought my first Pro dryer with the hopes that it would work as well as the one my stylist uses.  </li>
            <li>I just used the first time</li>
            <li>re ordering the Babyliss Pro BABNT5548 2000 Watt Ionic Nano Titanium with Integrated Ion Generator Hair Dryer, this baby gets HOT HOT HOT HOT.</li>
            <li>They are obviously a startup company, and I’m sure they will fix their mistakes as time goes on.</li>
            <li>I’d recommend you buy this product now before they improve their marketing and start selling this product  at a higher price.e</li>

            <li>I’d recommend you buy this product now before they improve their marketing and start selling this product  at a higher price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using different hair dryers for many years</li>
            <li>After going through so many subpar hair dryers I finally came across a quality one when buying this.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, but this has been the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used!!!</li>
            <li>Its hot product, well recommend.</li>
            <li>found it to be fairly lightweight and nicely balanced; and I had absolutely no difficulty in rotating it in my hand and about my head as I dried and styled my hair.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t asked or expected to give a positive review, and this is my honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li>More than worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>For the last fifty years I have always purchased a &#x27;cheapie&#x27; hair dryer out of frugality and my thought that it would be good enough to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>so was easy to plug-in at a more convenient location than usual.</li>
            <li>All of ours have been basic Conair type dryers bought at discount stores, and I was pleased to have the opportunity to test a real professional hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This dryer has one large opening for air flow, and so it will be a lot easier to remove the lint.  </li>
            <li>I got it just the other day in the mail and used it for the first time today, so far I am loving it</li>
            <li>Highly recommended !</li>
            <li>What I especially love about this blow dryer is the cold air feature.</li>
            <li>Not being a hairstylist or anything I really had no idea</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have really much to compare to</li>
            <li>the cord is very long-about 9 feet, not 3.</li>
            <li>Made very well.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The dryer is quiet (no high-pitched whirr) and it has fabulous blow.  </li>
            <li>but this dryer has helped me so much with that.</li>
            <li>Also, the whole packaging and the dryer had some chemical smell in them.</li>
            <li>I really recommend getting this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it for anyone that is looking for a hair dryer that&#x27;s efficient !</li>
            <li>I really like the blow dryer</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t already know, the best way to lock in a hair style after giving it much heat, is to blast it with cold air.</li>
            <li>This morning after my shower I decided to give this new Hair Dryer a try and let me just say, that is probably the quickest I have been able to dry my hair in a while.  </li>
            <li>It blows really strong my hair dry fast</li>
            <li>yes it might be 2100 watts powerful with just regular medium hot air.  </li>
            <li>Majestic Inc&#x27;s Professional Hair Dryer features ionic and ceramic tourmaline tchnology, that leaves your hair looking shiny and smooth, not dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li>I have paid less for other hair dryers and been much more satisfied.</li>
            <li>It has so many positive reviews that I&#x27;m wondering if I got a defective item that was accidentally manufactured in a toxic waste removal plant.</li>
            <li>Upon purchasing this hairdryer a few weeks ago, I straight away noticed the amazing differences between this and my old dryers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the first use, I threw my old blow dryer into the trash.</li>
            <li>what I liked immediately is it is small</li>
            <li>The big blow coupled with three temperature choices and a cool button make the hair drying ritual a pleasure.  </li>
            <li>This hairdryer is 2100 Watt and very noisy, yet does not provide enough hot air at all!</li>
            <li>Because of this we decided to splurge on a new, yet some-what reasonably priced hair dryer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are two main buttons.</li>
            <li>One very exacting narrow nozzle, about 3&amp;#34; for more concentrated drying.</li>
            <li>I particularly like the fact that the heat and speed can be controlled separately.</li>
            <li>I loved the way it dried my hair faster than my current home-style hair dryer and at a slightly cooler temperature that was better for the health of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As I have grown older</li>
            <li>Her reasons are it still takes the same amount of time (20 minutes) as it did with her cheap 10 year old hair dryer.</li>
            <li>and it is not heavy and has a nice, extra long cord.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>A small red button at the top gives you a fast continuous blast of cool air.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>my hair started showing all the effects of all the years of blow drying at high heat.</li>
            <li>So when I was offered this professional blow dryer to review, I wasn&#x27;t sure I needed it, however there are always those early morning appointments when my hair is not yet dry</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>The instructions and the words on the box are all in English—and you’ll be able to figure out what the manufacturer wants to say—but everything is explained in a way that no normal English speaking person would ever use.</li>
            <li>The instructions and the words on the box are all in English—and you’ll be able to figure out what the manufacturer wants to say—but everything is explained in a way that no normal English speaking person would ever use.</li>
            <li>Sturdy&lt;br /&gt;Attachment doesn&#x27;t come off easily, unlike other dryers I&#x27;ve used&lt;br /&gt;Dries</li>
            <li>I used to work at a fancy hair salon here in Hawaii and never seen such powerful</li>
            <li>so I could have more options and hopefully this will last a long time too.</li>
            <li>I bought this dryer few months ago and i am really satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>However this one was obviously different right from the start.</li>
            <li>I brought my new ProDryer with me</li>
            <li>Anti-frizz , keeps my hair smooth and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair!!!</li>
            <li>I have thick and curly hair, this hair dryer is strong enough for my hair, it&#x27;s not heavy and easy to work</li>
            <li>so the stylist can easily move around the client in the styling chair, 4) a removable air vent to make it easy to clean on a regular basis, and 5) at least one very exacting narrow concentrator nozzle.</li>
            <li>quick dry on heat or without heat.</li>
            <li>I still find this much lighter and easy to use for long periods of time without my arms screaming!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are indentations on the handle to make this hairdryer so much easier to hold than ANY other</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine how toxic the material has to be to hold that strong of an odor for that long, but it is definitely concerning.</li>
            <li>Once I was able to get the initial start-up, it went extremely well thereafter.</li>
            <li>It is really loud!</li>
            <li>The infrared heat enables hair to endure higher levels of heat without causing further damage.</li>
            <li>It is easy to grip and handle and it dries my hair quickly so my arm doesnt get so tired</li>
            <li>I tried the Professional Hair Dryer with my round brush and the difference was immediately apparent - - smooth, glossy and pretty.  </li>
            <li>Once I figured it out however, the hairdryer was easy to use, and dried hair faster than others that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>seems worth the money, but haven&#x27;t had it long enough to use it much.</li>
            <li>But I noticed right away that it has a really long cord (nine feet!)</li>
            <li>Luckily, the next day, I had a regularly scheduled appointment with my hair stylist.</li>
            <li>This is indeed a professional quality hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>This is a definitely a professional, salon quality blow dryer.</li>
            <li>and I would like to look and feel professional, and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Packaging and instructions are the only things that I didn&#x27;t like a whole lot, but if you know your way around a hair dryer, then you probably won&#x27;t need them.</li>
            <li>- my hair was so frizzy and out of control using the old technology.  </li>
            <li>this was a professional hair dryer</li>
            <li>It had never occurred to her to buy a professional hair dryer from Amazon.</li>
            <li>As long as it got hot</li>
            <li>I am a professional hair stylist .</li>
            <li>Instead of having a frizzy mess after using a hairdryer, my hair looked shiny, clean, and well styled.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is so easy to use and so extremely powerful, and dries hair so very quickly, that it would be frustrating to be forced to use a consumer model after being being spoiled by this professional version!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ProDryer provided a hair dryer for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li>The difference is really in the wide variety of settings and the attachments included, as well as thoughtful design touches such as that long cord.</li>
            <li>It comes with 2 different attachments and a nice Long heavy duty cord.  </li>
            <li>Second switch is the same but for hot hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are two rocker switches, one for airflow and one for heat, each with a high and low setting, as well as a control button for the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It sets your hair in significantly less time, is light weight, and comes with a 3 foot cord, allowing me to step back from the vanity and flip my head over.</li>
            <li>My hair is really kinky and alot if dryers dont straighren/and dry my hair</li>
            <li>In addition, it has all the usual switches to achieve style control: one three-position toggle switch for on/off, medium airflow, and maximum airflow control; another three-position toggle switch for cold, warm and hot control; and a red button to get a fast continuous blast of cool air for as long as it is depressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve owned one professional hair dryer before (bought from a salon for $120) and this felt equal to it.</li>
            <li>and I had to go back to my really OLD Conair</li>
            <li>I will definitely recommend this Professional Hair Dryer to friends.</li>
            <li>After looking at several online and reading tons of review I decided to go with the Professional Hair Dryer.</li>
            <li>so I needed a professional opinion to help me evaluate it properly for Amazon.</li>
            <li>She told me that she could definitely tell that this ProDryer was a professional salon-style dryer and not one of those cheaper home-use varieties…and then she proceeded to educate me, at length, about the difference between salon dyers and home dryers.</li>
            <li>Had a burning smell with the first use, not sure if this is normal.</li>
            <li>Even worse, the hotter the better the dryer was in my opinion.</li>
            <li>A bonus is how long the cord is, no worries about pulling the cord too far to reach the mirror!</li>
            <li>This hair dryer performs exactly as advertised (not more, not less).</li>
            <li>A long cord is helpful to allow standing nearly anywhere in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a professional hair dryer for a long time now and have finally found one!</li>
            <li>This little thing is powerful and takes almost no time at all to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li>The motor is a standard professional hair dryer motor: it’s 2,100 watts; it’s designed to last for 10,000 hours of continuous use; it has a very thick, heavy-duty, round, 9-foot power cable; it has a removable air vent for easy cleaning; and it has a very narrow and precise concentrator nozzle.</li>

            <li>I was delighted, as was my arm, that the time it took to dry my thick hair was literally cut in half!!!</li>

            <li> hair dryer itself is light!</li>
            <li> This is the nicest, most efficient hair dryer I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> but after I got the label to return it, I tried it one more time</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this dryer and totally thrown off track when I get an email from the company with tips on how to get results I like along with a PDF with tips on use as well as how to preserve it&#x27;s longentivity.  </li>
            <li> It involves a smoothing agent, better for your hair.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I paid more this time</li>
            <li> Because I’m an Amazon Top Reviewer, I was offered this ProDryer free in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad to have bought it-</li>
            <li> then I was satisfied.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The extra-long power cord is fantastic and will come in handy in any environment - at home or the salon.  </li>
            <li> At only $59.99 I am extremely impressed by the quality that went into its manufacture</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t be any more satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I asked her how many stars she would give it</li>
            <li> My favorite feature is the removable screen</li>
            <li> but I wish it had a better defuser as I have curly hair .</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super satisfied with with the dryer and its price! :)</li>
            <li> dryer!I did order it through a special promotion to try it and share my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there may be some hotter, faster, etc., but for what we need, without spending a total fortune, this has been ideal. :)</li>
            <li> She says it is the best hair dryer she&#x27;s ever had because it gets her long hair</li>
            <li> It is beyond worth it!!</li>
            <li> So I was offered this Ionic Ceramic Hair Dryer from PRODRYER for a great deal to share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered one.  </li>
            <li> Very light weight compare to the more familiar brands out there.</li>
            <li> I love that I can stand comfortably before my mirror...and not risk pulling the plug out from the wall</li>
            <li> The item was delivered fast and in good shape as advertised.</li>
            <li> The hook to hang the dryer is handy as well because if you set the dryer on the counter while its on it blows itself off the counter; its that powerful.</li>
            <li> and it really feels good with its ease of use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I love that the vent is removable so it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I like the hair dryer it is strong with its heat</li>
            <li> Dries hair quickly, and very comfortable to work with.</li>
            <li> Wow I never tried a blow dryer as amazing as this one for this price!</li>
            <li> I love the cool air blast to set my curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is hot to do lots of hair and has nice features.</li>
            <li> The ProDryer 2800 is hands DOWN the best I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
            <li> My hair dries quickly and no more fly aways, its ionic system is really great.</li>
            <li> I like the cooler option which works fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair SO straight, smooth and shiny!!</li>
            <li> Dries the hair real fast and its very light weight.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it a particularly comfortable or light grip...</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair smooth and shiny, and the 2100 watts of power dries my hair in just a couple of minutes.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Nice heavy blow dryer, a great improvement over the cheap dryer I had before this one.</li>
            <li> So rare that it was delightfully refreshing to see customer service like it use to be.</li>
            <li> ProDryer fit all the criteria she talked about.</li>
            <li> ProDryer fit all the criteria she talked about.</li>
            <li> This is a great dryer that I would definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great for directing the flow to specific areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although a bit heavy, the unit provides an excellent range of heat and air flow.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a great purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I finally realized the value in a good dryer.</li>
            <li> No where near as good as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> She says it gets nice and hot for a quick drying experience.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very powerful and dries hair quickly, even on warm, instead of hot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a variety of hairdryers over the years and most of them cause my hair to look frizzy and damaged right away.</li>
            <li> But having used it and appreciated how nice my hair turned out, I&#x27;ll have to say it&#x27;s worth the price!  </li>
            <li> It really works!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very powerful hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This prodryer has far more effective and useful settings which are easy and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> First of all its very light in weight</li>
            <li> I used the medium heat setting and my hair curled quickly and easily with a metal barreled brush.  </li>
            <li> Amazing product, highly recommend it to anyone and everyone..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was offered this product at a promotional price to share my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I found the hot setting to be way too hot for my hair, but I&#x27;m sure there are people whose hair needs more heat.  </li>
            <li> I love the different attachments, perfect for different size brushes.  </li>
            <li> well worth every penny at full price!</li>
            <li> so I can easily clean out accumulated lint at the air intake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with both nozzles, I am able to dry and style at the same time!</li>
            <li> but well worth the money in the quick results you&#x27;ll get!</li>
            <li> very good quality, very effective with its results, the blow dry stays for a long time and it dries the hair extremely fast.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say if this is really any better than the others on the market in this price range, but for me, it did the job, and it did it</li>
            <li> Maybe a better dryer would be a real help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If anyone has successfully removed the fumes please comment on this and let me know how long it took you and how you did it.</li>
            <li> Actually, my hair looked good after drying.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about paying this much, but when it arrived I thought sometimes you just have to pay for quality.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not BAD, but it doesn&#x27;t stand out in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have owned several hair dryers, but this is my first professional hair dryer, and this is the BEST hair dryer I have ever owned!!!  </li>
            <li> It drys quickly  </li>
            <li> Worked quickly without leaving my hair frizzy.</li>
            <li> Dries hair quickly without leaving ends looking frazzled.  </li>
            <li> the seller sent my dryer really quickly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to purchase this product if you have hair and like to style it :)</li>
            <li> Easy to control temperature and speed, nice long cord, lightweight.</li>
            <li> It blows very hot if you want (I don&#x27;t) and will blast your hair.  </li>
            <li> It also has a cool shot button that is useful for locking in your curls and sealing the hair cuticle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great salon dryer for its price, by far a great investment and very strong motor which competes with all the other 2100 blowdryer but half its price !</li>
            <li> Another perk was that my hair was nice and smooth and FLAT!!</li>
            <li> Thanks for a super hair care product!</li>
            <li> received a complimentary Prodryer for testing and review purposes.  </li>
            <li> powerful industrial grade hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I really liked that it came with two handles, so that&#x27;s a big plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li> is everything I expected from a good hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Good and delivered as was expected</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great Hair Dryer, I definitely suggest buying this Ionic Ceramic Professional Hair Dryer from PRODRYER.</li>
            <li> The seller has also been in touch and provided additional useful tips.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m enjoying my hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Im stylist I needed a powerful dryer</li>
            <li> If you need a long-lasting, heavy-duty, professional hair-salon-style blow dryer, then this is an outstanding value for the price.</li>
            <li> powerful and well made</li>
            <li> The dryer is right for the price</li>
            <li> It arrived and I was thrilled to see that there were 2 different attachments (honestly not sure what, but like a vacuum, I&#x27;m sure it great), and a cool shot for styling.</li>
            <li> My old dryer that I was tried to get rid off, has better hot air after 6 years of use.</li>
            <li> The cord is also nice and long so you don’t feel restricted at all.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hair dryers that I have used personally and I&#x27;ve used quite a few.</li>
            <li> I do have short hair, so that may be a help to achieve a short drying time, but it would be a great dryer for longer hair as well.  </li>
            <li> The customer service was outstanding, and proactively emailed a few times to make sure customers know the features.  </li>
            <li> Its pretty Quite, the air flow is powerful and I love all the different heat settings!  </li>
            <li> I recently received this hair dryer and I was instantly impressed with how much nicer it is than my last &#x27;professional&#x27; hair dryer -</li>
            <li> dry quicker yet gently &amp; her hair looks great afterwards (no frizzing, not dried out,...).  </li>
            <li> It also has a variety of settings, so I was able to choose a cool setting and a nozzle that directed the airflow in the exact right direction to keep the cuticles and surface of my hair closed and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> when I first used it, which often happens with heat devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> first sight</li>
            <li> I received this hair dryer the first thing I noticed</li>
            <li> I thought it would not work when I first plugged it in</li>
            <li> I bought my first Pro dryer with the hopes that it would work as well as the one my stylist uses.  </li>
            <li> I just used the first time</li>
            <li> re ordering the Babyliss Pro BABNT5548 2000 Watt Ionic Nano Titanium with Integrated Ion Generator Hair Dryer, this baby gets HOT HOT HOT HOT.</li>
            <li> They are obviously a startup company, and I’m sure they will fix their mistakes as time goes on.</li>
            <li> I’d recommend you buy this product now before they improve their marketing and start selling this product  at a higher price.e</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using different hair dryers for many years</li>
            <li> After going through so many subpar hair dryers I finally came across a quality one when buying this.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but this has been the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used!!!</li>
            <li> Its hot product, well recommend.</li>
            <li> found it to be fairly lightweight and nicely balanced; and I had absolutely no difficulty in rotating it in my hand and about my head as I dried and styled my hair.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t asked or expected to give a positive review, and this is my honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> More than worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> For the last fifty years I have always purchased a &#x27;cheapie&#x27; hair dryer out of frugality and my thought that it would be good enough to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> so was easy to plug-in at a more convenient location than usual.</li>
            <li> All of ours have been basic Conair type dryers bought at discount stores, and I was pleased to have the opportunity to test a real professional hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This dryer has one large opening for air flow, and so it will be a lot easier to remove the lint.  </li>
            <li> I got it just the other day in the mail and used it for the first time today, so far I am loving it</li>
            <li> Highly recommended !</li>
            <li> What I especially love about this blow dryer is the cold air feature.</li>
            <li> Not being a hairstylist or anything I really had no idea</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have really much to compare to</li>
            <li> the cord is very long-about 9 feet, not 3.</li>
            <li> Made very well.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The dryer is quiet (no high-pitched whirr) and it has fabulous blow.  </li>
            <li> but this dryer has helped me so much with that.</li>
            <li> Also, the whole packaging and the dryer had some chemical smell in them.</li>
            <li> I really recommend getting this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it for anyone that is looking for a hair dryer that&#x27;s efficient !</li>
            <li> I really like the blow dryer</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t already know, the best way to lock in a hair style after giving it much heat, is to blast it with cold air.</li>
            <li> This morning after my shower I decided to give this new Hair Dryer a try and let me just say, that is probably the quickest I have been able to dry my hair in a while.  </li>
            <li> It blows really strong my hair dry fast</li>
            <li> yes it might be 2100 watts powerful with just regular medium hot air.  </li>
            <li> Majestic Inc&#x27;s Professional Hair Dryer features ionic and ceramic tourmaline tchnology, that leaves your hair looking shiny and smooth, not dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have paid less for other hair dryers and been much more satisfied.</li>
            <li> It has so many positive reviews that I&#x27;m wondering if I got a defective item that was accidentally manufactured in a toxic waste removal plant.</li>
            <li> Upon purchasing this hairdryer a few weeks ago, I straight away noticed the amazing differences between this and my old dryers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first use, I threw my old blow dryer into the trash.</li>
            <li> what I liked immediately is it is small</li>
            <li> The big blow coupled with three temperature choices and a cool button make the hair drying ritual a pleasure.  </li>
            <li> This hairdryer is 2100 Watt and very noisy, yet does not provide enough hot air at all!</li>
            <li> Because of this we decided to splurge on a new, yet some-what reasonably priced hair dryer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are two main buttons.</li>
            <li> One very exacting narrow nozzle, about 3&amp;#34; for more concentrated drying.</li>
            <li> I particularly like the fact that the heat and speed can be controlled separately.</li>
            <li> I loved the way it dried my hair faster than my current home-style hair dryer and at a slightly cooler temperature that was better for the health of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As I have grown older</li>
            <li> Her reasons are it still takes the same amount of time (20 minutes) as it did with her cheap 10 year old hair dryer.</li>
            <li> and it is not heavy and has a nice, extra long cord.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> A small red button at the top gives you a fast continuous blast of cool air.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> my hair started showing all the effects of all the years of blow drying at high heat.</li>
            <li> So when I was offered this professional blow dryer to review, I wasn&#x27;t sure I needed it, however there are always those early morning appointments when my hair is not yet dry</li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> The instructions and the words on the box are all in English—and you’ll be able to figure out what the manufacturer wants to say—but everything is explained in a way that no normal English speaking person would ever use.</li>
            <li> The instructions and the words on the box are all in English—and you’ll be able to figure out what the manufacturer wants to say—but everything is explained in a way that no normal English speaking person would ever use.</li>
            <li> Sturdy&lt;br /&gt;Attachment doesn&#x27;t come off easily, unlike other dryers I&#x27;ve used&lt;br /&gt;Dries</li>
            <li> I used to work at a fancy hair salon here in Hawaii and never seen such powerful</li>
            <li> so I could have more options and hopefully this will last a long time too.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer few months ago and i am really satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> However this one was obviously different right from the start.</li>
            <li> I brought my new ProDryer with me</li>
            <li> Anti-frizz , keeps my hair smooth and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair!!!</li>
            <li> I have thick and curly hair, this hair dryer is strong enough for my hair, it&#x27;s not heavy and easy to work</li>
            <li> so the stylist can easily move around the client in the styling chair, 4) a removable air vent to make it easy to clean on a regular basis, and 5) at least one very exacting narrow concentrator nozzle.</li>
            <li> quick dry on heat or without heat.</li>
            <li> I still find this much lighter and easy to use for long periods of time without my arms screaming!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are indentations on the handle to make this hairdryer so much easier to hold than ANY other</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine how toxic the material has to be to hold that strong of an odor for that long, but it is definitely concerning.</li>
            <li> Once I was able to get the initial start-up, it went extremely well thereafter.</li>
            <li> It is really loud!</li>
            <li> The infrared heat enables hair to endure higher levels of heat without causing further damage.</li>
            <li> It is easy to grip and handle and it dries my hair quickly so my arm doesnt get so tired</li>
            <li> I tried the Professional Hair Dryer with my round brush and the difference was immediately apparent - - smooth, glossy and pretty.  </li>
            <li> Once I figured it out however, the hairdryer was easy to use, and dried hair faster than others that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> seems worth the money, but haven&#x27;t had it long enough to use it much.</li>
            <li> But I noticed right away that it has a really long cord (nine feet!)</li>
            <li> Luckily, the next day, I had a regularly scheduled appointment with my hair stylist.</li>
            <li> This is indeed a professional quality hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> This is a definitely a professional, salon quality blow dryer.</li>
            <li> and I would like to look and feel professional, and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Packaging and instructions are the only things that I didn&#x27;t like a whole lot, but if you know your way around a hair dryer, then you probably won&#x27;t need them.</li>
            <li> - my hair was so frizzy and out of control using the old technology.  </li>
            <li> this was a professional hair dryer</li>
            <li> It had never occurred to her to buy a professional hair dryer from Amazon.</li>
            <li> As long as it got hot</li>
            <li> I am a professional hair stylist .</li>
            <li> Instead of having a frizzy mess after using a hairdryer, my hair looked shiny, clean, and well styled.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is so easy to use and so extremely powerful, and dries hair so very quickly, that it would be frustrating to be forced to use a consumer model after being being spoiled by this professional version!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ProDryer provided a hair dryer for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> The difference is really in the wide variety of settings and the attachments included, as well as thoughtful design touches such as that long cord.</li>
            <li> It comes with 2 different attachments and a nice Long heavy duty cord.  </li>
            <li> Second switch is the same but for hot hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are two rocker switches, one for airflow and one for heat, each with a high and low setting, as well as a control button for the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It sets your hair in significantly less time, is light weight, and comes with a 3 foot cord, allowing me to step back from the vanity and flip my head over.</li>
            <li> My hair is really kinky and alot if dryers dont straighren/and dry my hair</li>
            <li> In addition, it has all the usual switches to achieve style control: one three-position toggle switch for on/off, medium airflow, and maximum airflow control; another three-position toggle switch for cold, warm and hot control; and a red button to get a fast continuous blast of cool air for as long as it is depressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve owned one professional hair dryer before (bought from a salon for $120) and this felt equal to it.</li>
            <li> and I had to go back to my really OLD Conair</li>
            <li> I will definitely recommend this Professional Hair Dryer to friends.</li>
            <li> After looking at several online and reading tons of review I decided to go with the Professional Hair Dryer.</li>
            <li> so I needed a professional opinion to help me evaluate it properly for Amazon.</li>
            <li> She told me that she could definitely tell that this ProDryer was a professional salon-style dryer and not one of those cheaper home-use varieties…and then she proceeded to educate me, at length, about the difference between salon dyers and home dryers.</li>
            <li> Had a burning smell with the first use, not sure if this is normal.</li>
            <li> Even worse, the hotter the better the dryer was in my opinion.</li>
            <li> A bonus is how long the cord is, no worries about pulling the cord too far to reach the mirror!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer performs exactly as advertised (not more, not less).</li>
            <li> A long cord is helpful to allow standing nearly anywhere in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a professional hair dryer for a long time now and have finally found one!</li>
            <li> This little thing is powerful and takes almost no time at all to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> The motor is a standard professional hair dryer motor: it’s 2,100 watts; it’s designed to last for 10,000 hours of continuous use; it has a very thick, heavy-duty, round, 9-foot power cable; it has a removable air vent for easy cleaning; and it has a very narrow and precise concentrator nozzle.</li>

            <li> I was delighted, as was my arm, that the time it took to dry my thick hair was literally cut in half!!!</li>
            <li> It boils down to these five points: the professional hair dryers always have 1) a heavier, more robust, longer-lasting high-wattage motor, 2) an extra thick and heavy duty cord to support that robust motor, 3)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my adult daughter, per her request, due to</li>
            <li> Extra long cord.</li>
            <li> My brand new Xtava Peony bought the farm a few days ago (after one month of use...)</li>
            <li> We use them for our hair, to dry nail polish, to heat up price stickers before removal, and to heat up shower caps when applying deep conditioners.  </li>
            <li> Simply unscrew from the dyer rinse, let dry and reattach to the dryer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;ve been using the same blow dryer for years now and my hair really never seems the same as when my hair stylist blows it out.</li>
            <li> It is well built, it has an extra long cord which I love , have two settings for heat, two speeds and a cold shot button.</li>
            <li> The top switch is cold air, medium airflow and maximum airflow.</li>
            <li> The negative ion technology is not hype and it really does help to control frizz.  </li>
            <li> This dryer emits infrared heat and negative ions, making the heat much gentler on the hair.</li>
            <li> The second nozzle is 2½&amp;#34; wide.  </li>
            <li> The cord is NOT 3 feet long.</li>
            <li> long as it works &amp;#34;like a pro&amp;#34; I will stand by.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;She took a long time testing it out and holding it in her hands.</li>
            <li> Been using it for few months and no problems so far.</li>
            <li> My previous dryer blew out because there wasn&#x27;t enough air flow out of the vents in the back of the dryer.  </li>
            <li> This is a heavy duty; high wattage motor with a heavy duty (EXTRA LONG cord!</li>
            <li> (It has a very long cord and a power interrupter built into the plug in unit.</li>
            <li> I hope it stays working for a very long time</li>
            <li> It comes with two diffusers, which I like to use to spot dry my bangs without messing up my curls.  </li>
            <li> Within 5 minutes of using it, my hair was dry.  </li>
            <li> As a cosmetologist, I need a to dry people&#x27;s hair asap.  </li>
            <li> The dryer gave me all three of the characteristics I wanted rolled up into a single dryer.</li>
            <li> Shopping for a new dryer was so confusing.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this dryer does not provide enough hot hair.  </li>
            <li> 9 feet LONG!!) cord!  </li>
            <li> Does everything I expected</li>
            <li> So I turned it on daily for a minute or so while holding my breath to see if the fumes would go away after a few days.</li>
            <li> She said to forget about terms like ceramic, tourmaline and ions…that those were just “hollow marketing hype.</li>

            <li> not much does these days, time will tell.</li>
            <li> This works as expected.</li>
            <li> I have always bought the big box dryers and with long thick hair, it took forever to dry.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s heavier than other dryers</li>
            <li> The controls are on the side and they are not in the way like other hair dryers that put the controls in the front which always get pushed inadvertently...</li>
            <li> but, the only thing it is very, very heavy.</li>
            <li> I usually need to do some straitening with my flat iron, but this hair dryer took care of that.</li>
            <li> It is also a little heavier then I expected.</li>
            <li> The channels tended to get lint over time, and the passages were so small that I had to spend a long time with my nail file getting out the lint.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair down to my bottom and don&#x27;t usually blowdry it at all, just because I am concerned with the damage that heat styling can cause.</li>

            <li> I never had the usual pain on my wrist and its also it took me just minutes to dry and style my hair.</li>
            <li> I just received my blow dryer in the mail after going through a few other blow dryers that either broke, or didn&#x27;t work the way I needed them too.</li>

            <li> Not with this hair dryer, cut my drying time in half and did not leave my hair frizzy.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair with a shinier and less frizzy finish.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it&#x27;s a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> It dries decent but has a weird smell to it.</li>
            <li> and separate switches for cold and hot air (each with off/low/high settings).  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a very powerful hair dryer. I&#x27;ve owned one professional hair dryer before (bought from a salon for $120) and this felt equal to it. It does cut down on drying time compared to my usual dryer, which is a Conair. However, it&#x27;s not as lightweight as my Conair. I don&#x27;t find it a particularly comfortable or light grip... it&#x27;s not BAD, but it doesn&#x27;t stand out in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two attachments are good, and they stay on well. They don&#x27;t &amp;#34;click in,&amp;#34; you just push them on. Cord length is good. No burning smell when I first used it, which often happens with heat devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels like it&#x27;s made to last and I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ll have it for when time is of the essence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for review.</li>
            <li> This is indeed a professional quality hair dryer.  It has a circuit breaker plug and and heavy-duty power cord with strain relief and a loop for hanging, nominally 3 m or 10 ft. long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two rocker switches, one for airflow and one for heat, each with a high and low setting, as well as a control button for the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two attachments, a 3 in. narrow nozzle and a 2 1/2 in. wide nozzle, to concentrate, intensify, and direct the airflow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle has indentations on one side for a sure grip.  The hair dryer without the cord weighs about 19 oz., so it is not fatiguing to hold for extended periods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is so easy to use and so extremely powerful, and dries hair so very quickly, that it would be frustrating to be forced to use a consumer model after being being spoiled by this professional version!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ProDryer provided a hair dryer for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> With three females in the house, we&#x27;ve gone through probably a dozen hair dryers in the last 20 years.  We use them for our hair, to dry nail polish, to heat up price stickers before removal, and to heat up shower caps when applying deep conditioners.  All of ours have been basic Conair type dryers bought at discount stores, and I was pleased to have the opportunity to test a real professional hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon first sight, this dryer looks a lot like the ones we&#x27;ve used in the past.  But I noticed right away that it has a really long cord (nine feet!) and separate switches for cold and hot air (each with off/low/high settings).  It comes with two diffusers, which I like to use to spot dry my bangs without messing up my curls.  It also comes with a hook for hanging, a separate button to give a burst of cold air to set a curl, a circuit interrupter button in case the dryer falls into water, and a nice balance to the weight of it in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it several times now, and I&#x27;m very impressed with it!  It leaves my hair smooth and shiny, and the 2100 watts of power dries my hair in just a couple of minutes.  I used the medium heat setting and my hair curled quickly and easily with a metal barreled brush.  I found the hot setting to be way too hot for my hair, but I&#x27;m sure there are people whose hair needs more heat.  I also really liked that it&#x27;s lightweight and doesn&#x27;t fatigue my arm, but that the plastic housing isn&#x27;t brittle or fragile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If someone had told me I&#x27;d be happy to pay $60 for this hairdryer, I wouldn&#x27;t believe them. After all, I can buy two Conair dryers for that price.  But having used it and appreciated how nice my hair turned out, I&#x27;ll have to say it&#x27;s worth the price!  The vendor guarantees your satisfaction, so give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary Prodryer for testing and review purposes.  I wasn&#x27;t asked or expected to give a positive review, and this is my honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended !Great power great heat!!! Anti-frizz , keeps my hair smooth and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair!!! And light weighttt!!! Love itt!!</li>
            <li> powerful industrial grade hair dryer. better than some $150 competitors</li>
            <li> My husband bought this product for me as a gift. I cant even describe in words how amazing it is. First of all its very light in weight so you dont feel like your arm is hurting after using it. Second,  it does not make your hair friz I literally felt like I just walked out of the salon when using it. I have very thick hair and the prodryer gave me the look I wanted instantly. Im am super happy and for sure recomend this product to everyone out there.</li>
            <li> I just received my blow dryer in the mail after going through a few other blow dryers that either broke, or didn&#x27;t work the way I needed them too. What I especially love about this blow dryer is the cold air feature. If you don&#x27;t already know, the best way to lock in a hair style after giving it much heat, is to blast it with cold air. Before, I would stick my head out the car window, or sit in front of a fan, but it wasn&#x27;t ideal. This blow dryer has a great feature that locks in my hairstyle immediately after styling. So far this is one of the best blow dryer I&#x27;ve tried. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> WOW!! Who knew I would have a better blow dryer than my stylist!! This is a definitely a professional, salon quality blow dryer. This is a heavy duty; high wattage motor with a heavy duty (EXTRA LONG cord! 9 feet LONG!!) cord!  The cord itself is even impressive!!  With a heavy duty loop for hanging and the ProDryer 2800 even has a circuit breaker plug!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two main buttons. The top switch is cold air, medium airflow and maximum airflow. Second switch is the same but for hot hair. A small red button at the top gives you a fast continuous blast of cool air. I love the cool air blast to set my curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a removable air vent so it&#x27;s easy to clean. Periodically cleaning the vent will help the air flow and keep your ProDryer in tip-top shape. Simply unscrew from the dyer rinse, let dry and reattach to the dryer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 2 nozzles that come with the ProDryer 2800. One very exacting narrow nozzle, about 3&amp;#34; for more concentrated drying. The second nozzle is 2½&amp;#34; wide.  I&#x27;m impressed with both nozzles, I am able to dry and style at the same time! LOVE  THAT!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair dryer itself is light! Weighing in at 19 ounces. The cord is what adds to the weight. I still find this much lighter and easy to use for long periods of time without my arms screaming!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are indentations on the handle to make this hairdryer so much easier to hold than ANY other I&#x27;ve tried!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first use, I threw my old blow dryer into the trash. The ProDryer 2800 is hands DOWN the best I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
            <li> I have long hair down to my bottom and don&#x27;t usually blowdry it at all, just because I am concerned with the damage that heat styling can cause. So when I was offered this professional blow dryer to review, I wasn&#x27;t sure I needed it, however there are always those early morning appointments when my hair is not yet dry and I would like to look and feel professional, and I thought a hairdryer might come in handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a variety of hairdryers over the years and most of them cause my hair to look frizzy and damaged right away. However this one was obviously different right from the start. It has a 9 foot cord so was easy to plug-in at a more convenient location than usual. It also has a variety of settings, so I was able to choose a cool setting and a nozzle that directed the airflow in the exact right direction to keep the cuticles and surface of my hair closed and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The proof is in the results. Instead of having a frizzy mess after using a hairdryer, my hair looked shiny, clean, and well styled. I am a convert! The difference is really in the wide variety of settings and the attachments included, as well as thoughtful design touches such as that long cord.</li>
            <li> Great value for the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received this hair dryer the first thing I noticed was the the instructions were a bit thin and a bit confusing.  Not being a hairstylist or anything I really had no idea which switch was which.  Once I figured it out however, the hairdryer was easy to use, and dried hair faster than others that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have really much to compare to so I can&#x27;t say if this is really any better than the others on the market in this price range, but for me, it did the job, and it did it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging and instructions are the only things that I didn&#x27;t like a whole lot, but if you know your way around a hair dryer, then you probably won&#x27;t need them.</li>
            <li> great product! just what i needed but couldnt find in stores</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hair dryers that I have used personally and I&#x27;ve used quite a few. I really liked that it came with two handles, so that&#x27;s a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Very Sturdy&lt;br /&gt;Attachment doesn&#x27;t come off easily, unlike other dryers I&#x27;ve used&lt;br /&gt;Dries my hair faster than my previous one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not one that I can find</li>
            <li> This is the nicest, most efficient hair dryer I have ever owned.  It has enough controls to attain the speed and heat required to do the job.  I do have short hair, so that may be a help to achieve a short drying time, but it would be a great dryer for longer hair as well.  Once I was able to get the initial start-up, it went extremely well thereafter. I thought it would not work when I first plugged it in but after I got the label to return it, I tried it one more time and it worked!  I think there was something in the instructions about the initial start but I had not read that part of the directional information.  I  just assumed a push of the button would start it.  That aside, I would order for gifts or personal use without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Nice heavy blow dryer, a great improvement over the cheap dryer I had before this one. Extra long cord.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer but was hoping for a digital one.</li>
            <li> Does everything I expected</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer I have ever had.  It drys quickly  is excellent !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great dryer. I got it for 59.99 few days ago. Today I see it&#x27;s at 69.99. I think the person who wrote the product description confused feet with meters. The cord is NOT 3 feet long. I would guess it&#x27;s somewhere around 9 feet or so.</li>
            <li> love it very good hair blower</li>
            <li> the cord is very long-about 9 feet, not 3. it&#x27;s very powerful and dries hair quickly, even on warm, instead of hot. it&#x27;s heavier than other dryers but you&#x27;re holding it a lot less time!</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer and amazing customer service!!</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer. My finger doesn&#x27;t accidentally change settings, my hair comes now looks like how it does when at a salon. It is heavier than other dryers, but not too heavy to tire your arm. Very happy with purchase and glad I didn&#x27;t spend triple the amount of money on a dryer that doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she just loves it to death!!!!  She says it gets nice and hot for a quick drying experience.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this. It was recommended by her hair cutter. My wife says this is the best one she has ever owned (and there have been many). The item was delivered fast and in good shape as advertised. (It has a very long cord and a power interrupter built into the plug in unit. A very necessary safety feature.</li>
            <li> I have thick and curly hair, this hair dryer is strong enough for my hair, it&#x27;s not heavy and easy to work with.&lt;br /&gt;It is everything I expected from a good hair dryer.</li>
            <li> My hair seems smoother after using this dryer.  It gets the job done nicely and the attachments are great.</li>
            <li> VERY happy with this hair dryer.  Granted - I just got it, but what I liked immediately is it is small and it is not heavy and has a nice, extra long cord.  The controls are on the side and they are not in the way like other hair dryers that put the controls in the front which always get pushed inadvertently... The negative ion technology is not hype and it really does help to control frizz.  My brand new Xtava Peony bought the farm a few days ago (after one month of use...) and I had to go back to my really OLD Conair - my hair was so frizzy and out of control using the old technology.  I tried the Professional Hair Dryer with my round brush and the difference was immediately apparent - - smooth, glossy and pretty.  It blows very hot if you want (I don&#x27;t) and will blast your hair.  I like the cooler option which works fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;As long as it works &amp;#34;like a pro&amp;#34; I will stand by.  If it doesn&#x27;t I will definitely update here!</li>
            <li> Good and delivered as was expected</li>
            <li> Oh my!  This little thing is powerful and takes almost no time at all to dry my hair.  I love the different attachments, perfect for different size brushes.  I&#x27;ve already recommended it to my stylist!</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair nice and silky</li>
            <li> It is really loud! It dries decent but has a weird smell to it. It is also a little heavier then I expected.</li>
            <li> This dryer works quite well but I found it to be a little in the heavy side.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this dryer and totally thrown off track when I get an email from the company with tips on how to get results I like along with a PDF with tips on use as well as how to preserve it&#x27;s longentivity.  So rare that it was delightfully refreshing to see customer service like it use to be.</li>
            <li> For the last couple years, I&#x27;ve been getting a Brazilian Blowout. I know what you&#x27;re thinking, but this is another form of straightening. It involves a smoothing agent, better for your hair. Well I&#x27;ve been using the same blow dryer for years now and my hair really never seems the same as when my hair stylist blows it out. So I was offered this Ionic Ceramic Hair Dryer from PRODRYER for a great deal to share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered one.  It arrived and I was thrilled to see that there were 2 different attachments (honestly not sure what, but like a vacuum, I&#x27;m sure it great), and a cool shot for styling. I was delighted, as was my arm, that the time it took to dry my thick hair was literally cut in half!!! Also, the heat was off the hook!! It is way hotter than my old useless blow dryer. I think sticking my head out the car window might be faster...lol. Another perk was that my hair was nice and smooth and FLAT!! I usually need to do some straitening with my flat iron, but this hair dryer took care of that. If you are looking for a great Hair Dryer, I definitely suggest buying this Ionic Ceramic Professional Hair Dryer from PRODRYER. It is beyond worth it!!</li>
            <li> Great blow dryer. Left hair shiny and smoothe. Worked quickly without leaving my hair frizzy. Love it. Would recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> OMG is what I can say about this AMAZING hair dryer! I used to work at a fancy hair salon here in Hawaii and never seen such powerful dryer!I did order it through a special promotion to try it and share my honest and unbiased opinion. It is well built, it has an extra long cord which I love , have two settings for heat, two speeds and a cold shot button. it is amazing all around! My hair dries quickly and no more fly aways, its ionic system is really great. Do buy it with confidence, well worth every penny at full price!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Made very well.  Quiet operation.  Easy to use.  Thanks for a super hair care product!</li>
            <li> I have really long, thick (not coarse, but takes-forever-to-blowdry thick) hair. Additionally, I have daughters with thick hair which means a night of showering usually is followed up with 45 minutes to an hour of hair drying. Because of this we decided to splurge on a new, yet some-what reasonably priced hair dryer. This hair dryer performs exactly as advertised (not more, not less). I&#x27;m sure there may be some hotter, faster, etc., but for what we need, without spending a total fortune, this has been ideal. :)</li>
            <li> Best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Dries hair quickly without leaving ends looking frazzled.  Seller is incredibly helpful and friendly.  The seller has also been in touch and provided additional useful tips.  The hook to hang the dryer is handy as well because if you set the dryer on the counter while its on it blows itself off the counter; its that powerful.</li>
            <li> Last week I had gotten my hair done at a Salon and I noticed that the stylist was using a hair dryer just like this one and then saw it being offered at an awesome promotional price and had to get it.  This morning after my shower I decided to give this new Hair Dryer a try and let me just say, that is probably the quickest I have been able to dry my hair in a while.  Within 5 minutes of using it, my hair was dry.  I like that it has 2 setting for the speed of the air and 2 for the heat as well.  It comes with 2 different attachments and a nice Long heavy duty cord.  I will definitely recommend this Professional Hair Dryer to friends.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer.  JUST LIKE A SALON.</li>
            <li> Not all hair dryers are created equal. For years I had been using the cheapest dryers on the market. I would use the highest and fastest heat setting, not realizing the damage I was causing my hair. No more! Majestic Inc&#x27;s Professional Hair Dryer features ionic and ceramic tourmaline tchnology, that leaves your hair looking shiny and smooth, not dry and frizzy. It sets your hair in significantly less time, is light weight, and comes with a 3 foot cord, allowing me to step back from the vanity and flip my head over. And my hair stylist approved. I highly recommend this blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was offered this product at a promotional price to share my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Just as good or better than twin turbo- which I have been using for years. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Had a burning smell with the first use, not sure if this is normal. Returned</li>
            <li> For the last fifty years I have always purchased a &#x27;cheapie&#x27; hair dryer out of frugality and my thought that it would be good enough to get the job done.  After one to three years it would smoke or spark and I&#x27;d move on to the next bargain dryer.  This time, after noticing a raft of split ends from frying my hair in an effort to get the job done in a timely manner with little help from my blower, I decided that maybe my machine was at fault.  Maybe a better dryer would be a real help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh my!  What a difference!  My hair is improving in just two weeks.  The dryer is substantial.  The dryer is quiet (no high-pitched whirr) and it has fabulous blow.  The big blow coupled with three temperature choices and a cool button make the hair drying ritual a pleasure.  I save time and I save my tresses.  Win-win.  I&#x27;m so glad I finally realized the value in a good dryer.</li>
            <li> I bought my first Pro dryer with the hopes that it would work as well as the one my stylist uses.  After looking at several online and reading tons of review I decided to go with the Professional Hair Dryer. I got it just the other day in the mail and used it for the first time today, so far I am loving it, It is a little heavier than what i&#x27;m use to but it works like a dream!! Its pretty Quite, the air flow is powerful and I love all the different heat settings!  If you are looking for a good affordable Pro dryer this is a great option!!</li>
            <li> The hair dryer I received had an incredibly toxic smell to it when I opened the package. I couldn&#x27;t be in the same room when I turned it on. So I turned it on daily for a minute or so while holding my breath to see if the fumes would go away after a few days. I ended up doing it for 2 weeks and it&#x27;s still too fumey to use. I can&#x27;t imagine how toxic the material has to be to hold that strong of an odor for that long, but it is definitely concerning. I returned the item. If anyone has successfully removed the fumes please comment on this and let me know how long it took you and how you did it. It has so many positive reviews that I&#x27;m wondering if I got a defective item that was accidentally manufactured in a toxic waste removal plant.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m enjoying my hair dryer. I hope it stays working for a very long time</li>
            <li> This is the BEST hairdryer I ever owned! I have long thick wavy hair that tends to frizz but this dryer has helped me so much with that. It is easy to grip and handle and it dries my hair quickly so my arm doesnt get so tired I think its gonna fall off. Love it!</li>
            <li> Very nice hair dryer.. One complaint- would like written product information in the box.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. I just used the first time and I love it. My hair was silky with no frizz. I particularly like the fact that the heat and speed can be controlled separately.</li>
            <li> Very powerful and good hairdryer, the best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer!  I have always bought the big box dryers and with long thick hair, it took forever to dry. Not with this hair dryer, cut my drying time in half and did not leave my hair frizzy. Actually, my hair looked good after drying. I know it cost twice as much as big box store but well worth the money in the quick results you&#x27;ll get!</li>
            <li> Very nice hair dryer!  It works quickly, nice weight, and has different options to do the best job!  Very happy with this hair dryer.  I paid more this time so I could have more options and hopefully this will last a long time too. A bonus is how long the cord is, no worries about pulling the cord too far to reach the mirror!</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is 2100 Watt and very noisy, yet does not provide enough hot air at all! My old dryer that I was tried to get rid off, has better hot air after 6 years of use. Also, the whole packaging and the dryer had some chemical smell in them. I returned this dryer and Amazon refunded me in lightening speed. My search for the ideal hairdryer continues...</li>
            <li> Best hair dryer EVER!</li>
            <li> As a cosmetologist, I need a to dry people&#x27;s hair asap.  Unfortunately this dryer does not provide enough hot hair.  yes it might be 2100 watts powerful with just regular medium hot air.  I&#x27;m returning it and re ordering the Babyliss Pro BABNT5548 2000 Watt Ionic Nano Titanium with Integrated Ion Generator Hair Dryer, this baby gets HOT HOT HOT HOT.</li>
            <li> It really works!!! Im stylist I needed a powerful dryer, I bought this one I can&#x27;t be happier of my choice... I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> THE BEST OF THE BEST - POWERFULL LIKE A PRO - I RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> BEST blow dryer I&#x27;ve used so far!! Dries the hair real fast and its very light weight. I really recommend getting this product.</li>
            <li> If you need a long-lasting, heavy-duty, professional hair-salon-style blow dryer, then this is an outstanding value for the price. Because I’m an Amazon Top Reviewer, I was offered this ProDryer free in exchange for an honest review. I used it the day it arrived and thought it was terrific. I loved the way it dried my hair faster than my current home-style hair dryer and at a slightly cooler temperature that was better for the health of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this was a professional hair dryer so I needed a professional opinion to help me evaluate it properly for Amazon. Luckily, the next day, I had a regularly scheduled appointment with my hair stylist. I brought my new ProDryer with me so my stylist could help me evaluate it. She’s been my stylist and friend for over twenty years; I knew she’d tell me the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She took a long time testing it out and holding it in her hands. She was really impressed and said the hair dryer was awesome for the price. She told me that she usually pays about $150 to $200 for the salon dryers she buys from her discount beauty supply shop. She eagerly took down all the information for buying it on Amazon and will spread the news among her stylist friends. It had never occurred to her to buy a professional hair dryer from Amazon. She told me that she could definitely tell that this ProDryer was a professional salon-style dryer and not one of those cheaper home-use varieties…and then she proceeded to educate me, at length, about the difference between salon dyers and home dryers. It boils down to these five points: the professional hair dryers always have 1) a heavier, more robust, longer-lasting high-wattage motor, 2) an extra thick and heavy duty cord to support that robust motor, 3) a cord that is at least nine foot long so the stylist can easily move around the client in the styling chair, 4) a removable air vent to make it easy to clean on a regular basis, and 5) at least one very exacting narrow concentrator nozzle. She said to forget about terms like ceramic, tourmaline and ions…that those were just “hollow marketing hype.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ProDryer fit all the criteria she talked about. The motor is a standard professional hair dryer motor: it’s 2,100 watts; it’s designed to last for 10,000 hours of continuous use; it has a very thick, heavy-duty, round, 9-foot power cable; it has a removable air vent for easy cleaning; and it has a very narrow and precise concentrator nozzle. In addition, it has all the usual switches to achieve style control: one three-position toggle switch for on/off, medium airflow, and maximum airflow control; another three-position toggle switch for cold, warm and hot control; and a red button to get a fast continuous blast of cool air for as long as it is depressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I close, I need to warn you about the packaging and instructions: they contain countless crazy and amusing errors in English language usage! The product was obviously manufactured and packaged overseas somewhere in Asia. The instructions and the words on the box are all in English—and you’ll be able to figure out what the manufacturer wants to say—but everything is explained in a way that no normal English speaking person would ever use. Don’t be turned off by the poor English and low-budget marketing from this seller. This is a high-quality product supported (for the time being) by low-budget marketing. They are obviously a startup company, and I’m sure they will fix their mistakes as time goes on. I’d recommend you buy this product now before they improve their marketing and start selling this product  at a higher price.e said to forget about terms like ceramic, tourmaline and ions…that those were just “hollow marketing hype.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ProDryer fit all the criteria she talked about.

            <li> Wow I never tried a blow dryer as amazing as this one for this price! Awesome product!! I highly recommend to purchase this product if you have hair and like to style it :)</li>
            <li> Love this !!! Best product ! Highly recommend it for anyone that is looking for a hair dryer that&#x27;s efficient !</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It is great for both use in salon and at home. You will love it!</li>
            <li> Amazing product, highly recommend it to anyone and everyone..personally use it at home and have at my salon, get it now trust me you will not regret it</li>
            <li> Upon purchasing this hairdryer a few weeks ago, I straight away noticed the amazing differences between this and my old dryers. This prodryer has far more effective and useful settings which are easy and comfortable to use. I never had the usual pain on my wrist and its also it took me just minutes to dry and style my hair. I&#x27;ve used this product numerous times and I&#x27;m glad to have bought it- I&#x27;m super satisfied with with the dryer and its price! :)</li>
            <li> I have been blow drying my hair since I was a child, yet have never put any thought into the kind of dryer I used. As long as it got hot then I was satisfied. Even worse, the hotter the better the dryer was in my opinion. As I have grown older my hair started showing all the effects of all the years of blow drying at high heat. Shopping for a new dryer was so confusing. I couldn’t figure out if I wanted the even heat of ceramic, the frizz-free shine of ionic, or the speed of tourmaline. The dryer gave me all three of the characteristics I wanted rolled up into a single dryer. This dryer emits infrared heat and negative ions, making the heat much gentler on the hair. It leaves my hair with a shinier and less frizzy finish. The infrared heat enables hair to endure higher levels of heat without causing further damage. The combination of an ionic dryer with a tourmaline ceramic system seems to be the quickest and least damaging for your hair. It dries my hair in a third of the time. It also has a cool shot button that is useful for locking in your curls and sealing the hair cuticle.&lt;br /&gt;The dryer is lightweight and very comfortable to hold. The cord is also nice and long so you don’t feel restricted at all. I love that the vent is removable so it is easy to clean. This is a great dryer that I would definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I received the ProDryer at a discount to test and provide my feedback.</li>
            <li> My daughter is very happy with this dryer she received for Christmas. No issues, so, if she has no problems, I am happy.</li>
            <li> It works great, I love it!</li>
            <li> Performs as expected.  Easy to control temperature and speed, nice long cord, lightweight. So far, so good!</li>
            <li> I recently received this hair dryer and I was instantly impressed with how much nicer it is than my last &#x27;professional&#x27; hair dryer - in EVERY respect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it to be fairly lightweight and nicely balanced; and I had absolutely no difficulty in rotating it in my hand and about my head as I dried and styled my hair.  Unlike with my last hair dryer, my arm wasn&#x27;t fatigued by the time I&#x27;d finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the multiple fan speeds and heat settings, it&#x27;s perfect for any hair length and hairstyle.  It also comes with two attachments that don&#x27;t continually fall off like those on my last hair dryer.  They&#x27;re great for directing the flow to specific areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extra-long power cord is fantastic and will come in handy in any environment - at home or the salon.  I love that I can stand comfortably before my mirror...and not risk pulling the plug out from the wall socket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a sturdy, built-to-last unit.  At only $59.99 I am extremely impressed by the quality that went into its manufacture and I will be recommending it to everyone that I know - for home/private or salon use.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my adult daughter, per her request, due to it was recommended to her by her hair stylist after her T3 broke (after several years).  She says it is the best hair dryer she&#x27;s ever had because it gets her long hair dry quicker yet gently &amp; her hair looks great afterwards (no frizzing, not dried out,...).  So I hinted for one for me now too.</li>
            <li> I have owned several hair dryers, but this is my first professional hair dryer, and this is the BEST hair dryer I have ever owned!!!  Leaves my hair SO straight, smooth and shiny!! I&#x27;m so pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> My daughter is very happy</li>
            <li> No where near as good as I had hoped.  I have paid less for other hair dryers and been much more satisfied.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a professional hair dryer for a long time now and have finally found one! Absolutely amazing product! This Hair dryer is a MUST!</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer few months ago and i am really satisfied with my purchase. definitely recommend  it. the seller sent my dryer really quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using different hair dryers for many years and this is the best one I have used so far. very good quality, very effective with its results, the blow dry stays for a long time and it dries the hair extremely fast. couldn&#x27;t be any more satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I am a professional hair stylist . And it&#x27;s one of the best hair dryers I have used so far !! I can blow out my costumers&#x27; hair in less then 20 min!!!  Great heat!!</li>
            <li> After going through so many subpar hair dryers I finally came across a quality one when buying this. More than worth the money spent. Amazing quality and performance. Would reccomend this product to any of my friends and family without a second thought.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas. I asked her how many stars she would give it and she said 3. Her reasons are it still takes the same amount of time (20 minutes) as it did with her cheap 10 year old hair dryer. She also said that with the attachments she can&#x27;t tell the difference and they don&#x27;t style her any differently.</li>
            <li> Great product. Very light weight compare to the more familiar brands out there. I do hairstyling for about 25 years now and this hair dryer is different then all others I&#x27;ve tried, for this price range. Dries hair quickly, and very comfortable to work with. Been using it for few months and no problems so far.</li>
            <li> I like the hair dryer it is strong with its heat and it really feels good with its ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;Although It&#x27;s not the best. The dryer is right for the price</li>
            <li> powerful and well made</li>
            <li> seems worth the money, but haven&#x27;t had it long enough to use it much. Hope its built to last cause not much does these days, time will tell. it is hot to do lots of hair and has nice features. will send another review later.  thank you amazon.... r. Jones</li>
            <li> This works as expected. Short hair...quick dry on heat or without heat.</li>
            <li> By far the best I&#x27;ve tried and I can definitley see an improvement with my hair. The only negative is that it&#x27;s a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> works well, but overpriced</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but this has been the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used!!! Thank you for an awesome product!</li>
            <li> Great salon dryer for its price, by far a great investment and very strong motor which competes with all the other 2100 blowdryer but half its price !</li>
            <li> This was very good on my hair.My hair is really kinky and alot if dryers dont straighren/and dry my hair but this did.</li>
            <li> Too  heavy for people who have weak arms.</li>
            <li> Although a bit heavy, the unit provides an excellent range of heat and air flow.  A long cord is helpful to allow standing nearly anywhere in the bathroom.  My favorite feature is the removable screen so I can easily clean out accumulated lint at the air intake.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful hair dryer!  I wasn&#x27;t sure about paying this much, but when it arrived I thought sometimes you just have to pay for quality.  It has separate controls for heat and air volume.  My previous dryer blew out because there wasn&#x27;t enough air flow out of the vents in the back of the dryer.  The channels tended to get lint over time, and the passages were so small that I had to spend a long time with my nail file getting out the lint.  This dryer has one large opening for air flow, and so it will be a lot easier to remove the lint.  The customer service was outstanding, and proactively emailed a few times to make sure customers know the features.  (I&#x27;ll admit for a minute I thought it was defective until I figured out you need to turn on both controls.)  Overall, a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 2 weeks!!</li>
            <li> I really like the blow dryer but I wish it had a better defuser as I have curly hair .</li>
            <li> The Prodryer hair is incredible, I purchased it to my friend.The lightweight piece helped to do all kinds of styles to the hair without hurting the wrist. Its hot product, well recommend. reasonable price and Excellent quality.</li>
            <li> It blows really strong my hair dry fast but, the only thing it is very, very heavy.</li>
