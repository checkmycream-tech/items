            <li>times has the top come off inside</li>
            <li>The best part about these swabs are that they are individually wrapped.  </li>
            <li>worth the price and was good quality.</li>
            <li>I am glad I found them.</li>
            <li>4 more words?</li>
            <li>Our daughter has a feeding tube, and the Sage toothettes make oral care between brushings much more convenient.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what it says it is and the cost of it was exceptional.</li>
            <li>Very quick service as well.</li>
            <li>It is easy for the residents to bite through the sticks which is a problem if they have Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease</li>
            <li>easy to use and as advertised.</li>

            <li>Comfortable and non invasive for someone who can&#x27;t rinse and spit.  </li>
            <li>They really are quite handy.</li>
            <li>The sponges do a good job of cleaning the mouth, we dip in our own non-alcohol mouthwash rather than using the pre-wetted type, but the sticks were shorter than expected.</li>
            <li>I ordered these to use with my elderly mother and the swabs were very useful.</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly andwere easy to use.</li>
            <li>The company is great, they were quick and they had a better price than other companies.</li>
            <li>Mom can now keep her teeth and mouth clean</li>
            <li>these are perfect,with nothing on them to clean ones mouth out after there meds.so</li>

            <li>We bought those for our toddler ,so we can clean his mouth after using the inhaler.</li>
            <li>She feels clean and it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>As I purchased these for use with special needs children, this presents a choking hazard and liability.  </li>
            <li>However, from a convenience standpoint, I would think, even for them, the BOX design with removable area for dispensing the swabs, would be more convenient than 250 swabs in a large plastic bag..</li>
            <li>Price was right, delivered quickly, But the foam head is easily detached from the stick.  </li>
            <li>quick delivery.</li>

            <li>Sterile and economical.</li>
            <li>It is extremely useful for controlling the amount of water, mouthwash, etc.</li>
            <li>The wrapping makes it simple to keep them clean and easily storable.</li>
            <li>Next time I will do more research in finding a safer product.</li>
            <li>I know for a fact these are hospital and nursing home quality because my husband was given this exact product in both the hospital and nursing home.  </li>

            <li>We also used them for applying certain medications, when needed.  </li>

            <li>They do a good job of cleaning food debris out of hard to reach areas.  </li>

            <li>I use this product to clean my pets teeth,  I tried different dental brushes for dogs before  </li>
            <li>My son with special needs is a constant user of this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recomended.</li>
            <li>I love these my son is a disabled child</li>
            <li>Bella my cat appreciates the smallness of the sponge though she doesn&#x27;t like it very much when I get to the back teeth</li>
            <li>I dip it in a small amount of antiseptic mouthwash and have her spit it out (most of the time-when she understands).</li>
            <li>I bought them for my dog and it makes it so easy to brush his little teeth.  </li>
            <li>Stick could be a little more durable - once wet, they fall apart pretty immediately.</li>
            <li>I use these to clear the phlegm out of my throat.</li>
            <li>and it takes me over two hours to remove, but i still have complete trust in&lt;br /&gt;the  </li>
            <li>They are great for cleaning my mom&#x27;s mouth since a toothbrush is too painful with the sores from chemotherapy.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint, which is subtle, is that the handle is a bit short, but overall this is a great product and a less expensive option with the same or better quality than many others on the market.</li>

            <li> Just as expected.</li>

            <li> /&gt;They are a little expensive ,but they last a long time.</li>

            <li> but that&#x27;s not the fault of these little sponges.</li>

            <li> They are a bit textured, tho no more so than others I&#x27;ve used, which helps with cleaning, but can make them a bit irritating, so use carefully.</li>

            <li> My husband was unable to swallow when he came home from the hospital. He had used something like this to keep his mouth moist while there, and I wanted some for home. These were perfect.  Very quick service as well.</li>
            <li> Price was right, delivered quickly, But the foam head is easily detached from the stick.  As I purchased these for use with special needs children, this presents a choking hazard and liability.  I will continue to use these but only with an increased vigilance.

Now he is being treated at home hospice care with a rare form of cancer.  Medicare does not cover a lot of extra incidentals like this, so i was elated to find them on Amazon.  I was down to just a few for a day and was hoping they would come early for him and they did.  A package of 250 swabs will last for awhile and I really hope Amazon continues to carry them.  SO HAPPY!!!</li>

            <li> I use these sponges to clean my Cocker Spaniel&#x27;s teeth.  It is the only thing he will allow me to use to clean his teeth, and works very well.</li>
            <li> We used these for cleaning our baby boy&#x27;s mouth.  We also used them for applying certain medications, when needed.  These worked great.</li>
            <li> Just what the doctor ordered.</li>
            <li> Use these on my son.  Good Amazon price</li>
            <li> I have used these for 5 years with my bedbound mother who does not swallow.  they are great to clean her mouth as well as refreshing it with water etc.  quick delivery.</li>
            <li> The sponges do a good job of cleaning the mouth, we dip in our own non-alcohol mouthwash rather than using the pre-wetted type, but the sticks were shorter than expected. The price was very good though so we are making them work. Our home nurse is still very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> These are not the item listed.  I specifically ordered these because I preferred the sage brand and saw that the item number matched the items that I had at home but I received a different brand.</li>
            <li> Great product will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love these my son is a disabled child and they work great to clean his mouth!!!</li>
            <li> I like these toothettes because they are individually wrapped and don&#x27;t have anything like mint on them.  They do a good job of cleaning food debris out of hard to reach areas.  I use them in addition to regular brushing.  I moisten them with luke warm water.  They are a bit textured, tho no more so than others I&#x27;ve used, which helps with cleaning, but can make them a bit irritating, so use carefully.</li>
            <li> My 94-years old mother-in-law lives with us and is not able to properly take care of her oral hygiene.  These oral swabs greatly help in that regard.</li>
            <li> Here is another product that met all requirements and is just like what I had used in the hospital with my brother. Lots of them left, but still nice product.</li>
            <li> Yes, I am very pleased with the convenience  of this product.  Since my husband can&#x27;t brush&lt;br /&gt;his teeth at the nursing home, this product helps the caregivers in part with his daily dental procedure.</li>
            <li> These work well when trying to remove food particles from someone&#x27;s mouth who has trouble swallowing and brushing teeth.  I have not tried to use them, but my husbands caregiver requested I get them and he says they work well</li>
            <li> Product was described in listing header as 250 per BOX.  Product arrived 250 pieces in a large plastic BAG.  This was to be for retail merchandising and needed to be received as described.  Retailers should be aware of this.  It probably will not matter to end user customers.  However, from a convenience standpoint, I would think, even for them, the BOX design with removable area for dispensing the swabs, would be more convenient than 250 swabs in a large plastic bag..</li>
            <li> This item met with my expectations and cost was better than expected...It works well for who I use it with and it is durable.</li>
            <li> I purchased these swabs to give my three-month-old oral medications. They are individually wrapped, which is difficult to find with paying much more. The wrapping makes it simple to keep them clean and easily storable. The swabs are medium-soft and super absorbent, which is great if you need to use them as I did. They are strongly constructed and there is never a worry that the swab is going to come detached inside my baby&#x27;s mouth. My only complaint, which is subtle, is that the handle is a bit short, but overall this is a great product and a less expensive option with the same or better quality than many others on the market.</li>
            <li> I use these in my speech therapy practice. They are great! Good for eliciting correct tongue placement an working on jaw stability. I definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> EXCELENTE VENDEDOR LO RECOMIENDO AMPLIAMENTE ESTE ARTICULO LO USAMOS TODOS LOS DIAS Y TIENE UNA EXCELENTE CALIDAD DE ABSORCION SIN NINGUN PROBLEMA</li>
            <li> Best swab available for TBI patient!</li>
            <li> Just what i was looking for my dad to use, when our home health company couldn&#x27;t get them for us.</li>
            <li> Good value and service.</li>
            <li> My son with special needs is a constant user of this product.  We have been buying it for several years now.</li>
            <li> works well, exactly what was needed</li>
            <li> I use this product to clean my pets teeth,  I tried different dental brushes for dogs before  and they hate it. Ever since I started using this product, which is actually for elderly people or people with dissabilites it has work wonders for my dog&#x27;s daily oral cleaning routine. The company is great, they were quick and they had a better price than other companies. I highly recomended.</li>
            <li> I have been ordering the toothettes from Amazon for a couple of years.  It is less expensive to buy them in bulk.  We use them to clean my 90 year old mother&#x27;s teeth.  I would recommend these to others.</li>
            <li> i have a son who has been in a coma for over eleven (11) years and that is the  only brand i have used.  In all that time&lt;br /&gt;only three(3) times has the top come off inside and it takes me over two hours to remove, but i still have complete trust in&lt;br /&gt;the  product</li>
            <li> Great for cleaning my infants gums.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised and exactly what was needed. Great packaging and quick shipment. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Just as expected. Sterile and economical.</li>
            <li> Our speech therapist asked us to purchase these to use on our son for oral stimulation. This was the best value!</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what it says it is and the cost of it was exceptional. This product is great for our Handicapped child for cleaning her mouth</li>
            <li> I buy these to clean my mother&#x27;s (who has Alzheimer&#x27;s) mouth out. I dip it in a small amount of antiseptic mouthwash and have her spit it out (most of the time-when she understands). I have never had any problems with the sponge coming off the stick. It is extremely useful for controlling the amount of water, mouthwash, etc. that goes into their mouth as well as cleaning up the mouth. I also love that these are individually wrapped for sanitation.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my mother-in-law who used them before. No issues. Item was received as described.</li>
            <li> We bought those for our toddler ,so we can clean his mouth after using the inhaler.They work great.(we moist them first with clean water)&lt;br /&gt;They are a little expensive ,but they last a long time.I gently wash them with dish detergent and reuse them couple of times.</li>
            <li> The best part about these swabs are that they are individually wrapped.  We keep a jar of them on hand.  Great to clean someone&#x27;s mouth after respiratory care.  Comfortable and non invasive for someone who can&#x27;t rinse and spit.  Also makes a great disposable toothbrush to carry for emergencies.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for brushing when your out and not at home.  I bought them for my dog and it makes it so easy to brush his little teeth.  He&#x27;s only 3 pounds.</li>
            <li> Use them for work as an speech language pathologist.  used with children of all ages.  worth the price and was good quality.</li>
            <li> The tooth fairy told me to get these to brush my cats teeth. They are perfect for her little mouth, and she tolerates me brushing her teeth now. Just a little twirl of the handle on her miniature teeth is about all I need. Bella my cat appreciates the smallness of the sponge though she doesn&#x27;t like it very much when I get to the back teeth and she starts to bite it which isn&#x27;t good but that&#x27;s not the fault of these little sponges. They really are quite handy.</li>
            <li> I ordered these to use with my elderly mother and the swabs were very useful. They arrived quickly andwere easy to use.</li>
            <li> Ordered these for a patient. We use them twice a day. These work great for kids or hardbound patients</li>
            <li> I use these daily in my job as a Speech Language Pathologist. Good product. I am glad I found them.</li>
            <li> just what we needed great product</li>
            <li> Very good product. I use to moisten my wifes lips and tongue.  She has dementia with Parkinson&#x27;s. Very helpful</li>
            <li> They are great for cleaning my mom&#x27;s mouth since a toothbrush is too painful with the sores from chemotherapy.  She feels clean and it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> very good  and delive in time</li>
            <li> Very good product and price, fast shipping. Will order again from this seller.</li>
            <li> We like the unflavored version for our son to wipe his mouth out after neb treatments. Are you kidding me? 4 more words?</li>
            <li> Half the price of a pharmacy</li>
            <li> this is an essential product for oral care for my handicapped son. and I wish I could just give a ratinga nd not put any comments in.</li>
            <li> Stick could be a little more durable - once wet, they fall apart pretty immediately.</li>
            <li> Our daughter has a feeding tube, and the Sage toothettes make oral care between brushings much more convenient. Actual brushing is required only three times daily since we have been using toothettes.</li>
            <li> I do find the untreated and unflavored Sage mouth swabs work really well for my Mother. They do not give her a bad reaction of increased secretions&lt;br /&gt;after their use for oral care.</li>
            <li> I use these to clear the phlegm out of my throat. This is the best thing I have found to do that. Since I can&#x27;t swallow, the phlegm will build up and can present a problem. I always carry these with me whenever I need them.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a while and it meets my expectations.</li>
            <li> easy to use and as advertised.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s leukemia treatment commonly leads to mouth sores. His neutropenia (low immune system) causes him to be at risk of bacterial infection which can often be caused by bacteria introduced by toothbrushes into the gums. We have begun to use these swabs dipped in his oral moisturizer (Biotene) throughout the day. He has had very very few and only minor cases of oral mucosa breakdown. The staff at his cancer clinic have been very impressed by how well he is doing. We will continue to order and use these mouthswabs throughout treatment.</li>
