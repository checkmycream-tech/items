            <li>I cannot wait to see more companies use this style brush.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for many years</li>

            <li>Easy to use .</li>
            <li>Maybe some of these great reviews are from people that actually work for Avon?</li>
            <li>If anyone on here likes Avon feel free to order Avon products from my website:</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered two more since getting my first.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this because I thought it was so neat.</li>
            <li>, this mascara wand can give you super volume with 1 coat &amp; 1 light touch of the brush.</li>
            <li>There is nothing special about this mascara.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about this.</li>
            <li>It is an okay product, and I actually end up with more of it on my skin then on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I have been using cover girl lash blast for about 6 years loyally.</li>
            <li>This really thickened my lashes well and is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>EVERY lash the first time!</li>
            <li>The quality of the mascara is excellent; lasts all day with no running or flaking, and the black is a beautiful deep black.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s how I was able to try this product so early.</li>
            <li>Avon has a return and exchange policy so its worth a try.</li>
            <li>It would be great if Avon switched to a standard handle with the same designed bristles.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was just one of the newer spikey brushes put on sideways made to look different, yet not to perform any better.</li>
            <li>And its always been my favorite that I have announced and recommended publicly.</li>
            <li>Is it worth $10? absolutely.</li>
            <li>July 31st you would be able to purchase online or through a rep.*Note, I have no problems not poking my eyes with this brush, but I have been using a spikey style brush for several years now.</li>
            <li>Make sure to seal with cap, or yes, it will dry out faster than it should.</li>
            <li>brush also really, really helps making lashes look longer and</li>
            <li>I am a mascara junkie, and I do freelance makeup aside from my regular full time jobs</li>
            <li>I really like that Avon came up with a new bristle design .</li>
            <li>I have bought this locally and am glad to also find it on amazon for when the local avon lady is off on holiday.</li>
            <li>The wand length is super short &amp; it bends.</li>
            <li>from high end to drug store.</li>
            <li>Before that I used lancome hypnose, clinique high impact..</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new brand, this is not it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any benefit in the new design compared to an oldfashioned brush.</li>
            <li>It needs at least 5 applications to see any effect, and mostly I got so unnerved that I used another normal mascara to finish the job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The curler lets you quickly direct your lashes upwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This mascara really gives panoramic volume without having to dig in the inner &amp; outer corner of the eyes.</li>
            <li>It is not as budge proof on my bottom lashes at the end of the day as far as rubbing off on my skin</li>
            <li>its not so easy to apply and hard to use.</li>
            <li>It really separates and fans out your lashes, and you can get into every corner, plus it&#x27;s great for &amp;#34;wiggling&amp;#34; at the base to give my lashline definition.</li>
            <li>It does get messy, but a quick q-tip with makeup remover over the lid</li>
            <li>The Color is great, but i wouldnt expect it to be bad.</li>
            <li>Their other mascaras are gentle on the eye</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s not dry, like some brands can be.</li>
            <li>but it is too small to handle right by your eyes.  </li>
            <li>I do like the new infinitize but the other avon mascaras</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I do one side, then the other, then back to each for a second coat.</li>
            <li> I have naturally long lashes</li>
            <li> The BRUSH itself gives a beautiful thickness at the base of my lashes, without being too thick at the tips.</li>
            <li> The actual mascara is ok, not sure I am crazy about the unconventional shape of the wand although I am trying to get used to it, probably will not buy again.</li>
            <li> It took very little time to adjust to the different grip.</li>
            <li> This mascara makes my lashes pop with minimal effort!</li>
            <li> i spent over $12 on this!</li>
            <li> I have very minimal lashes</li>
            <li> After using it for less than 4 weeks the mascara seemed to be empty.</li>
            <li> and when i got it, after the 2nd use the red part of the handle detatched from the brush.. worse product.</li>
            <li> and this gives me the look I want in less time without having to wiggle my brush and do tricks with my wand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mess to use and it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li> If I did, I probably wouldn&#x27;t even notice the mess.</li>
            <li> and this makes them thick and long.  </li>
            <li> a little-</li>
            <li> This is a non waterproof mascara, but it still takes a little working to get it off your lashes.</li>
            <li> but they are thin and blonde.</li>
            <li> I have volume as if I had worked the wand for a few minutes &amp; curled.</li>
            <li> I have cried a few times in this mascara with no running &amp; smudging.</li>
            <li> Completely dried out within two weeks.</li>
            <li> Felt like a waste of money, and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I use the \\&quot;blink\\&quot; method of applying mascara where I slowly shut my eyelashes down onto the wand , while pushing up with the wand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to apply, looking messy.</li>
            <li> I usually have to work my lower mascara to get the lashes, &amp; I have used those baby brush mascaras that are designed for lower lashes-</li>
            <li> It is really short, which makes it a little awkward to use.</li>
            <li> Save your hard earned mloney.</li>
            <li> The price Amazon offers it for isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> and it sucks.  </li>
            <li> waste your money on this misconstruction !!</li>
            <li> and it is very small in size.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not pleasant to put on</li>
            <li> Very hard to use, I feel like I will stick myself in my eye.  </li>
            <li> I tested it with a thin brush: All the color stays on the bottom, and the mascara cannot be used up.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> i like it nut am not happy that it took to trys to get them because it was sent</li>
            <li> I was so wrong</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> some were wrong</li>
            <li> very poor packaging</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s awkward and it hurts, I tried it about 3 times</li>
            <li> &amp;#62;:(</li>
            <li> I normally HATE avon mascaras.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come as advertised, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the worst mascara I ever bought.</li>
            <li> Terrible.. it took them longer than a week to even get it shipped</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a mess to use and it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  Very disappointed in this product.  Save your hard earned mloney.</li>
            <li> There is nothing special about this mascara. It is an okay product, and I actually end up with more of it on my skin then on my eyelashes. I was looking for a new brand, this is not it. Maybe some of these great reviews are from people that actually work for Avon? The plus side is that it does work well for bottom eyelashes. And it&#x27;s not dry, like some brands can be. I wont buy it again.</li>
            <li> I really like that Avon came up with a new bristle design . The BRUSH itself gives a beautiful thickness at the base of my lashes, without being too thick at the tips. It really separates and fans out your lashes, and you can get into every corner, plus it&#x27;s great for &amp;#34;wiggling&amp;#34; at the base to give my lashline definition. The quality of the mascara is excellent; lasts all day with no running or flaking, and the black is a beautiful deep black. I took one star off for the handle. It is really short, which makes it a little awkward to use. It would be great if Avon switched to a standard handle with the same designed bristles.</li>
            <li> I am an Avon Representative and I must say that after trying this mascara, I LOVE it!!!! It is very easy to use. I love the brushes. It makes my eye lashes look fuller and darker which I love. If you haven&#x27;t tried this product yet I definitely recommend that you do. If anyone on here likes Avon feel free to order Avon products from my website: [...]</li>
            <li> I have bought this locally and am glad to also find it on amazon for when the local avon lady is off on holiday. This really thickened my lashes well and is super easy to use. It looks great also!</li>
            <li> I love the curler and the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curler lets you quickly direct your lashes upwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush also really, really helps making lashes look longer and curlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so thrilled with this mascara and would surely purchase it again.The price Amazon offers it for isn&#x27;t bad either. Although I did purchase from my sales rep.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite! i have used every brand of mascara known to man. from high end to drug store. and i love this. i dont even need to curl my lashes and i use like 2 coats and good to go. it lasts me all day.</li>
            <li> I have very minimal lashes and this makes them thick and long.  Very pleased with it.  The brush takes some getting used to but it works great.</li>
            <li> The actual mascara is ok, not sure I am crazy about the unconventional shape of the wand although I am trying to get used to it, probably will not buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the worst mascara I ever bought. It needs at least 5 applications to see any effect, and mostly I got so unnerved that I used another normal mascara to finish the job. Trying to reach the inner lashes the color gets smeared on the eyelids, and it&#x27;s the same with the lower lashes. I don&#x27;t see any benefit in the new design compared to an oldfashioned brush. After using it for less than 4 weeks the mascara seemed to be empty. But how can this short brush of 15 mm pull any color from the bottom of the tube? I tested it with a thin brush: All the color stays on the bottom, and the mascara cannot be used up.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this misconstruction !!</li>
            <li> No joke. It took very little time to adjust to the different grip. I&#x27;ve never had a mascara that lengthened AND feathered the lashes out WITHOUT clumping. I do one side, then the other, then back to each for a second coat. It does get messy, but a quick q-tip with makeup remover over the lid and it&#x27;s gone. I don&#x27;t use eyeliner. If I did, I probably wouldn&#x27;t even notice the mess. I&#x27;ve ordered two more since getting my first. Can&#x27;t get over it. I will never buy a different mascara. LOVE!</li>
            <li> Item is Good, but not as impressive as advertised.  The Color is great, but i wouldnt expect it to be bad.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this because I thought it was so neat. The brush is rubber but it&#x27;s pokey and it&#x27;s not pleasant to put on, it&#x27;s awkward and it hurts, I tried it about 3 times and then it was in the garbage.</li>
            <li> This mascara applicator is the way of the future ! I believe this is how all mascaras will be packaged soon! But until then, this avon has a great formula . Easy to use . LLOOOVVVEEE IT !</li>
            <li> This mascara makes my lashes pop with minimal effort! I can&#x27;t race about it enough. I wish it was waterproof!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to apply, looking messy.</li>
            <li> Terrible.. it took them longer than a week to even get it shipped and when i got it, after the 2nd use the red part of the handle detatched from the brush.. worse product. i spent over $12 on this! &amp;#62;:(</li>
            <li> While this isn&#x27;t the perfect mascara, I love it because I have ET and it sucks.  I can&#x27;t do eye makeup because of it and eye makeup has been what I&#x27;ve loved since forever.  Because I can use this vertically, it means that I can give my arm extra support and have extra accuracy.  It&#x27;s not perfect, but I love it.</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing. I am a mascara junkie, and I do freelance makeup aside from my regular full time jobs and I would use this on clients. One look at the mascara packaging and you can tell it&#x27;s different. The wand length is super short &amp; it bends. This is mascara made easy! At first I thought it was just one of the newer spikey brushes put on sideways made to look different, yet not to perform any better. I was so wrong, this mascara wand can give you super volume with 1 coat &amp; 1 light touch of the brush. I usually have to work my lower mascara to get the lashes, &amp; I have used those baby brush mascaras that are designed for lower lashes- with this I only have to touch my bottom lashes 1 time and the sideways length of the brush coats EVERY lash the first time! I have naturally long lashes but they are thin and blonde. I have to work my mascara brushes. I use the \\&quot;blink\\&quot; method of applying mascara where I slowly shut my eyelashes down onto the wand , while pushing up with the wand. I do this 20 + times without re-dipping to get volume. I can brush this mascara on gently without pushing up and 1-3 times I am good to go. I have volume as if I had worked the wand for a few minutes &amp; curled. This is truly revolutionary mascara. I foresee many companies doing knock offs of this one. I will honestly say I sell avon- that&#x27;s how I was able to try this product so early. I normally HATE avon mascaras. The same with avon glimmer sticks eye liners , I find both eye products smudge &amp; transfer. Their other mascaras are gentle on the eye but they dont give any oomph to your lashes. I do like the new infinitize but the other avon mascaras suck- I&#x27;m sorry but they do! This mascara really gives panoramic volume without having to dig in the inner &amp; outer corner of the eyes. I have cried a few times in this mascara with no running &amp; smudging. It is not as budge proof on my bottom lashes at the end of the day as far as rubbing off on my skin a little- but not enough to give racooneyes. I cannot wait to see more companies use this style brush. I have been using cover girl lash blast for about 6 years loyally. Before that I used lancome hypnose, clinique high impact.. cover girl fit the bill for me, now I think I have found something I like better. I don&#x27;t have time to play with mascara anymore and this gives me the look I want in less time without having to wiggle my brush and do tricks with my wand. This is a non waterproof mascara, but it still takes a little working to get it off your lashes. I use avon moisture effective eye makeup remover. This is not a plug- I have been using it for many years and I have been on public makeup forums for almost 10 years now! And its always been my favorite that I have announced and recommended publicly. Avon has a return and exchange policy so its worth a try. Is it worth $10? absolutely. I hope to post pictures when I can. :) This mascara comes out in campaign 17, 2013 for anyone wondering- July 31st you would be able to purchase online or through a rep.*Note, I have no problems not poking my eyes with this brush, but I have been using a spikey style brush for several years now. It may take some people time to get use to it.</li>
            <li> Very hard to use, I feel like I will stick myself in my eye.  Will not be using this product</li>
            <li> i like it nut am not happy that it took to trys to get them because it was sent some were wrong</li>
            <li> This mascara is perfect. Everything works to perfection. I loved to have bought this mascara eyelash. It increase eyelashes and comb eyelash... Design totally different. The brush reaches all lashes. Everything works perfect.</li>
            <li> This mascara is by far the best. Usually only need 1 coat. Make sure to seal with cap, or yes, it will dry out faster than it should.</li>
            <li> Completely dried out within two weeks.</li>
            <li> This was reviewed in an issue of Real Simple so I thought I&#x27;d try it out. Nothing special about this. Felt like a waste of money, and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Perfect lashes any time.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come as advertised, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> its not so easy to apply and hard to use.</li>
            <li> well, how should i say this......very poor packaging and it is very small in size.  i dont have very big hands but it is too small to handle right by your eyes.  probably wont use it at all.</li>
