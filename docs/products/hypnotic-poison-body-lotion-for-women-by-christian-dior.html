            <li> I chose it because other reviews said it was the real thing, and not a knock-off imitation of the real Christian Dior&#x27;s Hypnotic Poison.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance stays for a long time.</li>
            <li> and it is just subtle enough</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> This fragrance is expensive in all the stores and I have a really hard time justifying the price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very subtle, with a touch of floral and then the cashmere scent is in there too.</li>
            <li> I have had it for years and never got sick of it...</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF SMELLS AWFUL!!!</li>

            <li> I HAVE WORN THIS FRAGRANCE FOR YEARS.  I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> The best lotion and parfume in the world. Beyond sexy and not too strong! I have had it for years and never got sick of it... EVERY LADY SHOULD HAVE IT.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful as always.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY THIS STUFF SMELLS AWFUL!!!</li>
            <li> Yep, this is a Christmas present, not for me. Wife is happy about that. Since it was a listed item on the Christmas list, I am pretty sure that it is happy making.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me and I really really love it. The fragrance stays for a long time. I have a lot of friends who complimented on it too. I will definitely buy this product again.I just can&#x27;t get over with the soothing and wonderful fragrance of this lotion.</li>
            <li> I previously fell in love with the Hypnotic Poison fragrance after smelling it on a friend, so had purchased the spray EDT.  Until recently, I had never tried the body lotion.  I LOVE it!  Hypnotic Poison has some vanilla, musk and other fragrances to produce an awesome blend.  The body lotion feels wonderful on your skin and enhances the spray EDT.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily. Smells fantastic. I love it. I use Hypnotic Poison Shower Gel by Christian Dior, then Hypnotic Poison By Chistian Dior for Women Body Lotion, then Hypnotic Poison Perfume. Lasts all day and evening. I get a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is expensive in all the stores and I have a really hard time justifying the price but honestly if used sparingly, a little goes a long way, it lasts. It leaves your skin feeling like silk, soaks in well and really does prolong the fragrance of the coordinated perfume.</li>
            <li> I love Poison so much. It makes me smell good, it is really good body lotion, and my granddaughter loves it too.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the perfect balance of quality skin care and lasting scent!  I chose it because other reviews said it was the real thing, and not a knock-off imitation of the real Christian Dior&#x27;s Hypnotic Poison.  I&#x27;ve had it for several months now (a small amount goes a long way) and I love it just as much each time I put it on.  Great choice for Poison lovers who don&#x27;t want to pay the higher price for Parfum or Eau de Toilette spray.</li>
            <li> I just love how this smells! It&#x27;s very subtle, with a touch of floral and then the cashmere scent is in there too. Men compliment me every time I wear this! So do women. They describe it as fresh and sexy. The lotion is very silky and I use it on my neck as well as legs and arms, in place of cologne and it is just subtle enough that it&#x27;s not over powering. I really like the  Dior products. This is no exception.</li>
            <li> Love the light fragrance!  Always get many compliments when I wear it! The container fits perfectly on my mdressing table.</li>
            <li> Birthday gift. She lived it</li>
            <li> the product came promptly and I am very satisfied</li>
            <li> amazing smell lasts longer than the perfume many comments</li>
            <li> Got it even before scheduled. Awesome. She is very pleased. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Delicious perfume! Excellent product for the skin.</li>
