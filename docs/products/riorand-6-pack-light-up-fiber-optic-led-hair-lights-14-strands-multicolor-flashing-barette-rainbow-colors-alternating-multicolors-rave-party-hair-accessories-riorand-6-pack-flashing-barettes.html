            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize there were six to a pack, so they were especially lovely on a full head of hair.</li>
            <li>Incredible considering that they&#x27;re so cheap already.  </li>

            <li>She loves them and couldn&#x27;t be happier she has so many for a lower price.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love it everybody asked me where I got it from...</li>
            <li>Many of them had disconnected strands upon opening the packages.</li>
            <li>Could be made better.</li>
            <li>thats ok.</li>
            <li>Most of them were bent because of the way they were pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>generally, i love these lights...</li>
            <li>but otherwise I love them</li>
            <li>and you can wear them attached to most anything.  </li>
            <li>The barrette itself does light up nicely but the fiber optic strands fall out and I am still finding them all over the place.  </li>
            <li>My girls love and</li>
            <li>Not horrible, but not all they appear to be.</li>
            <li>Helps to use a razor/scissors to cut/scratch up the top to make it brighter.</li>
            <li>the girls will love this.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a worthwhile buy.</li>
            <li>Yes, mostly the barrette portion of the clips provide the most color.</li>
            <li>our granddaughters love things like this, so they will  go  in their Christmas stockings this year for  sure.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making her happy.</li>
            <li>I would buy more or buy again.</li>
            <li>so I assume they have more battery life to use.  </li>
            <li>The  kids  love  these.</li>
            <li>They can be seen in a lighted area, but the darker the area, the better they show up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Glowbys are more $</li>
            <li>I got these for my girls to wear at Halloween and they enjoyed every minute of them.</li>
            <li>Wish I would have ordered more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I gave to the kids and they love it.</li>
            <li>Also they all color change between these colors, not solid colors very awesome for price!</li>
            <li>I had to give it an okay</li>
            <li>but you should know, if you order them you might not get the flashing rainbow and then your awesome outfit will be ruined because blue doesn&#x27;t even go with it</li>
            <li>I had purchased 3 of the 6packs for a total of 18 and all worked perfectly!</li>
            <li>i love it ...</li>
            <li>Sure, they are cute but don&#x27;t take any chances.</li>
            <li>Life is too hectic to stay on top of making sure the babies don&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li>Cute for the night, but  immediately started to fall out of them.</li>
            <li>but it was OK because 2 girls didn&#x27;t show up.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found them.</li>
            <li>These were such a great value!</li>
            <li>My girls love them.</li>
            <li>We also had light up rings that were fun because we handed them out, shared them with others, and they were a great icebreaker for meeting people.</li>
            <li>These are bright and lots of fun for the kids to change their color out.</li>
            <li>I would purchase again for sure.</li>
            <li>Needs better execution.</li>
            <li>I am thinking of modifying the ones I have to make them more practical.</li>
            <li>Worked okay for the price.</li>
            <li>There is an on and off switch at the top</li>
            <li>We love Glowbies</li>
            <li>Also the spring clip allows for more mounting options.</li>
            <li>My daughter love them</li>
            <li>Good quality and the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; was just right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with them, they stay in my hair which I was worried about since my hair is fine.</li>
            <li>Very unique.</li>
            <li>got these as gifts and all the girls just love these things, they are pretty bright and all have batteries included.</li>
            <li>My Jr High girls were so happy to get them.</li>
            <li>Super cute!</li>
            <li>My best friends granddaughter upon receiving these immediately put them all in her long hair.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, just clip it where you want it :-)  </li>
            <li>The girls were thrilled with them and they are very pretty, however, the strands kept falling out and ended up all over the floor.</li>
            <li>Excellent for parties, we used them at New Year&#x27;s fireworks and party afterward and my daughters looked so pretty and were the attention of the night.</li>
            <li>The clip part is large, but i think they&#x27;ll be a good music festival addition.</li>
            <li>We clip them things all over now, and they&#x27;re just good clean family fun.</li>
            <li>Very cool.</li>
            <li>almost all of the light comes from the barrette at the top.  </li>
            <li>A great hit for an 11 year old girl.</li>
            <li>The light up optic fiber lights were okay.</li>
            <li>The 1 That does as expected is quite awesome</li>
            <li>These things are like, cheap and are mostly &#x27;blah&#x27;.</li>
            <li>They were super adorable in kids hair, the optic fibers were pretty and bright but the fibers soon fell off the hair clips.</li>
            <li>Other than that they worked perfect.</li>
            <li>The hair braids are easy to clip on.  </li>
            <li>You can turn them on and off easily and batteries are replaceable.  </li>
            <li>Shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>the batteries were easy to replace.</li>
            <li>I dislikes because they fell apart to easy while taking out of the package.</li>
            <li>The optic  fiber lights are easy to come apart.</li>
            <li>the fibers come out easily and now my house is covered in plastic strings</li>
            <li>They were easy to clip into the girl&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>They are battery-operated with an easy on/off switch.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting these, my girls loved them.</li>
            <li>The two that work are pretty nice though.</li>
            <li>THe transaction was easy quick and more than satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine for the project I have in mind</li>
            <li>Fine for the price.</li>
            <li>I purchased these for a glow dance at my children&#x27;s elem school and they were super cute for the price.</li>
            <li>Super cute in hair.</li>
            <li>The clip is bright but the strands are very dim.  </li>
            <li>Nice for price but clip too large.</li>
            <li>Very pretty, and every one of them worked well!</li>
            <li>It would be ideal if the fit into the hair a little better</li>
            <li>and she was super excited to receive this!</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t light up anywhere near as bright as the photo.  </li>
            <li>things were a HUGE hit among guest.</li>
            <li>But like I said, they were a huge hit.  </li>
            <li>The clips were huge.  </li>
            <li>and this may cause light to stop working or the strands to bend or some fall like one of mine did.  </li>
            <li>These are cheap Globys knock</li>
            <li>others have noted, almost all of the light comes from the barrette, not the strands.  </li>
            <li>They do light up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>but they are for the light effect not for holding hair.</li>
            <li>You can tell they are cheaply made</li>
            <li>They were cheap...</li>
            <li>Glad to see you now have a accurate pic of item, but before Christmas this item was Not as described, this doesn&#x27;t have enough strands in 1 to shine bright</li>
            <li>Clips comfortable in hair.</li>
            <li>; 5K. I would buy them if you need TEMPORARY light up hair.</li>
            <li>Some are blinking, some are just one color of light.</li>
            <li>both times the product was folded over twice to fit in a box...</li>
            <li>These worked great and were a big hit.</li>
            <li>Cheap and break in one use.  </li>
            <li>Cheap &amp; flimsy, just as I anticipated.  </li>
            <li>Had to cover the bases with electrical tape so that the light didn&#x27;t show through.</li>
            <li>only lol they wanted them too).</li>
            <li>and I am going to enjoy wearing them to the event</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made and it shows</li>
            <li>the colors were nice but they stuck straight out from there head...</li>
            <li>I purchased these light up fiber hair lights for a rave</li>
            <li>They are cheaply made, and I had one break before I ever even used it, because I was trying to figure out how to make it &amp;#34;flash,&amp;#34; as the Amazon description said it would</li>
            <li>(the strands already fell out of the light) and was a hassle to fix.</li>
            <li>Nice sparkle...lasted the whole Justin Bieber Concert.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for cheap decor OR party</li>
            <li>I bought these for my 6 and 8 year old granddaughters to wear to the fair.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely worth it for those light ladies that love things like these.</li>
            <li>Loved them and will def order more for next year.  </li>
            <li>I gave it to the 3 and 5 yr old and they loved them and put multiples in their hair and insisted on shutting off the lights so they could glow.</li>
            <li>and they all worked right away in their many colors.  </li>
            <li>These made our night out very fun.</li>
            <li>This hair item was a HUGE success!</li>
            <li>Each one worked right out of the box, and the bright, vibrant colour flows evenly to the tip of each strand.  </li>
            <li>They barely emit any light from the side, you have to hold them up in the air and look into them for them to be bright.</li>
            <li>Yes it was quick easy and affordable.</li>
            <li>These worked great, which is more than I can say for the other light-up toys we bought for our holiday party!  </li>
            <li>But, the rest were very pretty and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love that these light up and are pretty fun for the girls, but they fall apart so easily.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>they had many colors and they were pretty</li>
            <li>Added to a fun event!  </li>
            <li>Not, completely disappointed.  </li>
            <li>These were lots of fun!</li>
            <li>They were so fun!</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to receiving these, but just wasn&#x27;t excited about them.  </li>
            <li>now we cannot wear them like we originally planned</li>
            <li>With all that long brown hair, it shows great,</li>
            <li>I have ordered many of these barrettes from other companies with great success</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d put in a touch of super glue to secure the glowing stuff.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t look like much in the light but are so cool when you are in the dark--the darker the better.</li>
            <li>She still thought she was super cool with light up hair.</li>
            <li>Colors were exactly as stated and they are light weight so easy to keep in hair.</li>
            <li>Nothing too special , no problems.</li>
            <li>The clips are too bulky, it&#x27;s hard to hide the battery compartment with the hair, but the Lights are awesome.</li>
            <li>Super fun!</li>
            <li>It falls apart easily and the batteries and sharp parts are perfect for being swallowed by a young child.</li>
            <li>These things are really cool</li>
            <li>: They&#x27;re much cheaper than authentic Globys.  </li>
            <li>cute I think for city, but not so much for burning man.</li>
            <li>Cheap and fun item to give out as party favors.</li>
            <li>Really cool product would buy again.</li>
            <li>I love all of them thank you so much.</li>
            <li>, it is ok, I thought it would be easier to put in to my child&#x27;s hair, not so much.</li>
            <li>Cool product...</li>
            <li>my daughter is having a sweet 16 and</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really recommend them for more than a one time use.</li>
            <li>The girls of all ages will have fun with these light up strands.  </li>
            <li>2/6 didn&#x27;t work and the others deteriorated quickly leaving lots of matter out of place to clean up.  </li>
            <li>Wants more for her friends.  </li>
            <li>These are beautiful in the dark.</li>
            <li>but you almost need two to get the full effect,</li>
            <li>In the description &amp;#34;Multicolor Flashing Barette - Rainbow Colors (Alternating Multicolors)&amp;#34; - none of those things are true.</li>
            <li>The girls loved these at the last festival we went to.</li>
            <li>This was a true winner.</li>
            <li>These were given out on the dance floor at a sweet sixteen party.</li>
            <li>got these for my middle daughter she loved them</li>
            <li>I saw some on Amazon for like $4 a five pack which is not bad either.  </li>
            <li>These were the hit of the party, people had fun finding new ways to attach them to their hair, made a nice effect.</li>
            <li>They worked great for our black light party</li>
            <li>Look neat however top needs to be cover by black tape as it is so bright i could distract from fiber optics.</li>
            <li>Bought these to give away to the little girls at a camping weekend trip &amp; they all loved them!</li>
            <li>Also the light strands feel off of one of the clips right away.</li>
            <li>Right now, they are $5.29 with free (Prime) shipping for a 6 pack.</li>
            <li>You need big hair or some kind of barrette or bow to cover the large battery filled top... a hat maybe?</li>
            <li>The long fibers are able to be manipulated very easy and spread apart making it cool to spread throughout your hair or place into a pony tail.  </li>
            <li>Voting for stars is due to their mom also being happy with these...</li>
            <li>the strands of fiber fell out quickly</li>
            <li>To be expected, I suppose, but would&#x27;ve been nice to be able to rely on all of them.</li>
            <li>thing I do like about them is that the barrette part is clear, so you see the light source at the top, instead of just at the ends.</li>
            <li>The teens, in particular, enjoyed the added attention from the chaser zombies.</li>
            <li>Luckily the one that I did get works.</li>
            <li>They were gone quickly</li>
            <li>These barrettes arrived quickly and packaged so they would not bend or tear.  </li>
            <li>The item arrived quickly and as promised.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because 2 of them did not work at all, but luckily 4 was all that was needed.</li>
            <li>Overall I was very glad to have them.</li>
            <li>THEY LOOK GREAT IN THE DARK.</li>
            <li>They were very pretty in the girls&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li>They are very funny.</li>
            <li>They are bright and can be seen from a long ways off.</li>
            <li>These are a great product for a glow party or anything in the dark.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>thats is very funny</li>
            <li>These are very pretty</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really great for parties, going to clubs or any event where you&#x27;re out in the dark.</li>
            <li>These look cool and are fun to play with at night but the strands fall out .</li>
            <li>They light up well, stay in their hair nice and just make a night out a little more fun.</li>
            <li>:) Unless you steal the batteries, it would be cheaper to just buy a new set of these every time they ran out.</li>
            <li>The girls had a great time using these in our light parade.  </li>
            <li>these are really neat!!</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s easy to get back in</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, the strands from one of the lights came out, and I had to try and super glue it back in, but the super glue absorbed most of the light basically rendering the strands</li>
            <li>A great buy for my kid&#x27;s grow in the dark theme party!</li>
            <li>Great for a little girls sleep over.  </li>
            <li>It gives off a lot of light though and that was the whole purpose.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive but fun for a children&#x27;s gift bag or stocking</li>
            <li>A lot of fun for upcoming parties.  </li>
            <li>Even if you don&#x27;t wear them in your hair, you can always make something fun with them.</li>
            <li>So worth it.</li>
            <li>If you need them to be shorter you can definitely cut them, we made sure to &#x27;layer&#x27; them like you would hair so that the light was spread out.</li>
            <li>These were a lot of fun at my daughter&#x27;s &#x27;Disco Diva Dance Party&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Fun and lasted all day for days</li>
            <li>The kids still had fun with them though.</li>
            <li>but my kids didn&#x27;t have much fun with them</li>
            <li>but it is going to be fun</li>
            <li>so I guess I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Just arrived and they look pretty cool.</li>
            <li>they do just what I hoped they would shimmer and glow, they are fun and have life.</li>
            <li>Adds fun to any costume.  </li>
            <li>Bought these for a one-use, night time, neon color fun run 5k race</li>
            <li>Fun for all ages.</li>
            <li>I ordered 72 of these and only 6 were the flashing kind.</li>
            <li>These lights were sold to kids at an elementary Valentine&#x27;s dance, they all fell apart during a 1 1/2 hour dance, these items were sold as a fundraiser to buy award night at the end of the school year.</li>
            <li>These are cute and fun, but you would need to buy twice as many as you actually need to make sure you have enough unbroken ones to use.</li>
            <li>I know mistakes happen, but I was upset that I didn&#x27;t get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Light up and not flash,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are better products out there for the same price.  </li>
            <li>they are fun to play with and can be used in all sorts of games and recreational pursuits.  </li>
            <li>Fun item for my niece for Christmas.</li>
            <li>These are really fun</li>
            <li>it was fun to ware.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and fun.  </li>
            <li>Favorite gift of a young friend.  </li>
            <li>a lot of fun.  </li>
            <li>get what u pay for fun for one night</li>
            <li>The kids have fun with these</li>
            <li>I purchased these for my daughters sleep-over birthday party thinking that the girls would have fun with them.  </li>
            <li>But the girls enjoyed them and the doubled as unexpected night lights.  </li>
            <li>Get the glow sticks or the pack of multi color foam batons to add some fun.</li>
            <li>Daughter had fun with these on her birthday.</li>
            <li>The girls loved them, as expected.</li>
            <li>The strands are fun</li>
            <li>Fun things...</li>
            <li>Fun product.</li>
            <li>The kids have glam fun</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly and without damage to her absolute delight!</li>
            <li>I see they were originally listed for over 20, I would be very upset</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t very bright, and they didn&#x27;t last long, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>so they blink in the right amount -- nothing too garish.  </li>
            <li>A couple of them didn&#x27;t work and some broke right away.</li>
            <li>two fell apart within 20 minutes - slipped right out of the main/battery clip part.</li>
            <li>Some of them broke right out of the package but most were fine, the batteries lasted a very long time.  </li>
            <li>Overall, very satisfied and considering how much my 4 yr.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-the light source to the fiber optics is bright and awesomely blinky, but the actually fiber is near useless</li>
            <li>Fiberoptics reflected light from main source well even in lighted room.&lt;br /&gt;Great for parties.</li>
            <li>, they are super cute, and definitely worth the low price.</li>
            <li>Overall, they&#x27;re fun and young girls will love them, just don&#x27;t plan on getting much more than one night out of them.</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with how quickly I got them, however when I did open them</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s party, hoping it will be so pretty and fun.</li>
            <li>would rate them lower if I&#x27;d paid more for them, but they are worth the current price, and they are fun.</li>
            <li>they should be packaged straight as many end up uses for hair design as the bends and curves cannot be control as readily as the straight fibers.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly like these, but they are significantly cheaper than the Glowbys.</li>
            <li>but we all wished we could place more hair within the barrette itself and that the shape and design was a little more fancy</li>
            <li>I did not get the right ones in the first place.</li>
            <li>I think if I get to use this for about three occasions in the following months, then I&#x27;ll get more than my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>I bought these previously and just loved them</li>
            <li>I would invest a few more dollars for better quality ones...</li>
            <li>I bought a whole bung thinking they would die really quickly</li>
            <li>Limited to your own imagination.</li>
            <li>old niece waved it around, threw, pulled on it, and overall play time these held up pretty good considering.</li>
            <li>Everyone really got a smile out of these and placed them in their hair right away.  </li>
            <li>you very much</li>
            <li>Still they get about 3 hours of constant light up fun!</li>
            <li>The light up extensions really do look cool, I just wish I could have blended them into my hair a little better.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price can not be beaten by local stores and definitely better than buying from street vendors.  </li>
            <li>Very festive!</li>
            <li>cute for what we needed but the clips are really big</li>
            <li>I love the different colors</li>
            <li>they shipped fast!</li>
            <li>They were exactly what I was wanting.</li>
            <li>This colorful LED-light hair clip is real purty too.</li>
            <li>Looks funny on the girls.  </li>
            <li>They were pretty.</li>
            <li>Really had a lot of fun with these.</li>
            <li>so you have to put several in but can&#x27;t cause the top is to big and bulky for head, also the top blinks so unlike the pic you HAD when I ordered on this item</li>
            <li>I wonder if possible an invention will come out; and be able to see in the day the lights also.</li>
            <li>The Barrette unit is clear plastic and incases the light and 2 batteries.</li>
            <li>Cute while they last.</li>
            <li>We purchased them for my teen&#x27;s bday party, &amp; the kids enjoyed them.</li>
            <li>Only one of the 6 I bought was a dud, but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>They fell apart the first time my grandkids tried to use them.</li>
            <li>They are exactly as they look in the picture.</li>
            <li>When I first got these they came all curled up</li>
            <li>and they lasted several more nights.</li>
            <li>but I knew exactly what I was getting when I ordered them, so no complaints here.</li>
            <li>My daughter got these for christmas (thanks santa!)</li>
            <li>the batteries didn&#x27;t last more than an hour&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought these for my teen grand daughter.</li>
            <li>what more do you need?&lt;br /&gt;cheaper than buying these parts individually at radioshack.</li>
            <li>The others just stay one color and the strands really only look bright/colorful at the top.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>First instead of a barrette type clip they have a toothed spring clip.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Exactly what you see...</li>
            <li>Last complaint is the top section which clips into hair is clear and the led is very bright</li>
            <li>HUGE hit with both boys and girls at a junior high and high school event.  </li>
            <li>The photos are probably of the superior (and more expensive)</li>
            <li>While they did not glow as in the pictured, the flashing lights in the barrette part gave off enough light to be a fun addition to a party.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a good product and it arrived a day early!</li>
            <li>I hot glued two large rhinestones to hide the batteries.</li>
            <li>: The strands themselves barely emit any light,</li>
            <li>Got all the hair lights in the mail pretty fast</li>
            <li>little girl&#x27;s will love them!</li>
            <li>Little girls love everything that glows or sparkles and these meet the requirement!</li>
            <li>My little girl love it!</li>
            <li>I had read reviews on different ones that they break easily and that the clip doesn&#x27;t stay in the hair.</li>
            <li>the entire casing first but leave the switch free.</li>
            <li>other wise the light up is nice a random.  </li>
            <li>The clips are large and obnoxious.</li>
            <li>General fun!</li>
            <li>, one of them didn&#x27;t work from the beginning and the other ones broke easily!</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t stay in fine hair w/o being hooked onto a rubber band or rubber banded in a ponytail.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the kind that the little ball fits into a space.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had to yet, but it&#x27;s a nice feature to have if you want to extend the life of these a little bit longer.</li>
            <li>The little girls, 6 and 3 years old loved them.  </li>
            <li>think the fiber optic hair lights are really great in general, and I usually get lots of compliments on them.</li>
            <li>These were amazing and glow multiple different colors once activated.</li>
            <li>These were very neat for my daughter&#x27;s glow themed party.</li>
            <li>However, They do not clip very well</li>
            <li>they were better than I expected.</li>
            <li>It might slide on straight hair so use hair spray and tease it a bit.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t seem very durable</li>
            <li>Very secured.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really say much.</li>
            <li>I ordered not one but 2 of the 6 pack light up fiber optic lights  and only got 5 per order.  </li>
            <li>Colors change too fast as well.</li>
            <li>The official Glowbys clips are much easier to remove.</li>
            <li>The clip part is so bright that even thick hair won&#x27;t conceal it.</li>
            <li>you so much</li>
            <li>The company was very accommodating about the return.</li>
            <li>They do not flash and out of the 6 pack only 3 of them would light up at all.</li>
            <li>, This company is very misleading on this products description.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plan on having one out to show them so they really understand what they are</li>
            <li>MUCH NEEDED FOR OUR SON&#x27;S DRUMS FOR NIGHT GIGS.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Yes, only the battery part lights up, but the light flows through the strands for total light up.</li>
            <li>We clipped them in for the whole hour</li>
            <li>These are really neat.  </li>
            <li>She is 13 and really loves them.  </li>
            <li>put them on my broom and works really well for Halloween.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Extra light and protection as kids go trick and treating</li>
            <li>I got the 6 pack multi color and they all stayed working for the whole night - 6 hours or so?  </li>
            <li>It looks like the battery can be changed, but after 4 months of light to moderate use, I have not had to change a battery yet.</li>
            <li>fast service and as advertised.</li>
            <li>product was ready to used and came with batteries included and lasted for hours&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very flimsy.</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t show up very well.</li>
            <li>I was really concerned that all of them would work</li>
            <li>its very inexpensive and convenient to dismantle for parts.</li>
            <li>Not only does the fiber optic strands light up but the battery compartment get lit up too.</li>
            <li>Got here fast .</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The fibers fall out a bit too much for my liking.</li>
            <li>but if they wont wear them it is kind of a waste of money.</li>
            <li>and I loved how they changed colors slow and the fast.</li>
            <li>Like some of the other reviews said, the top part is clear and is a little bright.</li>
            <li>They slide right out of your hair and don&#x27;t integrate well for a seamless look.</li>
            <li>The hair clip is cheap, and two or three did fall off during the course of the night, but other than that they were lots of fun.</li>
            <li>Good product but fragile due to the exposed fiber optics.</li>
            <li>I.e. each barrette is not one, constant, unique colour.  </li>
            <li>The hair lights LED are wonderful in the late evening and dark during the day people do not know I am wearing lights.  </li>
            <li>Product Packaging is about a foot long but all six were folded up into three sections to fit into delivery packaging.</li>
            <li>I expected something cheap but instead I received more than I expected.</li>
            <li>The lights were cool cause they changed to different colors but</li>
            <li>what a better way than these hair lights to have her glow in the dark......</li>
            <li>I use them when I go for a walk after dark so that cars can see me better.</li>
            <li>Pretty neat stuff for a young girl to play around with.</li>
            <li>when I narrowed it down to 3 or 4 strategically placed lights it gave a much better effect...</li>
            <li>I feel like packing these in our camping gear so that we can have a sure-fire way of keeping tabs on our kids when the sun goes down :)</li>
            <li>The brightest part is the plastic piece at the top and the lights sort of follow down the fibers.  </li>
            <li>Big hit, not just with my little niece but sister and my mom, everyone not super bright but cute.</li>
            <li>and I am older</li>
            <li>They change constantly, pretty fast, and are generally distracting.</li>
            <li>Luckily we had extras so we could replace them for the 2nd hour.</li>
            <li>string was falling off from the main clip on.&lt;br /&gt;price</li>
            <li>Color was not as vibrant as the picture</li>
            <li>Definitely don&#x27;t stay in hair as they come but could be cool some other way to use or wear them easy to turn on</li>
            <li>High hopes for this product and look forward to playing with them.</li>
            <li>The metal clip on the back of the light looked old compared to the other five in the package and the light was dimmer than the rest.</li>
            <li>Even out of the package, they didn&#x27;t shine brightly and it just got worse as the night wore on.  </li>
            <li>I held my breath as I searched for the remaining battery, hoping, praying really, that my two year old grandson had not swallowed it.</li>
            <li>I think I ordered 6 pkgs and got enough barrettes to supply a party of 14 ladies with 2 each for a night of fun in downtown.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably be buying a few more of them.</li>
            <li>The strands fall out very easy and the lights are not very bright.</li>
            <li>I knew from other reviews that there are not the glowby&#x27;s as picture and was fine with that.  </li>
            <li>I think that my daughters kindergarten teacher would have some strong words for me if I allowed my daughter to wear these to school, but they are fun for wearing around the house, especially when it&#x27;s dark.</li>
            <li>I suggest putting them on the side of your hair instead of on top, otherwise it&#x27;ll stick out from how stiff the plastic strands are.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good comparing to similar products with same quality but more expensive..</li>
            <li>The clip that will clip to hair is very large, will be very obvious unless wearing a curly puff head</li>
            <li>These were pretty neat most stopped working after a few uses which is why I only gave it 3 stars.  </li>
            <li>-1/2 x1/2 inches.(give a little) and the optic strands are steming from it which looks nice when they are on but that big plastic unit kills it!  </li>
            <li>ALSO NEW YEARS EVE PARTY</li>
            <li>Only a tiny amount of light is emitted by</li>
            <li>Worked really well and look cool in the dark.</li>
            <li>Good product, only complaint is one of the lights didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>A nice flashy add on that is always fun for those evening events.</li>
            <li>although if placed in the back of long hair, it looks great in the dark inside, but really shows up well outside!</li>
            <li>Thought I could use these in my photo work, but they seem to be very dim.  </li>
            <li>The white is fine, and the green is fine, I only wish I had not gotten 3 greens.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!  </li>
            <li>With little kids using them the strands fell apart really easy and had to be picked up from all over the floor.</li>
            <li>Some didn&#x27;t light up all the way down the strands.  </li>
            <li>The fibers slip right out of the barrette, and the barrettes are so flimsy they don&#x27;t stay in for long.  </li>
            <li>favor kinda thing for a black light party</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned, the main light is in the hair clip, faint light at the tip of the optical fibers.</li>
            <li>The fibers are to few and fall out easily</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s novel, but one light doesn&#x27;t work, and one light is a little dark.</li>
            <li>This product it cheap and doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>These were a fun addition to my daughters &amp;#34;glow in the dark dance party.&amp;#34; They are easy to use and last a long time.</li>
            <li>They have an on/off switch on the top, so it is easy to access it without taking it out of your hair, but sometimes the switch can be a little stiff to do while still in my hair, so sometimes I find it easier to take it out, flick the switch, and put it back in.</li>
            <li>They just added a little color and light.</li>
            <li>The construction is a little flimsy but  they will be fun as long as they last-the price was right!</li>
            <li>And the part that clips into hair is very bulky and kind of cheesy looking.</li>
            <li>3 of the 6 are clear and not colored.  </li>
            <li>If you could guarantee they would be straight, I will just order another set and send back others.</li>
            <li>I bought these expecting those displayed in the picture, but what I got was far off from it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>an old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>4- and 6-year old girls.  </li>
            <li>and it went to my old address.  </li>
            <li>I bought these as a surprise for my daughter for a party she had (18 year old) and she handed them out to friends to put in their hair.</li>
            <li>used for a party for 9 year old&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>The fiber optic strands were not firmly attached to the barrette.  </li>
            <li>Very upset that I planned and waited for only one to arrive.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Ultimate Gifts and Amazon.</li>
            <li>Purchased for my 7 year old&#x27;s halloween costume this year</li>
            <li>I requested it fixed.</li>
            <li>I will update if it gets fixed to 5 stars...but came from china seller.</li>
            <li>and I could see them from far away.</li>
            <li>As for the product itself:  The colors are very well done especially in darker areas.  </li>
            <li>its for my young child  </li>
            <li>(Please don&#x27;t think you can hide it from the young kids.)</li>
            <li>This causes the fibers to horseshoe and don&#x27;t sit straight for a proper look.</li>
            <li>If looking for a cheap alternative to GLOWBY, one time, few hour use....</li>
            <li>Had a Cosmic Bowling party for 6 year old girl.</li>
            <li>Having a glow in the dark sweet 16</li>
            <li>I have thick hair and put them underneath the top layer and tried to disguise them.</li>
            <li>They are easy to turn on, stay attached, and the lights are small</li>
            <li>Only complaint is that the clip will only close if you put a tiny amount of hair, so it&#x27;s not as easy to attach or as secure as I would like.</li>
            <li>no more no less... works well and is easy to handle.</li>
            <li>So, the idea of these is really cool, but my sister and I got a bunch of these things and some of them wouldn&#x27;t work at all, and some stopped working really fast because the switch would get stuck and you had to press it really hard for it to keep working</li>
            <li>These things are soo much fun, batteries last for a long time.</li>
            <li>These do light up, and work just not to the level in the picture, unless you are in a room just that dark where it is the only thing you will see.</li>
            <li>The blue and the red are soooo pretty.</li>
            <li>(not sure what I was expecting there).It would be better if the Hair clip were stronger to actually hold the thing in the place.  </li>
            <li>very low-quality there rolled up when you get them so they stay rolled up instead of hanging down in your hair very dissatisfied</li>
            <li>Light didn&#x27;t seem to travel down entire strand, as in picture.  </li>
            <li>I love the colored lights in my hair, to bad they fall apart easy.</li>
            <li>I only bought them as cheap decoration for a &#x27;black lite&#x27; Halloween party.</li>
            <li>I actually used these to light up my little girls&#x27; Halloween costumes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like the top pin wasn&#x27;t pushed together hard enough for the lights to function.</li>
            <li>and you won&#x27;t have enough time to try and order new ones.</li>
            <li>Daughter just loves these extra accessories to go with her new led hula hoop</li>
            <li>Not worth returning as the price was right.</li>
            <li>The tips are the only thing that light up and the batteries were dead within a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>These are pretty much the same thing but a few differences.</li>
            <li>First ,I had one missing item kind a irritating</li>
            <li>but if you did not hold the switch the whole time they would shut off like a loose connection.  </li>
            <li>Pretty but not very full.</li>
            <li>They were a fun little product that held up well in some rather horrid conditions.  </li>
            <li>These lights were dull and cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Moreover, we hardly can see any light on hear in rest of hair.</li>
            <li>It looks like a watch battery, and LEDs don&#x27;t use much power, so the batteries should last a long time.</li>
            <li>Shared amongst young girls BIG hit!</li>
            <li>On one of the barrettes, all of the fibers pulled out completely and had to be taped back onto the barrette.</li>
            <li>but it was still pretty in the dark at the tips of it.</li>
            <li>so I tried to straighten the fibers and most of the pieces fell off... not happy with them.  </li>
            <li>I just wish there was a way to turn the clip the opposite way, because I had to put the right side of my head in from the back to the front, and it was harder to clip into my hair.</li>
            <li>My 10 year old granddaughter loves them, bit the barrettes are a little large.  </li>
            <li>Our 6 year old Niece loved them at first, but was a little disappointed at how quickly they broke down.</li>
            <li>These are much cheaper than other brands I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li>They had very vivid colors and last a long time.  </li>
            <li>and they did exactly what I wanted them to do - make me stand out with the rest of my ridiculous outfit with a decent amount of glow.</li>
            <li>bought for night 5K. shows up very well in the dark.</li>
            <li>Out of the other 4, only one didn&#x27;t fall apart when we were putting them gently in.  </li>
            <li>Only weird part was the top clip part is the brightest part, so it doesn&#x27;t blend in naturally with hair (I get it...</li>
            <li>Someone must have barely stepped on it, unaware.</li>
            <li>the strings don&#x27;t go straight down.</li>
            <li>They did the job, they are fiber optic so pretty stiff</li>
            <li>(not a single nor double prong nor alligator clip).  </li>
            <li>Took a very long time to receive direct from China.</li>
            <li>Not bright enough for light painting though.</li>
            <li>You barely bend them wrong at the top where they connect to the battery part and they fall off.  </li>
            <li>the only problem I had and why the lower star rating is that when I first opened a few of them the strands came off.  </li>
            <li>Very dissapointed no color like the pictures came bent in half instead only 2 or 3light  up on clip...</li>
            <li>Light doesn&#x27;t stay on and it&#x27;s very hard to keep it in their hair.</li>
            <li>But in reality, if you wear them into even a generally dark room, as in a high school or college dance or similar, you will not see hat</li>
            <li>Here they show them as &amp;#34;vibrant&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;bright.&amp;#34; In reality, very little light makes it to the end of the fibers, and if you are in a pitch dark room you might get a result close to the pictures.</li>

            <li> This  Light-up fiber optic led hair lights are very amazing, i liked a lot the originaly,</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize there were six to a pack, so they were especially lovely on a full head of hair.</li>
            <li> Incredible considering that they&#x27;re so cheap already.  </li>
            <li> As with these types of things, the strands started to fall out after the first use, but the lights are still bright and make wonderful clips even without the strands.</li>

            <li> easy to use and lots of fun wearing , the price was outstandingly cheap but product is not !!!</li>
            <li> Will have to get more this October as a number of adults wanted them for costuming.</li>
            <li> The package says it brings trial batteries so if using for more than one occasion, look up battery size CR1220.  </li>
            <li> or you&#x27;ll be spending more when your child whines for it during the outing.  </li>
            <li> I am impressed and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> so I ordered more to give to my nieces for their Christmas..</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my grand daughter for her birthday.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure the kids receiving them will love them.  </li>
            <li> the more you seperate the strains the better</li>
            <li> WE GAVE THESE FOR OUR GRAND DAUGHTERS BIRTHDAY PARTY AND</li>
            <li> They are going to love these.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wanted to love these</li>
            <li> most of them.</li>
            <li> but I love them.</li>
            <li> , ok she is 3 y</li>
            <li> unless you are a skilled hair artist.</li>
            <li> They were cute for 10 minutes</li>
            <li> but overall they were great!</li>
            <li> Thought this would be a wonderful gift for the nieces; however, the plastic strands starting coming out</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the purchase</li>
            <li> Do not steal batteries! :)</li>
            <li> She loves them and couldn&#x27;t be happier she has so many for a lower price.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Love it everybody asked me where I got it from...</li>
            <li> Many of them had disconnected strands upon opening the packages.</li>
            <li> Could be made better.</li>
            <li> thats ok.</li>
            <li> Most of them were bent because of the way they were pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> generally, i love these lights...</li>
            <li> but otherwise I love them</li>
            <li> and you can wear them attached to most anything.  </li>
            <li> The barrette itself does light up nicely but the fiber optic strands fall out and I am still finding them all over the place.  </li>
            <li> My girls love and</li>
            <li> Not horrible, but not all they appear to be.</li>
            <li> Helps to use a razor/scissors to cut/scratch up the top to make it brighter.</li>
            <li> the girls will love this.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a worthwhile buy.</li>
            <li> Yes, mostly the barrette portion of the clips provide the most color.</li>
            <li> our granddaughters love things like this, so they will  go  in their Christmas stockings this year for  sure.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making her happy.</li>
            <li> I would buy more or buy again.</li>
            <li> so I assume they have more battery life to use.  </li>
            <li> The  kids  love  these.</li>
            <li> They can be seen in a lighted area, but the darker the area, the better they show up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Glowbys are more $</li>
            <li> I got these for my girls to wear at Halloween and they enjoyed every minute of them.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have ordered more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I gave to the kids and they love it.</li>
            <li> Also they all color change between these colors, not solid colors very awesome for price!</li>
            <li> I had to give it an okay</li>
            <li> but you should know, if you order them you might not get the flashing rainbow and then your awesome outfit will be ruined because blue doesn&#x27;t even go with it</li>
            <li> I had purchased 3 of the 6packs for a total of 18 and all worked perfectly!</li>
            <li> i love it ...</li>
            <li> Sure, they are cute but don&#x27;t take any chances.</li>
            <li> Life is too hectic to stay on top of making sure the babies don&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> Cute for the night, but  immediately started to fall out of them.</li>
            <li> but it was OK because 2 girls didn&#x27;t show up.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found them.</li>
            <li> These were such a great value!</li>
            <li> My girls love them.</li>
            <li> We also had light up rings that were fun because we handed them out, shared them with others, and they were a great icebreaker for meeting people.</li>
            <li> These are bright and lots of fun for the kids to change their color out.</li>
            <li> I would purchase again for sure.</li>
            <li> Needs better execution.</li>
            <li> I am thinking of modifying the ones I have to make them more practical.</li>
            <li> Worked okay for the price.</li>
            <li> There is an on and off switch at the top</li>
            <li> We love Glowbies</li>
            <li> Also the spring clip allows for more mounting options.</li>
            <li> My daughter love them</li>
            <li> Good quality and the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; was just right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with them, they stay in my hair which I was worried about since my hair is fine.</li>
            <li> Very unique.</li>
            <li> got these as gifts and all the girls just love these things, they are pretty bright and all have batteries included.</li>
            <li> My Jr High girls were so happy to get them.</li>
            <li> Super cute!</li>
            <li> My best friends granddaughter upon receiving these immediately put them all in her long hair.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, just clip it where you want it :-)  </li>
            <li> The girls were thrilled with them and they are very pretty, however, the strands kept falling out and ended up all over the floor.</li>
            <li> Excellent for parties, we used them at New Year&#x27;s fireworks and party afterward and my daughters looked so pretty and were the attention of the night.</li>
            <li> The clip part is large, but i think they&#x27;ll be a good music festival addition.</li>
            <li> We clip them things all over now, and they&#x27;re just good clean family fun.</li>
            <li> Very cool.</li>
            <li> almost all of the light comes from the barrette at the top.  </li>
            <li> A great hit for an 11 year old girl.</li>
            <li> The light up optic fiber lights were okay.</li>
            <li> The 1 That does as expected is quite awesome</li>
            <li> These things are like, cheap and are mostly &#x27;blah&#x27;.</li>
            <li> They were super adorable in kids hair, the optic fibers were pretty and bright but the fibers soon fell off the hair clips.</li>
            <li> Other than that they worked perfect.</li>
            <li> The hair braids are easy to clip on.  </li>
            <li> You can turn them on and off easily and batteries are replaceable.  </li>
            <li> Shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> the batteries were easy to replace.</li>
            <li> I dislikes because they fell apart to easy while taking out of the package.</li>
            <li> The optic  fiber lights are easy to come apart.</li>
            <li> the fibers come out easily and now my house is covered in plastic strings</li>
            <li> They were easy to clip into the girl&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> They are battery-operated with an easy on/off switch.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting these, my girls loved them.</li>
            <li> The two that work are pretty nice though.</li>
            <li> THe transaction was easy quick and more than satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fine for the project I have in mind</li>
            <li> Fine for the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for a glow dance at my children&#x27;s elem school and they were super cute for the price.</li>
            <li> Super cute in hair.</li>
            <li> The clip is bright but the strands are very dim.  </li>
            <li> Nice for price but clip too large.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, and every one of them worked well!</li>
            <li> It would be ideal if the fit into the hair a little better</li>
            <li> and she was super excited to receive this!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t light up anywhere near as bright as the photo.  </li>
            <li> things were a HUGE hit among guest.</li>
            <li> But like I said, they were a huge hit.  </li>
            <li> The clips were huge.  </li>
            <li> and this may cause light to stop working or the strands to bend or some fall like one of mine did.  </li>
            <li> These are cheap Globys knock</li>
            <li> others have noted, almost all of the light comes from the barrette, not the strands.  </li>
            <li> They do light up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> but they are for the light effect not for holding hair.</li>
            <li> You can tell they are cheaply made</li>
            <li> They were cheap...</li>
            <li> Glad to see you now have a accurate pic of item, but before Christmas this item was Not as described, this doesn&#x27;t have enough strands in 1 to shine bright</li>
            <li> Clips comfortable in hair.</li>
            <li> ; 5K. I would buy them if you need TEMPORARY light up hair.</li>
            <li> Some are blinking, some are just one color of light.</li>
            <li> both times the product was folded over twice to fit in a box...</li>
            <li> These worked great and were a big hit.</li>
            <li> Cheap and break in one use.  </li>
            <li> Cheap &amp; flimsy, just as I anticipated.  </li>
            <li> Had to cover the bases with electrical tape so that the light didn&#x27;t show through.</li>
            <li> only lol they wanted them too).</li>
            <li> and I am going to enjoy wearing them to the event</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made and it shows</li>
            <li> the colors were nice but they stuck straight out from there head...</li>
            <li> I purchased these light up fiber hair lights for a rave</li>
            <li> They are cheaply made, and I had one break before I ever even used it, because I was trying to figure out how to make it &amp;#34;flash,&amp;#34; as the Amazon description said it would</li>
            <li> (the strands already fell out of the light) and was a hassle to fix.</li>
            <li> Nice sparkle...lasted the whole Justin Bieber Concert.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for cheap decor OR party</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 6 and 8 year old granddaughters to wear to the fair.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely worth it for those light ladies that love things like these.</li>
            <li> Loved them and will def order more for next year.  </li>
            <li> I gave it to the 3 and 5 yr old and they loved them and put multiples in their hair and insisted on shutting off the lights so they could glow.</li>
            <li> and they all worked right away in their many colors.  </li>
            <li> These made our night out very fun.</li>
            <li> This hair item was a HUGE success!</li>
            <li> Each one worked right out of the box, and the bright, vibrant colour flows evenly to the tip of each strand.  </li>
            <li> They barely emit any light from the side, you have to hold them up in the air and look into them for them to be bright.</li>
            <li> Yes it was quick easy and affordable.</li>
            <li> These worked great, which is more than I can say for the other light-up toys we bought for our holiday party!  </li>
            <li> But, the rest were very pretty and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love that these light up and are pretty fun for the girls, but they fall apart so easily.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> they had many colors and they were pretty</li>
            <li> Added to a fun event!  </li>
            <li> Not, completely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> These were lots of fun!</li>
            <li> They were so fun!</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to receiving these, but just wasn&#x27;t excited about them.  </li>
            <li> now we cannot wear them like we originally planned</li>
            <li> With all that long brown hair, it shows great,</li>
            <li> I have ordered many of these barrettes from other companies with great success</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d put in a touch of super glue to secure the glowing stuff.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look like much in the light but are so cool when you are in the dark--the darker the better.</li>
            <li> She still thought she was super cool with light up hair.</li>
            <li> Colors were exactly as stated and they are light weight so easy to keep in hair.</li>
            <li> Nothing too special , no problems.</li>
            <li> The clips are too bulky, it&#x27;s hard to hide the battery compartment with the hair, but the Lights are awesome.</li>
            <li> Super fun!</li>
            <li> It falls apart easily and the batteries and sharp parts are perfect for being swallowed by a young child.</li>
            <li> These things are really cool</li>
            <li> : They&#x27;re much cheaper than authentic Globys.  </li>
            <li> cute I think for city, but not so much for burning man.</li>
            <li> Cheap and fun item to give out as party favors.</li>
            <li> Really cool product would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love all of them thank you so much.</li>
            <li> , it is ok, I thought it would be easier to put in to my child&#x27;s hair, not so much.</li>
            <li> Cool product...</li>
            <li> my daughter is having a sweet 16 and</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really recommend them for more than a one time use.</li>
            <li> The girls of all ages will have fun with these light up strands.  </li>
            <li> 2/6 didn&#x27;t work and the others deteriorated quickly leaving lots of matter out of place to clean up.  </li>
            <li> Wants more for her friends.  </li>
            <li> These are beautiful in the dark.</li>
            <li> but you almost need two to get the full effect,</li>
            <li> In the description &amp;#34;Multicolor Flashing Barette - Rainbow Colors (Alternating Multicolors)&amp;#34; - none of those things are true.</li>
            <li> The girls loved these at the last festival we went to.</li>
            <li> This was a true winner.</li>
            <li> These were given out on the dance floor at a sweet sixteen party.</li>
            <li> got these for my middle daughter she loved them</li>
            <li> I saw some on Amazon for like $4 a five pack which is not bad either.  </li>
            <li> These were the hit of the party, people had fun finding new ways to attach them to their hair, made a nice effect.</li>
            <li> They worked great for our black light party</li>
            <li> Look neat however top needs to be cover by black tape as it is so bright i could distract from fiber optics.</li>
            <li> Bought these to give away to the little girls at a camping weekend trip &amp; they all loved them!</li>
            <li> Also the light strands feel off of one of the clips right away.</li>
            <li> Right now, they are $5.29 with free (Prime) shipping for a 6 pack.</li>
            <li> You need big hair or some kind of barrette or bow to cover the large battery filled top... a hat maybe?</li>
            <li> The long fibers are able to be manipulated very easy and spread apart making it cool to spread throughout your hair or place into a pony tail.  </li>
            <li> Voting for stars is due to their mom also being happy with these...</li>
            <li> the strands of fiber fell out quickly</li>
            <li> To be expected, I suppose, but would&#x27;ve been nice to be able to rely on all of them.</li>
            <li> thing I do like about them is that the barrette part is clear, so you see the light source at the top, instead of just at the ends.</li>
            <li> The teens, in particular, enjoyed the added attention from the chaser zombies.</li>
            <li> Luckily the one that I did get works.</li>
            <li> They were gone quickly</li>
            <li> These barrettes arrived quickly and packaged so they would not bend or tear.  </li>
            <li> The item arrived quickly and as promised.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because 2 of them did not work at all, but luckily 4 was all that was needed.</li>
            <li> Overall I was very glad to have them.</li>
            <li> THEY LOOK GREAT IN THE DARK.</li>
            <li> They were very pretty in the girls&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> They are very funny.</li>
            <li> They are bright and can be seen from a long ways off.</li>
            <li> These are a great product for a glow party or anything in the dark.  </li>
            <li> Very pretty.</li>
            <li> thats is very funny</li>
            <li> These are very pretty</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really great for parties, going to clubs or any event where you&#x27;re out in the dark.</li>
            <li> These look cool and are fun to play with at night but the strands fall out .</li>
            <li> They light up well, stay in their hair nice and just make a night out a little more fun.</li>
            <li> :) Unless you steal the batteries, it would be cheaper to just buy a new set of these every time they ran out.</li>
            <li> The girls had a great time using these in our light parade.  </li>
            <li> these are really neat!!</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s easy to get back in</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, the strands from one of the lights came out, and I had to try and super glue it back in, but the super glue absorbed most of the light basically rendering the strands</li>
            <li> A great buy for my kid&#x27;s grow in the dark theme party!</li>
            <li> Great for a little girls sleep over.  </li>
            <li> It gives off a lot of light though and that was the whole purpose.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive but fun for a children&#x27;s gift bag or stocking</li>
            <li> A lot of fun for upcoming parties.  </li>
            <li> Even if you don&#x27;t wear them in your hair, you can always make something fun with them.</li>
            <li> So worth it.</li>
            <li> If you need them to be shorter you can definitely cut them, we made sure to &#x27;layer&#x27; them like you would hair so that the light was spread out.</li>
            <li> These were a lot of fun at my daughter&#x27;s &#x27;Disco Diva Dance Party&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Fun and lasted all day for days</li>
            <li> The kids still had fun with them though.</li>
            <li> but my kids didn&#x27;t have much fun with them</li>
            <li> but it is going to be fun</li>
            <li> so I guess I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Just arrived and they look pretty cool.</li>
            <li> they do just what I hoped they would shimmer and glow, they are fun and have life.</li>
            <li> Adds fun to any costume.  </li>
            <li> Bought these for a one-use, night time, neon color fun run 5k race</li>
            <li> Fun for all ages.</li>
            <li> I ordered 72 of these and only 6 were the flashing kind.</li>
            <li> These lights were sold to kids at an elementary Valentine&#x27;s dance, they all fell apart during a 1 1/2 hour dance, these items were sold as a fundraiser to buy award night at the end of the school year.</li>
            <li> These are cute and fun, but you would need to buy twice as many as you actually need to make sure you have enough unbroken ones to use.</li>
            <li> I know mistakes happen, but I was upset that I didn&#x27;t get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Light up and not flash,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are better products out there for the same price.  </li>
            <li> they are fun to play with and can be used in all sorts of games and recreational pursuits.  </li>
            <li> Fun item for my niece for Christmas.</li>
            <li> These are really fun</li>
            <li> it was fun to ware.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and fun.  </li>
            <li> Favorite gift of a young friend.  </li>
            <li> a lot of fun.  </li>
            <li> get what u pay for fun for one night</li>
            <li> The kids have fun with these</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my daughters sleep-over birthday party thinking that the girls would have fun with them.  </li>
            <li> But the girls enjoyed them and the doubled as unexpected night lights.  </li>
            <li> Get the glow sticks or the pack of multi color foam batons to add some fun.</li>
            <li> Daughter had fun with these on her birthday.</li>
            <li> The girls loved them, as expected.</li>
            <li> The strands are fun</li>
            <li> Fun things...</li>
            <li> Fun product.</li>
            <li> The kids have glam fun</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly and without damage to her absolute delight!</li>
            <li> I see they were originally listed for over 20, I would be very upset</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t very bright, and they didn&#x27;t last long, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> so they blink in the right amount -- nothing too garish.  </li>
            <li> A couple of them didn&#x27;t work and some broke right away.</li>
            <li> two fell apart within 20 minutes - slipped right out of the main/battery clip part.</li>
            <li> Some of them broke right out of the package but most were fine, the batteries lasted a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Overall, very satisfied and considering how much my 4 yr.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-the light source to the fiber optics is bright and awesomely blinky, but the actually fiber is near useless</li>
            <li> Fiberoptics reflected light from main source well even in lighted room.&lt;br /&gt;Great for parties.</li>
            <li> , they are super cute, and definitely worth the low price.</li>
            <li> Overall, they&#x27;re fun and young girls will love them, just don&#x27;t plan on getting much more than one night out of them.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with how quickly I got them, however when I did open them</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s party, hoping it will be so pretty and fun.</li>
            <li> would rate them lower if I&#x27;d paid more for them, but they are worth the current price, and they are fun.</li>
            <li> they should be packaged straight as many end up uses for hair design as the bends and curves cannot be control as readily as the straight fibers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like these, but they are significantly cheaper than the Glowbys.</li>
            <li> but we all wished we could place more hair within the barrette itself and that the shape and design was a little more fancy</li>
            <li> I did not get the right ones in the first place.</li>
            <li> I think if I get to use this for about three occasions in the following months, then I&#x27;ll get more than my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> I bought these previously and just loved them</li>
            <li> I would invest a few more dollars for better quality ones...</li>
            <li> I bought a whole bung thinking they would die really quickly</li>
            <li> Limited to your own imagination.</li>
            <li> old niece waved it around, threw, pulled on it, and overall play time these held up pretty good considering.</li>
            <li> Everyone really got a smile out of these and placed them in their hair right away.  </li>
            <li> you very much</li>
            <li> Still they get about 3 hours of constant light up fun!</li>
            <li> The light up extensions really do look cool, I just wish I could have blended them into my hair a little better.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price can not be beaten by local stores and definitely better than buying from street vendors.  </li>
            <li> Very festive!</li>
            <li> cute for what we needed but the clips are really big</li>
            <li> I love the different colors</li>
            <li> they shipped fast!</li>
            <li> They were exactly what I was wanting.</li>
            <li> This colorful LED-light hair clip is real purty too.</li>
            <li> Looks funny on the girls.  </li>
            <li> They were pretty.</li>
            <li> Really had a lot of fun with these.</li>
            <li> so you have to put several in but can&#x27;t cause the top is to big and bulky for head, also the top blinks so unlike the pic you HAD when I ordered on this item</li>
            <li> I wonder if possible an invention will come out; and be able to see in the day the lights also.</li>
            <li> The Barrette unit is clear plastic and incases the light and 2 batteries.</li>
            <li> Cute while they last.</li>
            <li> We purchased them for my teen&#x27;s bday party, &amp; the kids enjoyed them.</li>
            <li> Only one of the 6 I bought was a dud, but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> They fell apart the first time my grandkids tried to use them.</li>
            <li> They are exactly as they look in the picture.</li>
            <li> When I first got these they came all curled up</li>
            <li> and they lasted several more nights.</li>
            <li> but I knew exactly what I was getting when I ordered them, so no complaints here.</li>
            <li> My daughter got these for christmas (thanks santa!)</li>
            <li> the batteries didn&#x27;t last more than an hour&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought these for my teen grand daughter.</li>
            <li> what more do you need?&lt;br /&gt;cheaper than buying these parts individually at radioshack.</li>
            <li> The others just stay one color and the strands really only look bright/colorful at the top.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> First instead of a barrette type clip they have a toothed spring clip.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Exactly what you see...</li>
            <li> Last complaint is the top section which clips into hair is clear and the led is very bright</li>
            <li> HUGE hit with both boys and girls at a junior high and high school event.  </li>
            <li> The photos are probably of the superior (and more expensive)</li>
            <li> While they did not glow as in the pictured, the flashing lights in the barrette part gave off enough light to be a fun addition to a party.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s a good product and it arrived a day early!</li>
            <li> I hot glued two large rhinestones to hide the batteries.</li>
            <li> : The strands themselves barely emit any light,</li>
            <li> Got all the hair lights in the mail pretty fast</li>
            <li> little girl&#x27;s will love them!</li>
            <li> Little girls love everything that glows or sparkles and these meet the requirement!</li>
            <li> My little girl love it!</li>
            <li> I had read reviews on different ones that they break easily and that the clip doesn&#x27;t stay in the hair.</li>
            <li> the entire casing first but leave the switch free.</li>
            <li> other wise the light up is nice a random.  </li>
            <li> The clips are large and obnoxious.</li>
            <li> General fun!</li>
            <li> , one of them didn&#x27;t work from the beginning and the other ones broke easily!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay in fine hair w/o being hooked onto a rubber band or rubber banded in a ponytail.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the kind that the little ball fits into a space.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had to yet, but it&#x27;s a nice feature to have if you want to extend the life of these a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> The little girls, 6 and 3 years old loved them.  </li>
            <li> think the fiber optic hair lights are really great in general, and I usually get lots of compliments on them.</li>
            <li> These were amazing and glow multiple different colors once activated.</li>
            <li> These were very neat for my daughter&#x27;s glow themed party.</li>
            <li> However, They do not clip very well</li>
            <li> they were better than I expected.</li>
            <li> It might slide on straight hair so use hair spray and tease it a bit.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t seem very durable</li>
            <li> Very secured.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say much.</li>
            <li> I ordered not one but 2 of the 6 pack light up fiber optic lights  and only got 5 per order.  </li>
            <li> Colors change too fast as well.</li>
            <li> The official Glowbys clips are much easier to remove.</li>
            <li> The clip part is so bright that even thick hair won&#x27;t conceal it.</li>
            <li> you so much</li>
            <li> The company was very accommodating about the return.</li>
            <li> They do not flash and out of the 6 pack only 3 of them would light up at all.</li>
            <li> , This company is very misleading on this products description.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plan on having one out to show them so they really understand what they are</li>
            <li> MUCH NEEDED FOR OUR SON&#x27;S DRUMS FOR NIGHT GIGS.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Yes, only the battery part lights up, but the light flows through the strands for total light up.</li>
            <li> We clipped them in for the whole hour</li>
            <li> These are really neat.  </li>
            <li> She is 13 and really loves them.  </li>
            <li> put them on my broom and works really well for Halloween.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Extra light and protection as kids go trick and treating</li>
            <li> I got the 6 pack multi color and they all stayed working for the whole night - 6 hours or so?  </li>
            <li> It looks like the battery can be changed, but after 4 months of light to moderate use, I have not had to change a battery yet.</li>
            <li> fast service and as advertised.</li>
            <li> product was ready to used and came with batteries included and lasted for hours&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very flimsy.</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t show up very well.</li>
            <li> I was really concerned that all of them would work</li>
            <li> its very inexpensive and convenient to dismantle for parts.</li>
            <li> Not only does the fiber optic strands light up but the battery compartment get lit up too.</li>
            <li> Got here fast .</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The fibers fall out a bit too much for my liking.</li>
            <li> but if they wont wear them it is kind of a waste of money.</li>
            <li> and I loved how they changed colors slow and the fast.</li>
            <li> Like some of the other reviews said, the top part is clear and is a little bright.</li>
            <li> They slide right out of your hair and don&#x27;t integrate well for a seamless look.</li>
            <li> The hair clip is cheap, and two or three did fall off during the course of the night, but other than that they were lots of fun.</li>
            <li> Good product but fragile due to the exposed fiber optics.</li>
            <li> I.e. each barrette is not one, constant, unique colour.  </li>
            <li> The hair lights LED are wonderful in the late evening and dark during the day people do not know I am wearing lights.  </li>
            <li> Product Packaging is about a foot long but all six were folded up into three sections to fit into delivery packaging.</li>
            <li> I expected something cheap but instead I received more than I expected.</li>
            <li> The lights were cool cause they changed to different colors but</li>
            <li> what a better way than these hair lights to have her glow in the dark......</li>
            <li> I use them when I go for a walk after dark so that cars can see me better.</li>
            <li> Pretty neat stuff for a young girl to play around with.</li>
            <li> when I narrowed it down to 3 or 4 strategically placed lights it gave a much better effect...</li>
            <li> I feel like packing these in our camping gear so that we can have a sure-fire way of keeping tabs on our kids when the sun goes down :)</li>
            <li> The brightest part is the plastic piece at the top and the lights sort of follow down the fibers.  </li>
            <li> Big hit, not just with my little niece but sister and my mom, everyone not super bright but cute.</li>
            <li> and I am older</li>
            <li> They change constantly, pretty fast, and are generally distracting.</li>
            <li> Luckily we had extras so we could replace them for the 2nd hour.</li>
            <li> string was falling off from the main clip on.&lt;br /&gt;price</li>
            <li> Color was not as vibrant as the picture</li>
            <li> Definitely don&#x27;t stay in hair as they come but could be cool some other way to use or wear them easy to turn on</li>
            <li> High hopes for this product and look forward to playing with them.</li>
            <li> The metal clip on the back of the light looked old compared to the other five in the package and the light was dimmer than the rest.</li>
            <li> Even out of the package, they didn&#x27;t shine brightly and it just got worse as the night wore on.  </li>
            <li> I held my breath as I searched for the remaining battery, hoping, praying really, that my two year old grandson had not swallowed it.</li>
            <li> I think I ordered 6 pkgs and got enough barrettes to supply a party of 14 ladies with 2 each for a night of fun in downtown.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably be buying a few more of them.</li>
            <li> The strands fall out very easy and the lights are not very bright.</li>
            <li> I knew from other reviews that there are not the glowby&#x27;s as picture and was fine with that.  </li>
            <li> I think that my daughters kindergarten teacher would have some strong words for me if I allowed my daughter to wear these to school, but they are fun for wearing around the house, especially when it&#x27;s dark.</li>
            <li> I suggest putting them on the side of your hair instead of on top, otherwise it&#x27;ll stick out from how stiff the plastic strands are.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good comparing to similar products with same quality but more expensive..</li>
            <li> The clip that will clip to hair is very large, will be very obvious unless wearing a curly puff head</li>
            <li> These were pretty neat most stopped working after a few uses which is why I only gave it 3 stars.  </li>
            <li> -1/2 x1/2 inches.(give a little) and the optic strands are steming from it which looks nice when they are on but that big plastic unit kills it!  </li>
            <li> ALSO NEW YEARS EVE PARTY</li>
            <li> Only a tiny amount of light is emitted by</li>
            <li> Worked really well and look cool in the dark.</li>
            <li> Good product, only complaint is one of the lights didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> A nice flashy add on that is always fun for those evening events.</li>
            <li> although if placed in the back of long hair, it looks great in the dark inside, but really shows up well outside!</li>
            <li> Thought I could use these in my photo work, but they seem to be very dim.  </li>
            <li> The white is fine, and the green is fine, I only wish I had not gotten 3 greens.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money!  </li>
            <li> With little kids using them the strands fell apart really easy and had to be picked up from all over the floor.</li>
            <li> Some didn&#x27;t light up all the way down the strands.  </li>
            <li> The fibers slip right out of the barrette, and the barrettes are so flimsy they don&#x27;t stay in for long.  </li>
            <li> favor kinda thing for a black light party</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, the main light is in the hair clip, faint light at the tip of the optical fibers.</li>
            <li> The fibers are to few and fall out easily</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s novel, but one light doesn&#x27;t work, and one light is a little dark.</li>
            <li> This product it cheap and doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> These were a fun addition to my daughters &amp;#34;glow in the dark dance party.&amp;#34; They are easy to use and last a long time.</li>
            <li> They have an on/off switch on the top, so it is easy to access it without taking it out of your hair, but sometimes the switch can be a little stiff to do while still in my hair, so sometimes I find it easier to take it out, flick the switch, and put it back in.</li>
            <li> They just added a little color and light.</li>
            <li> The construction is a little flimsy but  they will be fun as long as they last-the price was right!</li>
            <li> And the part that clips into hair is very bulky and kind of cheesy looking.</li>
            <li> 3 of the 6 are clear and not colored.  </li>
            <li> If you could guarantee they would be straight, I will just order another set and send back others.</li>
            <li> I bought these expecting those displayed in the picture, but what I got was far off from it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> an old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 4- and 6-year old girls.  </li>
            <li> and it went to my old address.  </li>
            <li> I bought these as a surprise for my daughter for a party she had (18 year old) and she handed them out to friends to put in their hair.</li>
            <li> used for a party for 9 year old&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> The fiber optic strands were not firmly attached to the barrette.  </li>
            <li> Very upset that I planned and waited for only one to arrive.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Ultimate Gifts and Amazon.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my 7 year old&#x27;s halloween costume this year</li>
            <li> I requested it fixed.</li>
            <li> I will update if it gets fixed to 5 stars...but came from china seller.</li>
            <li> and I could see them from far away.</li>
            <li> As for the product itself:  The colors are very well done especially in darker areas.  </li>
            <li> its for my young child  </li>
            <li> (Please don&#x27;t think you can hide it from the young kids.)</li>
            <li> This causes the fibers to horseshoe and don&#x27;t sit straight for a proper look.</li>
            <li> If looking for a cheap alternative to GLOWBY, one time, few hour use....</li>
            <li> Had a Cosmic Bowling party for 6 year old girl.</li>
            <li> Having a glow in the dark sweet 16</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and put them underneath the top layer and tried to disguise them.</li>
            <li> They are easy to turn on, stay attached, and the lights are small</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that the clip will only close if you put a tiny amount of hair, so it&#x27;s not as easy to attach or as secure as I would like.</li>
            <li> no more no less... works well and is easy to handle.</li>
            <li> So, the idea of these is really cool, but my sister and I got a bunch of these things and some of them wouldn&#x27;t work at all, and some stopped working really fast because the switch would get stuck and you had to press it really hard for it to keep working</li>
            <li> These things are soo much fun, batteries last for a long time.</li>
            <li> These do light up, and work just not to the level in the picture, unless you are in a room just that dark where it is the only thing you will see.</li>
            <li> The blue and the red are soooo pretty.</li>
            <li> (not sure what I was expecting there).It would be better if the Hair clip were stronger to actually hold the thing in the place.  </li>
            <li> very low-quality there rolled up when you get them so they stay rolled up instead of hanging down in your hair very dissatisfied</li>
            <li> Light didn&#x27;t seem to travel down entire strand, as in picture.  </li>
            <li> I love the colored lights in my hair, to bad they fall apart easy.</li>
            <li> I only bought them as cheap decoration for a &#x27;black lite&#x27; Halloween party.</li>
            <li> I actually used these to light up my little girls&#x27; Halloween costumes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like the top pin wasn&#x27;t pushed together hard enough for the lights to function.</li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t have enough time to try and order new ones.</li>
            <li> Daughter just loves these extra accessories to go with her new led hula hoop</li>
            <li> Not worth returning as the price was right.</li>
            <li> The tips are the only thing that light up and the batteries were dead within a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> These are pretty much the same thing but a few differences.</li>
            <li> First ,I had one missing item kind a irritating</li>
            <li> but if you did not hold the switch the whole time they would shut off like a loose connection.  </li>
            <li> Pretty but not very full.</li>
            <li> They were a fun little product that held up well in some rather horrid conditions.  </li>
            <li> These lights were dull and cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> Moreover, we hardly can see any light on hear in rest of hair.</li>
            <li> It looks like a watch battery, and LEDs don&#x27;t use much power, so the batteries should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Shared amongst young girls BIG hit!</li>
            <li> On one of the barrettes, all of the fibers pulled out completely and had to be taped back onto the barrette.</li>
            <li> but it was still pretty in the dark at the tips of it.</li>
            <li> so I tried to straighten the fibers and most of the pieces fell off... not happy with them.  </li>
            <li> I just wish there was a way to turn the clip the opposite way, because I had to put the right side of my head in from the back to the front, and it was harder to clip into my hair.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old granddaughter loves them, bit the barrettes are a little large.  </li>
            <li> Our 6 year old Niece loved them at first, but was a little disappointed at how quickly they broke down.</li>
            <li> These are much cheaper than other brands I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li> They had very vivid colors and last a long time.  </li>
            <li> and they did exactly what I wanted them to do - make me stand out with the rest of my ridiculous outfit with a decent amount of glow.</li>
            <li> bought for night 5K. shows up very well in the dark.</li>
            <li> Out of the other 4, only one didn&#x27;t fall apart when we were putting them gently in.  </li>
            <li> Only weird part was the top clip part is the brightest part, so it doesn&#x27;t blend in naturally with hair (I get it...</li>
            <li> Someone must have barely stepped on it, unaware.</li>
            <li> the strings don&#x27;t go straight down.</li>
            <li> They did the job, they are fiber optic so pretty stiff</li>
            <li> (not a single nor double prong nor alligator clip).  </li>
            <li> Took a very long time to receive direct from China.</li>
            <li> Not bright enough for light painting though.</li>
            <li> You barely bend them wrong at the top where they connect to the battery part and they fall off.  </li>
            <li> the only problem I had and why the lower star rating is that when I first opened a few of them the strands came off.  </li>
            <li> Very dissapointed no color like the pictures came bent in half instead only 2 or 3light  up on clip...</li>
            <li> Light doesn&#x27;t stay on and it&#x27;s very hard to keep it in their hair.</li>
            <li> But in reality, if you wear them into even a generally dark room, as in a high school or college dance or similar, you will not see hat</li>
            <li> Here they show them as &amp;#34;vibrant&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;bright.&amp;#34; In reality, very little light makes it to the end of the fibers, and if you are in a pitch dark room you might get a result close to the pictures.</li>
            <li> The clips are kind of big (which is totally understandable, I mean, they have to power the light from somewhere, considering it&#x27;s a freaking battery pack on your head, they&#x27;re not that bad)</li>
            <li> Material should have been black or dark so light just transmits down optics for proper visual.</li>
            <li> The barrettes are also pretty ugly, even though they light up.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t going to hold up to the average young girl&#x27;s activity, and they fell apart shortly after opening.  </li>
            <li> Some reviews state that they don&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> This is just a flat out lie not an oversight.</li>
            <li> long story short, dont buy this product.</li>
            <li> Anyways to make a long story short, thankfully there were 6 pieces because when one girl seen my daughters they all had to have one.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t care how long they last!</li>
            <li> The batteries should last a long time being that they are the CR2032 type batteries.  </li>
            <li> Down side is that you have to be a little careful when moving the long strands, make sure you don&#x27;t pull downward to hard or the filaments will disconnect from the barrette, as we found out with the 4 yr old.  </li>
            <li> and they last a long time!  </li>
            <li> One arrived broken, amazon customer service was quick to credit me.</li>
            <li> Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the bottom fiber optic part can come loose</li>
            <li> If there are children under 4 in the household, absolutely do not buy this product or send it home to other families with young kids.</li>
            <li> While they will not tuck into your hair as well or hide in hair as well as Glowbies we think they will last longer due to larger batteries.</li>
            <li> Little girls and old men and everyone in between wore them.</li>
            <li> They were out of these flash braids, so the mother company went to the trouble of shipping them to me directly from&lt;br /&gt;China with no shipping charge.  </li>
            <li> As long as you turn the switch off</li>
            <li> and I get harder than Chinese Algebra.</li>
            <li> The back of the clip (with the spring) keeps grabbing my hair and requires careful untangling before I can remove it.</li>
            <li> Some of the optic led hair lights did not lasted so long.</li>
            <li> Not professional Crafted</li>
            <li> Batteries lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> The barrette itself was neat because it changed colors along with the long filaments</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> In face so long that I still haven&#x27;t worn mine out yet.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old niece spent a half an hour twirling in front of the mirror mesmorized by the</li>
            <li> Every single strand was bent when I opened the package and the packaging looked cheap and cheesy.</li>
            <li> They are not as pictured, but rather a tight thin strand of fiber optic that I feel still emits a lot of light but not flared out like is shown.</li>
            <li> Only 2/6 of these arrived functioning and the other 4 had to be trashed.</li>
            <li> Got 1 green, 2 red and 3 white color lights in the pack of 6.</li>
            <li> The others will be receiving theirs in the next few days and I have no doubt they will be a big hit also!</li>
            <li> The ones that come with them only last a few hours.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 packs of 6 each, and every single one of them worked.</li>
            <li> They did a treasure hunt in the dark outside</li>
            <li> in all, these were a big let down</li>
            <li> Clips hold firmly &amp; batteries last a long time.</li>
            <li> so they would at least add some glow color to the table (after the girls ripped them out of their hair because the only thing barely hanging on were the clips- no strands).</li>
            <li> the battery pack is very heavy and very big causing them to slide out of the hair once you actually get them to clip&lt;</li>
            <li> Every single person at our mardi gras ball refer about my hair!  </li>
            <li> Disappointed... Got all one color, and they fall apart very easy...</li>
            <li> Little tiny on off switch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to figure out how to change the batteries though to make them last a little longer.</li>
            <li> It ended up under the sofa where the clear plastic part was sticking out and hard to see at all.</li>
            <li> There is no way to lock them to a single color or keep them from flashing, other than by turning them</li>
            <li> The only thing wrong is they will not clip onto much hair</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not very inconspicuous, even if you put it under the hair</li>
            <li> Item was just as I expected</li>
            <li> The thing is, there are 5 transparent and 1 pink color of optics.</li>
            <li> I expected all to be.</li>
            <li> They work , just not very well.</li>
            <li> The glow strands themselves are so heavy and not secured well enough into the clip that they just fell out.  </li>
            <li> So you have to be careful.  </li>
            <li> Plain and simple.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately less than half of them actually worked.</li>
            <li> The big bulky clip is fine because it also glows like crazy!</li>
            <li> The fiber optic strands arrived all bent due to packaging.</li>
            <li> but I used them for other things besides hair.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t return due to shipping cost.</li>
            <li> you definitely get what you pay for :/</li>
            <li> the other 19 were all one color and non-flashing.  </li>
            <li> but I am looking for other ways to use them besides on a head.</li>
            <li> the other two would go on and off and</li>
            <li> I put them in my daughters hair for a concert and the battery end piece lit up brighter than the actual &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; which became difficult to hide in her hair because she is young.</li>
            <li> really cheap and nasty 50% of the items didnt work, very dissapointing for halloween</li>
            <li> the clip on part is really big and hard to hide.</li>
            <li> Keep shopping around these are not worth anything.</li>
            <li> they worked well in a dark room.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a glow in the dark turbo kick class.</li>
            <li> But I would recommend these for any glow in the dark party.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m suppose to be using them in a glow in the dark race with my daughter tomorrow</li>
            <li> then they flash, then go back slowly, then flash.</li>
            <li> So now I got to try to slowly bend them back in place.</li>
            <li> The only problem was they were bent since the package was folded in the envelope So not very happy about that.</li>
            <li> You could see the girls down the street the colors stood out so well.</li>
            <li> They helped us find each other!</li>
            <li> When I opened the box these came in, the individual bags were torn and some pieces were loose and broken.  </li>
            <li> I found one battery and two very sharp parts on the floor and almost had a heart attack.</li>
            <li> all of them were bent in half.  </li>
            <li> Half of My order did not work.</li>
            <li> They came bent in half in the packaging &amp; when you try to straighten out they fall apart.</li>
            <li> When the package arrived the hair lights were stuffed in the package bent in half and there is no way to straighten them.  </li>
            <li> The clip is difficult and the strands do not light up evenly or very</li>
            <li> They gave me the wrong product, it only glowed blue and I submitted a request to return it and get the rainbow flashing ones, they refunded my money &amp; had me keep these</li>
            <li> Half were damaged.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat disappointed in the red color as it was not as pretty as the others.</li>
            <li> Out of the 6 that came in the package they were all green and 2 didn&#x27;t work other then a little flutter.  </li>
            <li> the barrette portion is bigger than I expected and hard to hide even in thick hair.</li>
            <li> The parents were upset and wanted their money back due to poor quality as the fibre optic strands just fell out.  </li>
            <li> I can clip these things everywhere, but they&#x27;re too heavy to hold themselves upside down</li>
            <li> There is few color down the fiber optic &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> When my wife wore them in her hair, it stuck out in the air and then came straight down in a really awkward fashion.</li>
            <li> work for a little while then will not turn off</li>
            <li> My daughter adored them as well as her little cousin.</li>
            <li> She gets to pretendin that she&#x27;s like a My Little Pony</li>
            <li> The snap on them will not hold if you put verymuch hair in it which is why I decrease the rating a little.</li>
            <li> They still stuck out a little.</li>
            <li> They stay in your hair, but they don&#x27;t look &amp;#34;nice.&amp;#34; The fiber optic lights change colors, but I wish they were a little brighter to make them easier to see.</li>
            <li> It is a little sparse, so I used two together clipped onto one another and it&lt;</li>
            <li> the clip is a little hard/rough though</li>
            <li> As excited as the girls were to get them they were so disappointed and didn&#x27;t end up using them...waste of money unless they find a way to send them without bending the fibers....</li>
            <li> The pic is a little inaccurate.</li>
            <li> I am finding little plastic pieces all over the house.  </li>
            <li> What little girl wouldn&#x27;t loves these.</li>
            <li> Nothing a little electrical tape couldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> Beware, the little plastic prickle things come out sometimes.</li>
            <li> needs to be very dark to see the lights and colors.  </li>
            <li> My on,y complaint is the battery pack that is attached to the clip part is quite large and was difficult to hide in my hair</li>
            <li> A few of the strands fell off but it is what it is.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, out of the package, one of the six was basically dead on arrival.</li>
            <li> I tried to fill a wig with them and it just looked messy....</li>
            <li> Product does not light up as shown or even at all.</li>
            <li> I  received all green.  </li>
            <li> JUST A WASTE OF MY MONEY.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> waste of $$, consider another product</li>
            <li> The lights were green and stayed lit (did not blink or flash).  </li>
            <li> They were also all green and did not change colors</li>
            <li> but battery was missing</li>
            <li> One of six did not light up.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I bought them for a Zumba glow party and handed out to a few of the peeps.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re too heavy to stay in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time</li>
            <li> Lying them under heavy books for a day had no improvement.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money</li>
            <li> So, I can&#x27;t say I hate them because because it&#x27;s like they gave me free stuff</li>
            <li> The base (light source, where the switch and battery are) are brighter than the strands.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this, again.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> (We ordered a few packs.)</li>
            <li> Photo is not accurate, the strands do not illuminate like others have stated.</li>
            <li> Mine were bent in half in a small envelope and even after sitting a book on them for a day they are still bent at a 45 degree angle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s huge &amp; impossible to hide in between the strands of your hair, weave or wig!</li>
            <li> Not easy fix.</li>
            <li> sucks you cant put it in your hair and if u have hair like mine long, wavy, thick hair</li>
            <li> Not cool!</li>
            <li> these are pretty when they do work, but couldn&#x27;t use half of the barrettes I bought :(  </li>
            <li> Finally they are less expensive than Glowbies.</li>
            <li> I wish the clip in your hair part wasn&#x27;t so heavy because it tends to pull on my 3-year-olds hair a little too hard.</li>
            <li> They felt like little Rick star divas!</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re LED fake hair and are never going to look natural, but you know what I mean.)  </li>
            <li> A little hard to clip</li>
            <li> They are right for the price, but it does kinda sick because that slowly change colors</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see this product lasting long however for the price that I paid it wasn&#x27;t a bad deal</li>
            <li> got it in mail so late that I forgot bout it, and when I did get it, it was bent out of shape waste of time and money...</li>
            <li> I turned them on to test them and some blinked as they were supposed to, others blinked once and  no more or not at all.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got short hair and want something really flashy (literally), these might work for you.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Not really sure how to straighten it.</li>
            <li> The thin fiber optics do break off at times so store carefully</li>
            <li> and I would not give to a small child.</li>
            <li> They are very stiff, and they aren&#x27;t usable.  </li>
            <li> the fiber optics come out very easily , not meant For dancing</li>
            <li> but I had a hard time attaching/clipping them onto my hair.</li>
            <li> Have to repeatedly push the on button hard to stay on almost snapping it.</li>
            <li> and I can hardly wait to use it for the purpose I bought it for,</li>
            <li> We used these for a glow in the dark Easter egg hunt and they were a HIT with the girls!!!</li>
            <li> They complained the piece that attaches to the air is too bulky.  </li>
            <li> They are a silly novelty item, but not really very practical for every day use.</li>
            <li> They and their friends played late into the night.</li>
            <li> but the quality sucks</li>
            <li> The switches were not great quality and the barrette was so heavy it did not stay put in hair.</li>
            <li> Expect a ridiculous delay in getting your product.  </li>
            <li> so if you have thin hair they could be hard to hide.</li>
            <li> This left bad creases in the fiber optics which can&#x27;t be removed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was disappointed that in my &amp;#34;multicolor&amp;#34; pack, half of them were green.</li>
            <li> The hair clip is weak and the power pack is on the heavier side.</li>
            <li> but the quality was poor.</li>
            <li> we are not happy with the product.</li>
            <li> These barrettes are poorly made.  </li>
            <li> A rather poor product.</li>
            <li> for a refund if not happy.</li>
            <li> downside is out of package one was broken</li>
            <li> /&gt;-the plastic was already broken in the 4th package that I looked at&lt;br</li>
            <li> wires are broken up to look at</li>
            <li> The clip for these is really annoying for long hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, probably a quarter of them were broken.  </li>
            <li> So, if you&#x27;re determined to have flashing and multi-colors, you might be a little disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Unbelievable!!!  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I will be returning them.</li>
            <li> I think I put in the wrong address</li>

            <li> Unfortunately, some didn&#x27;t work.  </li>

            <li> These were very neat for my daughter&#x27;s glow themed party. Very unique. However, They do not clip very well and she lost two by the end of the night.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed no color like the pictures came bent in half instead only 2 or 3light  up on clip...</li>
            <li> Probably a good item but shipper folded each one which bends the wires and they cannot be straightened.</li>
            <li> got it in mail so late that I forgot bout it, and when I did get it, it was bent out of shape waste of time and money... I want my damn MONEY BACK</li>
            <li> Bought them for my daughter as an accessory to her Katy Perry costume...they were better than I expected. Worth the money!</li>
            <li> my daughter loves these</li>
            <li> Inexpensive but fun for a children&#x27;s gift bag or stocking</li>
            <li> At my sons 10th birthday party everyone got something that lit up.  For the girls these lights were a hit.  Will have to get more this October as a number of adults wanted them for costuming. My 3 year old niece spent a half an hour twirling in front of the mirror mesmorized by the</li>
            <li> grand daughter loved these</li>
            <li> Excellent for parties, we used them at New Year&#x27;s fireworks and party afterward and my daughters looked so pretty and were the attention of the night.</li>
            <li> We used these for a bachelorette party, everybody loved them!!! They are so much fun!!! Sixteen year olds all the way to 40 year olds used them and loved them!!</li>
            <li> all of them were bent in half.  folded even the cardboard.  The batteries work tho.  but I want to exchange them for straightened out ones, but I don&#x27;t trust the manufacturer.  they should be TAPED in place.  I need them for my granddaughters b.d. by may l0 2015.  What am I doing now?  What am I supposed to do?  If you could guarantee they would be straight, I will just order another set and send back others.</li>
            <li> These lights were dull and cheaply made.  Even out of the package, they didn&#x27;t shine brightly and it just got worse as the night wore on.  I&#x27;ll try another brand next time I choose to buy.</li>
            <li> work for a little while then will not turn off</li>
            <li> Keep shopping around these are not worth anything.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my children to use during Fourth of July!  Amazon&#x27;s price can not be beaten by local stores and definitely better than buying from street vendors.  A few of the strands fell off but it is what it is.  This is an inexpensive product that lights up and does the work.  The children were very happy.  I would recommend using it as is as strands.  I saw some videos of people using two of them around a bun and this may cause light to stop working or the strands to bend or some fall like one of mine did.  Some reviews state that they don&#x27;t last long.  The package says it brings trial batteries so if using for more than one occasion, look up battery size CR1220.  I saw some on Amazon for like $4 a five pack which is not bad either.  I think if I get to use this for about three occasions in the following months, then I&#x27;ll get more than my money&#x27;s worth.  Also, the clip is a bit on the big side but it lights up too which is a pro.  The clip part is like a barrette clip.  It&#x27;s the kind that the little ball fits into a space. (not a single nor double prong nor alligator clip).  It might slide on straight hair so use hair spray and tease it a bit. The lights switch from color to color which some may not want.  Don&#x27;t think about it twice or you&#x27;ll be spending more when your child whines for it during the outing.  Hope my review helps.</li>
            <li> Ordered these for a one time use on 4th of july.  One would not work at all, four of them would turn on but if you did not hold the switch the whole time they would shut off like a loose connection.  One worked like it should.  I would not purchase these again.</li>
            <li> Some didn&#x27;t work. The fibers came off. And the glue holding the battery and chip came apart</li>
            <li> They were out of these flash braids, so the mother company went to the trouble of shipping them to me directly from&lt;br /&gt;China with no shipping charge.  Incredible considering that they&#x27;re so cheap already.  The hair braids are easy to clip on.  You can turn them on and off easily and batteries are replaceable.  A lot of fun for upcoming parties.  Girls love them!</li>
            <li> These things are really cool but the filaments come out of the clip thingie. Sure, it&#x27;s easy to get back in so it&#x27;s not that big of a deal. I&#x27;d buy them again but I&#x27;d put in a touch of super glue to secure the glowing stuff.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved these.  Very festive!</li>
            <li> Half of My order did not work. I turned them on to test them and some blinked as they were supposed to, others blinked once and  no more or not at all.</li>
            <li> cute for what we needed but the clips are really big so it&#x27;s not very inconspicuous, even if you put it under the hair</li>
            <li> These worked well for a bachelorette party. They&#x27;d work equally well, I imagine, for a children&#x27;s birthday party where part of the event included turning the lights out and dancing.</li>
            <li> These look cool and are fun to play with at night but the strands fall out . I have found them all over the place.</li>
            <li> I used these for a Halloween party and I would say for the colors combined with price I am impressed and will definitely purchase again. As long as you turn the switch off and YES it has an on/off switch another added plus, it will last I still have the same ones from the Halloween party last October!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t base your purchase on the product photos.  The photos are probably of the superior (and more expensive) Globys.  These are cheap Globys knock offs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have noted, almost all of the light comes from the barrette, not the strands.  The strands do not look anything like the product photos. Only a tiny amount of light is emitted by the strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also note that they continually flash and change colors.  There is no way to lock them to a single color or keep them from flashing, other than by turning them off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: They&#x27;re much cheaper than authentic Globys.  They do light up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The strands themselves barely emit any light, almost all of the light comes from the barrette at the top.  So they&#x27;re really just a flashing LED barrette with a few fiber strands attached.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t seem very durable</li>
            <li> I ordered these for the 5K Glo Run.  They worked great.  They stayed in our hair the entire run.  Very secured.</li>
            <li> These worked great, which is more than I can say for the other light-up toys we bought for our holiday party!  Very pretty, and every one of them worked well!</li>
            <li> cute I think for city, but not so much for burning man. I will try wearing them out to a bar</li>
            <li> Love these!  I put in my hair for my birthday.  They stayed lit all night.</li>
            <li> I bought these expecting those displayed in the picture, but what I got was far off from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, out of the package, one of the six was basically dead on arrival. The metal clip on the back of the light looked old compared to the other five in the package and the light was dimmer than the rest. It was obvious that I was shipped an old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the strands from one of the lights came out, and I had to try and super glue it back in, but the super glue absorbed most of the light basically rendering the strands useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the strands light up poorly even when they seem to be working correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re trying to impress a child, these will work.</li>
            <li> Nice - Delivered on time - Perfect for my party!</li>
            <li> Shared amongst young girls BIG hit!</li>
            <li> Sparkle Lights!&lt;br /&gt;The little girl&#x27;s will love them!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 6 and 8 year old granddaughters to wear to the fair.  They loved them and got so many comments.</li>
            <li> It was purchased as a gift. I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints. Can&#x27;t really say much. No personal experience.</li>
            <li> I love them! Such a deal.</li>
            <li> the barrette portion is bigger than I expected and hard to hide even in thick hair. The fiber optic strands arrived all bent due to packaging.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s novel, but one light doesn&#x27;t work, and one light is a little dark.</li>
            <li> As the advertisement show there are suppose to be 6 in the pack.  I ordered not one but 2 of the 6 pack light up fiber optic lights  and only got 5 per order.  This is just a flat out lie not an oversight.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a halloween party.  Some of them broke right out of the package but most were fine, the batteries lasted a very long time.  I would buy them again if I had such a need.</li>
            <li> These are great, fun pieces to wear anytime and anywhere!  I love the different colors and they last a long time!  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Nice for price but clip too large. Colors change too fast as well.</li>
            <li> I love these. They all work perfect and the look cute in your hair. Even if you don&#x27;t wear them in your hair, you can always make something fun with them. Great deal and they shipped fast!</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t stay in my hair very well, but looked great attached to every piece of clothing I own.</li>
            <li> works great thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Bright LED lights and work well.  Big hit for birthday parties.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth it for those light ladies that love things like these. My daughter adored them as well as her little cousin. So worth it.</li>
            <li> They were exactly what I was wanting. The lights continued to work throughout the night. Shipped very quickly. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought these previously and just loved them so I ordered more to give to my nieces for their Christmas..</li>
            <li> Arrived as described, all pieces individually wrapped. As with these types of things, the strands started to fall out after the first use, but the lights are still bright and make wonderful clips even without the strands.</li>
            <li> the strands of fiber fell out quickly</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my grand daughter for her birthday. They arrived quickly and without damage to her absolute delight! A great hit for an 11 year old girl.</li>
            <li> Thought these looked really good for stocking stuffers and I&#x27;m sure the kids receiving them will love them.  The only thing wrong is they will not clip onto much hair but they are for the light effect not for holding hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my 7 year old granddaughter she loves them</li>
            <li> they worked well in a dark room. the more you seperate the strains the better it looks...</li>
            <li> First ,I had one missing item kind a irritating so I contact Amazon.com , respond was great. Product I order Light up fiber optic was great,I used for dance performance, my daughter loved it as well her friends.</li>
            <li> Great, bright lights that flash a variety of colors.  Cheaper than Glowbies and I like that the barrette glows too.  Only complaint is that the clip will only close if you put a tiny amount of hair, so it&#x27;s not as easy to attach or as secure as I would like.</li>
            <li> Wore these for an Electric 5k. People asked where we got them!  Only weird part was the top clip part is the brightest part, so it doesn&#x27;t blend in naturally with hair (I get it... they&#x27;re LED fake hair and are never going to look natural, but you know what I mean.)  If you need them to be shorter you can definitely cut them, we made sure to &#x27;layer&#x27; them like you would hair so that the light was spread out.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s party, hoping it will be so pretty and fun. Well, it didn&#x27;t not work, and we could not use it. It was rather disappointing. I do not recommend this product. Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> The wife and I like to do a lot of um, role playin we call it. This colorful LED-light hair clip is real purty too. She gets to pretendin that she&#x27;s like a My Little Pony and I get harder than Chinese Algebra. We clip them things all over now, and they&#x27;re just good clean family fun.</li>
            <li> Brought these to a themed party and handed them all out by the end. Cheap and fun item to give out as party favors.</li>
            <li> These were a lot of fun at my daughter&#x27;s &#x27;Disco Diva Dance Party&#x27;.</li>
            <li> WE GAVE THESE FOR OUR GRAND DAUGHTERS BIRTHDAY PARTY AND ALSO NEW YEARS EVE PARTY THEY WENT OVER REAL BIG!!!!!</li>
            <li> They did the job, they are fiber optic so pretty stiff but we still managed to work them in a hair bun that made an awesome light effects for our glow run!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to take with us to Disney World for my girls to wear at night.  They are great, love the colors and the price is even better.  Last thing I wanted to do was pay park prices for for something to glow.  They are going to love these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE** took to the Disney parks and the girls only wore for 20-30 min.  They complained the piece that attaches to the air is too bulky.  Looks funny on the girls.  We even tried putting a ball cap over it and it didnt help.  They work great but if they wont wear them it is kind of a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The things are awesome!!!! I bought some for my beautiful loving talented generous daughter and she loved them!!!they rock!!!!! I love them!!!</li>
            <li> Bought these for the tiny ladies and the mommas. Worked really well and look cool in the dark. Bling bling.</li>
            <li> The kids loved these lights.</li>
            <li> Fun and lasted all day for days</li>
            <li> Really cool product would buy again.</li>
            <li> Little girls love everything that glows or sparkles and these meet the requirement! Especially nice in the evening.go for it!</li>
            <li> The lights were cool cause they changed to different colors but the clip on part is really big and hard to hide. The kids still had fun with them though.</li>
            <li> A great price for these!  I bought these for The Electric Run Boston. They are bright, stayed in place during a 5K run.</li>
            <li> I think these were nice but my kids didn&#x27;t have much fun with them</li>
            <li> Wanted to love these but the quality was poor. I ordered these to pass out at a bday party but when I saw the product I ended up&lt;br /&gt;returning most of them. The switches were not great quality and the barrette was so heavy it did not stay put in hair.</li>
            <li> They worked and lit great but I had a hard time attaching/clipping them onto my hair. They fell a lot of times and I went home losing them all.</li>
            <li> You can tell they are cheaply made but I love them. Nothing too special , no problems. Nicde clip for your hair. Little tiny on off switch.</li>
            <li> Used these hair lights for a party of 4- and 6-year old girls.  The girls LOVED them, and the moms got a kick out of wearing them, too.  The lights were perfect for New Year&#x27;s Eve.  They are easy to turn on, stay attached, and the lights are small so they blink in the right amount -- nothing too garish.  Seem to last, too!  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> The hair lights are perfect for raves and the hair lights have a good length to them. they had many colors and they were pretty</li>
            <li> These are awesome to have and where.  I bought some for me and my friends daughter, ok she is 3 y/o and I am older but it is going to be fun</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my sister in law because she loves anything LED and she was super excited to receive this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to use mine to add color  and lights to gleam n columns. A lot of great stuff at great prices.</li>
            <li> The clips are too bulky, it&#x27;s hard to hide the battery compartment with the hair, but the Lights are awesome.</li>
            <li> These were great for my daughter&#x27;s 7th birthday party at glow bowling. They all worked and the girls loved them.</li>
            <li> They worked great for our black light party</li>
            <li> Bought these for a glow run and they lit up our hair all night it was a nice twist of color to add to the night.</li>
            <li> One stopped working the night I opened it, another 2 stopped the next day.  But they served their purpose for our night of partying so I guess I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> So, the idea of these is really cool, but my sister and I got a bunch of these things and some of them wouldn&#x27;t work at all, and some stopped working really fast because the switch would get stuck and you had to press it really hard for it to keep working (meaning that as soon as you&#x27;d let go, it would stop working). So I probably wouldn&#x27;t get these again, unless the quality improves.</li>
            <li> unless you are a skilled hair artist. I tried to fill a wig with them and it just looked messy.... when I narrowed it down to 3 or 4 strategically placed lights it gave a much better effect...</li>
            <li> When I opened the box these came in, the individual bags were torn and some pieces were loose and broken.  The ones that worked were very difficult to clip into the hair.  I bought 3 sets for my granddaughters and I think they would have difficulty snapping them on.  Plus there was nothing in the box explaining what these were or how to use them.  Needless to say, I will be returning them.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. Used them for an electric 5K and again for Halloween and they were a hit!</li>
            <li> This product is not what it looks like in picture. They do not show the big chunk that holds the battery where it  has a tiny hair clip. Product does not light up as shown or even at all. Have to repeatedly push the on button hard to stay on almost snapping it. Very cheap!!! Do not buy.</li>
            <li> After about a month they arrived. The ones in the picture are not what you receive. Mine were bent in half in a small envelope and even after sitting a book on them for a day they are still bent at a 45 degree angle. They barely emit any light from the side, you have to hold them up in the air and look into them for them to be bright. Also they stay bunched together in one strand instead of fanning out like in the picture. I would invest a few more dollars for better quality ones...</li>
            <li> I only rated because I had to to leave a comment very low-quality there rolled up when you get them so they stay rolled up instead of hanging down in your hair very dissatisfied</li>
            <li> I did not get the right ones in the first place. I  received all green.  They were pretty. All of them worked. I gave them out last Halloween to the princesses.</li>
            <li> Item was just as I expected and I can hardly wait to use it for the purpose I bought it for, its going to be perfect.</li>
            <li> I love all of them thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Bought these for the Electric Run.  They were cute for 10 minutes and then they stopped lighting up.  They were cheap...so I guess you get what you pay for....</li>
            <li> Really had a lot of fun with these. Wore them at several glo walks. The snap on them will not hold if you put verymuch hair in it which is why I decrease the rating a little.</li>
            <li> Glad to see you now have a accurate pic of item, but before Christmas this item was Not as described, this doesn&#x27;t have enough strands in 1 to shine bright so you have to put several in but can&#x27;t cause the top is to big and bulky for head, also the top blinks so unlike the pic you HAD when I ordered on this item you could NOT hide the base</li>
            <li> Just arrived and they look pretty cool. The clip that will clip to hair is very large, will be very obvious unless wearing a curly puff head</li>
            <li> the children go crazy over it</li>
            <li> I bought these for Burning Man.  They were a fun little product that held up well in some rather horrid conditions.  Not as bright as I&#x27;d hoped for the Playa, but if you are looking at these for Halloween or for a child&#x27;s dance recital, they should do just fine.</li>
            <li> Not as bright as the pic. And the packaging was awful. They bottoms were all bent and I can&#x27;t straighten them no matter what I do. Not worth returning as the price was right.</li>
            <li> Purchased for guests to wear at a bachelorette party. Everyone liked them. Batteries lasted through the night with an untested amount left over. Clips comfortable in hair.</li>
            <li> These were the hit of the party, people had fun finding new ways to attach them to their hair, made a nice effect. A couple of them didn&#x27;t work and some broke right away. To be expected, I suppose, but would&#x27;ve been nice to be able to rely on all of them.</li>
            <li> I got these for a kid&#x27;s party and the girls loved them!  They change color and stay in the hair well.</li>
            <li> The hair lights LED are wonderful in the late evening and dark during the day people do not know I am wearing lights.  I wonder if possible an invention will come out; and be able to see in the day the lights also. I like the LED barrett myself as a hair extention.</li>
            <li> All in all, good product. One out of 12 did not work. As others have mentioned, the main light is in the hair clip, faint light at the tip of the optical fibers. The kids loved them.</li>
            <li> Good product, only complaint is one of the lights didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> A little hard to clip but overall they were great!</li>
            <li> upon opening the package, 3 of the 6 lights didnt even work. I replaced the batteries in the ones that didnt work and they still didnt work. long story short, dont buy this product. if I could have given it 0 stars i would have.</li>
            <li> The clip for these is really annoying for long hair. It has a saw-tooth pressure clip (with a spring). The back of the clip (with the spring) keeps grabbing my hair and requires careful untangling before I can remove it. It might be easier with short hair. The official Glowbys clips are much easier to remove. However, this clip was good at grabbing on to belt straps and the like, so you can use it not in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the pattern of the lights really, really annoying to me. They change constantly, pretty fast, and are generally distracting. I prefer my barrettes to be accents, not disco balls. YMMV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I do like about them is that the barrette part is clear, so you see the light source at the top, instead of just at the ends. This makes it easier for you to be seen at night, which is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the fiber optic hair lights are really great in general, and I usually get lots of compliments on them. I don&#x27;t particularly like these, but they are significantly cheaper than the Glowbys. If you&#x27;ve got short hair and want something really flashy (literally), these might work for you.</li>
            <li> thinner than I thought.  clip in hair awkward and bulky.</li>
            <li> Came as promised. My kids loved them and they received so my compliments from others there as well asking where I got them.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a &amp;#34;Light Up The Night&amp;#34; 5K. I would buy them if you need TEMPORARY light up hair. The clips are kind of big (which is totally understandable, I mean, they have to power the light from somewhere, considering it&#x27;s a freaking battery pack on your head, they&#x27;re not that bad) so if you have thin hair they could be hard to hide. I have thick hair and put them underneath the top layer and tried to disguise them. They still stuck out a little. SO MANY PEOPLE COMMENTED ON THEM! Overall I was very glad to have them. The light up extensions really do look cool, I just wish I could have blended them into my hair a little better.</li>
            <li> What is discribe as the Barrette part doesn&#x27;t snap. Also, they should show a picture of the Barrette/Batteries unit. It&#x27;s huge &amp; impossible to hide in between the strands of your hair, weave or wig! The Barrette unit is clear plastic and incases the light and 2 batteries. The unit measures approx. 1-1/2 x1/2 inches.(give a little) and the optic strands are steming from it which looks nice when they are on but that big plastic unit kills it!  Disappointed! I won&#x27;t be wearing them. Don&#x27;t want to look tacky! I have them steming out of a mug!</li>
            <li> These Just glow on the ends - seemed to work out of the package - â€‹Fiber optics - but great for a Neon party</li>
            <li> Thought this would be a wonderful gift for the nieces; however, the plastic strands starting coming out and they were scattered all over the floor</li>
            <li> they do just what I hoped they would shimmer and glow, they are fun and have life. playtful and charming</li>
            <li> Easy to use, just clip it where you want it :-)  Adds fun to any costume.  I am pleased with the purchase</li>
            <li> Took a while to arrive, good flashing lights. Fiberoptics reflected light from main source well even in lighted room.&lt;br /&gt;Great for parties.</li>
            <li> easy to use and lots of fun wearing , the price was outstandingly cheap but product is not !!! buy!</li>
            <li> We loved these! I bought 2 packs and found 2 duds in one of the packs. The hair clip is cheap, and two or three did fall off during the course of the night, but other than that they were lots of fun.</li>
            <li> Bought these for a one-use, night time, neon color fun run 5k race and they did exactly what I wanted them to do - make me stand out with the rest of my ridiculous outfit with a decent amount of glow. :) Unless you steal the batteries, it would be cheaper to just buy a new set of these every time they ran out. Do not steal batteries! :)</li>
            <li> Great, fun party item - all lights worked.  They are super bright and switch color rapidly. The clip part is so bright that even thick hair won&#x27;t conceal it. The on/off switch is really handy.</li>
            <li> Took these to summer set last year.  Everybody loved them!!</li>
            <li> Got these for my daughter.  They sell similar items in Wal-mart and they&#x27;re more expensive.  She loves them and couldn&#x27;t be happier she has so many for a lower price.</li>
            <li> I  ORDERED 2PACKAGES OF  THE 6-PK LIGHT-UP OPTICS LED HAIR LIGHTS AND RECEIVED  2 FRASHING BRAIDS.  I ORDERED THEM BECAUSE THE WERE SEVERAL GIRLS AND THIS WAS A NIGHT TIME PARTY.  2 ONLY BRAIDS WAS NOT ENOUGH SO I DID NOT USE.  JUST A WASTE OF MY MONEY.</li>
            <li> We tried to use the lights attached to our hats during the night time on the Portland to Coast Relay (part of the Hood to Coast Relay).  Only one worked well.  The others worked for a short period of time, then stopped working.  I would not buy them again.</li>
            <li> A great compliment to our 5k &amp;#34;electric zombie run&amp;#34;.  All the girls had one of these in their hair.  The teens, in particular, enjoyed the added attention from the chaser zombies.</li>
            <li> I recently ran in a Glow Run 5k and ordered these to wear in my hair.  I had extras to share and they were a big hit.  Added to a fun event!  Good quality and the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; was just right.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  They are very stiff, and they aren&#x27;t usable.  Wound up throwing them out.</li>
            <li> I think I put in the wrong address and it went to my old address.  I don&#x27;t know how to contact you to let you know. It is my fault. I am sorry.  I will order again in the future.</li>
            <li> either bad batteries or circuitry.  these are pretty when they do work, but couldn&#x27;t use half of the barrettes I bought :(  waste of $$, consider another product</li>
            <li> I love it&lt;br /&gt;Its Perfect&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much</li>
            <li> Love it everybody asked me where I got it from...</li>
            <li> we received it 4 weeks after our order. two of six leds didn&#x27;t have hair attached it already - just out from packing bag. Moreover, we hardly can see any light on hear in rest of hair. we are not happy with the product. waist of money.</li>
            <li> Super fun! Kids loved them... Great addition for Halloween!</li>
            <li> Awesome! My Jr High girls were so happy to get them.</li>
            <li> How could you not like this</li>
            <li> These made our night out very fun. Lots of comments and flirts from these.</li>
            <li> All the girls loved the lights!! We used them for a glow party and they all worked great:)  They had alligator snaps to attach to your hair.</li>
            <li> With little kids using them the strands fell apart really easy and had to be picked up from all over the floor. Other than that they worked perfect.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and bright.  Good quality at fair price.  Excellent party favor at girls night-glow party.  Fun for all ages.</li>
            <li> I ordered 72 of these and only 6 were the flashing kind. The rest were solid colors. About 4 of the 72 didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The lights did not blink/flash and they were not multicolored.  The lights were green and stayed lit (did not blink or flash).  Kids liked them, and they were a decent price, so I am happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> THe in thing these days are all these lights at the school dances. When all these kids are getting tatoos and piercings, these hair clips are a great way for your girls to have fun without permanant scaring or discoloration.</li>
            <li> These lights were sold to kids at an elementary Valentine&#x27;s dance, they all fell apart during a 1 1/2 hour dance, these items were sold as a fundraiser to buy award night at the end of the school year. The parents were upset and wanted their money back due to poor quality as the fibre optic strands just fell out.  They were also all green and did not change colors</li>
            <li> Every single person at our mardi gras ball refer about my hair!  They lasts all night and are still working a week later.  Loved them and will def order more for next year.  My on,y complaint is the battery pack that is attached to the clip part is quite large and was difficult to hide in my hair</li>
            <li> I bought 2 packs of 6.  7 of the 12 broke off the barrette as I was taking the outer cellophane off. These are cute and fun, but you would need to buy twice as many as you actually need to make sure you have enough unbroken ones to use. While they did not glow as in the pictured, the flashing lights in the barrette part gave off enough light to be a fun addition to a party. We had a good time with the unbroken ones.</li>
            <li> I put in the batteries but they don&#x27;t all work, it is ok, I thought it would be easier to put in to my child&#x27;s hair, not so much.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my kids bday party to give out in gift bags and everyone loved them. I even kept one for myself.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with how quickly I got them, however when I did open them I tested every one of them out. Unfortunately less than half of them actually worked. I know mistakes happen, but I was upset that I didn&#x27;t get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Many of them had disconnected strands upon opening the packages. Seems like the fibers are just tenuously hot-glued into the housing. Could be made better.</li>
            <li> So rad! I didn&#x27;t realize there were six to a pack, so they were especially lovely on a full head of hair. The clip works great.</li>
            <li> bought for night 5K. shows up very well in the dark. they don&#x27;t flash but thats ok. will use them</li>
            <li> Cool product... Not bright enough for light painting though. The company was very accommodating about the return.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for a glow dance at my children&#x27;s elem school and they were super cute for the price. Only 2 duds out of all that I purchased. Perhaps it just needed batteries replaced.</li>
            <li> I actually used these to light up my little girls&#x27; Halloween costumes. They all worked great and I loved how they changed colors slow and the fast. You can trim the too.</li>
            <li> These were pretty neat most stopped working after a few uses which is why I only gave it 3 stars.  But for the price it did what we wanted.</li>
            <li> The fibers are to few and fall out easily I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again and by the time I sell 2 there won&#x27;t be any fibers left I suspect</li>
            <li> They do not flash and out of the 6 pack only 3 of them would light up at all. Light up and not flash,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are better products out there for the same price.  Ad state alternating colors. What? I do not think so, This company is very misleading on this products description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend buying from this company. Beware!</li>
            <li> I like this product that&#x27;s why I gave 3 stars. It is fiber optics, LED, and very cheap. The thing is, there are 5 transparent and 1 pink color of optics. Some are blinking, some are just one color of light. Most of them were bent because of the way they were pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller contacted me and offering me a refund. That&#x27;s good offer so upgraded to 4 stars...I&#x27;ll update again regarding the refund.</li>
            <li> The clips are large and obnoxious. They stay in your hair, but they don&#x27;t look &amp;#34;nice.&amp;#34; The fiber optic lights change colors, but I wish they were a little brighter to make them easier to see.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for a underwater-themed party that we just organized! Excellent value and they look great!</li>
            <li> Great.  Kids loved it and they were a hit!  Will buy again and recommend to others who ask about it.</li>
            <li> the ones that worked were neat but one came unassembled scattered in the box. was going to assembly it but battery was missing</li>
            <li> Bought these for our &#x27;store&#x27; at church and the girls specifically saved up to get them.  Plan on having one out to show them so they really understand what they are but, once they do, they will all want to have these hanging from their hair!</li>
            <li> Bought these hair lights for my granddaughter and they strands fell out of the connector, this was one Christmas present I wish I had left in the store. I do not recommend these to anyone they are junk.</li>
            <li> generally, i love these lights...they are fun to play with and can be used in all sorts of games and recreational pursuits.  i am a bit unhappy will packaging, however, as i have made two purchases of this product and both times the product was folded over twice to fit in a box...a bend and curve which becomes nigh permanent in the fibers.  they should be packaged straight as many end up uses for hair design as the bends and curves cannot be control as readily as the straight fibers.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! Everyone loves them when I wear them. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the bottom fiber optic part can come loose but otherwise I love them</li>
            <li> my daughter is having a sweet 16 and what a better way than these hair lights to have her glow in the dark......what a great idea and can&#x27;t wait to use them. :)</li>
            <li> One of six did not light up.  Light didn&#x27;t seem to travel down entire strand, as in picture.  Not, completely disappointed.  They were inexpensive, just not a five star purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a glow in the dark turbo kick class. These worked great and were a big hit. I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> Fun item for my niece for Christmas. Arrived on time and as described.  Good value for the price. I would recommend</li>
            <li> On time and everyone worked!</li>
            <li> Great addition to Halloween costume with the bonus of keeping my daughter safe since she was LIT up</li>
            <li> I bought these as a surprise for my daughter for a party she had (18 year old) and she handed them out to friends to put in their hair. Great fun had by all, they work great and look great.</li>
            <li> They work great and for a great price. The colors are nice and bright and I love that there is a on/off switch.</li>
            <li> MUCH NEEDED FOR OUR SON&#x27;S DRUMS FOR NIGHT GIGS.  THEY LOOK GREAT IN THE DARK. HE WAS A VERY HAPPY SON. HE USES THEM ON THE DRUM STANDS.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Christmas present. She was very happy and plans to take it with her to concerts and camping.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much</li>
            <li> the product worked just like described. the lights/flashing lasted for hours. the batteries were easy to replace. colors very bright</li>
            <li> This product has performed flawlessly and up to my expectations. Everyone should have one at home, one in the car, and one at the office...</li>
            <li> Cute while they last.</li>
            <li> Cheap and break in one use.  I bought them for kids and adults and even the adults were falling apart.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> used for a party for 9 year old&#x27;s.  They loved them.  Going to use them for a glow run next month.</li>
            <li> These are really fun and you can wear them attached to most anything.  They don&#x27;t stay in fine hair w/o being hooked onto a rubber band or rubber banded in a ponytail.  We wore them on our hoodie strings too.</li>
            <li> These barrettes are poorly made.  The barrette itself does light up nicely but the fiber optic strands fall out and I am still finding them all over the place.  The fiber optic strands were not firmly attached to the barrette.  I had to use them because I did not have any of the others left.  I would not recommend this company to others, nor would I ever purchase them from again.  I have ordered many of these barrettes from other companies with great success and they, over the years, still work beautifully.  These are just poorly made!</li>
            <li> I knew from other reviews that there are not the glowby&#x27;s as picture and was fine with that.  I was ordering them for the kids on the 4th of July.  However, when I got my package, there was only one included.  Very upset that I planned and waited for only one to arrive.  Now there is not enough time to get another package from Hong Kong in time.  Luckily the one that I did get works.</li>
            <li> We bought this item for a night 5k run.  Out of the 6 that came in the package they were all green and 2 didn&#x27;t work other then a little flutter.  Out of the other 4, only one didn&#x27;t fall apart when we were putting them gently in.  We had one that worked well and stayed together.  A rather poor product.</li>
            <li> These were lots of fun! We purchased them for my teen&#x27;s bday party, &amp; the kids enjoyed them. They were very pretty in the girls&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> like the idea of Fiber Optic Hair lights but the seller did not package it properly. It got folded during mailing and some of the stands broke. They need to package better!</li>
            <li> Kids loved them but we quickly found that they did no stay in their hair or clip to clothes at all.</li>
            <li> Only one of the 6 I bought was a dud, but that&#x27;s ok. It&#x27;s like the top pin wasn&#x27;t pushed together hard enough for the lights to function. Whatever. The rest were super bright, lasted through a 5k run, and EVERYONE commented on them. The big bulky clip is fine because it also glows like crazy! I just wish there was a way to turn the clip the opposite way, because I had to put the right side of my head in from the back to the front, and it was harder to clip into my hair. But I saw one girl wrap it around a bun, and another braided it in. They are very bright and I can&#x27;t wait for another opportunity to wear them.</li>
            <li> My girls love and it was fun to ware. We took it to six flags over Texas and every body said that it was awesome!</li>
            <li> Got all the hair lights in the mail pretty fast and they all worked right away in their many colors.  I hope they last a while.</li>
            <li> ordered 6 weeks in advance and they came 2 days after the party/ :( however they work great!</li>
            <li> Sent all the same color, when supposed to be multicolored</li>
            <li> Not horrible, but not all they appear to be. Pretty but not very full.</li>
            <li> This product it cheap and doesn&#x27;t last very long. I looks nothing like the picture. The tips are the only thing that light up and the batteries were dead within a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> I dislikes because they fell apart to easy while taking out of the package. I do not recommend buying these. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I used these for the Electric Run 5K.  the looked awesome for my hair and they lasted the whole night, but a couple of them can apart from the barrette and though I just stuck them back in, they didn&#x27;t stay.  these are perfect if you are not going to be moving around a lot, but it you are planning on dancing, jumping, or running about, TAKE CAUTION.</li>
            <li> Nice accessory for a night race. The holders are a bit clunky but they worked for what the intended use.</li>
            <li> These things are soo much fun, batteries last for a long time. I bought a whole bung thinking they would die really quickly but I have been using the same ones over and over again.  Just keep in mind that some of the fibers will fall out.</li>
            <li> The package came on time, and was well packaged. I put them in my daughters hair for a concert and the battery end piece lit up brighter than the actual &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; which became difficult to hide in her hair because she is young. She still thought she was super cool with light up hair.</li>
            <li> Each one is multicolor, not solid as pictured (I thought they were solid in a multicolor 6 pack...but it&#x27;s six packages that each are multicolored/color changing)...but they are great! Super bright! :-)</li>
            <li> Not that great.  They came bent in half in the packaging &amp; when you try to straighten out they fall apart.</li>
            <li> Love the idea, but not as bright as I would have hoped. Helps to use a razor/scissors to cut/scratch up the top to make it brighter.</li>
            <li> Bought these to give away to the little girls at a camping weekend trip &amp; they all loved them!</li>
            <li> The light up optic fiber lights were okay. The optic  fiber lights are easy to come apart. I opened the package and the fiber optics fell out of the clip. They brake very easy. I love the colored lights in my hair, to bad they fall apart easy.</li>
            <li> I bought a pack for my nieces to wear in their hair.  A nice flashy add on that is always fun for those evening events.</li>
            <li> Cheap &amp; flimsy, just as I anticipated.  Sufficed but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase them again.  Can&#x27;t really recommend them for more than a one time use.</li>
            <li> They work great. I highly recommend getting these, my girls loved them. They light up well, stay in their hair nice and just make a night out a little more fun.</li>
            <li> We used these for the Electric Run in Chicago. They were a big hit. Good quality, clip help up well and we will reuse them again for Halloween. Yes, only the battery part lights up, but the light flows through the strands for total light up. That&#x27;s what fiber optics is. Plain and simple. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> JUNK!!  They fell apart the first time my grandkids tried to use them.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t light up anywhere near as bright as the photo.  And the part that clips into hair is very bulky and kind of cheesy looking.</li>
            <li> Had to cover the bases with electrical tape so that the light didn&#x27;t show through.</li>
            <li> Lit up well, and lasted beyond Halloween. It is a little sparse, so I used two together clipped onto one another and it&lt;br /&gt;looked great.</li>
            <li> We used this hair lights for an electric run and everybody liked the look!!! Some of the optic led hair lights did not lasted so long.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE PRODUCT!  Do not waste your money!  Very cheap plastic fell apart as I was taking them out of the package.  Returning these.</li>
            <li> They were so fun! I bought them for a Zumba glow party and handed out to a few of the peeps. We clipped them in for the whole hour and they never fell out - and still had juice when we were done!</li>
            <li> The girls of all ages will have fun with these light up strands.  We used them with Halloween costumes and garnered lots of attention.  Thanks, Ultimate Gifts and Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great colors that cycle, easy to use. Clips hold firmly &amp; batteries last a long time. Perfect for my unicorn tail. :)</li>
            <li> These do light up, and work just not to the level in the picture, unless you are in a room just that dark where it is the only thing you will see.</li>
            <li> GIFT FAVORS!! the girls will love this. the clip is a little hard/rough though</li>
            <li> Great fun! Limited to your own imagination.</li>
            <li> Not professional Crafted</li>
            <li> These were amazing and glow multiple different colors once activated. I got these for my daughters 9th birthday. She had a glow party theme, and i didnt realize 6 came in a pack. Probably because i researched tons of places for similar products. Anyways to make a long story short, thankfully there were 6 pieces because when one girl seen my daughters they all had to have one. coolest thing ever, even the parents who attended thought they were amazing(including the parents with boys only lol they wanted them too). There is aswitch to turn on and off and still works!</li>
            <li> Thank you!  beautiful!</li>
            <li> These were great as party favors for my 8 year olds Cosmic Bounce Party.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loved them.</li>
            <li> These are really neat.  You can do a lot of things with them and they work well, however the piece that clips into your hair is larger than I thought it would be but I used them for other things besides hair.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old granddaughter loves them, bit the barrettes are a little large.  She&#x27;s happy-so it&#x27;s a worthwhile buy.</li>
            <li> They are right for the price, but it does kinda sick because that slowly change colors then they flash, then go back slowly, then flash. If only I could keep it a color, but for a dollar a piece it is still a good deal. They aren&#x27;t comb like hair accessories, but they do stay in your hair</li>
            <li> Meh.  It&#x27;s so so.  I can clip these things everywhere, but they&#x27;re too heavy to hold themselves upside down and they&#x27;re too heavy to stay in my hair.  I have to make a mounting base in my hair for them, so meh.  I ended up with them on a hat, where I built a mount.</li>
            <li> 2/6 didn&#x27;t work and the others deteriorated quickly leaving lots of matter out of place to clean up.  Will no purchase again or recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for the GLOW festival and I am going to enjoy wearing them to the event, I even bought some to share with friends. THe transaction was easy quick and more than satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> My best friends granddaughter upon receiving these immediately put them all in her long hair.  She is 13 and really loves them.  Wants more for her friends.  No complaints at all with purchase.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know what to expect.  I think I ordered 6 pkgs and got enough barrettes to supply a party of 14 ladies with 2 each for a night of fun in downtown. I even had leftovers.  Well worth the price. Changes colours.</li>
            <li> They were super adorable in kids hair, the optic fibers were pretty and bright but the fibers soon fell off the hair clips. If the hair clips and adhesive were of better quality this product would be perfect.</li>
            <li> These were for a project, have them when I need them</li>
            <li> They are exactly as they look in the picture. Got 1 green, 2 red and 3 white color lights in the pack of 6.</li>
            <li> All the lights worked when I receive these. The colors were very bright. I don&#x27;t like that the lights blinked. I thought that they would just stay on the color that they were.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and fun.  Received what was described.</li>
            <li> Daughters and moms group did a firefly run with these in our hair. They helped us find each other! Four stars because a couple of them broke.</li>
            <li> Having a glow in the dark sweet 16 these Will be the hit of the party.</li>
            <li> It too 12 weeks for it to show up. Don&#x27;t waste your time</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my daughter&#x27;s roller skating party, and within 1 hour of the party starting, they started falling apart.  Luckily we had extras so we could replace them for the 2nd hour.</li>
            <li> Great price but you get what you pay for. They are not as pictured, but rather a tight thin strand of fiber optic that I feel still emits a lot of light but not flared out like is shown. Every single strand was bent when I opened the package and the packaging looked cheap and cheesy. Lying them under heavy books for a day had no improvement. A search on the internet advised using a hair dryer to help straighten them but that proved fruitless. When my wife wore them in her hair, it stuck out in the air and then came straight down in a really awkward fashion. Might be a good idea for kids for a party favor but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> really cheap and nasty 50% of the items didnt work, very dissapointing for halloween how do you explain this to kids</li>
            <li> We bought these to give out on trick or treat night and the girls absolutely loved them!!  This was a great treat.  You could see the girls down the street the colors stood out so well.</li>
            <li> Yes, mostly the barrette portion of the clips provide the most color. There is few color down the fiber optic &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34;. Purchased for my 7 year old&#x27;s halloween costume this year and she loves them, so her opinion is all that matters. It gives off a lot of light though and that was the whole purpose. For the one day that I need them, it&#x27;s perfect after that, I don&#x27;t care how long they last!</li>
            <li> Only got 4 of 6. And only 1 is color changing as it days. I expected all to be. All 6! I requested it fixed. The 1 That does as expected is quite awesome I will say. I will update if it gets fixed to 5 stars...but came from china seller. Not easy fix. Bummed.</li>
            <li> these look wonderful!  our granddaughters love things like this, so they will  go  in their Christmas stockings this year for  sure.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality, fell apart</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see this product lasting long however for the price that I paid it wasn&#x27;t a bad deal</li>
            <li> I got these for my granddaughters. They loved them! Grades 2 and 8.</li>
            <li> Favorite gift of a young friend.  Thanks for making her happy.</li>
            <li> When I first got these they came all curled up so I tried to straighten the fibers and most of the pieces fell off... not happy with them.  It was a waste of money and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.  It&#x27;s cheaply made.</li>
            <li> So entirely cool, these worked great for me.  I would buy more or buy again.</li>
            <li> put them on my broom and works really well for Halloween.  Thanks</li>
            <li> There should be a seizure warning that comes with these, because it&#x27;s sort of like wearing mini strobe lights on your head. They are a silly novelty item, but not really very practical for every day use. I think that my daughters kindergarten teacher would have some strong words for me if I allowed my daughter to wear these to school, but they are fun for wearing around the house, especially when it&#x27;s dark. I feel like packing these in our camping gear so that we can have a sure-fire way of keeping tabs on our kids when the sun goes down :)</li>
            <li> These are beautiful in the dark.</li>
            <li> NEVER ORDER A PRODUCT FROM OVERSEES</li>
            <li> Works great and easy to see from a distance. Great for Mardi-Gras</li>
            <li> Light doesn&#x27;t stay on and it&#x27;s very hard to keep it in their hair.</li>
            <li> It was for my daughter and she loved them...</li>
            <li> Extra light and protection as kids go trick and treating</li>
            <li> sucks you cant put it in your hair and if u have hair like mine long, wavy, thick hair u wont have any luck putting it on</li>
            <li> Definitely don&#x27;t stay in hair as they come but could be cool some other way to use or wear them easy to turn on</li>
            <li> This  Light-up fiber optic led hair lights are very amazing, i liked a lot the originaly, the colors, the size, and the best is when change the colors. They are very funny. I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I got the 6 pack multi color and they all stayed working for the whole night - 6 hours or so?  We shut them off so I assume they have more battery life to use.  For the price they are great.  The clip was solid.  The brightest part is the plastic piece at the top and the lights sort of follow down the fibers.  The fibers aren&#x27;t nearly as bright as shown in the picture - but they do light up.</li>
            <li> Not quite as bright as appear in picture - fall apart easily.</li>
            <li> A great buy for my kid&#x27;s grow in the dark theme party!</li>
            <li> A couple of the lights didn&#x27;t work. Some didn&#x27;t light up all the way down the strands.  I was looking forward to receiving these, but just wasn&#x27;t excited about them.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter went crazy over these for her hair</li>
            <li> The  kids  love  these.</li>
            <li> They were the hit of the camping trip!! They don&#x27;t look like much in the light but are so cool when you are in the dark--the darker the better. Batteries lasted a long time. On off switch saves the juice! Hung some up on my curtains when we got back(they were to neat to just throw away) and they lasted several more nights. Assorted colors and some multicolored and some flash!! Just loved them!!</li>
            <li> Bought them for all the girls. They loved them and they are bright and colorful. I had read reviews on different ones that they break easily and that the clip doesn&#x27;t stay in the hair. These all lit up and the clips stayed without any issues.</li>
            <li> These broke and the lights lasted about 5 minutes before they died and never came back on. Cheaply made and it shows</li>
            <li> When the package arrived the hair lights were stuffed in the package bent in half and there is no way to straighten them.  As excited as the girls were to get them they were so disappointed and didn&#x27;t end up using them...waste of money unless they find a way to send them without bending the fibers....the colors were nice but they stuck straight out from there head...it just didn&#x27;t work....</li>
            <li> My daughter and her friends loved them!  They did a treasure hunt in the dark outside and I could see them from far away.</li>
            <li> I love them they make my hair look so luminescent and gorgeous I love it! :-)</li>
            <li> These are nice and bright. They can be seen in a lighted area, but the darker the area, the better they show up. I use them when I go for a walk after dark so that cars can see me better. They have an on/off switch on the top, so it is easy to access it without taking it out of your hair, but sometimes the switch can be a little stiff to do while still in my hair, so sometimes I find it easier to take it out, flick the switch, and put it back in. It looks like the battery can be changed, but after 4 months of light to moderate use, I have not had to change a battery yet. It looks like a watch battery, and LEDs don&#x27;t use much power, so the batteries should last a long time. I&#x27;ll update when I have to change a battery.</li>
            <li> What we ordered is what came, have not used yet, but look to be perfect for kids to use, ages 7-10.</li>
            <li> These are the WORST hairglow.  They fell apart before I even opened the package.  There was 1 that was still in tact, and when I turned it on, the &#x27;glow&#x27; extended about 1&amp;#34; from the barrette.....that was it.&lt;br /&gt;I returned them and will never buy these again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glowbys are more $ but they last and last.</li>
            <li> a lot of fun.  fast service and as advertised.</li>
            <li> get what u pay for fun for one night</li>
            <li> I got these for my girls to wear at Halloween and they enjoyed every minute of them. They were not that expensive and worked well. They are bright and can be seen from a long ways off. Nice item i would buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought a pack of the hair lights for stocking stuffers.  They worked for all of 2 seconds!  Do not buy this product!</li>
            <li> got these as gifts and all the girls just love these things, they are pretty bright and all have batteries included. great deal</li>
            <li> Out of the 6 pkg. Only 4 where put together.&lt;br /&gt;Was refunded my money. Would not buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Ask for a refund if not happy.</li>
            <li> Only 2/6 of these arrived functioning and the other 4 had to be trashed. The two that work are pretty nice though. The clip part is large, but i think they&#x27;ll be a good music festival addition.</li>
            <li> Everyone loved these!  They lasted all night and were just so bright and pretty!</li>
            <li> These are a great product for a glow party or anything in the dark.  HUGE hit with both boys and girls at a junior high and high school event.  Wish I would have ordered more. They were gone quickly</li>
            <li> Nice this is going to go nicely on my cruise</li>
            <li> Kids had a blast with them.  They and their friends played late into the night.</li>
            <li> Disappointed... Got all one color, and they fall apart very easy...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s okay. The clip is difficult and the strands do not light up evenly or very brightly.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Took 7 weeks to arrive from China. Arrived folded over, so the filaments won&#x27;t ever straighten out. The filaments pull out very easily. Several of the 16 I ordered wouldn&#x27;t work properly. Can&#x27;t return due to shipping cost. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> Very popular amongst the girls while camping.  Stays in hair and stays lite.  Still working for next years camping!</li>
            <li> the fiber optics come out very easily , not meant For dancing</li>
            <li> perfect for the price you pay! I&#x27;ll have to figure out how to change the batteries though to make them last a little longer. Still they get about 3 hours of constant light up fun!</li>
            <li> These worked great. I got them for my team that was running the Electric Run.  The girls loved them and they all worked perfectly.  Seems to have enough battery for another couple go-arounds.  It would be ideal if the fit into the hair a little better but I knew exactly what I was getting when I ordered them, so no complaints here.</li>
            <li> two fell apart within 20 minutes - slipped right out of the main/battery clip part. But, the rest were very pretty and easy to use. My daughter wore them on stage for a performance of &amp;#34;Firework&amp;#34; by Katy Perry.</li>
            <li> These barrettes arrived quickly and packaged so they would not bend or tear.  Each one worked right out of the box, and the bright, vibrant colour flows evenly to the tip of each strand.  Note: The pic is a little inaccurate. The colours rotate.  I.e. each barrette is not one, constant, unique colour.  The On/Off switch is a definite plus.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 5 granddaughters under 7. I gave it to the 3 and 5 yr old and they loved them and put multiples in their hair and insisted on shutting off the lights so they could glow. The others will be receiving theirs in the next few days and I have no doubt they will be a big hit also! The construction is a little flimsy but  they will be fun as long as they last-the price was right!</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t going to hold up to the average young girl&#x27;s activity, and they fell apart shortly after opening.  The fibers slip right out of the barrette, and the barrettes are so flimsy they don&#x27;t stay in for long.  The barrettes are also pretty ugly, even though they light up. Our 6 year old Niece loved them at first, but was a little disappointed at how quickly they broke down.</li>
            <li> My daughter got these for christmas (thanks santa!) and enjoys walking around with them in her hair.  The batteries should last a long time being that they are the CR2032 type batteries.  Pretty neat stuff for a young girl to play around with.</li>
            <li> The kids have fun with these</li>
            <li> Good. Have to fiddle with a couple for them to stay on and were package doubled over so some strands of fiber optics were creased but good for what I paid.</li>
            <li> These are much cheaper than other brands I&#x27;ve purchased.  I&#x27;d recommend to avoid these.</li>
            <li> these really  worked great, the girls loved them</li>
            <li> We gave these away as stocking stuffers this year (2013).  The youngest was 4 and the oldest was a grandma.  Everyone really got a smile out of these and placed them in their hair right away.  As for the product itself:  The colors are very well done especially in darker areas.  The long fibers are able to be manipulated very easy and spread apart making it cool to spread throughout your hair or place into a pony tail.  Down side is that you have to be a little careful when moving the long strands, make sure you don&#x27;t pull downward to hard or the filaments will disconnect from the barrette, as we found out with the 4 yr old.  The barrette itself was neat because it changed colors along with the long filaments but we all wished we could place more hair within the barrette itself and that the shape and design was a little more fancy so you didn&#x27;t feel like you should hide it under hair (adults).  There where a blast to take dancing and outside.  I can&#x27;t wait to use them during the fourth of July.  Overall, very satisfied and considering how much my 4 yr. old niece waved it around, threw, pulled on it, and overall play time these held up pretty good considering.</li>
            <li> I bought this for Halloween give away. I gave to the kids and they love it. This thing made good Halloween give away.</li>
            <li> Look neat however top needs to be cover by black tape as it is so bright i could distract from fiber optics. Also they all color change between these colors, not solid colors very awesome for price! Packaged to sell.</li>
            <li> The item arrived quickly and as promised.  Works great.</li>
            <li> I had to give it an okay because.... They gave me the wrong product, it only glowed blue and I submitted a request to return it and get the rainbow flashing ones, they refunded my money &amp; had me keep these but I wanted the rainbow ones. So, I can&#x27;t say I hate them because because it&#x27;s like they gave me free stuff but you should know, if you order them you might not get the flashing rainbow and then your awesome outfit will be ruined because blue doesn&#x27;t even go with it and you won&#x27;t have enough time to try and order new ones.</li>
            <li> these are really neat!! they arrived quickly and are all working!! Very happy!!</li>
            <li> Yes it was quick easy and affordable.</li>
            <li> UNPROFESSIONAL COMPANY THAT DID HANDLE THE ORDER WELL AND DID NOT DELIVER PRODUCTS AS MENTION DATE, I DID NOT RECEIVE MY PRODUCTS NOR RECEIVE ANY REFUND .</li>
            <li> These are a great alternative to Glowbies. I bought 2 packs of 6 each, and every single one of them worked. They came packaged in individual bags and none of them were bent. I used them in a glass container as part of thecenterpieces at a glow/blacklight party. We gave the extras out and they looked awesome in people&#x27;s hair and clothes as well as in the centerpieces. Its a great value for what I paid.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughters glow party and they were a hit! They are awesome! Everybody loved them! The hair clips are with fiber optics that flash multi-colors! Colors are bright! They are good quality. I had purchased 3 of the 6packs for a total of 18 and all worked perfectly! Will buy in the future!</li>
            <li> Purchased for our niece&#x27;s 10 birthday.  SHE LOVES IT.  She and her friends played with that and the hair chalk the rest of the day</li>
            <li> Very poorly made.  Half were damaged.</li>
            <li> We used these for a glow in the dark Easter egg hunt and they were a HIT with the girls!!! They worked great</li>
            <li> These lights are advertised to blink multicolor.&lt;br /&gt;Please do not sell as blinking or flashing multicolor lights.&lt;br /&gt;I will be checking.</li>
            <li> I purchased these light up fiber hair lights for a rave I will be attending this August at Otakon. I&#x27;m pretty happy with them, they stay in my hair which I was worried about since my hair is fine. The only thing I wish was you could pick the color instead of it jumping from color to color. Other than that it&#x27;s a good product and it arrived a day early!</li>
            <li> needs to be very dark to see the lights and colors.  Also the light strands feel off of one of the clips right away. Very pretty.</li>
            <li> thats is very funny i love it ... its for my young child  and she is happy  whith this ....................</li>
            <li> bought these for party favors for my 10 year olds party.  I love that these light up and are pretty fun for the girls, but they fall apart so easily.  You barely bend them wrong at the top where they connect to the battery part and they fall off.  I am finding little plastic pieces all over the house.  Just wish they would have lasted longer</li>
            <li> I would give this a 5 star but you almost need two to get the full effect, although if placed in the back of long hair, it looks great in the dark inside, but really shows up well outside! The girls love them, looking around on the web for these, I found this  to be  best, as I have bought from others and was not as happy with their products.</li>
            <li> Thought I could use these in my photo work, but they seem to be very dim.  The clip is bright but the strands are very dim.  Don&#x27;t show up in the hair.  They work , just not very well.</li>
            <li> They are cheaply made, and I had one break before I ever even used it, because I was trying to figure out how to make it &amp;#34;flash,&amp;#34; as the Amazon description said it would (it doesn&#x27;t).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, they are super cute, and definitely worth the low price. Right now, they are $5.29 with free (Prime) shipping for a 6 pack. That is a good price. If the price exceeds $1 per barrette, I would rethink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed that in my &amp;#34;multicolor&amp;#34; pack, half of them were green. In the description &amp;#34;Multicolor Flashing Barette - Rainbow Colors (Alternating Multicolors)&amp;#34; - none of those things are true. They are each one color, they do not alternate or flash. You can turn them on or you can turn them off, period. The blue and the red are soooo pretty. Thank God I got one of each. The white is fine, and the green is fine, I only wish I had not gotten 3 greens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rate them lower if I&#x27;d paid more for them, but they are worth the current price, and they are fun.</li>
            <li> It was great and shipped in a timely fashion.&lt;br /&gt;The product was ready to used and came with batteries included and lasted for hours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A downside is out of package one was broken (the strands already fell out of the light) and was a hassle to fix. But 5 out of 6 is still good.</li>
            <li> Nice sparkle...lasted the whole Justin Bieber Concert.  Colors were exactly as stated and they are light weight so easy to keep in hair.</li>
            <li> In the last 30 seconds:&lt;br /&gt;-the plastic of the barrette broke when opening metal clip in 3 of the 4 barrettes&lt;br /&gt;-the plastic was already broken in the 4th package that I looked at&lt;br /&gt;-the light source to the fiber optics is bright and awesomely blinky, but the actually fiber is near useless&lt;br /&gt;-I helped potential buyers from buying this crappy product...</li>
            <li> If there are children under 4 in the household, absolutely do not buy this product or send it home to other families with young kids. It falls apart easily and the batteries and sharp parts are perfect for being swallowed by a young child. Very flimsy. Beware !! (Please don&#x27;t think you can hide it from the young kids.) I thought I could keep my eye on it. It ended up under the sofa where the clear plastic part was sticking out and hard to see at all. Someone must have barely stepped on it, unaware. I found one battery and two very sharp parts on the floor and almost had a heart attack. I held my breath as I searched for the remaining battery, hoping, praying really, that my two year old grandson had not swallowed it. I found all the parts before he did, but it was close. IF YOU MUST keep them, scotch tape the entire casing first but leave the switch free. Sure, they are cute but don&#x27;t take any chances. Life is too hectic to stay on top of making sure the babies don&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> you definitely get what you pay for :/</li>
            <li> These are very pretty but they don&#x27;t show up very well.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed!!!! I purchased four of the 6-packs, which means 24 total.  only 5 of the 24 were flashing multi-colored.  the other 19 were all one color and non-flashing.  I brought them a while ago, in preparation of a birthday party to be held 1/8/15.  I am so sorry that I believe the packaging in which the items were in, FLASHING BRAID.  I discovered the problem today 1/3/15.  Now I have to try to order some that actually flash.  Unbelievable!!!  I wish I could return them!!! Lesson learned.  Sometimes you can not trust the packaging.</li>
            <li> Cute for the night, but  immediately started to fall out of them.</li>
            <li> Super cute! Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Daughter just loves these extra accessories to go with her new led hula hoop</li>
            <li> Big hit, not just with my little niece but sister and my mom, everyone not super bright but cute.</li>
            <li> string was falling off from the main clip on.&lt;br /&gt;price was good, but&lt;br /&gt;you will get what you are paid for.</li>
            <li> The girls loved this at their campfire party. They felt like little Rick star divas! They all worked great fun.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my daughters sleep-over birthday party thinking that the girls would have fun with them.  Here are the reasons that I felt these were terrible.&lt;br /&gt;1- the fibers come out easily and now my house is covered in plastic strings&lt;br /&gt;2- the clips do not hold any hair&lt;br /&gt;3- the battery pack is very heavy and very big causing them to slide out of the hair once you actually get them to clip&lt;br /&gt;4- the batteries didn&#x27;t last more than an hour&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, these were a big let down</li>
            <li> Show up well and easily integrated into most hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was great for The Electric run!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought more, my kids wanted some!</li>
            <li> These are cute, but kind of junky.  The base (light source, where the switch and battery are) are brighter than the strands.</li>
            <li> Great for a little girls sleep over.  I purchased these for my daughter&#x27;s 10th birthday sleep over.  They were easy to clip into the girl&#x27;s hair.  Unfortunately, some didn&#x27;t work.  But the girls enjoyed them and the doubled as unexpected night lights.  I can see that these would be great for a Bat Mitzvah party too.</li>
            <li> All the girls loved them.</li>
            <li> What little girl wouldn&#x27;t loves these.</li>
            <li> I received them all bent in terrible shape. Very cheap looking</li>
            <li> Use these with my friends when we do night neon glow 5K&#x27;s. General fun!</li>
            <li> I used these as party favors when the girls came in the door and they put them in their hair and they looked beautiful!  I was really concerned that all of them would work and if they looked as good as in the picture. I only had one that didn&#x27;t work but it was OK because 2 girls didn&#x27;t show up. I was somewhat disappointed in the red color as it was not as pretty as the others. But I would recommend these for any glow in the dark party. I am so glad I found them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably be buying a few more of them. They&#x27;re really great for parties, going to clubs or any event where you&#x27;re out in the dark. Might consider buying different batteries. The ones that come with them only last a few hours.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my teen grand daughter. She loves anything that lights up or sparkles. A big hit with her and her friends.</li>
            <li> Did not like! Got these for the girls hair- the clips are worthless. The glow strands themselves are so heavy and not secured well enough into the clip that they just fell out.  I ended up putting them in a glass jar standing up so they would at least add some glow color to the table (after the girls ripped them out of their hair because the only thing barely hanging on were the clips- no strands). Don&#x27;t waste your money! Get the glow sticks or the pack of multi color foam batons to add some fun.</li>
            <li> These were such a great value! I bought these for an outdoor music event, and everyone loved them. Like some of the other reviews said, the top part is clear and is a little bright. Nothing a little electrical tape couldn&#x27;t fix. I put a couple strips of electrical tape over the front and they were perfect. Also found out, you can change the battery in them if you want. Haven&#x27;t had to yet, but it&#x27;s a nice feature to have if you want to extend the life of these a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this, again.  The strands fall out very easy and the lights are not very bright.</li>
            <li> They are bent when shipped so the strings don&#x27;t go straight down. That&#x27;s fine for the project I have in mind but it might not be so great if you want to hid it in your hair. Not really sure how to straighten it.</li>
            <li> Took a very long time to receive direct from China. Product Packaging is about a foot long but all six were folded up into three sections to fit into delivery packaging. This left bad creases in the fiber optics which can&#x27;t be removed. This causes the fibers to horseshoe and don&#x27;t sit straight for a proper look. About 50 percent of the fiber optics fell out all over the house. Last complaint is the top section which clips into hair is clear and the led is very bright so all you see is a section in hair flashing. Material should have been black or dark so light just transmits down optics for proper visual.</li>
            <li> Daughter had fun with these on her birthday.</li>
            <li> I expected something cheap but instead I received more than I expected. They light up bright and they are perfect for any occasion.</li>
            <li> Photo is not accurate, the strands do not illuminate like others have stated. They glow but not like the photo! Some flicker off and on, the quality is poor and the battery housing is ugly. I hot glued two large rhinestones to hide the batteries. My girls love them. You can not beat the 5 buck price tag. I see they were originally listed for over 20, I would be very upset if I ordered these for 20....One arrived broken, amazon customer service was quick to credit me. If looking for a cheap alternative to GLOWBY, one time, few hour use....then this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> The little girls, 6 and 3 years old loved them.  Seem to be well made. Goes well with the LED Fairy Wings.</li>
            <li> The girls loved these at the last festival we went to. Great value.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my 8-yo granddaughter and her closest friend. Both girls adore those hair lights, they are so bright and fancy!</li>
            <li> These were worn and shared at last years Bonnaroo Festival. They just added a little color and light. We also had light up rings that were fun because we handed them out, shared them with others, and they were a great icebreaker for meeting people.</li>
            <li> its very inexpensive and convenient to dismantle for parts. lots of fireoptic uh fibers and switches and leds. what more do you need?&lt;br /&gt;cheaper than buying these parts individually at radioshack. im using the parts for my own lil e-cigs i make.</li>
            <li> These are bright and lots of fun for the kids to change their color out. I would purchase again for sure.</li>
            <li> Will buy these again for The Electric Run for next year.</li>
            <li> This was a true winner. Had a Cosmic Bowling party for 6 year old girl. All gifts glowed or lit up. This hair item was a HUGE success!</li>
            <li> Only one of the strands actually flashes and changes colors. The others just stay one color and the strands really only look bright/colorful at the top. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I got these for my daughter&#x27;s sleepover birthday party. The girls were thrilled with them and they are very pretty, however, the strands kept falling out and ended up all over the floor. On one of the barrettes, all of the fibers pulled out completely and had to be taped back onto the barrette. Overall, they&#x27;re fun and young girls will love them, just don&#x27;t plan on getting much more than one night out of them.</li>
            <li> Bought for a jumper glow party and the girls loved it.</li>
            <li> These were given out on the dance floor at a sweet sixteen party. The girls loved them, as expected. Did not realize that even the boys would want to wear them (clipped to ties, clothing, etc.) A big hit!</li>
            <li> You need big hair or some kind of barrette or bow to cover the large battery filled top... a hat maybe? The strands are fun but I am looking for other ways to use them besides on a head.</li>
            <li> these are nice and easy to clip into the hair.  the only problem I had and why the lower star rating is that when I first opened a few of them the strands came off.  So you have to be careful.  other wise the light up is nice a random.  Great for glow runs.</li>
            <li> The strands are not even close to what is depicted in the picture. Here they show them as &amp;#34;vibrant&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;bright.&amp;#34; In reality, very little light makes it to the end of the fibers, and if you are in a pitch dark room you might get a result close to the pictures. But in reality, if you wear them into even a generally dark room, as in a high school or college dance or similar, you will not see hat they show you. The clip part is the brightest part, and that distracts from the strands entirely..</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter, and she loves them. Beware, the little plastic prickle things come out sometimes. For the price point, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> these look great in my hair</li>
            <li> Very cool. Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I bought the package of 6 to wear to an upcoming music concert. They are battery-operated with an easy on/off switch. They are beautiful and functional and easy to use. I loved the pic of the girl wearing them around her hair-bun. It&#x27;s actually what inspired me to purchase.</li>
            <li> The barrette area of these is heavy and doesn&#x27;t have much gription. They slide right out of your hair and don&#x27;t integrate well for a seamless look. Great idea. Needs better execution. Fine for the price.</li>
            <li> Yes Pretty, Came quickly, I am happy with the product. The hair clip is weak and the power pack is on the heavier side. (not sure what I was expecting there).It would be better if the Hair clip were stronger to actually hold the thing in the place.  I am thinking of modifying the ones I have to make them more practical. Fun things...</li>
            <li> My daughter loved these.  They make a great stocking stuffer for Christmas.  They aren&#x27;t very bright, and they didn&#x27;t last long, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> as expected...bought for prom</li>
            <li> Awesome.. They were a big hit.. At the outdoor Party...</li>
            <li> The only problem was they were bent since the package was folded in the envelope So not very happy about that. So now I got to try to slowly bend them back in place.</li>
            <li> do NOT flash even though item says they do.  3 of the 6 are clear and not colored.  save your money</li>
            <li> Worked okay for the price. Not all colors are equally bright, but they made cute favors for a kids party.</li>
            <li> These lasted all night, even through the rain! But don&#x27;t expect it too just because i said so. I suggest putting them on the side of your hair instead of on top, otherwise it&#x27;ll stick out from how stiff the plastic strands are. Color was not as vibrant as the picture but it was still pretty in the dark at the tips of it. I gave it 4 stars because 2 of them did not work at all, but luckily 4 was all that was needed. There is an on and off switch at the top so i&#x27;m glad i can use again when the need arises!</li>
            <li> These things are like, cheap and are mostly &#x27;blah&#x27;. I only bought them as cheap decoration for a &#x27;black lite&#x27; Halloween party. Let me tell you, I ended up with NONE of them by the end of the night&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things were a HUGE hit among guest. I had actually bought two of them (so 2 6-packs, so a total of 12) and EVERYONE was asking for them, putting them in their hair, literally, by the end of the night, they were all gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for cheap decor OR party favor kinda thing for a black light party, these things are awesome, I doubt they do well in a well lit area.</li>
            <li> These are amazing I ordered 2 packs and they were just the touch we were looking for. All the girls and woman loved them and all the guys kept playing with them too. I would order again!</li>
            <li> Expect a ridiculous delay in getting your product.  Not cool!</li>
            <li> Super cute in hair. The battery lasted for a week of daily use and still going.</li>
            <li> Only four out of the six worked the other two would go on and off and I&#x27;m suppose to be using them in a glow in the dark race with my daughter tomorrow and she is bringing her friend.....now we cannot wear them like we originally planned</li>
            <li> they fall apart fairly easliy</li>
            <li> These were a TOTAL hit at our holiday party.  Unfortunately, probably a quarter of them were broken.  (We ordered a few packs.)</li>
            <li> You may ask why I&#x27;m giving 5 stars when it was NOT as advertised.  It&#x27;s because everyone loved them anyway!!  Even though I ordered one 6 pk, I received 14.  That&#x27;s enough to give an extra star.  Only two of the barrettes were multi-colored flashing.  The others were just one color and did not flash.  But like I said, they were a huge hit.  So, if you&#x27;re determined to have flashing and multi-colors, you might be a little disappointed.  Little girls and old men and everyone in between wore them. Good times!!</li>
            <li> wires are broken up to look at</li>
            <li> The top clip a bit bulky but great for parties.</li>
            <li> MY DAUGHTER WEAR  THESE  EXTENTIONS AND HER FRIENDS LOVED IT ........ MY DAUGHTER SAID THAT THEY WERE AMAZING AND THAT SHE LOVED THEM</li>
            <li> Nice but they fall off everywhere</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got this for my daughters and the price was good. Quality is not the best but it works with replaceable batteries. It&#x27;s good comparing to similar products with same quality but more expensive..</li>
            <li> Very cheap.  Only some of them worked.  The clips were huge.  Did not look good.</li>
            <li> preetttyyy parrttyy accessory</li>
            <li> We love Glowbies but they are kind of pricy. These are pretty much the same thing but a few differences. First instead of a barrette type clip they have a toothed spring clip. Second the batteries look bigger. Third the battery compartment is bigger. Finally they are less expensive than Glowbies. While they will not tuck into your hair as well or hide in hair as well as Glowbies we think they will last longer due to larger batteries. Also the spring clip allows for more mounting options. They clip nicely to a hat, clothing, or belt. Not only does the fiber optic strands light up but the battery compartment get lit up too. We like that.  They are plenty bright for evening wear. High hopes for this product and look forward to playing with them.</li>
            <li> Good product but fragile due to the exposed fiber optics. Work well and look brilliant . The thin fiber optics do break off at times so store carefully and I would not give to a small child.</li>
            <li> Got these for my Granddaughters.  With all that long brown hair, it shows great,</li>
            <li> Very nice. Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> These were great!  The girls had a great time using these in our light parade.  They had very vivid colors and last a long time.  In face so long that I still haven&#x27;t worn mine out yet.</li>
            <li> Big hit last Halloween for my daughters and her friends. Voting for stars is due to their mom also being happy with these...</li>
            <li> My daughter love them</li>
            <li> Got here fast . My little girl love it! Thanks</li>
            <li> The fibers fall out a bit too much for my liking. But otherwise they look great.</li>
            <li> got these for my middle daughter she loved them but the quality sucks, one of them didn&#x27;t work from the beginning and the other ones broke easily!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Fun product.</li>
            <li> Exactly what you see...no more no less... works well and is easy to handle. Nothing else to add, good item.</li>
            <li> These were a fun addition to my daughters &amp;#34;glow in the dark dance party.&amp;#34; They are easy to use and last a long time. I wish the clip in your hair part wasn&#x27;t so heavy because it tends to pull on my 3-year-olds hair a little too hard.</li>
            <li> granddaughters love them! great for night time activities, backyard barbeques  and the beach. The kids have glam fun and they give adults a way of keeping track of kids without  letting them know that&#x27;s what you are doing.</li>
