            <li>Fast shipment, perfect fit for the Blackberry Q10.</li>
            <li>Dirt gets caught in the edges, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s my fault.</li>
            <li>Cute too.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s easy to put on phone and take off as well.</li>
            <li>The i-Blason softgel flexible tpu case is a slimline, light duty fitted case.</li>
            <li>Overall good product for phone.</li>
            <li>I ordered this case for my new Q10 and I love the color and the look and feel of it</li>
            <li>I received the case and it was exactly what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is; the volume buttons and the top on/off button are covered.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Was a perfect fit and came up high enough around the entire phone to offer some glass protection should you lay the phone upside down.</li>
            <li>More of a rose pink than bubblegum pink.</li>
            <li>It works well in your hand and pocket, but if you are looking for a protective case, other than light scratches or light drops</li>
            <li>My biggest issue with most cases is that you loose &amp;#34;good button function-ability&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>As a result, I can&#x27;t really press the power button without holding my phone in both hands</li>
            <li>Really like the look of the case tho</li>
            <li>Thanks for making a protector for my bb</li>
            <li>Love this little rubber case for my BlackBerry!</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s a little grippy which I like because it won&#x27;t slide off a countertop as easily</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s gel (hard cases tend to still transfer shock to the phone)</li>
            <li>This case is my 1st from this company and I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>An essential accessory, that actually should have come with the phone.&lt;br /&gt;Based on my transaction and delivery, the seller is very much reliable.</li>
            <li>It just get dirty kind fast</li>
            <li>It is very thick plastic, but easy to get on and off.</li>

            <li> It is very thick plastic, but easy to get on and off.</li>
            <li> Only negative is the power button on top is covered and makes it difficult to push.  </li>
            <li> The pink appears a bit darker to me than the picture.</li>
            <li> complaint I have is that there is a concave part on top in the spot where the power button is and because this case is semi-hard, it is difficult to press down the power button.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> but the case was designed as though it does, thus requiring you to press down twice as hard to turn the screen on and off.</li>
            <li> but not sure I can.</li>
            <li> I have to press really hard in order for the buttons to engage now.  </li>
            <li> so I can press hard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not amazing</li>

            <li> Love this little rubber case for my BlackBerry! It is very thick plastic, but easy to get on and off. I haven&#x27;t taken it off once since I bought it!</li>
            <li> This product is of a very good quality and it has a very good price. It helps protect the blackberry Q10. An essential accessory, that actually should have come with the phone.&lt;br /&gt;Based on my transaction and delivery, the seller is very much reliable.</li>
            <li> I ordered this case for my new Q10 and I love the color and the look and feel of it - it&#x27;s a little grippy which I like because it won&#x27;t slide off a countertop as easily and it doesn&#x27;t interfere with typing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint I have is that there is a concave part on top in the spot where the power button is and because this case is semi-hard, it is difficult to press down the power button. The power button on the Q10 itself doesn&#x27;t actually stick out from the phone but the case was designed as though it does, thus requiring you to press down twice as hard to turn the screen on and off. As a result, I can&#x27;t really press the power button without holding my phone in both hands so I can press hard. Trying to get used to it but not sure I can. Really like the look of the case tho so I&#x27;m trying to deal with it.</li>
            <li> Only negative is the power button on top is covered and makes it difficult to push.  Overall good product for phone.</li>
            <li> This is a great case. I love that it&#x27;s gel (hard cases tend to still transfer shock to the phone) so it protects against damage and has a great, comfortable feel in the hand. It fits perfectly on my Blackberry Q10, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with pressing the top button like other reviewers mentioned. I would definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> Fits my Q10 perfectly and doesn&#x27;t seem to show dirt. It&#x27;s just like the white store bought one I had.</li>
            <li> No complaints. Fits well and protects the phone. Dirt gets caught in the edges, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s my fault. Cute too.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment, perfect fit for the Blackberry Q10. Still have it and am really pleased! It&#x27;s lasted all the falls and bumps, would definitely recommend !</li>
            <li> very cute and I love it.</li>
            <li> This case is my 1st from this company and I am pleasantly surprised. My biggest issue with most cases is that you loose &amp;#34;good button function-ability&amp;#34;. This case does have ample openings for charger, hdmi, etc.The pink appears a bit darker to me than the picture. More of a rose pink than bubblegum pink. The i-Blason softgel flexible tpu case is a slimline, light duty fitted case. It works well in your hand and pocket, but if you are looking for a protective case, other than light scratches or light drops (ie a carpet), this case is not for you.</li>
            <li> This is a great case and I am so happy to have it, because it really sets my phone apart.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Thanks for making a protector for my bb can you make more choices in colors by any chance n this word of mouth is happy with your service too</li>
            <li> Nice cover. It just get dirty kind fast</li>
            <li> I like how flexible, yet durable this cover is. It&#x27;s easy to put on phone and take off as well.</li>
            <li> Was a perfect fit and came up high enough around the entire phone to offer some glass protection should you lay the phone upside down.</li>
