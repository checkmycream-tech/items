            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to be excellent based on the price.  </li>
            <li>was a great purchase!</li>
            <li>The stamper isn&#x27;t all that great either.</li>
            <li>You guys did a great job making this stamper.</li>
            <li>your rubber before using (youtube has great tutorials)</li>
            <li>This is a really great product.</li>
            <li>Not the best stamper but works ok for beginners</li>
            <li>good to use</li>
            <li>The Scraper doesn&#x27;t seem to be good as well.</li>
            <li>Just bought this until I could find my good stuff in storage.</li>
            <li>Honestly I don&#x27;t know why I thought this stamper may not have been good</li>
            <li>I bought 4...and am buying 4 more!</li>
            <li>The plastic scraper works better than another metal one I received, and the large end does a great job of picking up designs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, I can use it but its not my favorite.</li>
            <li>To me this scraper is ok.</li>
            <li>They are not sticky, the image transfers better and picks up images better.  </li>
            <li>This works fine.  </li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t turn out to be such a great purchase.  </li>
            <li>Thanks a lot!!!</li>
            <li>The stamper works ok, but with too much pressure</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t pay much for it.</li>
            <li>it really does make a huge difference)&lt;br /&gt;This is easy to use, captures all the polish from the plate and it makes my nails look</li>
            <li>so I am just able to use the smaller end.</li>
            <li>The rubber falls out of the tube more often than not and when it doesn&#x27;t it gets pushed back into the tube.  </li>
            <li>The stamped broke the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>tried it first and at the begging it wasn&#x27;t doing much, I came to realized I wasn&#x27;t cleaning it</li>
            <li>The large stamp part pushes in and goes sideways when trying to stamp.</li>
            <li>I did not pay much for this item</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really transfer the image that well.</li>
            <li>The edge is not flat or smooth and you have to have a flat, smooth edge to scrape the excess polish off the plates.</li>
            <li>It was nice that this stamper had a large and small stamping end and that it was on one tube.</li>
            <li>I have recently started stamping my nails and thought buying several stampers of various sizes would be a good idea.  </li>
            <li>but I had ordered a different one before for about the same price and the one I got this time was very cheaply put together.</li>
            <li>GREAT stamper,  works well, my only issue is,  if you&#x27;re using any color except black or white,  you can&#x27;t see the image on the stamper.</li>
            <li>Too much pressure when picking up the design causes the end to push up into the handle and only the large end worked for me.</li>
            <li>I was so hoping to have a good review for this, seeing that I just love other Pueen products, but this was disappointing.</li>
            <li>The large end has sunk back into the handle already</li>
            <li>but I decided to try it out anyway and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I fixed it by making an inner rim with a hot glue gun, but next time will just get the Konad double stamper.</li>
            <li>These, with the pink stamping pad, are better than other stamps with the white pad.  </li>
            <li>the rubber end slips into the handle too far and has to be fixed before you can do the next stamp.  </li>
            <li>My only name brand stamper and my least favorite.  </li>
            <li>The small end fell out right away and was never found.</li>

            <li> I just wanted to buy a stamper with a plastic scraper but this was a waste of money. I was so hoping to have a good review for this, seeing that I just love other Pueen products, but this was disappointing. It doesn&#x27;t pick up the images well and mind you I had to test my other stampers just to see if I was being unjustly critical. The plastic scraper isn&#x27;t anything to scream about either. This doesn&#x27;t get the job done!</li>
            <li> I have recently started stamping my nails and thought buying several stampers of various sizes would be a good idea.  I thought this stamper would be bigger than several I have - it is not.  The surface is the same size as Konad&#x27;s.  The biggest issue I have is with the construction of the tube that holds the rubber stamping surface.  The tube is hallow and has a ledge that should hold the stamper.  With regular pressure applied during stamping,  the rubber gets pushed inside the tube because the ledge is not big enough to prevent it&#x27;s falling.  I would not recommend this choice.</li>
            <li> So small , in the pictures look bigger, very disappointed</li>
            <li> This sucks. The one I received only picks up a portion of the stamp and/or only stamps part of the design on the nail.</li>
            <li> Works decent enough on the small end. On the big end when you go to push down to get the stamp on it, it goes down into the tube and smears the stamp so I had to rig it to stop doing that.</li>
            <li> From my wife:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this stamper the larger end of the silicone pushed into the handle and was unable to be fished out.  The smaller end is a completely different type of silicone that does not transfer the image at all.  This was used with Pueen brand plates which are very shallow and unusable.</li>
            <li> I got my Pueen Stamper and Scraper and the scraper is garbage.  The edge is not flat or smooth and you have to have a flat, smooth edge to scrape the excess polish off the plates. The stamper isn&#x27;t all that great either. I have problems getting the image to transfer to it. I would not recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> This works fine.  I didn&#x27;t expect it to be excellent based on the price.  The large end has sunk back into the handle already so I am just able to use the smaller end.</li>
            <li> GREAT stamper,  works well, my only issue is,  if you&#x27;re using any color except black or white,  you can&#x27;t see the image on the stamper. If it were white, I&#x27;d definitely give it 5 ☆</li>
            <li> The price on this stamper is great!&lt;br /&gt;I tried it first and at the begging it wasn&#x27;t doing much, I came to realized I wasn&#x27;t cleaning it properly!&lt;br /&gt;(Try tape it really does make a huge difference)&lt;br /&gt;This is easy to use, captures all the polish from the plate and it makes my nails look beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;This was a great purchase!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t turn out to be such a great purchase.  The stamper works ok, but with too much pressure the rubber end slips into the handle too far and has to be fixed before you can do the next stamp.  The scraper has a little uneven notch out of the edge, so that ephemeral you scrape, there is a line of polish that doesn&#x27;t get removed.  It&#x27;s ok, I can use it but its not my favorite.</li>
            <li> the scraper not very good&lt;br /&gt;overall good to use</li>
            <li> The small end fell out right away and was never found. Rubber always falls out.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work. When I got this product, on the bigger side, there was some tiny cuts, don&#x27;t now why. Also the bigger head felled off before i use it. The Scraper doesn&#x27;t seem to be good as well.</li>
            <li> The plastic scraper works better than another metal one I received, and the large end does a great job of picking up designs.</li>
            <li> To me this scraper is ok. I bought 2 and the other one is silicone. This one I had to press hard in order to get the whole stamp design on it. But the silicone one didn&#x27;t even work at all.</li>
            <li> It was nice that this stamper had a large and small stamping end and that it was on one tube. Not two tools just double ended.</li>
            <li> The stamper head was to small</li>
            <li> I had thought this would be similar to the Konad double ended stamper a friend lent me, but it is not the same quality. The larger end pushes into the handle everytime. I fixed it by making an inner rim with a hot glue gun, but next time will just get the Konad double stamper.</li>
            <li> I did not pay much for this item but I had ordered a different one before for about the same price and the one I got this time was very cheaply put together.</li>
            <li> kinda squishy n sticky</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really transfer the image that well. You pay for what you get I guess. Just bought this until I could find my good stuff in storage. Wouldn&#x27;t do it again.</li>
            <li> The stamper is horrible. The large stamp part pushes in and goes sideways when trying to stamp. The plastic scraper does not work...it&#x27;s uneven. Glad I didn&#x27;t pay much for it.</li>
            <li> Honestly I don&#x27;t know why I thought this stamper may not have been good but I decided to try it out anyway and was pleasantly surprised. It works like a charm. I have even put aside my other stampers and use this one only. I am pretty new at stamping but this stamper really makes the job the least frustrating. You guys did a great job making this stamper. Thanks a lot!!!</li>
            <li> Not the best stamper but works ok for beginners</li>
            <li> My only name brand stamper and my least favorite.  The rubber falls out of the tube more often than not and when it doesn&#x27;t it gets pushed back into the tube.  Even after priming it a few times it doesn&#x27;t pick up images very well.</li>
            <li> The stamped broke the first time I used it. The larger end got pushed in all the way. Can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> used it twice and it broke. Won&#x27;t be purchasing this product again</li>
            <li> This does what its supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;If u use bigger designs you will want to have a bigger stamper.&lt;br /&gt;but this works just as well for your smaller images.&lt;br /&gt;Prep your rubber before using (youtube has great tutorials)</li>
            <li> Bummed. Too much pressure when picking up the design causes the end to push up into the handle and only the large end worked for me. Small end doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> These, with the pink stamping pad, are better than other stamps with the white pad.  They are not sticky, the image transfers better and picks up images better.  I bought 4...and am buying 4 more!</li>
            <li> This is a really great product.</li>
