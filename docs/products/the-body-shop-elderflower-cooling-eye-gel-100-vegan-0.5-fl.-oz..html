            <li> Not as cooling as I hoped for, and not really moisturizing either.</li>
            <li> the Chinese buy it by the case because they are in on the big secret.  </li>
            <li> Also helped with my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I get horrible eye allergies during the Spring, and I also keep this in the fridge-really nice calming effect from the redness and itching.</li>
            <li> In addition to getting rid of the baggy eyes and dark circles, the elderflower is also a secret natural version of Viagra (seriously!)</li>
            <li> Just a touch of it, and you feel your eye&#x27;s delicate skin absorving it inmediatelly.</li>

            <li> In addition to getting rid of the baggy eyes and dark circles, the elderflower is also a secret natural version of Viagra (seriously!)... the Chinese buy it by the case because they are in on the big secret.  I keep mine in the fridge because it feels good on my eyes (yes, my eyes) before I go to sleep.  I wake up and look a lot better in the morning!</li>
            <li> I bought this to try when my favorite cooling moisturizing eye cream was discontinued, and it just doesn&#x27;t live up. Not as cooling as I hoped for, and not really moisturizing either. It&#x27;s just okay, nothing special.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS, STILL WORKS,KEEP IN FRIDGE FOR FAST ACTION EACH DAY!</li>
            <li> Product provides an immediate cool sensation on irritated, allergy prone eyes. Does it come in a larger container?</li>
            <li> It feels good but I haven&#x27;t see any visible effects.</li>
            <li> I love love love this eye gel. It help reduce puffiness and is very light. Use it every morning and every night</li>
            <li> Received as a gift, ANOTHER product I will purchase for myself. I get horrible eye allergies during the Spring, and I also keep this in the fridge-really nice calming effect from the redness and itching. Also helped comfort my stye when I wasn&#x27;t using warm compresses.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years. It is not greasy and is cooling and soothing on the eyes.</li>
            <li> High end product, I feel the skin become soft after using, like face returned to 18 years old, is very good</li>
            <li> It smells good and the cooling sensation is great but it does seem to fade quickly. Overall a lifesaver for trying to sleep during allergy season.</li>
            <li> i am using this now ,pretty good.make my eyes moist&lt;br /&gt;i think i should use every day in order to works well</li>
            <li> It works great for poof allergy eyes. Also helped with my dark circles.  Shipping was quick.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely satisfied!</li>
            <li> this eye gel makes my eyes&#x27; skin very smooth and cool, i like it, it&#x27;s totally worth the price, but when i got this item, the bar code has been scraped.</li>
            <li> A truly superior eye gel  - if you put in the frig in summertime - use in the am or pm and you will feel depuffed and ready for&lt;br /&gt;day or night  - have enjoyed for years and it really works - love it and reorder it - really good product</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine, although the amount is not so much. And the overall view of this product looks almost good. It was recommended by my friends.</li>
            <li> nothing special. I will not buy again</li>
            <li> Light, fresh and smooth... Nothing like it! Different, a touch of freshness around the eyes. Just a touch of it, and you feel your eye&#x27;s delicate skin absorving it inmediatelly.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to have the effect it advertised.</li>
    </ol>
