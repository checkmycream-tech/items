    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>this is the best thing.</li>
            <li>Perfect tool for any barber...  </li>
            <li>Around $55 would be great.</li>
            <li>they work great,</li>
            <li>Very nice without the cord.</li>
            <li>I am really loving these clippers!</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Holds a good charge.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with the cordless magic clippers</li>
            <li>Works great but needs a better description.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It works amazingly well and holds a charge for almost 2 hours.  </li>
            <li>But most barbers dont use just ONE clippers so its good for what it is.</li>
            <li>Would be nice</li>
            <li>Would be nice if the battery were user replaceable.</li>
            <li>but I bought these clippers to cut my own hair and also while I&#x27;m away from home cut some of my units hair also.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
            <li>These are easy to use, hold, and hold their charge!</li>
            <li>5 stars for being a great tool for light and quick grooming.</li>
            <li>As a barber I would recommend it for most cuts.</li>
            <li>Works better than my magic clips, I wouldn&#x27;t replace seniors for this.</li>
            <li>I tried the cordless designers in comparison and more hairs got snagged on the designer than the sterlings.</li>
            <li>I got the Magic clippers after.</li>
            <li>I used the Andis Master as my adjustable blade clipper for many years and then switched to the Wahl Senior a couple years ago.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Everything i thought it would be and more</li>
            <li>I love wahl.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research on these clippers and by far I think this a great price for what you get.</li>
            <li>Not recommended to cut strong bulk of hair...</li>
            <li>must say the Cordless Sterling 4 is a great general purpose clipper.  </li>
            <li>but I think the manufacturer&#x27;s claims are probably accurate.  </li>
            <li>One pass is all that is necessary and greatly reduces time trimming my hair and beard.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic brand and clipper.  </li>
            <li>I have gone through 4 different cordless rechargeable clippers and these are by far the best ones.  </li>
            <li>When I travel light I have brought only the sterling with the full set of guards and have been very satisfied with its performance.  </li>
            <li>If this will be your primary/only adjustable blade clipper and you will use it for several cuts a day, I think it would be a good idea to get two, then you can wait until the battery is depleted before recharging (fewer recharge cycles should prolong battery life)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>the sterling has no grip at all and feels like it&#x27;s gonna slip right out of my hand</li>
            <li>I wonder how long does the battery last for 2 or three years I would be happy.</li>
            <li>(I normally don&#x27;t use it for every part of every haircut in my shop; I also have and use a full detachable blade Oster</li>
            <li>I also find the clipper doesn&#x27;t get hot like the Senior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also find the clipper doesn&#x27;t get hot like the Senior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still running on the first charge.</li>
            <li>The connector for charging is large enough that it is easy to clean and seems not to corrode as easy as the smaller connectors most of the other units i have purchased did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m pretty much bald</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is unfortunately no warning light to let you know if the battery is running low.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great to do flat tops and other detail work without having a cord to wrangle.  </li>
            <li>Very sharp, easy clean up.</li>
            <li>It also not making that much noise like the Wahl clipper with cord</li>
            <li>Nothing special about these, I have the cordless designer and the only difference is</li>
            <li>They feel like high quality clippers.  </li>
            <li>Powerful, battery last about 5 haircuts each charge.</li>
            <li>I much prefer this blade because its the same one that comes with the seniors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took me a few days to get used to how light this clipper is.  </li>
            <li>They are very convenient just because I can take them anywhere and at my current location</li>
            <li>the battery charge last about a week or so depending on how much you use them.</li>
            <li>wow works</li>
            <li>I recently used this clipper at a St. Baldrick&#x27;s event and fully buzzed down 10 full heads of hair before the motor started to slow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I expected them to feel lighter and &amp;#34;plastic like&amp;#34; but they felt very professional in the hand.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback is that it&#x27;s a little large for trimming (like around the ears).</li>

            <li> I am using it almost everyday on my clients hair, 2-3 times. The battery is holding at least 1 week. I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s sometimes not catching a few hairs. The design is not the newest look. It also not making that much noise like the Wahl clipper with cord</li>
            <li> Has the same blade as the cordless designer. This machine is over price</li>
            <li> I have gone through 4 different cordless rechargeable clippers and these are by far the best ones.  The connector for charging is large enough that it is easy to clean and seems not to corrode as easy as the smaller connectors most of the other units i have purchased did. This little guy has plenty of power to last too.</li>
            <li> Powerful, battery last about 5 haircuts each charge. Very nice without the cord. Love it! It could be a little cheaper. Around $55 would be great. I wonder how long does the battery last for 2 or three years I would be happy.</li>
            <li> Good product. As a barber I would recommend it for most cuts. Works better than my magic clips, I wouldn&#x27;t replace seniors for this. But most barbers dont use just ONE clippers so its good for what it is. My coworker got the cordless designer the ONLY difference between this and the designers are the blades it comes with. I much prefer this blade because its the same one that comes with the seniors. I tried the cordless designers in comparison and more hairs got snagged on the designer than the sterlings.</li>
            <li> Every time I tried doing a skin fade, the blade would poke the skin. Make it bleed. I got the Magic clippers after. I&#x27;m really happy with the cordless magic clippers</li>
            <li> Cuts through my hair like butter.  One pass is all that is necessary and greatly reduces time trimming my hair and beard.  I&#x27;ve only had to charge this thing once in 2 months and I trim something, whether it be my beard or head at least every other day.  Quality trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a barber for 12 years.  I used the Andis Master as my adjustable blade clipper for many years and then switched to the Wahl Senior a couple years ago.  I&#x27;ve been using the Rechargeable Sterling 4 for almost a month now and I love it.  In fact, my Senior is now packed away in a drawer and will probably not be used again anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say the Cordless Sterling 4 is a great general purpose clipper.  When I travel light I have brought only the sterling with the full set of guards and have been very satisfied with its performance.  (I normally don&#x27;t use it for every part of every haircut in my shop; I also have and use a full detachable blade Oster 76 set-up.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never timed the battery life but I think the manufacturer&#x27;s claims are probably accurate.  I find the battery will get me through about half of my workday.  I recently used this clipper at a St. Baldrick&#x27;s event and fully buzzed down 10 full heads of hair before the motor started to slow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is unfortunately no warning light to let you know if the battery is running low.  The only indication you get that you&#x27;re about to run out of juice is that the motor will start to slow.  I find this happens about 2 minutes before the clipper shuts off.  If the battery runs out you can plug in, wait a moment, and then go back to cutting with the cord attached.  I ended up getting two of these clippers, so one is charging/charged while the other is in use.  If I&#x27;m cutting somewhere an outlet isn&#x27;t handy (like an event) it&#x27;s reassuring to know I have an extra charged up.  If this will be your primary/only adjustable blade clipper and you will use it for several cuts a day, I think it would be a good idea to get two, then you can wait until the battery is depleted before recharging (fewer recharge cycles should prolong battery life)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me a few days to get used to how light this clipper is.  Now I use it for anything 000-1.5  It&#x27;s also great to do flat tops and other detail work without having a cord to wrangle.  I also find the clipper doesn&#x27;t get hot like the Senior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this will be your primary/only adjustable blade clipper and you will use it for several cuts a day, I think it would be a good idea to get two, then you can wait until the battery is depleted before recharging (fewer recharge cycles should prolong battery life).  You will also extend performance if you oil before/after every cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only other complaint about this clipper is you&#x27;ll have to send the clipper in to have the battery replaced.  Hopefully it&#x27;ll be a year or two before that&#x27;s necessary.  Would be nice if the battery were user replaceable.and other detail work without having a cord to wrangle.

            <li> Feels like a plastic toy. Not  powerful, cant be adjusted and definately not worth the price!! Keep your corded senior!</li>
            <li> Must have in the barber shop.</li>
            <li> Holds a good charge. So far I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
            <li> I have used  WAHL clippers for years and haven&#x27;t had any complaints.  However, I bought this product and after about a year it stopped working.  I put it in the garbage and now I am on Amazon shopping for another one.  I will probably get another WAHL but not this one.</li>
            <li> I am really loving these clippers! I expected them to feel lighter and &amp;#34;plastic like&amp;#34; but they felt very professional in the hand.  They feel like high quality clippers.  It works amazingly well and holds a charge for almost 2 hours.  Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I am not a professional barber but I bought these clippers to cut my own hair and also while I&#x27;m away from home cut some of my units hair also. They are very convenient just because I can take them anywhere and at my current location this is the best thing. they work great, the battery charge last about a week or so depending on how much you use them. I did a lot of research on these clippers and by far I think this a great price for what you get.</li>
            <li> Works like a champ.  Have cut my hair 4 or 5 times on the same charge.  Very sharp, easy clean up. Quiet.</li>
            <li> I have had these clippers for a year using them only at home. It no longer charges up. I have to plug it in. I did not buy if from Amazon. Would not buy again. Just got a bad pair, I guess. Other than that, I like the weight and not having to use a cord. (till now).</li>
            <li> Works great but needs a better description. Guide combs are included! I bought an extra set for no reason.</li>
            <li> Perfect tool for any barber...  no cord to worry about being tangled up with the rest of your work area</li>
            <li> 5 stars for being a great tool for light and quick grooming. Not recommended to cut strong bulk of hair...</li>
            <li> wow works well i would  reccomend to any one who is looking  to buy one</li>
            <li> Everything i thought it would be and more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for 4 months and it&#x27;s still running on the first charge. I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m pretty much bald so I buzz cut what I have. I use it about 3 times a week but that includes my beard also. The only drawback is that it&#x27;s a little large for trimming (like around the ears). A cheapy from Walmart handles that task. This is a heavy duty piece of equipment so if you have several heads to cut this is the machine for you. It will pay for itself in no time.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brand and clipper.  I love wahl. These are easy to use, hold, and hold their charge!</li>
            <li> Nothing special about these, I have the cordless designer and the only difference is the sterling has no grip at all and feels like it&#x27;s gonna slip right out of my hand especially when you get hair on it, not worth the extra $25,just stick with the designers.</li>
            <li> Not to power and overprized clipper.....This toy for home use, but not for professionals !!!!!!!!!</li>
