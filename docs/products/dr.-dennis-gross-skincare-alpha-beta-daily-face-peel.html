            <li>Lovely lovely stuff!  </li>
            <li>I swear by these peel pads, they keep my sensitive skin flawless.</li>
            <li>I am very fair, sensitive and I absolutely love these!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love!</li>
            <li>The regular is just perfect.</li>
            <li>I tried products from the department store and more affordable things from walmart.  </li>
            <li>Then I started to notice that that my completion became more even.</li>
            <li>I love it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>My skin is better than it has ever been.  </li>
            <li>Sleep with Dr. Dennis Gross Correct and Perfect Spot treatment if I think a pimple is forming...but never does....    </li>
            <li>the price on Amazon, especially with the subscription service, is the best around.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels noticeably better when I use this once a week at night.&lt;br</li>
            <li>aha peels and Dr. Gross is one of the best out of all that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>my Obagi regimen and my skin has never been better.  </li>
            <li>Ive worked with many skin care lines over the years and have done my research.</li>
            <li>I read many of the reviews on this product and talked to a representative at Sephora in the mall.  </li>
            <li>No primers, even the top $100 brands help cover it.  </li>
            <li>My skin is tighter, my complexion is better and there&#x27;s not a wrinkle anywhere.</li>
            <li>It took me 2-3 more days to realize that burning was from this</li>
            <li>I am on Solodyn prescription too, so I am not quite sure if the results are from this peel or from Solodyn.</li>
            <li>Amazon seems to have a better price than my dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>This is my first review to post..on anything!!!</li>
            <li>However, SUPER bummed that the price was jacked up and wont be able to buy again!</li>
            <li>It is an amazing product weather you are looking for a daily exfoliator or a great acne treatment.</li>
            <li>I was able to easily return it however and get a refund from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Most skin care ingredients are dirt cheap, nothing in these pads justifies the price.</li>
            <li>Honestly, after three days I was sold... and after the two weeks, my laugh lines were practically gone and my skin had a radiance I&#x27;ve never gotten from a moisturizer, serum, mask, etc.</li>
            <li>The cheap salicylic acid scrubbing pads I buy at the grocery store are more effective in treating my acne and giving my skin a fresh clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>The 60 count in the subscribe and save was such a great price.</li>
            <li>The product itself is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This products makes your skin look and feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>The results are truly visible and my face looked poreless, smooth and brighter</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how great this product is.  </li>
            <li>I received a free sample (3 applications) from Sephora about two weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Warning - I  tried the same product that has a tanning component -the tanning is very effective</li>
            <li>Really loved this product the first time around because it really worked.</li>
            <li>women we are worth it!</li>
            <li>Love it so much!</li>
            <li>I feel really clean after using on my face.</li>
            <li>but it still does an amazing job of making my face feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I liked the ingredients because I was looking for a more complete and stronger acid that would still be gentle.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has helped to control the oil (in combination with a light moisturizer) and with nightly use has kept me pretty much free from breakouts for three months now.</li>
            <li>I have always had great skin my whole life until I recently got off birth control.  </li>
            <li>Use adequate moisturizer and skip a day if your skin feels irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pads are convenient and easy to use &#x3D; FAST.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I hoped for!  </li>
            <li>Dr. Dennis Gross has come up with an amazing product...</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I still look young, I&#x27;m sure when I&#x27;m in my mid-20&#x27;s pimples will be the thing of the past\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Keeps skin fresh, with clear pores and healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>I started the lower strength (I bought them at Nordstrom in Kansas City), the more \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; version of this peel over a week ago</li>
            <li>I think they&#x27;re worth it.</li>
            <li>Quick fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I was looking for a gentle daily exfoliator, what I got was not only a great exfoliator but an amazing treatment for my adult acne.</li>
            <li>I expected to see more skin toning and eveness in my clean but have yet to see it.</li>
            <li>I first came into contact with this product at a Nordstrom at of course a higher price.</li>
            <li>I have seen my pore size diminish and notice skin is much softer!</li>
            <li>You wash your face first</li>
            <li>I love this product, it is my second time purchasing</li>
            <li>I may try the maximum strength A&amp;B peel next time. :)</li>
            <li>My skin is clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>I still have hyperpigmented laugh lines but not as much I&#x27;d say it diminished my spots about 40% .</li>
            <li>I just found it drying with no exfoliation which is exactly what I did not need.</li>
            <li>This is gentle enough for me. :-)</li>
            <li>I first bought the two-week trial version of this product at the suggestion of an employee of a certain beauty-related mall chain store.</li>
            <li>After the first application, my face was unbelievably smooth, never dry.</li>
            <li>Tried using just once a week just could not see any positive results</li>
            <li>I use it every day for that clean feeling of starting fresh each day.  </li>
            <li>It leaves skin fresh, even and new.  </li>
            <li>(apparently it is 4x the strength of the daily peels) and it was amazing.  </li>
            <li>For some people the alpha hydroxy acid daily face peel may be too strong.</li>
            <li>My skin tone looks better but my dark laugh lines are still there.</li>
            <li>recommendations from that smart lady</li>
            <li>I had to find a better way to exfoliate my dry skin without buying peels like this--it just was not practical!  </li>
            <li>I tried this product a few years ago and thought it was great; I was younger and didn&#x27;t feel I needed it and also couldn&#x27;t afford it.</li>
            <li>just looks so much cleaner and smoother.</li>
            <li>I still have a ways to go, but this product has really made a difference after yrs of frustration and embarrassment.</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY</li>
            <li>Combined with prescription Retin A in the evening, these two products have really changed the texture and look of my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference in how my skin looks.</li>
            <li>I alternate every night between this &amp; the advanced formula.  </li>
            <li>Really like how my skin feels.</li>
            <li>The pads make it really convenient to use for those that don&#x27;t want to fumble with skincare.</li>
            <li>This was ok but not what I expected.</li>
            <li>Its been a month of usage now and I haven&#x27;t seen a whole lot of change</li>
            <li>My wife loves this so much that she bought it for our daughter too, and once her friend tried it she too is hooked</li>
            <li>and *gasp* put on some real clothes...do something for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really, you are.</li>
            <li>Before using this product I had fairly oily skin, a very minor acne problem and a lot of minor blackheads on and around my nose.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First learned about this product at The Ritz Carlton Spa in New Orleans.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit nervous because it is more than I usually spend on a face care product but figured it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li>My acne did not improve, my spots did not fade, and my skin felt as ordinary as it does with a splash of warm water.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been thrilled at how it&#x27;s turning my skin over without excessive drying or peeling.  </li>
            <li>I do cut them in half sometimes to stretch them, and it&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>I use it daily, and I have smooth soft skin.</li>
            <li>and i was sucked in by a high price tag and promises galore.</li>
            <li>I had very noticeable largish pores on my nose, and these have considerably improved so that I have a finer texture all over.</li>
            <li>Def keeper and worth the extra money!!</li>
            <li>They are coming back in a month to do complimentary body peels and I am already signed up for those.</li>
            <li>know $128...or $60 is a lot to spend on a product for yourself, but at the risk of sounding like a Loreal commercial, YOU&#x27;RE WORTH IT.  </li>
            <li>A few months later, I tried it again and it didn&#x27;t seem as effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m reluctant to try the extra strength product because I feel like I would just be throwing away more money that I could have spent at a dermatologist and a medi spa.</li>
            <li>And a HIGH SPF too, as the ingredients in this product will make your skin to sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li>Also, I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I felt like it left my skin looking refreshed, helped clear some pimples, and left my skin feeling very soft and smooth to the touch.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t spend your money on a professional face peel!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: The pads definitely provide some benefits if you use them consistently but don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
            <li>After the first use my skin got softer and smoother, after about a week no more new breakouts, after a month my skin was completely clear and new acne scars were gone and old ones were significantly lightened.</li>
            <li>But I recently consumed some oily food and noticed 2 new breakouts of which one healed pretty quickly and the other one is in the process.</li>
            <li>I even went to the dermatologist but those products were harsh and made me very sensitive to sun light, which affected my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I have always had clear skin, then at 26 I started to have breakouts.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s old ways without the product.</li>
            <li>However when I turned 21yrs old, and still had acne, I thought to myself \\&quot;Well...</li>
            <li>It has helped fade sun damage &amp; restores my skin&#x27;s natural vibrancy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 49 and still suffer from frequent nodular acne on my chin and cheeks.  </li>
            <li>And the Retinol makes my face sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li>Makes skin sensitive to sun.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a busy mom of 3 and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it, especially with the price that amazon offers.</li>
            <li>The first few days I got very excited and started using this everyday after reading the reviews online.</li>
            <li>My skin looks ten years older</li>
            <li>Most of these super expensive over the counter peels you can buy at the beauty store do not contain a high enough percentage of acid at the proper PH for any exfoliation to occur.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d pay full price, even if it killed me...</li>
            <li>the other day and the Dr. Gross specialists were there from NY and were doing free facial peels.  </li>
            <li>I have a very oily T-zone and dry skin everywhere else on my face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I gently wash and dry my face as normal.&lt;br /&gt;-Wipe</li>
            <li>I tried the Extra Strength version of the AB Daily Face Peel, and I didn&#x27;t like it as much.</li>
            <li>Within one week it had completely cleared up my face and within two it had helped with the chest and back acne as well.  </li>
            <li>and if you&#x27;re sensitive to the sun, only use it at night.</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;ve been getting my old self back.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I even skip a day to let my skin alone for awhile, but overall I couldn&#x27;t live without the daily peel and the nightly retin a!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>My face isn&#x27;t as rough as it used to be, my pores dont look as large and overall my skin</li>
            <li>much lower than other stores and the product truly makes a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>The past few years through my 40&#x27;s and now a year into my 50&#x27;s my skin is more sensitive than ever, with hormonal breakouts.  </li>
            <li>The active Vitamin D added to my Vivier Lexxel moisturizer is really improving my skin which after just a day or two was significantly not dry!  </li>
            <li>I tried a couple of different methods, changed facial washes, did natural oil cleansing method, and nothing worked.  </li>
            <li>hope this is not extreme optimism, but I think I see my scars lightening in the last 2 months.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 30s with dry to combination skin.</li>
            <li>That may sound cheesy or far fetched</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Sleep with Dr. Dennis Gross Correct and Perfect Spot treatment if I think a pimple is forming...but never does....    </li>
            <li> the price on Amazon, especially with the subscription service, is the best around.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels noticeably better when I use this once a week at night.&lt;br</li>
            <li> aha peels and Dr. Gross is one of the best out of all that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> my Obagi regimen and my skin has never been better.  </li>
            <li> Ive worked with many skin care lines over the years and have done my research.</li>
            <li> I read many of the reviews on this product and talked to a representative at Sephora in the mall.  </li>
            <li> No primers, even the top $100 brands help cover it.  </li>
            <li> My skin is tighter, my complexion is better and there&#x27;s not a wrinkle anywhere.</li>
            <li> It took me 2-3 more days to realize that burning was from this</li>
            <li> I am on Solodyn prescription too, so I am not quite sure if the results are from this peel or from Solodyn.</li>
            <li> Amazon seems to have a better price than my dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> This is my first review to post..on anything!!!</li>
            <li> However, SUPER bummed that the price was jacked up and wont be able to buy again!</li>
            <li> It is an amazing product weather you are looking for a daily exfoliator or a great acne treatment.</li>
            <li> I was able to easily return it however and get a refund from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Most skin care ingredients are dirt cheap, nothing in these pads justifies the price.</li>
            <li> Honestly, after three days I was sold... and after the two weeks, my laugh lines were practically gone and my skin had a radiance I&#x27;ve never gotten from a moisturizer, serum, mask, etc.</li>
            <li> The cheap salicylic acid scrubbing pads I buy at the grocery store are more effective in treating my acne and giving my skin a fresh clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> The 60 count in the subscribe and save was such a great price.</li>
            <li> The product itself is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This products makes your skin look and feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> The results are truly visible and my face looked poreless, smooth and brighter</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how great this product is.  </li>
            <li> I received a free sample (3 applications) from Sephora about two weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Warning - I  tried the same product that has a tanning component -the tanning is very effective</li>
            <li> Really loved this product the first time around because it really worked.</li>
            <li> women we are worth it!</li>
            <li> Love it so much!</li>
            <li> I feel really clean after using on my face.</li>
            <li> but it still does an amazing job of making my face feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I liked the ingredients because I was looking for a more complete and stronger acid that would still be gentle.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has helped to control the oil (in combination with a light moisturizer) and with nightly use has kept me pretty much free from breakouts for three months now.</li>
            <li> I have always had great skin my whole life until I recently got off birth control.  </li>
            <li> Use adequate moisturizer and skip a day if your skin feels irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pads are convenient and easy to use &#x3D; FAST.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I hoped for!  </li>
            <li> Dr. Dennis Gross has come up with an amazing product...</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I still look young, I&#x27;m sure when I&#x27;m in my mid-20&#x27;s pimples will be the thing of the past\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Keeps skin fresh, with clear pores and healthy glow.  </li>
            <li> I started the lower strength (I bought them at Nordstrom in Kansas City), the more \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; version of this peel over a week ago</li>
            <li> I think they&#x27;re worth it.</li>
            <li> Quick fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was looking for a gentle daily exfoliator, what I got was not only a great exfoliator but an amazing treatment for my adult acne.</li>
            <li> I expected to see more skin toning and eveness in my clean but have yet to see it.</li>
            <li> I first came into contact with this product at a Nordstrom at of course a higher price.</li>
            <li> I have seen my pore size diminish and notice skin is much softer!</li>
            <li> You wash your face first</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is my second time purchasing</li>
            <li> I may try the maximum strength A&amp;B peel next time. :)</li>
            <li> My skin is clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> I still have hyperpigmented laugh lines but not as much I&#x27;d say it diminished my spots about 40% .</li>
            <li> I just found it drying with no exfoliation which is exactly what I did not need.</li>
            <li> This is gentle enough for me. :-)</li>
            <li> I first bought the two-week trial version of this product at the suggestion of an employee of a certain beauty-related mall chain store.</li>
            <li> After the first application, my face was unbelievably smooth, never dry.</li>
            <li> Tried using just once a week just could not see any positive results</li>
            <li> I use it every day for that clean feeling of starting fresh each day.  </li>
            <li> It leaves skin fresh, even and new.  </li>
            <li> (apparently it is 4x the strength of the daily peels) and it was amazing.  </li>
            <li> For some people the alpha hydroxy acid daily face peel may be too strong.</li>
            <li> My skin tone looks better but my dark laugh lines are still there.</li>
            <li> recommendations from that smart lady</li>
            <li> I had to find a better way to exfoliate my dry skin without buying peels like this--it just was not practical!  </li>
            <li> I tried this product a few years ago and thought it was great; I was younger and didn&#x27;t feel I needed it and also couldn&#x27;t afford it.</li>
            <li> just looks so much cleaner and smoother.</li>
            <li> I still have a ways to go, but this product has really made a difference after yrs of frustration and embarrassment.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY</li>
            <li> Combined with prescription Retin A in the evening, these two products have really changed the texture and look of my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference in how my skin looks.</li>
            <li> I alternate every night between this &amp; the advanced formula.  </li>
            <li> Really like how my skin feels.</li>
            <li> The pads make it really convenient to use for those that don&#x27;t want to fumble with skincare.</li>
            <li> This was ok but not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Its been a month of usage now and I haven&#x27;t seen a whole lot of change</li>
            <li> My wife loves this so much that she bought it for our daughter too, and once her friend tried it she too is hooked</li>
            <li> and *gasp* put on some real clothes...do something for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really, you are.</li>
            <li> Before using this product I had fairly oily skin, a very minor acne problem and a lot of minor blackheads on and around my nose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First learned about this product at The Ritz Carlton Spa in New Orleans.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous because it is more than I usually spend on a face care product but figured it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li> My acne did not improve, my spots did not fade, and my skin felt as ordinary as it does with a splash of warm water.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been thrilled at how it&#x27;s turning my skin over without excessive drying or peeling.  </li>
            <li> I do cut them in half sometimes to stretch them, and it&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li> I use it daily, and I have smooth soft skin.</li>
            <li> and i was sucked in by a high price tag and promises galore.</li>
            <li> I had very noticeable largish pores on my nose, and these have considerably improved so that I have a finer texture all over.</li>
            <li> Def keeper and worth the extra money!!</li>
            <li> They are coming back in a month to do complimentary body peels and I am already signed up for those.</li>
            <li> know $128...or $60 is a lot to spend on a product for yourself, but at the risk of sounding like a Loreal commercial, YOU&#x27;RE WORTH IT.  </li>
            <li> A few months later, I tried it again and it didn&#x27;t seem as effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reluctant to try the extra strength product because I feel like I would just be throwing away more money that I could have spent at a dermatologist and a medi spa.</li>
            <li> And a HIGH SPF too, as the ingredients in this product will make your skin to sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li> Also, I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I felt like it left my skin looking refreshed, helped clear some pimples, and left my skin feeling very soft and smooth to the touch.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend your money on a professional face peel!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: The pads definitely provide some benefits if you use them consistently but don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
            <li> After the first use my skin got softer and smoother, after about a week no more new breakouts, after a month my skin was completely clear and new acne scars were gone and old ones were significantly lightened.</li>
            <li> But I recently consumed some oily food and noticed 2 new breakouts of which one healed pretty quickly and the other one is in the process.</li>
            <li> I even went to the dermatologist but those products were harsh and made me very sensitive to sun light, which affected my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I have always had clear skin, then at 26 I started to have breakouts.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s old ways without the product.</li>
            <li> However when I turned 21yrs old, and still had acne, I thought to myself \\&quot;Well...</li>
            <li> It has helped fade sun damage &amp; restores my skin&#x27;s natural vibrancy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 49 and still suffer from frequent nodular acne on my chin and cheeks.  </li>
            <li> And the Retinol makes my face sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li> Makes skin sensitive to sun.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a busy mom of 3 and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend it, especially with the price that amazon offers.</li>
            <li> The first few days I got very excited and started using this everyday after reading the reviews online.</li>
            <li> My skin looks ten years older</li>
            <li> Most of these super expensive over the counter peels you can buy at the beauty store do not contain a high enough percentage of acid at the proper PH for any exfoliation to occur.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d pay full price, even if it killed me...</li>
            <li> the other day and the Dr. Gross specialists were there from NY and were doing free facial peels.  </li>
            <li> I have a very oily T-zone and dry skin everywhere else on my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I gently wash and dry my face as normal.&lt;br /&gt;-Wipe</li>
            <li> I tried the Extra Strength version of the AB Daily Face Peel, and I didn&#x27;t like it as much.</li>
            <li> Within one week it had completely cleared up my face and within two it had helped with the chest and back acne as well.  </li>
            <li> and if you&#x27;re sensitive to the sun, only use it at night.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve been getting my old self back.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I even skip a day to let my skin alone for awhile, but overall I couldn&#x27;t live without the daily peel and the nightly retin a!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> My face isn&#x27;t as rough as it used to be, my pores dont look as large and overall my skin</li>
            <li> much lower than other stores and the product truly makes a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> The past few years through my 40&#x27;s and now a year into my 50&#x27;s my skin is more sensitive than ever, with hormonal breakouts.  </li>
            <li> The active Vitamin D added to my Vivier Lexxel moisturizer is really improving my skin which after just a day or two was significantly not dry!  </li>
            <li> I tried a couple of different methods, changed facial washes, did natural oil cleansing method, and nothing worked.  </li>
            <li> hope this is not extreme optimism, but I think I see my scars lightening in the last 2 months.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30s with dry to combination skin.</li>
            <li> That may sound cheesy or far fetched</li>
            <li> but I always use full pads if I&#x27;m tired</li>
            <li> In between facials and in the winter-- i get a lot of dry patches on my face that my regular toner cannot get rid of.  </li>
            <li> : using the pads every day can sometimes irritate your face especially if the weather is dry.</li>
            <li> As a mom of a toddler, I am on a limited budget, but these pads are my essential!</li>
            <li> The first few times it began to sting slightly by the end of two minutes.  </li>
            <li> I have very dark acne scars and rough skin, but this peel has faded the dark spots on my skin so that now i can actually see my real skin tone which I haven&#x27;t seen in years.</li>
            <li> I purchases these years ago long before i had any training in the beauty industry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in &amp;#34;mom mode&amp;#34; for as long as I can remember now.  </li>
            <li> I actually cut these pads in half to make them last longer, I do think they work</li>
            <li> I use the facial pads with other products as well...</li>
            <li> I have compromised other skin care products, like cleansers and moisterizers, but this is my only must!!</li>
            <li> My skin care specialist recommends that after two months use (I am almost there) I should cut back to using every other day.  </li>
            <li> In the winter if my face feels really dry</li>
            <li> no new breakouts.  </li>
            <li> and yet NO NEW BREAKOUTS.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 34 yr old African-American and have had problems with acne for the past 20 yrs.  </li>
            <li> I am 41 and starting to have slight rosacea, dry patches, and break-outs.  </li>
            <li> You will get the same results for half the price.</li>
            <li> if u close the jar tightly immediately after taking out a pad it lasts the entire time.</li>
            <li> I have extremely tight pores and cannot relieve a pimple without damaging my skin and leaving a purple mark that last for months.  </li>
            <li> The price back when I purchased it was reasonable, but now it is too expensive in my opinion for the generated results.</li>
            <li> Clarisonic is definitely worth a look for those that are wary of spending $100</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products I would actually repurchase.</li>
            <li> If used nightly after washing, I really do not break out.</li>
            <li> Be really careful about getting out in the sun when you&#x27;ve used this product in the morning</li>
            <li> As a teenage my skin was so bad I used to pop pimples as a pass-time, but always figured when I become an adult I will outgrow acne and have clear skin like all adults.  </li>
            <li> which many studies have already found to be dangerous!</li>
            <li> This product is one of two items I never go without--the other is Renova, a prescription retinoid, which my dermotologist prescribes.  </li>
            <li> Other imperfections have also diminished or disappeared.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using it every other day until your skin adapts to it.</li>
            <li> After looking into other alternatives I discovered the miracle of the Clarisonic brush.  </li>
            <li> They work extremely well with</li>
            <li> After that, my hormones were extremely out of whack.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m guessing there have to be other moms out there</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;d have to put extra thick moisturizers over to mask the dryness.  </li>
            <li> and it is less than half the price on Amazon vs. Nordstrom.  </li>
            <li> The pads have also slightly reduced the appearance of the pores on and around my nose and helped to even my skin tone a little.</li>
            <li> NOT if you have delicate skin, dry skin, or aging skin.</li>
            <li> That little improvement makes me want to put a little makeup on in the morning</li>
            <li> so it comes out unevenly.</li>
            <li> I still get a pimple now and again, but definitely not as many as before.</li>
            <li> I get lazy and stop using it and within a week the problems start to return.</li>
            <li> Also, I know some ppl have complained about them drying out before they&#x27;ve used them all, but I&#x27;ve found that</li>
            <li> who know what I mean.  </li>
            <li> Sadly I did not have the results other people have.</li>
            <li> Im not a fan of any peels or other products that come on pads because the company gets away with selling you a small amount of solution for a crazy price.</li>
            <li> If I use products that are too drying, such as benzoil peroxide, I peel horribly, with patches of skin peeling and a mess under my makeup.  </li>
            <li> However I was desperate and did a little research on him when I came across these face peel pads.  </li>
            <li> irritating to the skin even with repeated use.</li>
            <li> The results are dramatic and I noticed changes after just two days.</li>
            <li> By then I&#x27;ve tried ProActiv, prescriptions from dermatologists, expensive facials at spas, baking soda (home remedy), witch hazel</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s difficult to spread the wipes evenly over your face and neck area or wherever you want to tan</li>
            <li> However, after shelling out hundreds of dollars buying this product I realized that this remedy was just way too expensive over time.  </li>
            <li> The ones sold over here were of questionable authenticity (as per the reviews) that I did not want to risk it.  </li>
            <li> (Incidentally I got it on Amazon for $60, it&#x27;s $128 at Sephora - sorry,</li>
            <li> (hey...I was REALLY DESPERATE).  </li>
            <li> Im afraid this product falls under that category.</li>
            <li> I have not had horrible breakouts I usually have.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very expensive, but I don&#x27;t use it every day.</li>
            <li> but they are very expensive.</li>
            <li> I no longer have bad skin</li>
            <li> On really bad days, I get flaky skin on my chin and parts of my forehead that look disgusting up close</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I first came into contact with this product at a Nordstrom at of course a higher price. when I started using it I was hooked. I saw a remarkably difference in my face. The 60 count in the subscribe and save was such a great price. when amazon could no longer sell it at that price I could not afford it for a while. I noticed that my face went back to it&#x27;s old ways without the product. I recently ordered the 30 count. this product truly does what it says. If you can afford to purchase do so. I hope that amazon can reoffer it within the subsribe and save again at some point. The product itself is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while. I just looked at the bottom of the plastic jar and surprisingly found that it is plastic #7 ( containing BPA) which many studies have already found to be dangerous!</li>
            <li> This item is a must-have for my skin care. I apply both of them after I&#x27;ve washed my face in the morning and before I put on any serums or moisturizers. This products makes your skin look and feel so smooth. It gives it a glow. My skin has never looked healthier. I&#x27;m always getting complimented on my skin, which I didn&#x27;t hear when I was younger. This product is one of two items I never go without--the other is Renova, a prescription retinoid, which my dermotologist prescribes.  NOTE: I tried the Extra Strength version of the AB Daily Face Peel, and I didn&#x27;t like it as much. The regular is just perfect.</li>
            <li> I have always had clear skin, then at 26 I started to have breakouts.  Nothing helped the breakouts.  I tried products from the department store and more affordable things from walmart.  I even went to the dermatologist but those products were harsh and made me very sensitive to sun light, which affected my skin tone.  This product reduced the size of my blackheads and pores after one use.  Then I started to notice that that my completion became more even. The results are dramatic and I noticed changes after just two days. This product does not irritate my skin at all.  I love it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use it daily, and I have smooth soft skin.</li>
            <li> I have never reviewed a product before, however, this product is excellent.  My skin is better than it has ever been.  It&#x27;s very expensive, but I don&#x27;t use it every day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 34 yr old African-American and have had problems with acne for the past 20 yrs.  While I still have issues with acne, I can see such a big difference in the way my skin looks and feels. I have very dark acne scars and rough skin, but this peel has faded the dark spots on my skin so that now i can actually see my real skin tone which I haven&#x27;t seen in years. Looks pretty good!  I&#x27;ve been using the peel for almost 2 months and I&#x27;m so happy to see the results. My face isn&#x27;t as rough as it used to be, my pores dont look as large and overall my skin just looks so much cleaner and smoother. I still have a ways to go, but this product has really made a difference after yrs of frustration and embarrassment. I&#x27;d highly recommend it, especially with the price that amazon offers. U can&#x27;t beat it. Also, I know some ppl have complained about them drying out before they&#x27;ve used them all, but I&#x27;ve found that if u close the jar tightly immediately after taking out a pad it lasts the entire time. Actually I still have some of the liquid left over and plan to use it on some cotton pads. Like I said, can&#x27;t be beat. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is the best damn acne medicine out there. As a teenage my skin was so bad I used to pop pimples as a pass-time, but always figured when I become an adult I will outgrow acne and have clear skin like all adults.  However when I turned 21yrs old, and still had acne, I thought to myself \\&quot;Well... I still look young, I&#x27;m sure when I&#x27;m in my mid-20&#x27;s pimples will be the thing of the past\\&quot;.  On my 30th birthday, instead of blowing out 30 candles on a b-day cake I was counting 13 pimples on my face.  By then I&#x27;ve tried ProActiv, prescriptions from dermatologists, expensive facials at spas, baking soda (home remedy), witch hazel....and yes even baby piss (hey...I was REALLY DESPERATE).  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WORKED.  The smartest woman I know, my mom, told me to make an appointment with a dermatologist she heard of in NYC named Dr. Dennis Gross.  I listened but when she said \\&quot;Dr.....and NYC\\&quot; in the same sentence, I knew that meant $$$$. However I was desperate and did a little research on him when I came across these face peel pads.  I told myself it this doesn&#x27;t work I will definitely call and schedule a consultation with the Dr. and give him an in-person critique on his facial pads.    After one week of usage I noticed a total change....no new breakouts.  After 2 weeks my pores minimized.  I thought to myself, \\&quot;In one month my face will gets use to this  and start breaking out like it does with everything else\\&quot;.  Its been about 18 months now.  My 31st b-day passed and I&#x27;m planning my 32nd soon...and yet NO NEW BREAKOUTS.      I use the facial pads with other products as well...recommendations from that smart lady I call Mom.    In the morning:  1.  Wash my face with with Jan Marini&#x27;s Bioglycolic Face Cleanser  2. Use Dr. Gross Alpha Beta face peel pads  3. Use Jan Marini&#x27;s Benzoyl Peroxide 10% acne treatment lotion afterwards  4. Use AMBI fade cream as my moisturizer    At night before bed:  1.  Wash my face with with Jan Marini&#x27;s Bioglycolic Face Cleanser  2. Use Jan Marini&#x27;s Benzoyl Peroxide 10% acne treatment lotion afterwards  3. Dab on Jan Marini&#x27;s Bioglycolic Acne Gel II   4. Sleep with Dr. Dennis Gross Correct and Perfect Spot treatment if I think a pimple is forming...but never does....    In the winter if my face feels really dry I use EMU oil as a moisturizer.  It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores nor break me out.  I hope this was helpful to anyone.  I no longer have bad skin an Im so happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 years. I use it every morning after I shower. Combined with prescription Retin A in the evening, these two products have really changed the texture and look of my skin. I have a very oily T-zone and dry skin everywhere else on my face. I had very noticeable largish pores on my nose, and these have considerably improved so that I have a finer texture all over. Other imperfections have also diminished or disappeared. For some people the alpha hydroxy acid daily face peel may be too strong. I would recommend using it every other day until your skin adapts to it. Sometimes I even skip a day to let my skin alone for awhile, but overall I couldn&#x27;t live without the daily peel and the nightly retin a!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the price on Amazon, especially with the subscription service, is the best around.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product. I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference in how my skin looks. And it feels amazing!</li>
            <li> Just found these lil gems a couple months ago..I have seen my pore size diminish and notice skin is much softer! Def keeper and worth the extra money!!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I alternate every night between this &amp; the advanced formula.  It has helped fade sun damage &amp; restores my skin&#x27;s natural vibrancy.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by a Nordstrom cosmetics  lady to use this daily..... NOT if you have delicate skin, dry skin, or aging skin. It will aggravate all three. However,  used once a week as directed this helps to regenerate and deeply cleanse. My skin looks and feels noticeably better when I use this once a week at night.&lt;br /&gt;Warning - I  tried the same product that has a tanning component -the tanning is very effective but it&#x27;s difficult to spread the wipes evenly over your face and neck area or wherever you want to tan so it comes out unevenly.</li>
            <li> I actually cut these pads in half to make them last longer, I do think they work but they are very expensive.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for awhile. Really like how my skin feels. I feel really clean after using on my face. You wash your face first then u use the peel afterwards.</li>
            <li> IPads make my skin look firmer and pores look smaller. I can definitely tell when I don&#x27;t use these regularly..... My skin looks ten years older</li>
            <li> Quick fast delivery! Very pleased!! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Really loved this product the first time around because it really worked. A few months later, I tried it again and it didn&#x27;t seem as effective. The price back when I purchased it was reasonable, but now it is too expensive in my opinion for the generated results. The pads make it really convenient to use for those that don&#x27;t want to fumble with skincare. I would suggest getting AHA cream in the drugstore for 10% of the cost and works similarly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the AB peel for about a year.  I used it together with my regular Obagi regimen and with retinoids that I got from my dermatologist.  In between facials and in the winter-- i get a lot of dry patches on my face that my regular toner cannot get rid of.  On really bad days, I get flaky skin on my chin and parts of my forehead that look disgusting up close that I&#x27;d have to put extra thick moisturizers over to mask the dryness.  The answer to my problem was aha peels and Dr. Gross is one of the best out of all that I&#x27;ve tried.  However, after shelling out hundreds of dollars buying this product I realized that this remedy was just way too expensive over time.  I had to find a better way to exfoliate my dry skin without buying peels like this--it just was not practical!  After looking into other alternatives I discovered the miracle of the Clarisonic brush.  The initial purchase was pricey at $125 for the Mia 2 on sale at the Clarisonic website.  The ones sold over here were of questionable authenticity (as per the reviews) that I did not want to risk it.  Having used the brush for about 2 months I am very happy with the results.  You shell out the money once (and maybe every 3 months for the brush heads) but it&#x27;s way cheaper than buying the peels.  They work extremely well with my Obagi regimen and my skin has never been better.  Clarisonic is definitely worth a look for those that are wary of spending $100+ every 2 months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I am in my early 30s with dry to combination skin.</li>
            <li> Most of these super expensive over the counter peels you can buy at the beauty store do not contain a high enough percentage of acid at the proper PH for any exfoliation to occur. Im afraid this product falls under that category. Im not a fan of any peels or other products that come on pads because the company gets away with selling you a small amount of solution for a crazy price. Most skin care ingredients are dirt cheap, nothing in these pads justifies the price. Ive worked with many skin care lines over the years and have done my research. I know a price that matches the ingredient list when i see one. This isnt it. I purchases these years ago long before i had any training in the beauty industry and i was sucked in by a high price tag and promises galore. Dont do the same. Manually exfoliate with micro crystals and get yourself a nice glycolic acid toner. You will get the same results for half the price.</li>
            <li> I wish I had this peel years ago.  I use it every day for that clean feeling of starting fresh each day.  My sister-in-law referred it to me and she was told about it by her sister.  It&#x27;s a family tradition now.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I hoped for!  Keeps skin fresh, with clear pores and healthy glow.  I always get compliments when I am using this regularly!</li>
            <li> Once you finish using this product your skin is flawless. It is great if you are having problems with your skin as I was at the time I tried it. I love this product, it is my second time purchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;I had no problems with this seller and everything came on time.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this product after trying it at the Nordstrom makeup counter.  I tend to have problem skin that seems breaks out and have tried lots of products on the market to help with it.  I really liked the way my skin felt after using the peal.  Based on what the sales person said I started by using it daily for 1 week and then scaled back to about 1 or 2 per week.  I felt like it left my skin looking refreshed, helped clear some pimples, and left my skin feeling very soft and smooth to the touch.  This is one of the few products I would actually repurchase.</li>
            <li> Product was great and made my skin feel so smooth after using it.  However, SUPER bummed that the price was jacked up and wont be able to buy again!</li>
            <li> This is my first review to post..on anything!!! I took the time to say two things- these pads are so wonderful, and I think (with sunblock) contribute to great skin! I am very fair, sensitive and I absolutely love these! They make my skin look radiant, and helps with oil/pores. As a mom of a toddler, I am on a limited budget, but these pads are my essential! I have compromised other skin care products, like cleansers and moisterizers, but this is my only must!!</li>
            <li> I tried this product a few years ago and thought it was great; I was younger and didn&#x27;t feel I needed it and also couldn&#x27;t afford it. I am now over 50 and still can&#x27;t afford it but it still does an amazing job of making my face feel soft and smooth.  It is pricey but women we are worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 49 and still suffer from frequent nodular acne on my chin and cheeks.  I have extremely tight pores and cannot relieve a pimple without damaging my skin and leaving a purple mark that last for months.  Some of these marks turned brown years ago and have never faded.  I read many of the reviews on this product and talked to a representative at Sephora in the mall.  I liked the ingredients because I was looking for a more complete and stronger acid that would still be gentle.  I used this product every day for 30 days as directed.  The first few times it began to sting slightly by the end of two minutes.  It does not sting anymore.  It had practically no effect on my skin.  My acne did not improve, my spots did not fade, and my skin felt as ordinary as it does with a splash of warm water.  The cheap salicylic acid scrubbing pads I buy at the grocery store are more effective in treating my acne and giving my skin a fresh clean feeling.  I&#x27;m reluctant to try the extra strength product because I feel like I would just be throwing away more money that I could have spent at a dermatologist and a medi spa.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was looking for a gentle daily exfoliator, what I got was not only a great exfoliator but an amazing treatment for my adult acne. After the first use my skin got softer and smoother, after about a week no more new breakouts, after a month my skin was completely clear and new acne scars were gone and old ones were significantly lightened. My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good since I was 18. It is an amazing product weather you are looking for a daily exfoliator or a great acne treatment.</li>
            <li> Really awesome product. Love it so much! Have been using it once every two days. It&#x27;s helpful to my acne.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after hearing about it on the radio. I was a bit nervous because it is more than I usually spend on a face care product but figured it was worth a shot. After the first application, my face was unbelievably smooth, never dry. Within a couple weeks, my tone evened out (I had acne scars) and pores were minimized. I still get a pimple now and again, but definitely not as many as before. I may try the maximum strength A&amp;B peel next time. :)</li>
            <li> irritating to the skin even with repeated use. Tried using just once a week just could not see any positive results</li>
            <li> Dr. Dennis Gross has come up with an amazing product...I know cuz I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of anti aging products in my search for the fountain of youth.  The pads are convenient and easy to use &#x3D; FAST.  The results are truly visible and my face looked poreless, smooth and brighter &#x3D; FIERCE. This was a great price and great service for a great product!</li>
            <li> I love these pads!  My skin looks luminous and I have received several compliments on my skin. They are pricey but I have discovered I can cut the pads in third and receive the same benefit. More bang for the buck!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  I have been using it since it was put on the market.  My skin is clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have always had great skin my whole life until I recently got off birth control.  After that, my hormones were extremely out of whack.  I was breaking out everywhere on my face, hair line, chest, back etc, and not just regular zits, but big purple cystic acne spots.  I tried a couple of different methods, changed facial washes, did natural oil cleansing method, and nothing worked.  I went to my skin specialist at Nordstrom and she MADE me try the face peels by Dr. Dennis Gross.  I was reluctant because it was over $100+, but I decided to give it a try.  Within one week it had completely cleared up my face and within two it had helped with the chest and back acne as well.  I looked on Amazon to see if I could get it cheaper and it is less than half the price on Amazon vs. Nordstrom.  I was so thankful because I did not think I could afford to keep up this routine otherwise.  I have been using every night after using Purity facial cleanser.  I follow with Bobbi Brown facial moisturizer and Bobbi Brown eye cream.  My skin care specialist recommends that after two months use (I am almost there) I should cut back to using every other day.  I have had one mini break out around my monthly cycle, but it was cleared up within a couple days as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in Nordstrom the other day and the Dr. Gross specialists were there from NY and were doing free facial peels.  I had one done (apparently it is 4x the strength of the daily peels) and it was amazing.  It cleared up acne scars from my recent breakouts by the next morning.  They are coming back in a month to do complimentary body peels and I am already signed up for those. For now, I am hooked!</li>
            <li> I first bought the two-week trial version of this product at the suggestion of an employee of a certain beauty-related mall chain store. Honestly, after three days I was sold... and after the two weeks, my laugh lines were practically gone and my skin had a radiance I&#x27;ve never gotten from a moisturizer, serum, mask, etc. (I&#x27;m kind of a junkie.) The price on Amazon is absolutely amazing. I&#x27;d pay full price, even if it killed me... that&#x27;s how good it is. I do cut them in half sometimes to stretch them, and it&#x27;s okay, but I always use full pads if I&#x27;m tired or I want to look my absolute best. Do NOT try this if you don&#x27;t want to keep paying for it. It&#x27;ll break your heart to give it up. SO GOOD!</li>
            <li> I tried samples of this product when I visited the Cooper Spa in Dallas.  They only had the stronger version at that time, but I didn&#x27;t find it was too drying.  The past few years through my 40&#x27;s and now a year into my 50&#x27;s my skin is more sensitive than ever, with hormonal breakouts.  If I use products that are too drying, such as benzoil peroxide, I peel horribly, with patches of skin peeling and a mess under my makeup.  No primers, even the top $100 brands help cover it.  I started the lower strength (I bought them at Nordstrom in Kansas City), the more \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; version of this peel over a week ago and I&#x27;ve been thrilled at how it&#x27;s turning my skin over without excessive drying or peeling.  My acne has improved enough to know the stuff is helping.  I&#x27;m also using Dr. Dennis Redmond&#x27;s moisturizer and the Vitamin D I was given samples of.  Lovely lovely stuff!  The active Vitamin D added to my Vivier Lexxel moisturizer is really improving my skin which after just a day or two was significantly not dry!  I am sold on Dr Dennis Grossman products.</li>
            <li> I swear by these peel pads, they keep my sensitive skin flawless. If used nightly after washing, I really do not break out. Love, love, love!</li>
            <li> This was ok but not what I expected. I expected to see more skin toning and eveness in my clean but have yet to see it. I tried it because I could not find another product that was working for me. My search continues.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend your money on a professional face peel! This product does just as good a job without the recovery time. I only use it twice a week and I get compliments galore on how radiant and youthful my skin is. I am 37 and still get carded!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now and when I take a hiatus, my skin feels it and I break out. Be really careful about getting out in the sun when you&#x27;ve used this product in the morning and if you&#x27;re sensitive to the sun, only use it at night. My skin is tighter, my complexion is better and there&#x27;s not a wrinkle anywhere. I love this product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 months now. The first few days I got very excited and started using this everyday after reading the reviews online. But my skin started burning on Day 2. It took me 2-3 more days to realize that burning was from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to using it only on alternate days and sometimes even only twice a week if my skin still feels sore. I have not had horrible breakouts I usually have. But I recently consumed some oily food and noticed 2 new breakouts of which one healed pretty quickly and the other one is in the process. I am on Solodyn prescription too, so I am not quite sure if the results are from this peel or from Solodyn. But whatever it is, I am happy to get rid of some acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this is not extreme optimism, but I think I see my scars lightening in the last 2 months.Amazon seems to have a better price than my dermatologist&#x27;s office. I will buy from Amazon next time.</li>
            <li> Its been a month of usage now and I haven&#x27;t seen a whole lot of change I still have hyperpigmented laugh lines but not as much I&#x27;d say it diminished my spots about 40% . And the Retinol makes my face sensitive to the sun. But it has kept acne at bay. My skin tone looks better but my dark laugh lines are still there. Does feel nice though at night . I think I won&#x27;t order again. I will update later. And definitely use sunscreen every 2-3 hours SPF 30 and up with Zinc Oxide. Makes skin sensitive to sun.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this so much that she bought it for our daughter too, and once her friend tried it she too is hooked</li>
            <li> Before using this product I had fairly oily skin, a very minor acne problem and a lot of minor blackheads on and around my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has helped to control the oil (in combination with a light moisturizer) and with nightly use has kept me pretty much free from breakouts for three months now. The pads have also slightly reduced the appearance of the pores on and around my nose and helped to even my skin tone a little. I know the product works because as soon as it starts working I get lazy and stop using it and within a week the problems start to return. Once I start seeing the problems returning I start using the product regularly again and within a week the problems have subsided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: using the pads every day can sometimes irritate your face especially if the weather is dry. Use adequate moisturizer and skip a day if your skin feels irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: The pads definitely provide some benefits if you use them consistently but don&#x27;t expect miracles. I think they&#x27;re worth it.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin even toned. DON&#x27;T need to use it every day. Clears up your skin and just gives it an overall even glow. Great to use before bed or before you go start your day. Just don&#x27;t forget to use sunscreen! And a HIGH SPF too, as the ingredients in this product will make your skin to sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. Before getting 60 day supply, I tried the 14 day challenge. I noticed a change in my complexion and pore size. So I purchased a 60 day supply. People have complimented my skin and the change. Also, I have very sensitive skin. If you touch it, it turns red. This is gentle enough for me. :-)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how great this product is.  I received a free sample (3 applications) from Sephora about two weeks ago.  I&#x27;d never even heard of the stuff before.  I used those three applications over the course of a week and saw such an improvement in my skin I purchased the 60 application set immediately.  (Incidentally I got it on Amazon for $60, it&#x27;s $128 at Sephora - sorry, Sephora)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a busy mom of 3 and my youngest 2 are 15 months apart.  I&#x27;ve been in &amp;#34;mom mode&amp;#34; for as long as I can remember now.  Since I&#x27;ve been using this face peel I feel like I&#x27;ve been getting my old self back.  That may sound cheesy or far fetched but I&#x27;m guessing there have to be other moms out there who know what I mean.  I look rested and younger (hallelujah!!) and my skin glows.  That little improvement makes me want to put a little makeup on in the morning and *gasp* put on some real clothes...do something for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another bonus is IT&#x27;S EASY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I gently wash and dry my face as normal.&lt;br /&gt;-Wipe on the step 1 pad.  (It tingles. In an &amp;#34;I know this stuff is working&amp;#34; kind of way)&lt;br /&gt;-Wait 2 minutes. (ie: brush my teeth, floss, pee, do jumping jacks, etc)&lt;br /&gt;-Wipe on the step 2 pad.&lt;br /&gt;-Admire my awesome skin in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;-Go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;-Wake up with baby for 2am feeding&lt;br /&gt;-Admire my awesome skin in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;You get the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know $128...or $60 is a lot to spend on a product for yourself, but at the risk of sounding like a Loreal commercial, YOU&#x27;RE WORTH IT.  Really, you are.</li>
            <li> these were a great price! much lower than other stores and the product truly makes a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> First learned about this product at The Ritz Carlton Spa in New Orleans.  It leaves skin fresh, even and new.  I am 41 and starting to have slight rosacea, dry patches, and break-outs.  All are lessoned by product.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this item to resopve my ruddy skin issues. Sadly I did not have the results other people have. I just found it drying with no exfoliation which is exactly what I did not need. I was able to easily return it however and get a refund from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Best ever. After 1 treatment my skin was clearer and smoother. I recommend it to anyone who has chronic skin probs.</li>
