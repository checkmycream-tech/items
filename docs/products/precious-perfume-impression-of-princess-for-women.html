            <li>As for me I definetly enjoyed the price.</li>
            <li>so I was extremely pleased to find it on amazone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was extremely pleased with my experience with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I first purchased it from Rainbow, and it smells so good for a knockoff.</li>
            <li>Very sweet smell.</li>
            <li>It smells really good, just like the real thing.</li>
            <li>In good condition, looks like the real thing.</li>
            <li>I like it, and not just becouse of the name!&lt;br /&gt;It smells good, very affordable</li>
            <li>then I know the product was worth it, plus it comes in a nice bottle..</li>
            <li>This smells spot-on, and the scent is actually strong and LASTS.</li>
            <li>hints of sweet vanilla lingers without being overwhelming just like \\&quot;PRINCESS\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>But until then, I am just fine with using the mini.</li>
            <li>WORTH THE MONEY SEXY SMELLING SIZE OF THE BOTTLE BLOWED ME</li>
            <li>, it has a pretty bottle too!!</li>
            <li>First spray will not smell anything like the original since impressions of original fragrances would contain more alcohol --</li>
            <li>It is a flirty, yet clean scent.</li>
            <li>Only good thing is its cheap.</li>
            <li>I performed a side by side comparison of this \\&quot;PRECIOUS\\&quot; perfume with the original \\&quot;PRINCESS\\&quot; by Vera Wang and the result is not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The scent is sweet, but by no means overly sweet.</li>
            <li>and she wants to order more thank you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a sweet smell and is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It arrive quickly and undamaged.</li>
            <li>i love it and highly reccommend to others ....</li>
            <li>The seller i purchased it from was not so honest about it though, as it was way smaller than the size i ordered.</li>
            <li>Ended fresh with a subdued sweetness, with equal parts rose, cotton candy and vanilla.</li>
            <li>They combine very well to make an unmistakably friendly, fresh, feminine, and outgoing type of fragrance.</li>
            <li>One of my friends is pregnant and extremely sensitive towards any strong smells</li>
            <li>Although I had never smelled the fragance before, the price was right</li>
            <li>she will like it very much.</li>
            <li>bottle is in a pretty heart shape and the fragrance has a staying power.  </li>
            <li>The vanilla remained consistent.</li>
            <li>THAT ARE SO MUCH HIGHER IN PRICE</li>
            <li>Thank you so much and please, don&#x27;t stop making this product!</li>
            <li>The cool rain remained, but became less noteworthy and gave more of a background freshness.</li>
            <li>its not expensive which is an added bonus  thanks.</li>
            <li>Precious Perfume stays long and dealers are quite reliable too.</li>
            <li>The seller was professional and quick to respond to offer a refund.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t  really like to buy knock-offs unless I really like the brand first.</li>
            <li>It has an initial smell of cotton candy, vanilla, and a fresh cool rain.</li>
            <li>It smells nothing like the real thing.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s so soft and fresh ...</li>
            <li>But the spray applicator functions very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>REASONABLE SMELLS</li>
            <li>THIS WAS REASONABLE 4</li>
            <li>ONES BUDGET THANKS</li>
            <li>Also , she wants to keep building her collection.</li>
            <li>I&#x60;ve ordered it for my 10 years daughter and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>but it has a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>VERY SATISIFIED ARRIVED</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t love the cost, and I certainly couldn&#x27;t care less about name brand products.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product and will absolutly be ordering again</li>
            <li>This perfume smells nothing like Princess or the bottle of Precious that I had in the past.  </li>
            <li>This imitation scent Precious fragrance is really similar to Vera Wang Princess.</li>
            <li>This really does last me all day too.</li>
            <li>Only order this if you want to try a new scent, not because you want a cheaper version of</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but definitely not anywhere near as good as Vera Wang.</li>

            <li> it is a little off, but you have to remember that it is after all only an imitation of the real deal.</li>
            <li> I normally find name brands for close to if not more than 50% off.</li>
            <li> missing in the back and all up in the front like dang girl stahp just stahp serisoly stahp gi gi</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s not a very stable scent</li>
            <li> price is unbelievable, especially if you are used to buying quality fragrances at almost a hundred dollars (some are even over).</li>
            <li> so wait a few seconds for the dry down.  </li>
            <li> The bottle and cap are quite plain, as you may expect from an inexpensive perfume.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed! :)</li>
            <li> When i found this faux/Princess perfume in a CVS last year, i was a bit skeptical.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t necessarily the worst perfume in the world, but it certainly smells NOTHING like the perfume it&#x27;s imitating.</li>
            <li> Even then, they have to at least make an effort to smell the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would probably purchase this perfume again, but not through the same seller, as i don&#x27;t want to have another disappointing experience.</li>
            <li> it was broken and leakage</li>
            <li> However, it is too expensive.</li>
            <li> When it came in the mail I was shocked.</li>
            <li> Smells awful.</li>

            <li> I bought this from big lots, and I am very impressed. This smells spot-on, and the scent is actually strong and LASTS. Most knock offs don&#x27;t have staying power, but this one does. I will buy again!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells nothing like Princess or the bottle of Precious that I had in the past.  Did not like it.  The seller was professional and quick to respond to offer a refund.</li>
            <li> this fragrance is so great. I wear it all the time.. in the summer, its wonderful cause its so light and clean-smelling.. After the shower, its like a body mist.. i love it and highly reccommend to others .... its not expensive which is an added bonus  thanks.</li>
            <li> I love Vera Wang&#x27;s Princess. However, it is too expensive. I normally find name brands for close to if not more than 50% off. I went to look in Big Lots, and they only have the .8 oz bottles. It smells really good, just like the real thing. I don&#x27;t  really like to buy knock-offs unless I really like the brand first. Even then, they have to at least make an effort to smell the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does have staying power. I put it on at 10 last night, and it is almost 8 am. The .8 oz does not come with a lid, but there is a piece on the bottle that if you twist it, it will lock. Just untwist and spray. It is a flirty, yet clean scent. I will continue to look around to find the bigger bottle of this. But until then, I am just fine with using the mini.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this perfume, which smells close to the same thing. it is a little off, but you have to remember that it is after all only an imitation of the real deal. The seller i purchased it from was not so honest about it though, as it was way smaller than the size i ordered. I would probably purchase this perfume again, but not through the same seller, as i don&#x27;t want to have another disappointing experience.</li>
            <li> I love \\&quot;Princess\\&quot; by Vera Wang. I have been using it for over five years now. However, I don&#x27;t love the cost, and I certainly couldn&#x27;t care less about name brand products. I ordered this perfume for a science project actually, in order to analyze the compositional differences between this perfume and Princess. When it came in the mail I was shocked. It smells nothing like the real thing. It isn&#x27;t necessarily the worst perfume in the world, but it certainly smells NOTHING like the perfume it&#x27;s imitating. Only order this if you want to try a new scent, not because you want a cheaper version of \\&quot;Princess\\&quot; by Vera Wang.</li>
            <li> Very sweet smell. Is VERY similar to princess. I love it. Husband loved it. A great purchase if you&#x27;re frugal and want to smell fancy!</li>
            <li> I performed a side by side comparison of this \\&quot;PRECIOUS\\&quot; perfume with the original \\&quot;PRINCESS\\&quot; by Vera Wang and the result is not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;This bottle is in a pretty heart shape and the fragrance has a staying power.  First spray will not smell anything like the original since impressions of original fragrances would contain more alcohol -- so wait a few seconds for the dry down.  This \\&quot;PRECIOUS\\&quot; fragrance dries down to a soft powdery scent just like the \\&quot;PRINCESS\\&quot; fragrance, except that \\&quot;PRINCESS\\&quot; is  sweeter and stronger. However, despite being weaker I have to say that I fell in love with this scent, it&#x27;s so soft and fresh ... hints of sweet vanilla lingers without being overwhelming just like \\&quot;PRINCESS\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;The price is unbelievable, especially if you are used to buying quality fragrances at almost a hundred dollars (some are even over). I am giving this 5 stars since it is a wonderful fragrance at a superb value!</li>
            <li> I purchased this from bestseller1234. It arrive quickly and undamaged. My impression of this impression of Vera Wang&#x27;s Princess, Precious, was very good. I can&#x27;t say how it compares to Princess, because I have yet to smell it. The bottle and cap are quite plain, as you may expect from an inexpensive perfume. But the spray applicator functions very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I have rated this 5 stars is because of the scent. It has an initial smell of cotton candy, vanilla, and a fresh cool rain. They combine very well to make an unmistakably friendly, fresh, feminine, and outgoing type of fragrance. The scent is sweet, but by no means overly sweet. After about an hour on the skin it had transformed to include rose as the cotton candy faded. The cool rain remained, but became less noteworthy and gave more of a background freshness. The vanilla remained consistent. Ended fresh with a subdued sweetness, with equal parts rose, cotton candy and vanilla.</li>
            <li> Smell is nauseating.  Bought it for my daughter.  I did not give her my opinion before she too verbalized that she did not like the scent.</li>
            <li> i had brought the precious perfume,impression of princess for women perfume for my wife  for christmas. she will like it very much. thank you.</li>
            <li> Excellent seller and products and very nice</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.I first purchased it from Rainbow, and it smells so good for a knockoff.This really does last me all day too.</li>
            <li> i like this fregrance so thanx for&lt;br /&gt;and hope to deal with you again couse it came in quik way and safe&lt;br /&gt;thx again</li>
            <li> In good condition, looks like the real thing. Smells awful. Thank goodness my fiance&#x27; can&#x27;t smell. I&#x27;d white elephant gift this one.</li>

            <li> GREAT SIZE COST IS REASONABLE SMELLS GREAT WOULD BUY AGAIN WORTH THE MONEY SEXY SMELLING SIZE OF THE BOTTLE BLOWED ME AWAY I ALSO HAVE BEEN GETTING FRAGRANCES FROM OTHERS THAT ARE SO MUCH HIGHER IN PRICE THIS WAS REASONABLE 4 ANY ONES BUDGET THANKS</li>
            <li> the package did arrive on time but when it did get here it was broken and leakage and i told the company and they did not believe me.</li>
            <li> My wife love this and she wants to order more thank you. Also , she wants to keep building her collection.</li>
            <li> This imitation scent Precious fragrance is really similar to Vera Wang Princess. The scent is not over powering its light and smells really good try this scent as a cheapier version.</li>
            <li> I&#x60;ve ordered it for my 10 years daughter and she absolutely loves it. It&#x60;s not a very stable scent but it has a reasonable price. Moreover the seller was very nice)</li>
            <li> I like it, and not just becouse of the name!&lt;br /&gt;It smells good, very affordable, it has a pretty bottle too!!</li>
            <li> I sent this perfume to a friend to brighten up her day and it did. She told me it arrived prompt and was intact. When she used it got several compliments on the fagrance. As for me I definetly enjoyed the price. Real nice gift yet affordable.</li>
            <li> The box and the bottle look very cheap. The cap of the bottle looked like it had glue on it and it looked like plastic from a dollar store. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but definitely not anywhere near as good as Vera Wang. Only good thing is its cheap. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it though</li>
            <li> Every time that I wear this perfume I will get multiple compliments and people ask me what I am wearing. When it comes to perfume I go for how it smells rather than a designer label. The store I used to buy this brand from sopped carrying it so I was extremely pleased to find it on amazone.&lt;br /&gt;It is a sweet smell and is not overpowering. One of my friends is pregnant and extremely sensitive towards any strong smells but she likes this perfume. It is just a very pleasant smell and I was extremely pleased with my experience with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and will absolutly be ordering again soon!&lt;br /&gt;Trust me.... You won&#x27;t be disappointed! :)</li>
            <li> GREAT SMELL WORTH THE PRICE VERY SATISIFIED ARRIVED ON TIME WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN IF NEEDED SIZE GREAT WORTH WHAT U PAY</li>
            <li> Everything about this, the perfume, the quick order, the packaging is great. I would definately order it again. Although I had never smelled the fragance before, the price was right and I bought it. The heart shaped bottle looks good too.</li>
            <li> nice perfume with great scent. Precious Perfume stays long and dealers are quite reliable too. i also like the packaging</li>
            <li> When i found this faux/Princess perfume in a CVS last year, i was a bit skeptical. But after using it, i fell in love w/ur &#x27;Precious&#x27; product! I hafto keep ordering it for all my friends! Thank you so much and please, don&#x27;t stop making this product!</li>
            <li> I have not tried the original I guess, but my friend loves this one, she was very happy with the smell, plus I liked it on her too, as long as she is happy then I know the product was worth it, plus it comes in a nice bottle..</li>
