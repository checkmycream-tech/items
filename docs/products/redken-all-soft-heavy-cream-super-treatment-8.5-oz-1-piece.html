            <li>Fast Delivery!</li>
            <li>makes hair very soft but kind of flat</li>
            <li>Redken&#x27;s All Soft Heavy Cream is a great product.</li>
            <li>I also use a tiny bit as &amp;#34;leave in&amp;#34; conditioner sometimes, and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I am very content to use this.</li>
            <li>So far I have not found a better deep conditioning product out there.</li>
            <li>Dose to good of a job ,use very little and do not put near your scalp.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the regular all soft conditioner if you have fine hair though.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for anyone with damaged hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and it really has done repairs.</li>
            <li>, I have a chunk on the top of my head that is only about 2 inches long because it all broke off.</li>
            <li>I like to apply it very sparingly a few inches near the roots and focus more towards the rest of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this the first time and my hair felt like silk, my brush went right through it, no resistance and minimal fall out.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s totally changed my hair from dry and damaged to soft and healthy</li>
            <li>This product turned my dead hair soft and it actually looks healthy!</li>
            <li>This seems to be exactly the same product I&#x27;ve used for years … without paying the &amp;#34;Beauty&amp;#34; store price.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a conditioner that makes my long color treated coarse hair feel silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have pretty much bleach blonde hair and use this as my daily conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have blonde color treated hair that gets very damaged from processing, I started using this every day and it is like I have brand new hair.</li>
            <li>leaves hair soft smooth and not weighted down!</li>
            <li>I have course hair and this stuff makes it so soft.</li>
            <li>I have pretty long hair (was curly, but has been straightened).  </li>
            <li>Hair is soft.  </li>
            <li>What I received is the same as what I&#x27;ve bought in salons for years, at a much lower price.</li>
            <li>Is it old?</li>
            <li>This is my favorite of Redken&#x27;s conditioners/treatments for my thick slightly coarse color treated straight hair.</li>
            <li>Mind you, I still use two leave in conditioners and use an oil based heat protectant when ironing, but this goes a long way to make my hair normal again.</li>
            <li>I can let my hair dry naturally; sometimes user dryer.  </li>

            <li> I use it as regular conditioner and leave it in for 5-10min or as a no poo alternative and it never weighs my hair down.</li>
            <li> Be warned that this heavy cream can weigh down your hair when applied near the roots.</li>
            <li> Great Stuff!!i bleach my hair into something awful and</li>

            <li> and it leaves my hair soft and shiny (though it might be too thick for finer hair).</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick, dry, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> and you only need a small amount.</li>

            <li> I have extremely thick, coarse, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I also use it as a leave in conditioner by mixing a little with water and put in a spray bottle.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Heavy Cream on Amazon twice now and the product is as I remember</li>
            <li> I had been through product after product from the beauty supply stores trying to get my soft hair back after I had fried it by bleaching the crap out of it because it had turned orange from all the iron in my well water.</li>
            <li> It felt like hard straw.</li>
            <li> I try to use it at least once a week.</li>

            <li> I am very content to use this. This cream is away better than using same line of conditioner.</li>
            <li> best Redken product ever</li>
            <li> Dose to good of a job ,use very little and do not put near your scalp.</li>
            <li> I have course hair and this stuff makes it so soft. If they keep making it, I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this 3-4X over the years, still just doesn&#x27;t work :(((&lt;br /&gt;And I want it to lol&lt;br /&gt;Great name--All Soft&lt;br /&gt;Wish it worked.  My hair was dry after using.</li>
            <li> This is a great deep conditioner.  I have tried others in an effort to save money or because others told me they found the best product ever but I always come back to this.  I shampoo and then put this on and cover my hair with a heated towel and a plactic shower cap and just wait for about 15 minutes.  This keeps my hair rleatively smooth and moisturized and when you are old you need some moisture. So far I have not found a better deep conditioning product out there.</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference.  Hair is smooth, tangle free, soft. I have pretty long hair (was curly, but has been straightened).  I can let my hair dry naturally; sometimes user dryer.  Hair is soft.  I also use a tiny bit as &amp;#34;leave in&amp;#34; conditioner sometimes, and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> This is the best. Omg . ^-^</li>
            <li> This stuff saved my hair. I had been through product after product from the beauty supply stores trying to get my soft hair back after I had fried it by bleaching the crap out of it because it had turned orange from all the iron in my well water. My hair was literally falling out by the handful, I have a chunk on the top of my head that is only about 2 inches long because it all broke off. It felt like hard straw. It was just gone. I used this the first time and my hair felt like silk, my brush went right through it, no resistance and minimal fall out. Redken always has the best products every time. I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t just order this before wasting money on all sorts of treatments and conditioners at the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> i didnt find anything special about it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a long time.  This seems to be exactly the same product I&#x27;ve used for years … without paying the &amp;#34;Beauty&amp;#34; store price.</li>
            <li> this product is a godsend! makes my horribly bleached silver hair feel like its never been damaged! leaves hair soft smooth and not weighted down!</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this out, I like it ok but I still love my Kerastase Ultime  line much better. The product arrived fast and in great condition. I have very dry bleached hair that I have to baby big time. I do like the Redken products, I use the anti snap and the Cat protein spray.  I mix it all up a bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m asian with medium length dead hair that has been though a lot of bleaching and coloring. This product turned my dead hair soft and it actually looks healthy! I love this product! It makes your hair feel silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> No Problems! Fast Delivery! A++++</li>
            <li> makes hair very soft but kind of flat</li>
            <li> its okay, dont feel it soften my hair</li>
            <li> I have pretty much bleach blonde hair and use this as my daily conditioner. My hair looks healthy and shiny!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. I started bleaching my hair late last year and this Heavy Cream saved my hair from being brittle and dry. Be warned that this heavy cream can weigh down your hair when applied near the roots. I like to apply it very sparingly a few inches near the roots and focus more towards the rest of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this stuff every time I wash my hair but diluted with regular conditioner. I have long hair so this is a money-saving tip as well. All you need is a little of the heavy cream mixed with enough conditioner when you don&#x27;t have to deep condition. It&#x27;s been almost 6mos since I purchased my last tube and only now am I due for another tube.</li>
            <li> I love all Redken items.</li>
            <li> This product I found to be just okay,  if not drying to the hair.  I would not purchase again for the price.</li>
            <li> Authentic product. What I received is the same as what I&#x27;ve bought in salons for years, at a much lower price. I&#x27;ve been using this for years. I have extremely thick, coarse, curly hair. I leave this in for 5-10 minutes in the shower and my hair feels much better afterwards. I try to use it at least once a week.</li>
            <li> I started using this a couple of times a week and it&#x27;s totally changed my hair from dry and damaged to soft and healthy</li>
            <li> This is my biggest anxiety about purchasing &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; hair products not at a salon. Is it old? Is it a fake? Is it some factory messup that they wholesale distributed to a third party? I don&#x27;t know. I have purchased Heavy Cream on Amazon twice now and the product is as I remember it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wherever you buy it Redken&#x27;s All Soft Heavy Cream is a great product. I use it once a week on my bleach-processed hair. Use consistently, and not too much, and this is an easy step towards maintaining damaged and unruly hair.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a conditioner that makes my long color treated coarse hair feel silky and smooth. This is it! My hair has a lot of grey in it and I have colored and highlighted it for years. It is really long and most conditioners just don&#x27;t do the job but this is amazing! I also use it as a leave in conditioner by mixing a little with water and put in a spray bottle. If you have course thick hair, you HAVE to at least try this!!</li>
            <li> Love love love.  I have very long, thick, dry, coarse hair.  I use this as my daily rinse out conditioner and it leaves my hair soft and shiny (though it might be too thick for finer hair).</li>
            <li> Needed some help for my damaged hair. Redken comes to the rescue again. What a tremendous line they offer. I would highly recommend this for anyone with damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I have blonde color treated hair that gets very damaged from processing, I started using this every day and it is like I have brand new hair. It looks healthy and is very manageable. Truly amazing and you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> Great Stuff!!i bleach my hair into something awful and this reversed it. I put this on with Ion intensive protein conditioner for 20 minutes and my hair comes out great. Mind you, I still use two leave in conditioners and use an oil based heat protectant when ironing, but this goes a long way to make my hair normal again.</li>
            <li> Item works great! My hair is damaged from coloring and straightening.  It seems to be helping to repair my hair.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite of Redken&#x27;s conditioners/treatments for my thick slightly coarse color treated straight hair. I use it as regular conditioner and leave it in for 5-10min or as a no poo alternative and it never weighs my hair down. I would recommend the regular all soft conditioner if you have fine hair though.</li>
            <li> Not organic, which I usually insist upon, but it does the job on my hair leaving it soft, not dried from curling irons and manageable.</li>
            <li> WORKS WONDERS ON PLATINUM BLONDE~</li>
            <li> Amazing! My hair is so soft and it really has done repairs. I don&#x27;t even rinse it out like it suggests.</li>
