            <li>I find it to be a great product.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>This product is great,  took about 8 days to kick in.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with product.</li>
            <li>I am happy and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li>my skin looks great, dryness everywhere is gone.</li>
            <li>Great news though</li>
            <li>The reason, as a physician, I DO NOT recommend Biestro - otherwise a great product - is because it contains phenoxyethanol.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and feels wonderful.</li>
            <li>it will always be available!!!  </li>
            <li>i love the price of this product and the potency and would defibately recommend it!!</li>
            <li>If you like a cream based estrogen formula this is a very nice one.  </li>
            <li>This makes a very nice face cream....</li>
            <li>Very nice item.</li>
            <li>Love it, works great!</li>
            <li>and I feel the best I have in many years.</li>
            <li>I had no energy or motivation to do all the things I love best.  </li>
            <li>This product is great, I feel so much better!</li>
            <li>I follow Dr John Lee and this is a brand that he recommends as being a good progestrone cream to buy.  </li>
            <li>not as good as I had hoped</li>
            <li>I have reordered, so it must be good.</li>
            <li>So I decided it might be wise to check my levels.  </li>
            <li>I also felt like Eyeore  in Winnie the Pooh -- nobody loved me and nobody cared about me anymore.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good smelling,not sticky.</li>
            <li>Good luck and</li>
            <li>Good luck and peace.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to anyone searching for good brands.</li>
            <li>Good lukc, ladies- find what works for you! :)</li>
            <li>I have used this for years and was so happy to get it at a better price...</li>
            <li>this product is great, i like it better than just the estriol.  </li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>It takes care of hot flashes and dryness, it works great !</li>

            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>so glad I found it!</li>
            <li>So much better!  </li>
            <li>This is a really amazing cream, if I thought I wouldn&#x27;t offend my  MIL</li>
            <li>Works amazingly well to heal postpartum tears.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re a candidate, it seems to be effective.    </li>
            <li>Nice to feel like I don&#x27;t have to join the &#x27;scrap heap&#x27; just yet.</li>
            <li>Do your own homework- read Northrup and check online.</li>
            <li>This is well formulated and the pre-measured dose that the pump dispenses is handy and tidy.  </li>
            <li>OMG, I will be honest with you.  </li>
            <li>, it kind of freaked me out.  </li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t as effective for me, it may be all you need.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite effective to reduce the hotflashes.</li>
            <li>I do have one nice thing to say for this, tho.  </li>
            <li>This is a product I have come to love/use, and find effective.</li>
            <li>Ingredients looked safe and all, and reviews were good.</li>
            <li>She has been treated with every kind of anti-depressant and anti-seisure drug on the market along with birth control pill.</li>
            <li>the upside, my experience tells me that the product is effective.  </li>
            <li>the upside, my experience tells me that the product is effective.  </li>
            <li>Life-Flo products work very well for me and am very happy I found them.</li>
            <li>The cream does not have a strong smell, so there is no concern of not liking the smell, the cream is pleasant to apply.</li>
            <li>And, then, I experienced one day where I felt absolutely PREGNANT.  </li>
            <li>I am sure I must be very rare!!</li>
            <li>Started using this kind of hormonal creams and feel much better.</li>
            <li>Wow, I am a happy woman again!  </li>
            <li>The cream has a light consistency, is easy to apply and is unscented, although I cannot say the cream is odorless as I have a very acute sense of smell, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>I am having VERY light cycles again, but that&#x27;s okay with me to feel</li>
            <li>I feel more confident about myself, and my body hair seems to be growing a lot slower now.</li>
            <li>This cream has also helped me to sleep a bit better.</li>
            <li>-- I am still in search of better sleep.</li>
            <li>But it is much better.  </li>
            <li>Another more frivolous point in favor of this cream</li>
            <li>: people say I have been looking better than I have in a while since I started on this ream</li>
            <li>I used this solution for about 5 more years.  </li>
            <li>I have better energy and</li>
            <li>I thru it out and went with bio-identical much better</li>
            <li>I also ordered Dr. Lee&#x27;s cream and it works better and rubs in faster.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>You just get more for your money with Life-Flo.</li>
            <li>it was okay..</li>
            <li>I wish it were more of a serum.</li>
            <li>so so glad they made this</li>
            <li>It took over 6 weeks to begin to feel results but glad I didn&#x27;t give up.</li>
            <li>It took over 6 weeks to begin to feel results but glad I didn&#x27;t give up.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product will definitely use again just wish I had known about it</li>
            <li>I did research and found that estrogen replacement that resembled more like what the body would produce could be beneficial.</li>
            <li>Love it, works wonderful for my hormone changes I am currently having.</li>
            <li>My wife feels much better when she uses it.  </li>
            <li>and I do see many changes in my body.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read TONS about this, to be safe.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>With this cream I was able to get off premarin</li>
            <li>My skin feels so much better</li>
            <li>I would have never thought that something over the counter would help so much and a great price.  </li>
            <li>and I just wasn&#x27;t sure if I should be using this alone or with the progestra.  </li>
            <li>I am going to do a bit more research just to be sure I&#x27;m okay</li>
            <li>Keeps my wife&#x27;s post menopausal health in much better condition.</li>
            <li>More Update:  </li>
            <li>Still love it.  </li>
            <li>My thinking is still clearer, and yes, I do think my muscles are responding better to exercise.  </li>
            <li>More Update:  </li>
            <li>Still love it.  </li>
            <li>It seems to just sit on top of the skin, not absorb.</li>
            <li>I will try to find something else that absorbs better.</li>
            <li>Too soon to know  for sure?</li>
            <li>It will take awhile to know for sure.</li>
            <li>Love the pump which makes it easier to use.</li>
            <li>Make sure to use it with progesterone cream too.  </li>
            <li>The more Bi-estro care one uses, the more progesta-care has to be used since there has to be a healthy balance of estrogens to progesterone.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>It is one of the most affordable I have found.  </li>
            <li>ladies!!)It&#x27;s better than nothing, but</li>
            <li>and I find that I am getting better results.  </li>
            <li>I went off and began to have more headaches and mood swings.</li>
            <li>and I have been able to lose weight plus</li>
            <li>It takes a couple of months to build up to help symptoms the most.</li>
            <li>and he gave it an ok if it works</li>
            <li>If a woman needs more estrogen, then this product will probably work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feeling great now, so it´s very efficient.</li>
            <li>Not orally since it has so many more side</li>
            <li>This cream is okay</li>
            <li>Within hours I was out of bed and feeling so much better.</li>
            <li>Make sure u use both progesterone and the estrogen cream together.</li>
            <li>I love these two creams and recommend them to any and all.  </li>
            <li>Some need more.</li>
            <li>Some quite a bit more.  </li>
            <li>Some need more.</li>
            <li>Some quite a bit more.  </li>
            <li>My doc recommended that I not take HRT because I had taken birth control pills for so many years</li>
            <li>We are so thankful that we seem to have found a better solution to keep her migraines at bay.</li>
            <li>We couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I added in this product after using Progesta-care for awhile, which took care of most of my menopausal symptoms</li>
            <li>My latest experiment with HRT has been in using bioidentical hormone</li>
            <li>I persisted for three more days just to rule out the possibility of a stomach bug, but my problems stopped almost immediately after I stopped using this</li>
            <li>I persisted for three more days just to rule out the possibility of a stomach bug, but my problems stopped almost immediately after I stopped using this</li>
            <li>I have noticed that it is softer and more moisturized.</li>
            <li>Hang in there girls, try 3 times a day, just might be the magic bullet for you as it was for me.</li>
            <li>This cream does help with hot flashes and is good when used in conjunction with HRT.</li>
            <li>Your body may be producing adequate hormones on its own.  </li>
            <li>Your body may be producing adequate hormones on its own.  </li>
            <li>I found this particular brand and manner of dosage to be easy, convenient and I feel great.</li>
            <li>I am very happy to see that bioidentical hormones such as this are now available over the counter.</li>
            <li>The first three or four days were wonderful; I felt completely normal.  </li>
            <li>This is pure and natural--a good way to supplement estrogen in menopause without all the risk of oral supplements.</li>
            <li>, I always lifted light weights but they didn&#x27;t work any more, and then I had the feeling of a urinary tract infection, like I had to go</li>
            <li>I do not feel comfortable adding a progesterone cream to my regimen as that would cause even more of an imbalance for me.</li>
            <li>I do not feel comfortable adding a progesterone cream to my regimen as that would cause even more of an imbalance for me.</li>
            <li>But that is not to say that it would not work great for someone who is going through natural menopause.  </li>
            <li>I am much more cheerful, and I feel like tackling the fall housecleaning that I couldn&#x27;t even make myself think about in September.  </li>
            <li>There have been a couple of comments about absolutely having to take progesterone if taking estrogen, but since my progesterone level tested good</li>
            <li>There have been a couple of comments about absolutely having to take progesterone if taking estrogen, but since my progesterone level tested good</li>
            <li>Easy</li>
            <li>Pump makes it easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It was too creamy and did not go into the skin that easily.</li>
            <li>The package arrived VERY quickly, so there was no waiting.</li>
            <li>The cream itself is not sticky and absorbs easily into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cream itself is not sticky and absorbs easily into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just be aware as others have said it does leave your skin feeling sticky and kind of clammy.</li>
            <li>I was able to cut the bottle with kitchen shears and found it full of product.  </li>
            <li>I still use the Progesta-care full amount, per instructions, and my menopausal symptoms are mostly relieved.  </li>
            <li>and I felt fine.  </li>
            <li>They worked wonderfully, but this cream is half the price.</li>
            <li>The patch has latex in the adhesive, giving me huge welts.  </li>
            <li>I think she could have avoided the 5 day migraine that resulted from a huge estrogen drop.</li>
            <li>and since it is transdermal (through the skin), it is absorbed better.  </li>
            <li>Important for cancer prevention.</li>
            <li>I found the Biestro Cream that contained both Estriol and the more powerful Estradiol as well.  </li>
            <li>i like this creme and it has really helped me over the winter; we&#x27;ll see if it works as well in summer as hot air tends to bring warm flushes(awful!).</li>
            <li>Just as others had posted, if you still have your uterus it is wise to also use a natural progesterone cream with it.  </li>
            <li>We thank you very much for having Biestro available for us to purchase!</li>
            <li>I was excited to find this product here.</li>
            <li>When I had my hormone levels checked they were higher than without the cream, but I still needed more.  </li>
            <li>Decided to try this one, and immediately the hot flashes and brain fog went away,  my mood and energy improved, and everything just got better.  </li>
            <li>So, I then tried 2 pumps and success!</li>
            <li>I need a lot more of the cream that I thought I would at first.  </li>
            <li>So, maybe it&#x27;s just me, but try a bottle first and limit the damages:)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write many reviews but felt it was my obligation to all the menopause women suffering from hot flashes.  </li>
            <li>Love the dispensing method of getting exactly what you need without measuring and there is no guessing that way</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it gets absorbed easily (unlike a progesterone cream I tried from another brand).</li>
            <li>Either way, 10 hours or even 24 hours later I can still feel it on my skin, and it isn&#x27;t pleasant.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a big difference too, as she is much nicer and life is much more pleasant now for both of us.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure when I purchased, it came on time and it really does work.</li>
            <li>My mom uses two full pumps.</li>
            <li>It smells clean and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Her hair has gotten much thicker and better looking now that she uses Biestro.  </li>
            <li>Love the measured pump, so you know about how much dosage you are getting.  </li>
            <li>Of course, I am not using it for replacement therapy, so I don&#x27;t use a full pump at once.  </li>
            <li>, I believe for me that the estradiol is what actually gave me this satisfaction, most creams do not have this, plus I love that it is paraben free.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t cut them out, just cut back, and eat plenty of protein and good fats.  </li>
            <li>I really have enjoyed using this product.  </li>
            <li>, I had to find a more affordable alternative for my HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy), and this works very well.</li>
            <li>If you really want to be sure about your hormones, you should get tested.  </li>
            <li>I have been in full blown parimenopause for three years.</li>
            <li>I appreciate very much that this product is so clean, free from harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>This product has my hot flashes and mood swings under control and is so easy to use...</li>
            <li>Other than that, great product.</li>
            <li>I took the menopause type test on the yourhormones.com site and the result indicated that my progesterone level is adequate</li>
            <li>Research told me it was compounded from pregnant horse urine</li>
            <li>how many drops of the oil I would have to use and then figured out how many days a bottle would last, I passed.</li>
            <li>and they were mild when I did.  </li>
            <li>Once in a while, I will have a mild &amp;#34;heat surge&amp;#34;, but not often -- maybe once a day, if that.  </li>
            <li>Good texture and didn&#x27;t take long to absorb, no bad smell.</li>
            <li>Got my results today and my levels are in a normal balance for the most part</li>
            <li>My new doctor knew about Life Flo products and was glad I stopped HRT Therapy.</li>
            <li>Works exactly for what I need it for!</li>
            <li>Talk to your doctor first!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using for several weeks now and feel absolutely great, no difference that I can note, so this will be my new cream.  </li>
            <li>my neck was more and more wrinkled and dry.  </li>
            <li>I did great for 8 months, then began a cycle of heavy bleeding that lasted for WEEKS.  </li>
            <li>I did great for 8 months, then began a cycle of heavy bleeding that lasted for WEEKS.  </li>
            <li>The progesterone helps to calm u and the estrogen gives u energy.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth it for me.  </li>
            <li>I had full hysterectomy and was on the patch at first.</li>
            <li>I had a full hysterectomy and the doctor immediately popped a pill in my mouth for hot flashes.</li>
            <li>Over the years I educated myself with more natural  and organic products.</li>
            <li>I have had good results with it, but be careful -</li>
            <li>Just the more cheerful outlook on life is worth every penny and every extra pound that I now will have to fight off.  </li>
            <li>It absorbed like you would expect it to.</li>
            <li>I am glad it is available OTC finally</li>
            <li>She decided to try something more natural and we started with progesterone on day 12-28 of her cycle and Life-Flo Biestro-care two days before her period until the end of her period.</li>
            <li>Yes, the results were mild the first day.  </li>
            <li>Yes, the results were mild the first day.  </li>
            <li>Then, again, came the headaches, the hot flashes, the mild nausea.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective but it&#x27;s not super strong.  </li>
            <li>I am happy to say that this product keeps me hot flash free, at least 85-90% of the time.</li>
            <li>Despite the side effects, losing my candidacy for a straight jacket and a rubber room have made this product well worth every penny!</li>
            <li>This company always sends the product right out, no worries.  </li>
            <li>Just follow directions on both and adjust it to when you feel it is right for you.</li>
            <li>it has the right ingredients but it is too greasy</li>
            <li>I did and they found some dense tissue in my right breast.</li>
            <li>My weight gain has leveled off, I&#x27;m not crying any more (unless I forget it for two days) and the hot flashes and skin itching has STOPPED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One full pump is too much for me.  </li>
            <li>This can be a useful part of the whole treatment!</li>
            <li>meh.. smell is kind of strange and it just never dries.</li>
            <li>it keeps the hot flashes down better and lessens anxiety better than the esirol alone.  </li>
            <li>I am trying to use a little more of the Biestro cream to hopefully increase my estrogen to a more acceptable level.</li>
            <li>I am trying to use a little more of the Biestro cream to hopefully increase my estrogen to a more acceptable level.</li>
            <li>You think you are getting this really large bottle of product, but you are not!</li>
            <li>At first I started using a full pump, but it was way too much for my needs</li>
            <li>Low-dose oral HRT has improved most of my low-estrogen symptoms, but unfortunately not my dry skin, vaginal atrophy, or night sweats.</li>
            <li>Really works but is sticky and doesn&#x27;t absorb as quickly as RX.</li>
            <li>Was using Emeritta natural progesterone and phytoestrogen with good results till last summer when symptoms returned with a vengeance, was slathering the stuff on but my symptoms were still debilitating.</li>
            <li>My doctor  gave me a prescription when I  had very intense menopause symptoms.</li>
            <li>After quitting HRT entirely, my migraines had a significant drop in frequency, allowing me to be almost 100% pain free.  </li>
            <li>She claims that this product has made a huge difference in her life, and she feels alive again.</li>
            <li>I get hot flashes.  </li>
            <li>Made my skin on my hands look years younger and seemed to help me sleep better.</li>
            <li>(hot flashes again, lack of libido, insomnia), so</li>
            <li>I had nightsweats, insomnia and hot flashes.  </li>
            <li>Used at Night it keeps me out of Hot Flashes which then allows me to sleep all night.</li>
            <li>It has ended my hot flashes and is assisting with my hormonal-induced depression from surgical menopause.</li>
            <li>The hot flashes have gone, as have the night sweats, the moods have stabilized, I&#x27;m able to sleep, I have my memory and sense of orientation back, the anxiety has gone (thank goodness)</li>
            <li>If this ever stops working I will shell out the money for one of those expensive West Coast hormone doctors and all of their blood testing, but for now I will just keep using my wonderful voluminous sticky cream!  </li>
            <li>I am taking about 4 things to control hot flashes, and this is one of them.</li>
            <li>I did not experience a hot flash after stopping the patch,and thought \\&quot;I&#x27;m home fee from post menopausal problems\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Since I couldn&#x27;t afford the Divigel, I ordered this and prayed that it would work at least somewhat as well, and I am happy to report that it works every bit as well.</li>
            <li>I get night sweats and hot flashes without usage.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use Progesterone Cream at the same time!</li>
            <li>I use one pump on the skin of my legs the first two weeks of my cycle.  </li>
            <li>Never realized this was available online, so I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the ingredients were probably identical.  </li>
            <li>hot flashes&lt;br</li>
            <li>really cannot be with out it!</li>
            <li>With this version my hot flashes have almost stopped happening altogether.  </li>
            <li>those first weeks while you figure out what your dosage needs to be.  </li>
            <li>those first weeks while you figure out what your dosage needs to be.  </li>
            <li>So, if you feel this does not work for you, it would most likely be a dosage problem.</li>
            <li>I have had hot flashes for about 4 tears now.</li>
            <li>Stick with it and the Hot Flashes will just be a heat surge now and then.</li>
            <li>It does work pretty well.</li>
            <li>I started taking L-theanine throughout the day to lower my cortisol and that stopped the hot flashes.  </li>
            <li>and yes, it helped with my hot flashes, however I have just been diagnosed with BREAST CANCER.......</li>
            <li>Thank you so much Life-Flo!</li>
            <li>Instead of menstruating, I would get hot flashes.  </li>
            <li>This very mild dosage of estriol and estradiol (2 of the 3 main hormones women&#x27;s bodies produce - estrone is the 3rd) is just enough to provide me with the good benefits of estradiol without the high risk of prescription strenght.</li>
            <li>, she thought I was much too high risk and basically booted me to the curb to find my own way after a brief discussion about what I should try.  </li>
            <li>(vaginal atrophy reduces them), increased eyebrow and vaginal hair - which has come back to the original color of brown!  </li>
            <li>I tried Life-Flo Biestro-care as a possible substitute and it works just as well as my prescription did and at a much more reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>My last cycle was about a year ago, and I noticed (as did my husband and children), that I began having much more intense symptoms a couple of months ago.  </li>
            <li>Worked very well and will continue use for hot flashes</li>
            <li>Helps my mood &amp; hot flashes greatly, Thanks.</li>
            <li>This product has really helped me with hot flashes.  </li>
            <li>I was ready to kill myself and others - dealing with severe hot flashes, night sweats, insomnia, fatigue, and depression for well over 3 years.  </li>
            <li>Twice a day was doing nothing for me, then just out of pure desperation tried 3 times a day.</li>
            <li>(I wish it were more concentrated so less could be used), so for me this is useful as a night cream on my face/chest/hands (sometimes alternating with arms/feet to rotate application sites) at bedtime.</li>
            <li>More libido, less brain fog, overall feel more &#x27;myself.&#x27;    </li>
            <li>Apparently high cortisol can cause hot flashes, too.  </li>
            <li>The trick is to figure out what amount will work for you, so watch your symptoms and keep track of how much you are using so you can make adjustments as needed.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like this that much.</li>
            <li>I was on physician prescribed bioidenticals years ago, and felt they made a real difference, then went off for a year and noticed the difference</li>
            <li>In my experience it takes time to feel a real difference, months.    </li>
            <li>She shook her head and said \\&quot;absolutely not!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The 20 percent Estradiol it contains( which I thought was only available by prescription) seemed to be the solution.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s safer because it is natural.adiol it contains( which I thought was only available by prescription)</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>My mood is much improved.</li>
            <li>within days I had to stop HRT because I had symptoms of too much Estradiol</li>
            <li>There is too much cream mix with the product.  </li>
            <li>it really became a quality of life issue for me.</li>
            <li>The company should really do something about the odor  though.</li>
            <li>This cream really helped to decrease and almost eliminate my severe hotflashes.</li>
            <li>I would be cautious about using too much, could cause swelling or water retention?</li>
            <li>These bioidentical hormones are so much safer for the body than synthetic hormones that are often given to women for menopausal symptoms.</li>
            <li>I really like this cream</li>
            <li>THIS IS NOT THE REAL THING.  </li>
            <li>This is not the real estriol.  </li>
            <li>It really works, and I am comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I realize that low strength is required to be available over-the-counter, with no need for prescription.   </li>
            <li>Tried for 2 months really had high hopes!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get how it has real estradiol in it</li>
            <li>I really have zero menopausal symptoms.</li>
            <li>I Absolutely believe that using this product fanned the flames of my cancer.</li>
            <li>First off I used ProgestraCare Complete for over a month and it did not do much for my hot flashes but helped with dryness a lot.  </li>
            <li>As always, these conventions are very stressful events</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hot flashes for me consist of nausea, intense heat  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so absolutely grateful to the women who took the time to write about their experiences.</li>
            <li>It really does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>peace.h.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so absolutely grateful to the women who took the time to write about their experiences.</li>
            <li>It really does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much to my dismay, I had started menopause and didn&#x27;t know what was going on.  </li>
            <li>And, if you&#x27;ve been through surgical menopause, your body might very well be acclimated to a lower hormone level.  </li>
            <li>And, if you&#x27;ve been through surgical menopause, your body might very well be acclimated to a lower hormone level.  </li>
            <li>When I used one pump of this, after a few days I was drowning in my own sweat at night.</li>
            <li>However, I put the creme on the inner labia of the vagina - which is the most direct route, recommended by Dr. Jonathan Wright, the &amp;#34;father&amp;#34; of bio-identical hormones according to Suzanne Somers.  </li>
            <li>This might be okay if one pump was sufficient, but I have to do two at a time to get up to my previous dose, so it results in a pretty large amount of sticky cream to rub in.</li>
            <li>AND I CAN THINK CLEARLY!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m experiencing many less hot flashes, I&#x27;ve lost some weight</li>
            <li>Less hot flashes and better sleep.</li>
            <li>I live in an extremely hot and humid climate as well (Gulf Coast).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get confused constantly any longer, I don&#x27;t forget what I was doing mid presentation, my weight is under control, but most importantly my children and husband don&#x27;t have to live with an ogre any more, they have the kind caring Mom and wife back that they had become accustomed to in the years gone by.  </li>
            <li>I think has more estrogen in it than my the other brand I tried.</li>
            <li>There is no set formula or amount that is standard, every woman&#x27;s needs are unique.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness this product is available to those like me who do not have medical insurance and can not afford the full price of medical care.  </li>
            <li>I first got a progesterone cream which I love and still use, but I still had the stripes and the U.T.I. symptoms, so I added this cream the estrogen is what was missing, we are not all estrogen dominant.</li>
            <li>Not a single hot flash since first day.</li>
            <li>(not sure I agree, but it is nice of them</li>
            <li>wanted to try something natural to help with my hot flashes.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve never had any daytime hot flashes, so far).</li>
            <li>The cream/lotion is really industrial feeling and not what I would normally want on my body.  </li>
            <li>Hot flashes are COMPLETELY GONE.  </li>
            <li>Hot flashes are COMPLETELY GONE.  </li>
            <li>I would buy her one as a gift to make her less grumpy :)  </li>
            <li>but I would have emotional responses in the first couple of minutes of a hot flash</li>
            <li>Things do get better, especially if you can cut way back on carbs.  </li>
            <li>so I know it&#x27;s something in this particular product.  </li>
            <li>Once the evidence is in hand, then, and only then, should you consider supplementation.utely PREGNANT.  </li>
            <li>I can not live comfortably without this.  </li>
            <li>So, during the normal drop in estrogen,  I must have been down regulating more that</li>
            <li>I was right back at square one, but really didn&#x27;t like all the risks with Estradiol Rx.  </li>
            <li>If you have a need for estradiol, I highly recommend this dose.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The problem turned out to be high cortisol.  </li>
            <li>I tried many other natural products over the years and nothing else helped me.  </li>
            <li>Would love a little &amp;#34;window&amp;#34</li>
            <li>It turned out that my estrogen and progesterone were both normal, with my progesterone being comfortably high in proportion to estrogen.  </li>
            <li>The hot flashes became very intense, and sometimes I would have a hot flash followed by another one  only 10 or 15 minutes later.  </li>
            <li>I began using this cream about 10 days ago, and so far, it has been a real blessing to me.  </li>
            <li>This product allowed me to discontinue HRT completely without suffering the return of frequent hot flashes, which happened a year or so ago when I unsuccuessfully tried to get off of the synthetic hormones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product (once a day) for about six weeks along with a progesterone  cream.</li>
            <li>only problem I had was that when I used the pump for the first time, it dispensed too much cream.  </li>
            <li>In over four months I went from almost nothing regarding my Estradiol to within a normal with supplementation range.</li>
            <li>Just rub it on and you will start feeling better within just a few days.  </li>
            <li>BTW, once my estrogen receptors absorbed the estrogens, the period stopped by the 2nd month, but everything else has continued.  </li>
            <li>My bp went from a normal 120/60 to 190/105.</li>
            <li>I sleep normal.</li>
            <li>I have normal energy again.</li>
            <li>Before I had zero sex drive, its close to normal now.</li>
            <li>I am now almost, ALMOST, normal</li>
            <li>I felt normal.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s half the price of what I paid at my compounding pharmacy (but does lack the third kind of estrogen, the progesterone and dab of testosterone</li>
            <li>I cut back to 1/4th of a pump am &amp; pm and that is just about right for my needs.  </li>
            <li>I have definitely noticed a difference in how I feel right away with this product (using it for menopausal symptoms.)</li>
            <li>This is a new product for me.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li>a heads up to anyone else who may live in a humid climate.</li>
            <li>and I can live with that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can live with that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried other bio-identical estrogens and they typically make me feel really good.</li>
            <li>I never write reviews, but this is something that has actually worked, and I was so surprised that I thought it worth writing something.</li>
            <li>Definitely not something to use on a whim without first looking into it, but</li>
            <li>This, along with Remifemin day and night formulations, is the only thing that&#x27;s worked to get rid of the thrice-hourly sweating hot flashes.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say if it is working because I barely used it</li>
            <li>I do see a big improvement with hot flashes.</li>
            <li>*Update 04/07/2015 After repetitively having heart palpitations/racing after many attempts to lower or spread out the dosage I just cannot use this.</li>
            <li>Not all hot flashes are caused by low estrogen.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d only used a fraction of my first bottle, and found I couldn&#x27;t return either to Amazon, so I&#x27;m stuck with 2 bottles of something I can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li>By the following day the hot flashes were gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;During this time-frame, I would have occasional hot flashes during the week of my cycle.  </li>
            <li>By the 10th hour I will have one tiny break through hot flash and another on the 11th hour.  </li>
            <li>By the 10th hour I will have one tiny break through hot flash and another on the 11th hour.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my first hot flash a year and a half ago at a convention for my job.  </li>
            <li>It contains a good mix of real human estrogens, but it is sticky and weak.  </li>
            <li>the only thing i don&#x27;t care for is that cremes take longer to absorb or you have to apply over a large area.</li>
            <li>I cannot really say that this is a bad product because for some women it may work great for.  </li>
            <li>I used a very small amount, every other day, and the difference was amazing!</li>
            <li>I know it works because when I was taking too much I developed breast tenderness.  </li>
            <li>And my skin look so old lady wrinkled when I squeezed it, my muscle tone too</li>
            <li>There is no way of telling how much cream is left in the bottle.</li>
            <li>I had a hysterectomy when I was 39 years old.  </li>
            <li>I went almost immediately into early menopause.  </li>
            <li>Big plus is the transdermal delivery goes straight in your system, not through your digestive tract or liver.  </li>
            <li>Since I began natural HRT</li>
            <li>She said it is natural and that this is working well for me in combination to the patch to eliminate the symptoms I was experiencing with menopause</li>
            <li>This worked very well for me for about 1 year, then the night sweats started coming back.  </li>
            <li>I developed atopic vaginitis and interstitial cystitis.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s safer because it is natural.</li>
            <li>I also use Life Flo Progesta Care Complete along with it.</li>
            <li>This product really caused some massive pain in my breasts!</li>
            <li>I am a sensitive person age of 61.  </li>
            <li>So far I like it</li>
            <li>old</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li>This is a natural way to get your hormones, it&#x27;s plant based bio-identical and has made all the difference for me.</li>
            <li>i cant really give a rating as it wasn&#x27;t for me, i have received no feed back</li>
            <li>I use the progesterone also 10 days every month, also natural but FDA approved.</li>
            <li>, I have been using both ProgestraCare Complete and BiestroCare together for two weeks and my how flashes are almost gone.  </li>
            <li>I figure another week and they will be completely gone.  </li>
            <li>It has worked wonderfully so far.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t just assume that your doctor knows what they&#x27;re talking about if they haven&#x27;t gathered empirical evidence (blood work, hormone panels).  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t just assume that your doctor knows what they&#x27;re talking about if they haven&#x27;t gathered empirical evidence (blood work, hormone panels).  </li>
            <li>Back to research, nothing was working, was almost ready to allow dr to prescribe the dreaded hrt, then tried this product along with Allvia progesterone, pregnenolen and dhea.</li>
            <li>This toxic preservative is an endocrine disruptor and a skin irritant and should not be inside a hormone formula that gets applied on sensitive skin areas.&lt;br /&gt;Time</li>
            <li>I will update this review after I have been using the cream for a few months.&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Update: After using this cream for over a year I am still a bit low in estrogen but am still enjoying the relief of symptoms.</li>
            <li>My body turned against me, my skin mostly, it became so dry and had a brown discoloration down the front of my arms, I looked striped.</li>
            <li>I had a full Hysterectomy a couple of years ago, and have tried many different prescription HRT combinations, with very limited success (virtually no success), and I finally tried this, fully expecting it to be another rip off or waste of time, however I have to say one month in</li>
            <li>I was a Phyto-B rescue victim who depended on that product for over 10 years to stave off hot flashes and night sweats.</li>
            <li>(I also found out from a skincare forum I belong to that it was helpful on facial skin, had anti aging properties, used in small amount, especially in concert with Retin A *or probably retinols too, which are weaker version of prescription retin-a), so after I tried it awhile one great benefit I noticed was that my pesky chin hairs were getting softer and a little less, most likely counteracting the androgens that cause that issue in women.)    </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect it to actually work as well as it has so far with my severe hot flashes and other problems.  </li>
            <li>Also the only reason I knew it lasts for just a month is because when I tried to get more out of the bottle today, no more came out.</li>
            <li>I still have more energy, and don&#x27;t need three short naps a day to make it past 8 in the evening.  </li>
            <li>It might be having the desired hormonal effect, I am not sure yet, maybe the inactive ingredients are the ones that sit on top of the skin (doesn&#x27;t seem likely though).</li>
            <li>and I ended up spending the entire day having one hot flash every twenty minutes for ten hours.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle now, and no hot flashes, the price is right too!</li>
            <li>So far so good I will buy it again, I have been using four pumps am and pm and definitely notice a calming less anxious feeling.</li>
            <li>After one month of use, I had a light period for 3 days..plus sore nipples, fuller breasts, no more vaginal dryness, plump vaginal outer labia</li>
            <li>Cycles back to normal.</li>
            <li>Minimal hot flashes and night sweats</li>
            <li>Granted they didn&#x27;t try very hard, half-heartedly dispensing the kind of advice that you can find on any generic website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I live in a rural area without a lot of choices.)</li>
            <li>I realize most all companies do this in one way or another, but it really makes me angry</li>
            <li>To figure out how much to use (since I&#x27;m not using a full pump), I used a permanent marker to make small lines on the sides of the pump to indicate half a pump, 1/4 and 3/4 pumps - that helps me know how far to depress the pump to get the right amount for my needs.</li>
            <li>So for 16 years, I suffered through my hot flashes and other symptoms.</li>
            <li>I have been having hot flashes, mood swings,  acne, sleeplessness, cognitive issues and a myriad of other issues.  </li>
            <li>One pump twice a day helped me, but I still had hot flashes (milder and less frequent, but still there).  </li>
            <li>One pump twice a day helped me, but I still had hot flashes (milder and less frequent, but still there).  </li>
            <li>and I feel a general improvement in my moods and energy.  </li>
            <li>She was clear that she would reduce the estrogen dosage over time and as soon as I adjusted to a smaller dose.</li>
            <li>I am now ready to order my third bottle and finally am beginning to feel like my former self.</li>
            <li>I am now ready to order my third bottle and finally am beginning to feel like my former self.</li>
            <li>This product apparently works for some women but didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>twice daily) of natural progesterone ended the bleeding and I have not had a problem since.  </li>
            <li>(If you are old enough to need this cream, perhaps you remember the old commercial that said, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not a doctor, but I play one on TV.&amp;#34;  Well, I don&#x27;t even play one on TV!</li>
            <li>twice daily) of natural progesterone ended the bleeding and I have not had a problem since.  </li>
            <li>It seems like you have your natural hormones back.  </li>
            <li>the company will not offer a refund and the product is unusable, alcohol is an irritant on the highly sensitive area this is meant for and it never sated it had alcohol in it until you receive the product and read it on the back of the bottle</li>
            <li>( I really thought I would find they had shipped an empty bottle):  </li>
            <li>It is one of the brands recommended by respected sources, such as Dr. Lee and Christine Northrup, experts on menopause the natural way.</li>
            <li>After several months of natural estrogen cream I found it works almost as well as the patches and birth control pills</li>
            <li>I can not handle not having estrogen, became very depressed, and mentally so foggy</li>
            <li>but they are barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I first used this product as my doctor moved me down from my customized estrogen prescription.</li>
            <li>Two weeks before my purchase, I have had a hot flash almost every half hour for twenty-four hours a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The other problem with it is that the \\&quot;squirts\\&quot; or doses, are very voluminous.  </li>
            <li>After taking myself off harmful synthetic hormones (after reading Suzanne Somers book Ageless) I knew I needed Estrogen but was not happy with just the Estriol cream as it didn&#x27;t seem to help very much with my hot flashes.  </li>
            <li>Today,  Dec. 13 (8 days later), I am in complete and utter misery.  </li>
            <li>I do recommend consulting with a medical professional prior to beginning the use of these products.</li>
            <li>I had been on prescription HRT for several years, tried tapering down and my hot flashes ect.</li>
            <li>In public, social settings, family events, shopping, the grocery store and everywhere</li>
            <li>If she only had this product to use as a substitute for the first few days</li>
            <li>Constant hot flashes,  dry eyes, dry skin, dry fingernails,  </li>
            <li>After much research I found out that as little as 1</li>
            <li>Although I still get some hot flashes, they are less severe and less frequent and they do not interrupt my sleep as often as they used to.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Great news though</li>
            <li> The reason, as a physician, I DO NOT recommend Biestro - otherwise a great product - is because it contains phenoxyethanol.</li>

            <li> This product is great, I feel so much better!</li>
            <li> I follow Dr John Lee and this is a brand that he recommends as being a good progestrone cream to buy.  </li>
            <li> not as good as I had hoped</li>
            <li> I have reordered, so it must be good.</li>
            <li> So I decided it might be wise to check my levels.  </li>
            <li> I also felt like Eyeore  in Winnie the Pooh -- nobody loved me and nobody cared about me anymore.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good smelling,not sticky.</li>
            <li> Good luck and</li>
            <li> Good luck and peace.</li>

            <li> So much better!  </li>
            <li> This is a really amazing cream, if I thought I wouldn&#x27;t offend my  MIL</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well to heal postpartum tears.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re a candidate, it seems to be effective.    </li>
            <li> Nice to feel like I don&#x27;t have to join the &#x27;scrap heap&#x27; just yet.</li>
            <li> Do your own homework- read Northrup and check online.</li>
            <li> This is well formulated and the pre-measured dose that the pump dispenses is handy and tidy.  </li>
            <li> OMG, I will be honest with you.  </li>
            <li> , it kind of freaked me out.  </li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t as effective for me, it may be all you need.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite effective to reduce the hotflashes.</li>
            <li> I do have one nice thing to say for this, tho.  </li>
            <li> This is a product I have come to love/use, and find effective.</li>
            <li> Ingredients looked safe and all, and reviews were good.</li>
            <li> She has been treated with every kind of anti-depressant and anti-seisure drug on the market along with birth control pill.</li>
            <li> the upside, my experience tells me that the product is effective.  </li>
            <li> the upside, my experience tells me that the product is effective.  </li>
            <li> Life-Flo products work very well for me and am very happy I found them.</li>
            <li> The cream does not have a strong smell, so there is no concern of not liking the smell, the cream is pleasant to apply.</li>
            <li> And, then, I experienced one day where I felt absolutely PREGNANT.  </li>
            <li> I am sure I must be very rare!!</li>
            <li> Started using this kind of hormonal creams and feel much better.</li>
            <li> Wow, I am a happy woman again!  </li>
            <li> The cream has a light consistency, is easy to apply and is unscented, although I cannot say the cream is odorless as I have a very acute sense of smell, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> I am having VERY light cycles again, but that&#x27;s okay with me to feel</li>
            <li> I feel more confident about myself, and my body hair seems to be growing a lot slower now.</li>
            <li> This cream has also helped me to sleep a bit better.</li>
            <li> -- I am still in search of better sleep.</li>
            <li> But it is much better.  </li>
            <li> Another more frivolous point in favor of this cream</li>
            <li> : people say I have been looking better than I have in a while since I started on this ream</li>
            <li> I used this solution for about 5 more years.  </li>
            <li> I have better energy and</li>
            <li> I thru it out and went with bio-identical much better</li>
            <li> I also ordered Dr. Lee&#x27;s cream and it works better and rubs in faster.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> You just get more for your money with Life-Flo.</li>
            <li> it was okay..</li>
            <li> I wish it were more of a serum.</li>
            <li> so so glad they made this</li>
            <li> It took over 6 weeks to begin to feel results but glad I didn&#x27;t give up.</li>
            <li> It took over 6 weeks to begin to feel results but glad I didn&#x27;t give up.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product will definitely use again just wish I had known about it</li>
            <li> I did research and found that estrogen replacement that resembled more like what the body would produce could be beneficial.</li>
            <li> Love it, works wonderful for my hormone changes I am currently having.</li>
            <li> My wife feels much better when she uses it.  </li>
            <li> and I do see many changes in my body.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read TONS about this, to be safe.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> With this cream I was able to get off premarin</li>
            <li> My skin feels so much better</li>
            <li> I would have never thought that something over the counter would help so much and a great price.  </li>
            <li> and I just wasn&#x27;t sure if I should be using this alone or with the progestra.  </li>
            <li> I am going to do a bit more research just to be sure I&#x27;m okay</li>
            <li> Keeps my wife&#x27;s post menopausal health in much better condition.</li>
            <li> More Update:  </li>
            <li> Still love it.  </li>
            <li> My thinking is still clearer, and yes, I do think my muscles are responding better to exercise.  </li>
            <li> More Update:  </li>
            <li> Still love it.  </li>
            <li> It seems to just sit on top of the skin, not absorb.</li>
            <li> I will try to find something else that absorbs better.</li>
            <li> Too soon to know  for sure?</li>
            <li> It will take awhile to know for sure.</li>
            <li> Love the pump which makes it easier to use.</li>
            <li> Make sure to use it with progesterone cream too.  </li>
            <li> The more Bi-estro care one uses, the more progesta-care has to be used since there has to be a healthy balance of estrogens to progesterone.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> It is one of the most affordable I have found.  </li>
            <li> ladies!!)It&#x27;s better than nothing, but</li>
            <li> and I find that I am getting better results.  </li>
            <li> I went off and began to have more headaches and mood swings.</li>
            <li> and I have been able to lose weight plus</li>
            <li> It takes a couple of months to build up to help symptoms the most.</li>
            <li> and he gave it an ok if it works</li>
            <li> If a woman needs more estrogen, then this product will probably work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feeling great now, so it´s very efficient.</li>
            <li> Not orally since it has so many more side</li>
            <li> This cream is okay</li>
            <li> Within hours I was out of bed and feeling so much better.</li>
            <li> Make sure u use both progesterone and the estrogen cream together.</li>
            <li> I love these two creams and recommend them to any and all.  </li>
            <li> Some need more.</li>
            <li> Some quite a bit more.  </li>

            <li> My doc recommended that I not take HRT because I had taken birth control pills for so many years</li>
            <li> We are so thankful that we seem to have found a better solution to keep her migraines at bay.</li>
            <li> We couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I added in this product after using Progesta-care for awhile, which took care of most of my menopausal symptoms</li>
            <li> My latest experiment with HRT has been in using bioidentical hormone</li>
            <li> I persisted for three more days just to rule out the possibility of a stomach bug, but my problems stopped almost immediately after I stopped using this</li>

            <li> I have noticed that it is softer and more moisturized.</li>
            <li> Hang in there girls, try 3 times a day, just might be the magic bullet for you as it was for me.</li>
            <li> This cream does help with hot flashes and is good when used in conjunction with HRT.</li>

            <li> I am very happy to see that bioidentical hormones such as this are now available over the counter.</li>
            <li> The first three or four days were wonderful; I felt completely normal.  </li>
            <li> This is pure and natural--a good way to supplement estrogen in menopause without all the risk of oral supplements.</li>
            <li> , I always lifted light weights but they didn&#x27;t work any more, and then I had the feeling of a urinary tract infection, like I had to go</li>
            <li> I do not feel comfortable adding a progesterone cream to my regimen as that would cause even more of an imbalance for me.</li>
            <li> I do not feel comfortable adding a progesterone cream to my regimen as that would cause even more of an imbalance for me.</li>
            <li> But that is not to say that it would not work great for someone who is going through natural menopause.  </li>
            <li> I am much more cheerful, and I feel like tackling the fall housecleaning that I couldn&#x27;t even make myself think about in September.  </li>
            <li> There have been a couple of comments about absolutely having to take progesterone if taking estrogen, but since my progesterone level tested good</li>

            <li> Easy</li>
            <li> Pump makes it easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It was too creamy and did not go into the skin that easily.</li>
            <li> The package arrived VERY quickly, so there was no waiting.</li>
            <li> The cream itself is not sticky and absorbs easily into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cream itself is not sticky and absorbs easily into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just be aware as others have said it does leave your skin feeling sticky and kind of clammy.</li>
            <li> I was able to cut the bottle with kitchen shears and found it full of product.  </li>
            <li> I still use the Progesta-care full amount, per instructions, and my menopausal symptoms are mostly relieved.  </li>
            <li> and I felt fine.  </li>
            <li> They worked wonderfully, but this cream is half the price.</li>
            <li> The patch has latex in the adhesive, giving me huge welts.  </li>
            <li> I think she could have avoided the 5 day migraine that resulted from a huge estrogen drop.</li>
            <li> and since it is transdermal (through the skin), it is absorbed better.  </li>
            <li> Important for cancer prevention.</li>
            <li> I found the Biestro Cream that contained both Estriol and the more powerful Estradiol as well.  </li>
            <li> i like this creme and it has really helped me over the winter; we&#x27;ll see if it works as well in summer as hot air tends to bring warm flushes(awful!).</li>
            <li> Just as others had posted, if you still have your uterus it is wise to also use a natural progesterone cream with it.  </li>
            <li> We thank you very much for having Biestro available for us to purchase!</li>
            <li> I was excited to find this product here.</li>
            <li> When I had my hormone levels checked they were higher than without the cream, but I still needed more.  </li>
            <li> Decided to try this one, and immediately the hot flashes and brain fog went away,  my mood and energy improved, and everything just got better.  </li>
            <li> So, I then tried 2 pumps and success!</li>
            <li> I need a lot more of the cream that I thought I would at first.  </li>
            <li> So, maybe it&#x27;s just me, but try a bottle first and limit the damages:)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews but felt it was my obligation to all the menopause women suffering from hot flashes.  </li>
            <li> Love the dispensing method of getting exactly what you need without measuring and there is no guessing that way</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it gets absorbed easily (unlike a progesterone cream I tried from another brand).</li>
            <li> Either way, 10 hours or even 24 hours later I can still feel it on my skin, and it isn&#x27;t pleasant.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a big difference too, as she is much nicer and life is much more pleasant now for both of us.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure when I purchased, it came on time and it really does work.</li>
            <li> My mom uses two full pumps.</li>
            <li> It smells clean and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Her hair has gotten much thicker and better looking now that she uses Biestro.  </li>
            <li> Love the measured pump, so you know about how much dosage you are getting.  </li>
            <li> Of course, I am not using it for replacement therapy, so I don&#x27;t use a full pump at once.  </li>
            <li> , I believe for me that the estradiol is what actually gave me this satisfaction, most creams do not have this, plus I love that it is paraben free.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t cut them out, just cut back, and eat plenty of protein and good fats.  </li>
            <li> I really have enjoyed using this product.  </li>
            <li> , I had to find a more affordable alternative for my HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy), and this works very well.</li>
            <li> If you really want to be sure about your hormones, you should get tested.  </li>
            <li> I have been in full blown parimenopause for three years.</li>
            <li> I appreciate very much that this product is so clean, free from harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> This product has my hot flashes and mood swings under control and is so easy to use...</li>
            <li> Other than that, great product.</li>
            <li> I took the menopause type test on the yourhormones.com site and the result indicated that my progesterone level is adequate</li>
            <li> Research told me it was compounded from pregnant horse urine</li>
            <li> how many drops of the oil I would have to use and then figured out how many days a bottle would last, I passed.</li>
            <li> and they were mild when I did.  </li>
            <li> Once in a while, I will have a mild &amp;#34;heat surge&amp;#34;, but not often -- maybe once a day, if that.  </li>
            <li> Good texture and didn&#x27;t take long to absorb, no bad smell.</li>
            <li> Got my results today and my levels are in a normal balance for the most part</li>
            <li> My new doctor knew about Life Flo products and was glad I stopped HRT Therapy.</li>
            <li> Works exactly for what I need it for!</li>
            <li> Talk to your doctor first!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for several weeks now and feel absolutely great, no difference that I can note, so this will be my new cream.  </li>
            <li> my neck was more and more wrinkled and dry.  </li>
            <li> I did great for 8 months, then began a cycle of heavy bleeding that lasted for WEEKS.  </li>
            <li> I did great for 8 months, then began a cycle of heavy bleeding that lasted for WEEKS.  </li>
            <li> The progesterone helps to calm u and the estrogen gives u energy.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t worth it for me.  </li>
            <li> I had full hysterectomy and was on the patch at first.</li>
            <li> I had a full hysterectomy and the doctor immediately popped a pill in my mouth for hot flashes.</li>
            <li> Over the years I educated myself with more natural  and organic products.</li>
            <li> I have had good results with it, but be careful -</li>
            <li> Just the more cheerful outlook on life is worth every penny and every extra pound that I now will have to fight off.  </li>
            <li> It absorbed like you would expect it to.</li>
            <li> I am glad it is available OTC finally</li>
            <li> She decided to try something more natural and we started with progesterone on day 12-28 of her cycle and Life-Flo Biestro-care two days before her period until the end of her period.</li>
            <li> Yes, the results were mild the first day.  </li>
            <li> Yes, the results were mild the first day.  </li>
            <li> Then, again, came the headaches, the hot flashes, the mild nausea.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective but it&#x27;s not super strong.  </li>
            <li> I am happy to say that this product keeps me hot flash free, at least 85-90% of the time.</li>
            <li> Despite the side effects, losing my candidacy for a straight jacket and a rubber room have made this product well worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This company always sends the product right out, no worries.  </li>
            <li> Just follow directions on both and adjust it to when you feel it is right for you.</li>
            <li> it has the right ingredients but it is too greasy</li>
            <li> I did and they found some dense tissue in my right breast.</li>
            <li> My weight gain has leveled off, I&#x27;m not crying any more (unless I forget it for two days) and the hot flashes and skin itching has STOPPED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One full pump is too much for me.  </li>
            <li> This can be a useful part of the whole treatment!</li>
            <li> meh.. smell is kind of strange and it just never dries.</li>
            <li> it keeps the hot flashes down better and lessens anxiety better than the esirol alone.  </li>
            <li> I am trying to use a little more of the Biestro cream to hopefully increase my estrogen to a more acceptable level.</li>
            <li> I am trying to use a little more of the Biestro cream to hopefully increase my estrogen to a more acceptable level.</li>
            <li> You think you are getting this really large bottle of product, but you are not!</li>
            <li> At first I started using a full pump, but it was way too much for my needs</li>
            <li> Low-dose oral HRT has improved most of my low-estrogen symptoms, but unfortunately not my dry skin, vaginal atrophy, or night sweats.</li>
            <li> Really works but is sticky and doesn&#x27;t absorb as quickly as RX.</li>
            <li> Was using Emeritta natural progesterone and phytoestrogen with good results till last summer when symptoms returned with a vengeance, was slathering the stuff on but my symptoms were still debilitating.</li>
            <li> My doctor  gave me a prescription when I  had very intense menopause symptoms.</li>
            <li> After quitting HRT entirely, my migraines had a significant drop in frequency, allowing me to be almost 100% pain free.  </li>
            <li> She claims that this product has made a huge difference in her life, and she feels alive again.</li>
            <li> I get hot flashes.  </li>
            <li> Made my skin on my hands look years younger and seemed to help me sleep better.</li>
            <li> (hot flashes again, lack of libido, insomnia), so</li>
            <li> I had nightsweats, insomnia and hot flashes.  </li>
            <li> Used at Night it keeps me out of Hot Flashes which then allows me to sleep all night.</li>
            <li> It has ended my hot flashes and is assisting with my hormonal-induced depression from surgical menopause.</li>
            <li> The hot flashes have gone, as have the night sweats, the moods have stabilized, I&#x27;m able to sleep, I have my memory and sense of orientation back, the anxiety has gone (thank goodness)</li>
            <li> If this ever stops working I will shell out the money for one of those expensive West Coast hormone doctors and all of their blood testing, but for now I will just keep using my wonderful voluminous sticky cream!  </li>
            <li> I am taking about 4 things to control hot flashes, and this is one of them.</li>
            <li> I did not experience a hot flash after stopping the patch,and thought \\&quot;I&#x27;m home fee from post menopausal problems\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Since I couldn&#x27;t afford the Divigel, I ordered this and prayed that it would work at least somewhat as well, and I am happy to report that it works every bit as well.</li>
            <li> I get night sweats and hot flashes without usage.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use Progesterone Cream at the same time!</li>
            <li> I use one pump on the skin of my legs the first two weeks of my cycle.  </li>
            <li> Never realized this was available online, so I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the ingredients were probably identical.  </li>
            <li> hot flashes&lt;br</li>
            <li> really cannot be with out it!</li>
            <li> With this version my hot flashes have almost stopped happening altogether.  </li>
            <li> those first weeks while you figure out what your dosage needs to be.  </li>
            <li> those first weeks while you figure out what your dosage needs to be.  </li>
            <li> So, if you feel this does not work for you, it would most likely be a dosage problem.</li>
            <li> I have had hot flashes for about 4 tears now.</li>
            <li> Stick with it and the Hot Flashes will just be a heat surge now and then.</li>
            <li> It does work pretty well.</li>
            <li> I started taking L-theanine throughout the day to lower my cortisol and that stopped the hot flashes.  </li>
            <li> and yes, it helped with my hot flashes, however I have just been diagnosed with BREAST CANCER.......</li>
            <li> Thank you so much Life-Flo!</li>
            <li> Instead of menstruating, I would get hot flashes.  </li>
            <li> This very mild dosage of estriol and estradiol (2 of the 3 main hormones women&#x27;s bodies produce - estrone is the 3rd) is just enough to provide me with the good benefits of estradiol without the high risk of prescription strenght.</li>
            <li> , she thought I was much too high risk and basically booted me to the curb to find my own way after a brief discussion about what I should try.  </li>
            <li> (vaginal atrophy reduces them), increased eyebrow and vaginal hair - which has come back to the original color of brown!  </li>
            <li> I tried Life-Flo Biestro-care as a possible substitute and it works just as well as my prescription did and at a much more reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> My last cycle was about a year ago, and I noticed (as did my husband and children), that I began having much more intense symptoms a couple of months ago.  </li>
            <li> Worked very well and will continue use for hot flashes</li>
            <li> Helps my mood &amp; hot flashes greatly, Thanks.</li>
            <li> This product has really helped me with hot flashes.  </li>
            <li> I was ready to kill myself and others - dealing with severe hot flashes, night sweats, insomnia, fatigue, and depression for well over 3 years.  </li>
            <li> Twice a day was doing nothing for me, then just out of pure desperation tried 3 times a day.</li>
            <li> (I wish it were more concentrated so less could be used), so for me this is useful as a night cream on my face/chest/hands (sometimes alternating with arms/feet to rotate application sites) at bedtime.</li>
            <li> More libido, less brain fog, overall feel more &#x27;myself.&#x27;    </li>
            <li> Apparently high cortisol can cause hot flashes, too.  </li>
            <li> The trick is to figure out what amount will work for you, so watch your symptoms and keep track of how much you are using so you can make adjustments as needed.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this that much.</li>
            <li> I was on physician prescribed bioidenticals years ago, and felt they made a real difference, then went off for a year and noticed the difference</li>
            <li> In my experience it takes time to feel a real difference, months.    </li>
            <li> She shook her head and said \\&quot;absolutely not!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The 20 percent Estradiol it contains( which I thought was only available by prescription) seemed to be the solution.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s safer because it is natural.adiol it contains( which I thought was only available by prescription)</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>
            <li> My mood is much improved.</li>
            <li> within days I had to stop HRT because I had symptoms of too much Estradiol</li>
            <li> There is too much cream mix with the product.  </li>
            <li> it really became a quality of life issue for me.</li>
            <li> The company should really do something about the odor  though.</li>
            <li> This cream really helped to decrease and almost eliminate my severe hotflashes.</li>
            <li> I would be cautious about using too much, could cause swelling or water retention?</li>
            <li> These bioidentical hormones are so much safer for the body than synthetic hormones that are often given to women for menopausal symptoms.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT THE REAL THING.  </li>
            <li> This is not the real estriol.  </li>
            <li> It really works, and I am comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I realize that low strength is required to be available over-the-counter, with no need for prescription.   </li>
            <li> Tried for 2 months really had high hopes!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get how it has real estradiol in it</li>
            <li> I really have zero menopausal symptoms.</li>
            <li> I Absolutely believe that using this product fanned the flames of my cancer.</li>
            <li> First off I used ProgestraCare Complete for over a month and it did not do much for my hot flashes but helped with dryness a lot.  </li>
            <li> As always, these conventions are very stressful events</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hot flashes for me consist of nausea, intense heat  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so absolutely grateful to the women who took the time to write about their experiences.</li>
            <li> It really does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> peace.h.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so absolutely grateful to the women who took the time to write about their experiences.</li>
            <li> It really does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much to my dismay, I had started menopause and didn&#x27;t know what was going on.  </li>
            <li> And, if you&#x27;ve been through surgical menopause, your body might very well be acclimated to a lower hormone level.  </li>
            <li> And, if you&#x27;ve been through surgical menopause, your body might very well be acclimated to a lower hormone level.  </li>
            <li> When I used one pump of this, after a few days I was drowning in my own sweat at night.</li>
            <li> However, I put the creme on the inner labia of the vagina - which is the most direct route, recommended by Dr. Jonathan Wright, the &amp;#34;father&amp;#34; of bio-identical hormones according to Suzanne Somers.  </li>
            <li> This might be okay if one pump was sufficient, but I have to do two at a time to get up to my previous dose, so it results in a pretty large amount of sticky cream to rub in.</li>
            <li> AND I CAN THINK CLEARLY!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m experiencing many less hot flashes, I&#x27;ve lost some weight</li>
            <li> Less hot flashes and better sleep.</li>
            <li> I live in an extremely hot and humid climate as well (Gulf Coast).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get confused constantly any longer, I don&#x27;t forget what I was doing mid presentation, my weight is under control, but most importantly my children and husband don&#x27;t have to live with an ogre any more, they have the kind caring Mom and wife back that they had become accustomed to in the years gone by.  </li>
            <li> I think has more estrogen in it than my the other brand I tried.</li>
            <li> There is no set formula or amount that is standard, every woman&#x27;s needs are unique.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness this product is available to those like me who do not have medical insurance and can not afford the full price of medical care.  </li>
            <li> I first got a progesterone cream which I love and still use, but I still had the stripes and the U.T.I. symptoms, so I added this cream the estrogen is what was missing, we are not all estrogen dominant.</li>
            <li> Not a single hot flash since first day.</li>
            <li> (not sure I agree, but it is nice of them</li>
            <li> wanted to try something natural to help with my hot flashes.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve never had any daytime hot flashes, so far).</li>
            <li> The cream/lotion is really industrial feeling and not what I would normally want on my body.  </li>
            <li> Hot flashes are COMPLETELY GONE.  </li>
            <li> Hot flashes are COMPLETELY GONE.  </li>
            <li> I would buy her one as a gift to make her less grumpy :)  </li>
            <li> but I would have emotional responses in the first couple of minutes of a hot flash</li>
            <li> Things do get better, especially if you can cut way back on carbs.  </li>
            <li> so I know it&#x27;s something in this particular product.  </li>
            <li> Once the evidence is in hand, then, and only then, should you consider supplementation.utely PREGNANT.  </li>
            <li> I can not live comfortably without this.  </li>
            <li> So, during the normal drop in estrogen,  I must have been down regulating more that</li>
            <li> I was right back at square one, but really didn&#x27;t like all the risks with Estradiol Rx.  </li>
            <li> If you have a need for estradiol, I highly recommend this dose.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The problem turned out to be high cortisol.  </li>
            <li> I tried many other natural products over the years and nothing else helped me.  </li>
            <li> Would love a little &amp;#34;window&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It turned out that my estrogen and progesterone were both normal, with my progesterone being comfortably high in proportion to estrogen.  </li>
            <li> The hot flashes became very intense, and sometimes I would have a hot flash followed by another one  only 10 or 15 minutes later.  </li>
            <li> I began using this cream about 10 days ago, and so far, it has been a real blessing to me.  </li>
            <li> This product allowed me to discontinue HRT completely without suffering the return of frequent hot flashes, which happened a year or so ago when I unsuccuessfully tried to get off of the synthetic hormones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product (once a day) for about six weeks along with a progesterone  cream.</li>
            <li> only problem I had was that when I used the pump for the first time, it dispensed too much cream.  </li>
            <li> In over four months I went from almost nothing regarding my Estradiol to within a normal with supplementation range.</li>
            <li> Just rub it on and you will start feeling better within just a few days.  </li>
            <li> BTW, once my estrogen receptors absorbed the estrogens, the period stopped by the 2nd month, but everything else has continued.  </li>
            <li> My bp went from a normal 120/60 to 190/105.</li>
            <li> I sleep normal.</li>
            <li> I have normal energy again.</li>
            <li> Before I had zero sex drive, its close to normal now.</li>
            <li> I am now almost, ALMOST, normal</li>
            <li> I felt normal.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s half the price of what I paid at my compounding pharmacy (but does lack the third kind of estrogen, the progesterone and dab of testosterone</li>
            <li> I cut back to 1/4th of a pump am &amp; pm and that is just about right for my needs.  </li>
            <li> I have definitely noticed a difference in how I feel right away with this product (using it for menopausal symptoms.)</li>
            <li> This is a new product for me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li> a heads up to anyone else who may live in a humid climate.</li>
            <li> and I can live with that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can live with that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried other bio-identical estrogens and they typically make me feel really good.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but this is something that has actually worked, and I was so surprised that I thought it worth writing something.</li>
            <li> Definitely not something to use on a whim without first looking into it, but</li>
            <li> This, along with Remifemin day and night formulations, is the only thing that&#x27;s worked to get rid of the thrice-hourly sweating hot flashes.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say if it is working because I barely used it</li>
            <li> I do see a big improvement with hot flashes.</li>
            <li> *Update 04/07/2015 After repetitively having heart palpitations/racing after many attempts to lower or spread out the dosage I just cannot use this.</li>
            <li> Not all hot flashes are caused by low estrogen.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d only used a fraction of my first bottle, and found I couldn&#x27;t return either to Amazon, so I&#x27;m stuck with 2 bottles of something I can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> By the following day the hot flashes were gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;During this time-frame, I would have occasional hot flashes during the week of my cycle.  </li>
            <li> By the 10th hour I will have one tiny break through hot flash and another on the 11th hour.  </li>
            <li> By the 10th hour I will have one tiny break through hot flash and another on the 11th hour.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my first hot flash a year and a half ago at a convention for my job.  </li>
            <li> It contains a good mix of real human estrogens, but it is sticky and weak.  </li>
            <li> the only thing i don&#x27;t care for is that cremes take longer to absorb or you have to apply over a large area.</li>
            <li> I cannot really say that this is a bad product because for some women it may work great for.  </li>
            <li> I used a very small amount, every other day, and the difference was amazing!</li>
            <li> I know it works because when I was taking too much I developed breast tenderness.  </li>
            <li> And my skin look so old lady wrinkled when I squeezed it, my muscle tone too</li>
            <li> There is no way of telling how much cream is left in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I had a hysterectomy when I was 39 years old.  </li>
            <li> I went almost immediately into early menopause.  </li>
            <li> Big plus is the transdermal delivery goes straight in your system, not through your digestive tract or liver.  </li>
            <li> Since I began natural HRT</li>
            <li> She said it is natural and that this is working well for me in combination to the patch to eliminate the symptoms I was experiencing with menopause</li>
            <li> This worked very well for me for about 1 year, then the night sweats started coming back.  </li>
            <li> I developed atopic vaginitis and interstitial cystitis.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s safer because it is natural.</li>
            <li> I also use Life Flo Progesta Care Complete along with it.</li>
            <li> This product really caused some massive pain in my breasts!</li>
            <li> I am a sensitive person age of 61.  </li>
            <li> So far I like it</li>
            <li> old</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li> This is a natural way to get your hormones, it&#x27;s plant based bio-identical and has made all the difference for me.</li>
            <li> i cant really give a rating as it wasn&#x27;t for me, i have received no feed back</li>
            <li> I use the progesterone also 10 days every month, also natural but FDA approved.</li>
            <li> , I have been using both ProgestraCare Complete and BiestroCare together for two weeks and my how flashes are almost gone.  </li>
            <li> I figure another week and they will be completely gone.  </li>
            <li> It has worked wonderfully so far.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t just assume that your doctor knows what they&#x27;re talking about if they haven&#x27;t gathered empirical evidence (blood work, hormone panels).  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t just assume that your doctor knows what they&#x27;re talking about if they haven&#x27;t gathered empirical evidence (blood work, hormone panels).  </li>
            <li> Back to research, nothing was working, was almost ready to allow dr to prescribe the dreaded hrt, then tried this product along with Allvia progesterone, pregnenolen and dhea.</li>
            <li> This toxic preservative is an endocrine disruptor and a skin irritant and should not be inside a hormone formula that gets applied on sensitive skin areas.&lt;br /&gt;Time</li>
            <li> I will update this review after I have been using the cream for a few months.&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Update: After using this cream for over a year I am still a bit low in estrogen but am still enjoying the relief of symptoms.</li>
            <li> My body turned against me, my skin mostly, it became so dry and had a brown discoloration down the front of my arms, I looked striped.</li>
            <li> I had a full Hysterectomy a couple of years ago, and have tried many different prescription HRT combinations, with very limited success (virtually no success), and I finally tried this, fully expecting it to be another rip off or waste of time, however I have to say one month in</li>
            <li> I was a Phyto-B rescue victim who depended on that product for over 10 years to stave off hot flashes and night sweats.</li>
            <li> (I also found out from a skincare forum I belong to that it was helpful on facial skin, had anti aging properties, used in small amount, especially in concert with Retin A *or probably retinols too, which are weaker version of prescription retin-a), so after I tried it awhile one great benefit I noticed was that my pesky chin hairs were getting softer and a little less, most likely counteracting the androgens that cause that issue in women.)    </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect it to actually work as well as it has so far with my severe hot flashes and other problems.  </li>
            <li> Also the only reason I knew it lasts for just a month is because when I tried to get more out of the bottle today, no more came out.</li>
            <li> I still have more energy, and don&#x27;t need three short naps a day to make it past 8 in the evening.  </li>
            <li> It might be having the desired hormonal effect, I am not sure yet, maybe the inactive ingredients are the ones that sit on top of the skin (doesn&#x27;t seem likely though).</li>
            <li> and I ended up spending the entire day having one hot flash every twenty minutes for ten hours.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle now, and no hot flashes, the price is right too!</li>
            <li> So far so good I will buy it again, I have been using four pumps am and pm and definitely notice a calming less anxious feeling.</li>
            <li> After one month of use, I had a light period for 3 days..plus sore nipples, fuller breasts, no more vaginal dryness, plump vaginal outer labia</li>
            <li> Cycles back to normal.</li>
            <li> Minimal hot flashes and night sweats</li>
            <li> Granted they didn&#x27;t try very hard, half-heartedly dispensing the kind of advice that you can find on any generic website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I live in a rural area without a lot of choices.)</li>
            <li> I realize most all companies do this in one way or another, but it really makes me angry</li>
            <li> To figure out how much to use (since I&#x27;m not using a full pump), I used a permanent marker to make small lines on the sides of the pump to indicate half a pump, 1/4 and 3/4 pumps - that helps me know how far to depress the pump to get the right amount for my needs.</li>
            <li> So for 16 years, I suffered through my hot flashes and other symptoms.</li>
            <li> I have been having hot flashes, mood swings,  acne, sleeplessness, cognitive issues and a myriad of other issues.  </li>
            <li> One pump twice a day helped me, but I still had hot flashes (milder and less frequent, but still there).  </li>
            <li> One pump twice a day helped me, but I still had hot flashes (milder and less frequent, but still there).  </li>
            <li> and I feel a general improvement in my moods and energy.  </li>
            <li> She was clear that she would reduce the estrogen dosage over time and as soon as I adjusted to a smaller dose.</li>
            <li> I am now ready to order my third bottle and finally am beginning to feel like my former self.</li>
            <li> I am now ready to order my third bottle and finally am beginning to feel like my former self.</li>
            <li> This product apparently works for some women but didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> twice daily) of natural progesterone ended the bleeding and I have not had a problem since.  </li>
            <li> (If you are old enough to need this cream, perhaps you remember the old commercial that said, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not a doctor, but I play one on TV.&amp;#34;  Well, I don&#x27;t even play one on TV!</li>
            <li> twice daily) of natural progesterone ended the bleeding and I have not had a problem since.  </li>
            <li> It seems like you have your natural hormones back.  </li>
            <li> the company will not offer a refund and the product is unusable, alcohol is an irritant on the highly sensitive area this is meant for and it never sated it had alcohol in it until you receive the product and read it on the back of the bottle</li>
            <li> ( I really thought I would find they had shipped an empty bottle):  </li>
            <li> It is one of the brands recommended by respected sources, such as Dr. Lee and Christine Northrup, experts on menopause the natural way.</li>
            <li> After several months of natural estrogen cream I found it works almost as well as the patches and birth control pills</li>
            <li> I can not handle not having estrogen, became very depressed, and mentally so foggy</li>
            <li> but they are barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I first used this product as my doctor moved me down from my customized estrogen prescription.</li>
            <li> Two weeks before my purchase, I have had a hot flash almost every half hour for twenty-four hours a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other problem with it is that the \\&quot;squirts\\&quot; or doses, are very voluminous.  </li>
            <li> After taking myself off harmful synthetic hormones (after reading Suzanne Somers book Ageless) I knew I needed Estrogen but was not happy with just the Estriol cream as it didn&#x27;t seem to help very much with my hot flashes.  </li>
            <li> Today,  Dec. 13 (8 days later), I am in complete and utter misery.  </li>
            <li> I do recommend consulting with a medical professional prior to beginning the use of these products.</li>
            <li> I had been on prescription HRT for several years, tried tapering down and my hot flashes ect.</li>
            <li> In public, social settings, family events, shopping, the grocery store and everywhere</li>
            <li> If she only had this product to use as a substitute for the first few days</li>
            <li> Constant hot flashes,  dry eyes, dry skin, dry fingernails,  </li>
            <li> After much research I found out that as little as 1</li>
            <li> Although I still get some hot flashes, they are less severe and less frequent and they do not interrupt my sleep as often as they used to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> hard part is finding the right dose for *you.  </li>
            <li> My doctor only did a urinalysis which showed absence of infection and treated me as if I were neurotic.</li>
            <li> Then, my doctor became concerned about my hormone levels due to being only 30 years old.  </li>
            <li> I am 15 years post-menopausal, having had a hysterectomy at 28 year old and using a prescribed Premarin patch till age 55, at which time my doctor told me I no longer needed them due to the cancer risk.</li>
            <li> I started using Progesta-care complete and Biestro-Care, I have stopped taking the oral HRT and no hot flashes.</li>
            <li> This works really well for me - I am 51 and still cycling, but with some low estrogen symptoms (not many).</li>
            <li> I began slowly upping the dosage, waiting 4 or 5 days between, until I got to where the hot flashes finally are gone.  </li>
            <li> I began slowly upping the dosage, waiting 4 or 5 days between, until I got to where the hot flashes finally are gone.  </li>
            <li> After about two weeks of daily application of this estriol/estradiol combo cream I started experiencing noticeable effects including reduced hot flashes, less frequency of urination, and less vaginal dryness.</li>
            <li> I am not sure this really works.  </li>
            <li> I had wanted to go through menopause \\&quot;naturally\\&quot;, but there is nothing natural about what I have gone through during the last few years, and now (at 59) I just found out I am osteoporotic and have lost an inch of height in a very short time!</li>
            <li> I can smile when they walk into the kitchen for breakfast and not wonder if they have been talking about me behind my back in the next room.  </li>
            <li> I started to feel really pumped up and decided to back off using the creams every other day but started having heart palpitations, trouble sleeping and anxiety.</li>
            <li> After having my ovaries removed at age 16 due to severe PCOS, I have been on several different hormone replacement products, from traditional HRT like PremPro and Premarin, birth control pills like Alesse and Seasonique, and then transdermal patches like the CombiPatch.  </li>
            <li> It has added appreciable moisture &amp; suppleness to my dry skin, visibly reduced my deep expression lines, &amp; lets me sleep through the night without those disruptive night sweats that I so despise</li>
            <li> The problem with applying it to fatty areas of the body like the inner thighs is that it doesn&#x27;t get to where it needs to go nearly as well.  </li>
            <li> I developed severe osteoporosis and regained only a small amount of bone density after taking the daily shots for a year.</li>
            <li> After all, I know a lot of women my age, and I only know of one woman that had hot flashes worse than mine in the last 10 years.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this cream because it is so inexpensive compared to other similar products and contains estradiol, but I just can&#x27;t get past the stickiness of this cream.  </li>
            <li> I was on HRT for 20 years tried everything under the sun to get off it since it can be harmful long term</li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of time.</li>
            <li> lasting two minutes and a drenching, wringing wet sweat for two minutes.  </li>
            <li> It help but did not completely resolve my problems  </li>
            <li> It help but did not completely resolve my problems  </li>
            <li> Last year, my hot flashes got worse--</li>
            <li> Should have left a transparent strip down one side so users can tell how much is left.</li>
            <li> After one month, having felt quite lethargic for the previous several months, I suddenly had loads of energy and started pulling out bushes and digging flower beds in the front yard!</li>
            <li> It was too late to return it as I used the other two bottles first.</li>
            <li> like most of Life Flo&#x27;s estriol/progesterone and related products, the odour on this is pretty horrible, but I will keep using for as long as it 1/ works and 2/ is affordable.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also helped with other menopausal symptoms such as dryness.</li>
            <li> Banging it on the side of the sink in various places about 100 times a night usually gets me enough to equal 2 pumps, but I can&#x27;t wait til this thing is done</li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s due to a REALLY low estrogen level before I began the cream.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this for a woman who has very minor symptoms.</li>
            <li> I like the consistence since my skin is dry.</li>
            <li> cream even cured my dry eyes.</li>
            <li> My skin was dry..</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is due to this particular cream or both.</li>
            <li> every single day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am only using half a pump every other night as I alternate between this one and the progestacare.</li>
            <li> I love that it works well as a face &amp; neck cream since I find the sticky texture unpleasant on the body under clothing.</li>
            <li> It is not a good way to get ready for bed (blood pressure rises with every bang).</li>
            <li> I am so surprised that there are not more comments about the feel of this cream....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this along with natural progesterone cream for the past four months.</li>
            <li> I tried the Progestra Care and while my hot flashes had really decreased I still had them once or twice a day</li>
            <li> I tried this and my hot flashes got a lot worse.  </li>
            <li> Saved my Marriage, and my SANITY after total hysterectomy due to cancer!</li>
            <li> I can only liken it to second degree burns that was only relieved by laying down with a small ice pack in order to sleep.</li>
            <li> I have never had a hot flash, but I thought I was losing my mind, and my husband was seriously considering taking up residence under the couch!</li>
            <li> I was dry all over!  </li>
            <li> I like topical hormones, as safer and subject to fewer side effects.</li>
            <li> All problems disappeared after only 1 week and with half of the dose.</li>
            <li> It was a little bit low on my Estrogen needs</li>
            <li> I have not eaten any little children or cried uncontrollably in public since I started using hormone creams!  </li>
            <li> Should have put it on a wide twist off cap instead.</li>
            <li> Since then it has worked well and is a relatively non messy way to dispense the cream.</li>
            <li> I lost 30 pounds in three years and felt like a dried up shell of my former self.</li>
            <li> I also believe this product is helping somewhat with my mental fog.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why they couldn&#x27;t just answer my question instead of sending me to a call center?</li>
            <li> I have spent close to 800 on Rx prescriptions...</li>
            <li> I knew there would be an adjustment period, but that adjustment period never really ended.  </li>
            <li> and when I do get them, they are minimal.</li>
            <li> These contain far less of the estrogens (estradiol and estriol) than one would usually get if a doctor prescribed them.  </li>
            <li> Since the other brand estrogen I was using was discontinued (Source Naturals Phyto-Estrogen Cream), I switched to this.</li>
            <li> my Fibrocystic Breast Disease and other breast issues went away.</li>
            <li> Buy from Amazon because other sites charge 2-3 times the price.</li>
            <li> Now, to show you this is not a fake review, I will tell you what is wrong with the product.  </li>
            <li> This reduced my hotflashes, insomnia, and other menopause symptoms about 95 percent.</li>
            <li> It does not absorb as well as other products I have used</li>
            <li> It helps manage vaginal dryness using a small amount applied externally in the vaginal area.</li>
            <li> but due to the almost unaffordable price of the product, I decided to try the Biestro-care.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m exploring adding other Life-Flo products to my &amp;#34;bag of tricks&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have use this product for over two years but this is the first time that both bottles the pump failed to work.</li>
            <li> I had been using various herbal supplements for the past 8 or 10 years for pre-menopausal symptoms, and after a year or so of using something, my body would get used to it, and I would have to either up my dosage, or switch to some other product.  </li>
            <li> , I decided to use it every other day, I am 68 yr.</li>
            <li> You will find this issue in other reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products that do</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I am guessing it is due to the lack of estrogen in my body that was replaced by this cream.  </li>
            <li> was walking around with makeup streaked down my face, wet hair</li>
            <li> I just read a discussion on Hyster Sisters about whether the positive reviews on this product are fake, placed by the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> After all, I don&#x27;t want to deal with  osteoporosis and other problems down the line.  </li>
            <li> For years I used black cohosh and other herbs</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to know where to start when you actually decide to try something.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is it&#x27;s a lot to spread on, but at least it works.  </li>
            <li> This stuff shuts all that down.  </li>
            <li> I made it three days before I broke down and bought a bunch of OTC stuff off amazon.</li>
            <li> , it has a kind of rank smell and it is greasy, therefore, not suitable for daytime use on the face.  </li>
            <li> but I was still suffering with painful dryness, it literally hurt to use toilet tissue (Too much information!).  </li>
            <li> On the last container the pump did not work so the entire contents were useless.</li>
            <li> I use about half of that.  </li>
            <li> Life-Flo gives you 4.0oz for much less.</li>
            <li> I unfortunately need a higher dose that I&#x27;m not able to get with this cream.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint is that the formula is heavy.  </li>
            <li> My symptoms are much less</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m less moody using this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for a year and a half now . . .</li>
            <li> However, the stickiness of it is uncomfortable enough for me in the summertime that I will have to wash it off during the day and may go back to my previous brand and save this for colder weather.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the cost is less than the patches.</li>
            <li> By the end of a shopping expedition, people would be looking at me oddly.  </li>
            <li> I can hold a conversation with a teenager or young adult child who doesn&#x27;t totally agree with me, and I don&#x27;t lay awake for hours in the night fearful that they will turn out to be drug addicts or something.  </li>
            <li> By the end of the day I was a drenched, frazzled and wilted mess.  </li>
            <li> and my night sweats are down to a few in a week.  </li>
            <li> I gave it four stars, because the smell is a little off.</li>
            <li> Not obnoxious, just a little plastic-like.</li>
            <li> (too little  </li>
            <li> I was spending $50 each month for a compounded version from a compounding pharmacy that my doctor prescribed, so I was a little hesitant to switch to this brand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still a little weepy</li>
            <li> have had approximately five menstrual cycles in the last year and a half.  </li>
            <li> There are a few downsides to this though.</li>
            <li> I now wish I had started using this a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Not only is this frustrating and embarrassing, but has resulted in 3 urinary tract infections in 2 years.</li>
            <li> After just a few days on the Divigel samples, I stopped crying and yelling.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several bottles, one pump was broken.  </li>
            <li> I threw out both bottles...total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Hot flashes were half as bad and by the 10th hour were severe again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hot flashes were half as bad and by the 10th hour were severe again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish the company could fix these two problems, but considering how bad I was feeling before finding this product, I am willing to deal.  </li>
            <li> It has been 2 months now and she has not had a bad one since she first went off her birth control pill.</li>
            <li> and I even began to wear dresses and long skirts without underwear because my vaginal tissue was so thin</li>
            <li> Then the one ovary I had shut down and symptoms slowly returned.  </li>
            <li> We have to be careful what she puts on her skin since she is terribly allergic to propylene glycol and this product is free from that chemical.</li>
            <li> There is a slight order as well, which I could get past if it weren&#x27;t for the thick consistency of this cream.  </li>
            <li> I had not even used any yet and there was at least a little over an inch of space between the bottom and where the product began.</li>
            <li> The cream is thick and takes a little while to soak in.</li>
            <li> I usually apply at bedtime after showering.  </li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t be lazy about it anymore.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it also causes the same side effects, which are a back ache for a couple of days and weird difficulty urinating for about 4 days each month.</li>
            <li> No more night sweats and</li>
            <li> No problems at all for the past 8 months now.</li>
            <li> It is not a top you can unscrew or pop off.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get my usual estrogen product</li>
            <li> All of these have so many terrible side effects.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s impossible to live with.  </li>
            <li> That gave me horrible back and leg pains, so much I couldn&#x27;t walk or sleep.</li>
            <li> She has been going through menopause and not very pleasant to be around.</li>
            <li> would continually swell up making it hard to breath.</li>
            <li> The pills made it hard for me to control my weight.</li>
            <li> and I developed painful breasts.  </li>
            <li> The packaging is also bulky and rather clumsy to handle.</li>
            <li> Feels icky</li>
            <li> I have a vaginal problem that came with  menopause that is common in women who haven&#x27;t had children and let me tell you...</li>
            <li> At least that&#x27;s what worked for me.  </li>
            <li> If I take it too late in day I can&#x27;t sleep.</li>
            <li> Menopause really sucks</li>
            <li> Menopause really sucks</li>
            <li> That was the toughest part since she dropped it cold turkey which was a big mistake.</li>
            <li> I had a crushing headache with an aura, combined with terrible morning sickness that didn&#x27;t subside until I took prescription pain medication.  </li>
            <li> I had a crushing headache with an aura, combined with terrible morning sickness that didn&#x27;t subside until I took prescription pain medication.  </li>
            <li> This product is thick and sticky.  </li>
            <li> After four weeks of using this cream, things are still slowly improving.  </li>
            <li> Starting having different issues from feeling tired, depressed, hot flashes and worst of all painful sex.</li>
            <li> I was previously on estradiol in pill form, which worked, but I learned taking it orally is not ideal.  </li>
            <li> I mean come on....</li>
            <li> , if you are undecided but feel unable to function due to menopause, please give it a chance.  </li>
            <li> , if you are undecided but feel unable to function due to menopause, please give it a chance.  </li>
            <li> Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> A subtle return to &amp;#34;feeling like myself</li>
            <li> so tired, confused crying...</li>
            <li> forward to the present:  I have been miserable for the last two months.  </li>
            <li> too much is also a bad thing!  </li>
            <li> Bad because my energy level is so low since I&#x27;m not taking it.</li>
            <li> I also use progesterone, not a good idea to add just estrogen.</li>
            <li> and you kinda sweat behind it, a very odd and uncomfortable feeling.</li>
            <li> While being sealed does keep contaminates out, there is no way to get the last drop of the cream out with out cutting the bottle!</li>
            <li> I have been suffering for over a year with horrible effects of vaginal dryness , brain fog, hot flashes all those menopausal symptoms.  </li>
            <li> I was very edgy and irritable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I was deficient in estrogen, so that is what prompted me to try this product.  </li>
            <li> I began to fear my husband would grow tired of my complaints and end our marriage.</li>
            <li> Another review compared it to sunscreen, but I think it is way worse.  </li>
            <li> I guess that I was so deficient in estrogen that it took 8 months for my body to catch up on the estrogen before needing the progesterone.</li>
            <li> I guess that I was so deficient in estrogen that it took 8 months for my body to catch up on the estrogen before needing the progesterone.</li>
            <li> I hate wearing it when I do yard work and wash it off the instant</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even respond verbally at its worse.</li>
            <li> Just when I think my cycles are behind me,</li>
            <li> on 2 of the bottles I got I took the plastic off the bottom of container and it had a false bottom in it.</li>
            <li> I had the surgery in 1996 and was not on any estrogen afterwards, because basically, I was afraid of the  hormone therapy that is usually offered in a doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> It seems to work fine hormonally but the base it is in is awful, very thick and damp-feeling.</li>
            <li> but I have had a long ugly run with the menopause beast!  </li>
            <li> I started peri-menopause about 18 months ago and thought I must have something dreadful happening with my body for everything to be so broken and horrid all of a sudden.  </li>
            <li> Estro500 is ridiculously expensive...</li>
            <li> On random nights when I&#x27;ve been too lazy/tired/forgot to go through the application process, the night sweats return....</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 3 months now after finding out how outrageously expensive the Divigel prescription my OB/GYN gave me was.</li>
            <li> I was taking the Phyto-B until they pulled it off the market, and unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t found anything else that compares.</li>
            <li> The labs revealed postmenopausal levels of estradiol and progesterone, which is sad considering I&#x27;m still in my forties.</li>
            <li> Not perfect, but I&#x27;ll take it!  </li>
            <li> Can cause even worse headaches!  </li>
            <li> -- I am not an angry person, but I felt like throwing a brick through a window or something.  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER, I ended up being wrong about not needing any progesterone cream to balance things out.  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER, I ended up being wrong about not needing any progesterone cream to balance things out.  </li>
            <li> and this was completely wrong.  </li>
            <li> No matter what method was used, I tended to get horrible migraines occasionally.  </li>
            <li> Very frustrating.  </li>
            <li> I use less of this than recommended as at this stage, I do not have any of the horrible symptoms that come with menopause.  </li>
            <li> However, at 50, I decided to see if the symptoms had passed at went cold turkey.  </li>
            <li> I also buy in bulk because I&#x27;m afraid any minute they will discontinue this because it works too well.</li>
            <li> Consumers aren&#x27;t stupid...if you are in desperate need of estrogen</li>
            <li> It makes me feel cold and clammy</li>
            <li> My body went crazy and I was worried that this stuff wouldn&#x27;t work....</li>
            <li> I looked like a drug addict or a crazy woman.  </li>
            <li> I mean was a relief!!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After horrible experiences with a string of other products, I decided to try bioidentical hormone cream in the hopes that it wouldn&#x27;t make me sick.  </li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> I had virtually ALL the menopausal symptoms, and was rather unpleasant to be around (even for me)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really shocked at this.  </li>
            <li> but so desperate was I for any amount of relief I would have tried anything!</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t have any noticeable effect on me. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> But, I was so very,  very desperate.  </li>
            <li> The product is so sticky, I hate using it.  </li>
            <li> (I hate to wake up at night like this, don&#x27;t you?)</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;The pill&amp;#34; reduced my headaches to a couple of days a week but came with horrific, painful bleeding during the placebo days.  </li>
            <li> I hated my symptoms.  </li>
            <li> I was having very bad night sweats.  </li>
            <li> I had horrible headaches on the pill</li>
            <li> I knew from experience that I needed Estrogen but had awful side effects from the birth control pill my doc prescribed.  </li>
            <li> After three months of feeling terrible, I quit using the patch and &#x27;fired&#x27; my doctor for not listening to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> At first I started using a full pump, but it was way too much for my needs and I developed painful breasts.  I cut back to 1/4th of a pump am &amp; pm and that is just about right for my needs.  I know it works because when I was taking too much I developed breast tenderness.  When I don&#x27;t use it at all I get hot flashes.  The trick is to figure out what amount will work for you, so watch your symptoms and keep track of how much you are using so you can make adjustments as needed.  To figure out how much to use (since I&#x27;m not using a full pump), I used a permanent marker to make small lines on the sides of the pump to indicate half a pump, 1/4 and 3/4 pumps - that helps me know how far to depress the pump to get the right amount for my needs.</li>
            <li> Every since hitting menopause, UGH!  My body turned against me, my skin mostly, it became so dry and had a brown discoloration down the front of my arms, I looked striped. And my skin look so old lady wrinkled when I squeezed it, my muscle tone too, I always lifted light weights but they didn&#x27;t work any more, and then I had the feeling of a urinary tract infection, like I had to go but nothin came out, just had me squirming, out of my mind. Doctor found no infection, she said its your hormones or lack of them. I decided to fight back. I first got a progesterone cream which I love and still use, but I still had the stripes and the U.T.I. symptoms, so I added this cream the estrogen is what was missing, we are not all estrogen dominant. So if you recognize any symptoms try this cream. It helped me.</li>
            <li> Being a transsexual, I have used this for a month now and I see some breasts developing and my hips getting a bit wider. I feel more confident about myself, and my body hair seems to be growing a lot slower now. This definitely is taking effect. Since the other brand estrogen I was using was discontinued (Source Naturals Phyto-Estrogen Cream), I switched to this. There are a few downsides to this though. It only lasted me exactly a month and for $20, that is pretty expensive. Another flaw is the bottle the cream is in. While being sealed does keep contaminates out, there is no way to get the last drop of the cream out with out cutting the bottle! I don&#x27;t like this that much. Should have put it on a wide twist off cap instead. Also the only reason I knew it lasts for just a month is because when I tried to get more out of the bottle today, no more came out. There is no way of telling how much cream is left in the bottle. Should have left a transparent strip down one side so users can tell how much is left. Because of these flaws, I took off 2 stars. Other than that, great product.</li>
            <li> Made my skin on my hands look years younger and seemed to help me sleep better.</li>
            <li> Love it, works great!</li>
            <li> Worked very well and will continue use for hot flashes</li>
            <li> I was on physician prescribed bioidenticals years ago, and felt they made a real difference, then went off for a year and noticed the difference (hot flashes again, lack of libido, insomnia), so I was excited to find this product here. It&#x27;s half the price of what I paid at my compounding pharmacy (but does lack the third kind of estrogen, the progesterone and dab of testosterone my Rx had).    It has restored some of my sense of former well being I had on the rx prescribed version. More libido, less brain fog, overall feel more &#x27;myself.&#x27;    (I also found out from a skincare forum I belong to that it was helpful on facial skin, had anti aging properties, used in small amount, especially in concert with Retin A *or probably retinols too, which are weaker version of prescription retin-a), so after I tried it awhile one great benefit I noticed was that my pesky chin hairs were getting softer and a little less, most likely counteracting the androgens that cause that issue in women.)    In my experience it takes time to feel a real difference, months.    I suggest doing your homework on this topic before using. It is probably contraindicated in some cases (where breast cancer or estrogen sensitivity is an issue). Definitely not something to use on a whim without first looking into it, but if you&#x27;re a candidate, it seems to be effective.    [...].</li>
            <li> Estradiol has been crucial from getting my memory back during perimenopause. I was losing it before!  This cream has also helped me to sleep a bit better. I&#x27;m not fully there yet -- I am still in search of better sleep. But it is much better.  I find I need a pump to get back to sleep when I wake up in the middle of the night.  My understanding is that estrogen increases serotonin.  Another more frivolous point in favor of this cream: people say I have been looking better than I have in a while since I started on this ream (not sure I agree, but it is nice of them anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need about 4-5 pumps/day.</li>
            <li> I had a hysterectomy when I was 39 years old.  I went almost immediately into early menopause.  For years I used black cohosh and other herbs and I felt fine.  Then the one ovary I had shut down and symptoms slowly returned.  I had nightsweats, insomnia and hot flashes.  My doctor put me on .5 mg of estrogen, took a pill daily.  This almost immediately took care of my symptoms  I used this solution for about 5 more years.  However, at 50, I decided to see if the symptoms had passed at went cold turkey.  I was right back at square one, but really didn&#x27;t like all the risks with Estradiol Rx.  I was so bloated from it too.  I tried BiEstro for 3 weeks and by the 4th my symptoms are now gone.  i put it on morning and evening.  Easy and I lost about 8 lbs.  I used this in conjunction with DHEA cream, that Life-Flo also sells.  I have better energy and my vaginal atrophy/dryness has improved as well. Big plus is the transdermal delivery goes straight in your system, not through your digestive tract or liver.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> On the last container the pump did not work so the entire contents were useless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review. I decided to write about this product. It&#x27;s great! I wasn&#x27;t sure when I purchased, it came on time and it really does work. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) for 25 years. Since I began natural HRT my Fibrocystic Breast Disease and other breast issues went away. Instead of six month mammograms I&#x27;m now back to twelve months.  I found this particular brand and manner of dosage to be easy, convenient and I feel great. I also use the progesta care.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife a while back. She has been going through menopause and not very pleasant to be around. It took about  month, but she started noticing differences in the way that she felt. She claims that this product has made a huge difference in her life, and she feels alive again. I have noticed a big difference too, as she is much nicer and life is much more pleasant now for both of us.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product. Pump makes it easy to apply. Does not stain Clothing. Used at Night it keeps me out of Hot Flashes which then allows me to sleep all night.</li>
            <li> Works great and it&#x27;s a great price ! I have no menopause symptoms whatsoever ! It takes care of hot flashes and dryness, it works great ! It is so affordable ! This product is life changing !</li>
            <li> I thru it out and went with bio-identical much better</li>
            <li> I went to the dr because I had started crying and couldn&#x27;t stop for two straight weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeay.  Menopause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff brought me back to life.  My weight gain has leveled off, I&#x27;m not crying any more (unless I forget it for two days) and the hot flashes and skin itching has STOPPED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can SLEEP again!  Yeay!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hard part is finding the right dose for *you.  One full pump is too much for me.  I use about half of that.  My mom uses two full pumps.</li>
            <li> It was too creamy and did not go into the skin that easily. I also ordered Dr. Lee&#x27;s cream and it works better and rubs in faster.</li>
            <li> My insurance company will no longer cover my prescription bio-identical estrogen.  I tried Life-Flo Biestro-care as a possible substitute and it works just as well as my prescription did and at a much more reasonable price.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use it anymore. Had a reaction to it.</li>
            <li> This product was a lifesaver for me.  I use it daily.  The difference since I started using this is night and day. Buy from Amazon because other sites charge 2-3 times the price. I hope they never discontinue this product!</li>
            <li> This is a new product for me. I&#x27;ve used the Estro500 and they are basically the same. You just get more for your money with Life-Flo. Estro500 is ridiculously expensive...1.7oz for $40. Life-Flo gives you 4.0oz for much less. It smells clean and absorbs quickly. It has ended my hot flashes and is assisting with my hormonal-induced depression from surgical menopause. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This product allowed me to discontinue HRT completely without suffering the return of frequent hot flashes, which happened a year or so ago when I unsuccuessfully tried to get off of the synthetic hormones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product (once a day) for about six weeks along with a progesterone  cream. Although I still get some hot flashes, they are less severe and less frequent and they do not interrupt my sleep as often as they used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had was that when I used the pump for the first time, it dispensed too much cream.  Since then it has worked well and is a relatively non messy way to dispense the cream.</li>
            <li> I just went to get a follow up with my Novartis Combi-Patch. It was a little bit low on my Estrogen needs so I had been supplementing the patch with Life Flo BiEstro-Care - She Approved! She said it is natural and that this is working well for me in combination to the patch to eliminate the symptoms I was experiencing with menopause so Keep using it! I have been using it for almost a year now. When the anxiety starts to creep in, I just use a pump in the AM and another pump in the pm to reduce the symptoms. Working great for me. Good lukc, ladies- find what works for you! :)</li>
            <li> This worked very well for me for about 1 year, then the night sweats started coming back.  I am currently looking for for another product.</li>
            <li> I had a full Hysterectomy a couple of years ago, and have tried many different prescription HRT combinations, with very limited success (virtually no success), and I finally tried this, fully expecting it to be another rip off or waste of time, however I have to say one month in and I feel the best I have in many years. I had virtually ALL the menopausal symptoms, and was rather unpleasant to be around (even for me), this has helped with virtually everything. The hot flashes have gone, as have the night sweats, the moods have stabilized, I&#x27;m able to sleep, I have my memory and sense of orientation back, the anxiety has gone (thank goodness), I can actually function at work again, I don&#x27;t get confused constantly any longer, I don&#x27;t forget what I was doing mid presentation, my weight is under control, but most importantly my children and husband don&#x27;t have to live with an ogre any more, they have the kind caring Mom and wife back that they had become accustomed to in the years gone by.  I never write reviews, but this is something that has actually worked, and I was so surprised that I thought it worth writing something. The package arrived VERY quickly, so there was no waiting. The cream does not have a strong smell, so there is no concern of not liking the smell, the cream is pleasant to apply. I did have a headache for a couple of weeks while my body got used to the change in hormone levels, but not drinking tea (caffiene) or sugar helped that immediately. This is a really amazing cream, if I thought I wouldn&#x27;t offend my  MIL I would buy her one as a gift to make her less grumpy :)  I use it twice a day, once before bed, and once when I get up after showering, and it has worked a treat. I have a memory again which is simply fabulous!!!!! Nice to feel like I don&#x27;t have to join the &#x27;scrap heap&#x27; just yet.</li>
            <li> I follow Dr John Lee and this is a brand that he recommends as being a good progestrone cream to buy.  I unfortunately need a higher dose that I&#x27;m not able to get with this cream.  When I had my hormone levels checked they were higher than without the cream, but I still needed more.  I was using it several times a day to try to get the level I needed.  It wasn&#x27;t worth it for me.  I would recommend this for a woman who has very minor symptoms.</li>
            <li> I just read a discussion on Hyster Sisters about whether the positive reviews on this product are fake, placed by the manufacturer.  It was enough to inspire me to do a review in defense of this product, which I have been using now for about two years.  I was previously on estradiol in pill form, which worked, but I learned taking it orally is not ideal.  Then, I tried a compounded prescription cream which, for whatever reason, did not seem to work at all, and the doc didn&#x27;t seem to know what he was doing.  (I live in a rural area without a lot of choices.) Decided to try this one, and immediately the hot flashes and brain fog went away,  my mood and energy improved, and everything just got better.  Now, to show you this is not a fake review, I will tell you what is wrong with the product.  Number one, as others have stated, it is STICKY.  It took about a year to train my husband to quit commenting on my sticky skin when he touched me.  I had to explain to him that the sticky cream is the reason I am not a psycho anymore, and he eventually got it.  I live in an extremely hot and humid climate as well (Gulf Coast).  The other problem with it is that the \\&quot;squirts\\&quot; or doses, are very voluminous.  This might be okay if one pump was sufficient, but I have to do two at a time to get up to my previous dose, so it results in a pretty large amount of sticky cream to rub in. I wish the company could fix these two problems, but considering how bad I was feeling before finding this product, I am willing to deal.  I use Dr. Lee&#x27;s progesterone cream as well, which thankfully is a tiny amount.  If this ever stops working I will shell out the money for one of those expensive West Coast hormone doctors and all of their blood testing, but for now I will just keep using my wonderful voluminous sticky cream!  I also buy in bulk because I&#x27;m afraid any minute they will discontinue this because it works too well.</li>
            <li> I think has more estrogen in it than my the other brand I tried. I am taking about 4 things to control hot flashes, and this is one of them.</li>
            <li> wanted to try something natural to help with my hot flashes. it was okay..not as good as I had hoped</li>
            <li> I was having very bad night sweats.  This product has worked well and my night sweats are down to a few in a week.  The only complaint is that the formula is heavy.  I wish it were more of a serum.</li>
            <li> this cream works great at relieving menopausal symptoms.  and since it is transdermal (through the skin), it is absorbed better.  so so glad they made this and it is a great price too.</li>
            <li> After about two weeks of daily application of this estriol/estradiol combo cream I started experiencing noticeable effects including reduced hot flashes, less frequency of urination, and less vaginal dryness. I have been using one pump per day, alternating as suggested between abdomen, inner thighs, inner arms. The cream has a light consistency, is easy to apply and is unscented, although I cannot say the cream is odorless as I have a very acute sense of smell, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. I usually apply at bedtime after showering.  I now wish I had started using this a few years ago. I had wanted to go through menopause \\&quot;naturally\\&quot;, but there is nothing natural about what I have gone through during the last few years, and now (at 59) I just found out I am osteoporotic and have lost an inch of height in a very short time! I hope that I can undo some of the damage that has been done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have said that if you use estrogen you must also use progesterone but everyone&#x27;s needs are specific to them. There is no set formula or amount that is standard, every woman&#x27;s needs are unique. I don&#x27;t have insurance and can&#x27;t afford hormone testing so it&#x27;s hard to know where to start when you actually decide to try something.  I took the menopause type test on the yourhormones.com site and the result indicated that my progesterone level is adequate but I was deficient in estrogen, so that is what prompted me to try this product.  I really didn&#x27;t expect it to actually work as well as it has so far with my severe hot flashes and other problems.  I will update this review after I have been using the cream for a few months.&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Update: After using this cream for over a year I am still a bit low in estrogen but am still enjoying the relief of symptoms. I finally did the saliva testing (you can order a female profile kit for 171US (Estradiol (E2), Progesterone (Pg), Testosterone (T), DHEA&#x27;s, and morning Cortisol (C)) Still expensive for many of us but nothing compared to going to a doctor/heath practitioner. There have been a couple of comments about absolutely having to take progesterone if taking estrogen, but since my progesterone level tested good but my estrogen is still low I do not feel comfortable adding a progesterone cream to my regimen as that would cause even more of an imbalance for me. I am trying to use a little more of the Biestro cream to hopefully increase my estrogen to a more acceptable level.Still expensive for many of us but nothing compared to going to a doctor/heath practitioner.

            <li> Total hysterectomy in 2011. This reduced my hotflashes, insomnia, and other menopause symptoms about 95 percent. The only downside is it&#x27;s a lot to spread on, but at least it works.  1 pump once a day took about 2 wks for 1/2 reduction in flashes and a month for 95% reduction.  I also use 1 pump of this brand progesterone cream 3 weeks out of the month.  I began using these creams in January 2015.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness this product is available to those like me who do not have medical insurance and can not afford the full price of medical care.  Of course access to lab testing and symptom noting has been helpful in decision for using this product, it&#x27;s my savior through the various stages of peri-menopause.</li>
            <li> I am a post menopausal female who has suffered with urge incontinence for the last 2 years. Not only is this frustrating and embarrassing, but has resulted in 3 urinary tract infections in 2 years. After much research I found out that as little as 1 mg can help this condition. Do your own homework- read Northrup and check online.</li>
            <li> This product is thick and sticky.  It does not absorb as well as other products I have used</li>
            <li> I am 15 years post-menopausal, having had a hysterectomy at 28 year old and using a prescribed Premarin patch till age 55, at which time my doctor told me I no longer needed them due to the cancer risk.I did not experience a hot flash after stopping the patch,and thought \\&quot;I&#x27;m home fee from post menopausal problems\\&quot;. WRONG! I developed severe osteoporosis and regained only a small amount of bone density after taking the daily shots for a year. My facial skin was severely wrinkling and my body skin would tear like tissue with the slightest injury. I lost 30 pounds in three years and felt like a dried up shell of my former self. I developed atopic vaginitis and interstitial cystitis. I couldn&#x27;t sit or drive or wear pants and I even began to wear dresses and long skirts without underwear because my vaginal tissue was so thin I feared I would bleed from any pressure or rubbing. I began to fear my husband would grow tired of my complaints and end our marriage. I can only liken it to second degree burns that was only relieved by laying down with a small ice pack in order to sleep. My doctor only did a urinalysis which showed absence of infection and treated me as if I were neurotic. Thank goodness for the internet and my ability to research what was happening to me. Recalling my poor,now deceased mother&#x27;s aging illnesses, I asked my doctor about HRT. She shook her head and said \\&quot;absolutely not!\\&quot; Finally, I was referred to a gynecologist who gave me a sample tube of Premarin cream. Research told me it was compounded from pregnant horse urine but so desperate was I for any amount of relief I would have tried anything! The sample helped in a couple of days so she wrote a RX for the cream and when the pharmacist quoted me a price of $205.00 and told me my insurance would not pay any of it, I discovered bio identicals! I ordered several brands of estriol and progesterone creams that gave me some relief but not enough. Then I discovered Life-flo BiEstro Care. The 20 percent Estradiol it contains( which I thought was only available by prescription) seemed to be the solution.I am now ready to order my third bottle and finally am beginning to feel like my former self. It took over 6 weeks to begin to feel results but glad I didn&#x27;t give up. I can only say it&#x27;s working for me and it&#x27;s safer because it is natural.adiol it contains( which I thought was only available by prescription) seemed to be the solution.I am now ready to order my third bottle and finally am beginning to feel like my former self.

            <li> Low-dose oral HRT has improved most of my low-estrogen symptoms, but unfortunately not my dry skin, vaginal atrophy, or night sweats. Adding this cream to my HRT has helped with these ongoing problem areas. Each press dispenses a lot of cream (I wish it were more concentrated so less could be used), so for me this is useful as a night cream on my face/chest/hands (sometimes alternating with arms/feet to rotate application sites) at bedtime. It has added appreciable moisture &amp; suppleness to my dry skin, visibly reduced my deep expression lines, &amp; lets me sleep through the night without those disruptive night sweats that I so despise (I&#x27;ve never had any daytime hot flashes, so far). It helps manage vaginal dryness using a small amount applied externally in the vaginal area. On random nights when I&#x27;ve been too lazy/tired/forgot to go through the application process, the night sweats return....so I won&#x27;t be lazy about it anymore. I love that it works well as a face &amp; neck cream since I find the sticky texture unpleasant on the body under clothing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 3 months now after finding out how outrageously expensive the Divigel prescription my OB/GYN gave me was. I have never had a hot flash, but I thought I was losing my mind, and my husband was seriously considering taking up residence under the couch! After just a few days on the Divigel samples, I stopped crying and yelling. After a couple of weeks, I could remember where I left things and how to get where I was going. After one month, having felt quite lethargic for the previous several months, I suddenly had loads of energy and started pulling out bushes and digging flower beds in the front yard! Since I couldn&#x27;t afford the Divigel, I ordered this and prayed that it would work at least somewhat as well, and I am happy to report that it works every bit as well. Unfortunately, it also causes the same side effects, which are a back ache for a couple of days and weird difficulty urinating for about 4 days each month. Despite the side effects, losing my candidacy for a straight jacket and a rubber room have made this product well worth every penny! Please note that I do not use the Progesterone cream because I have a Mirena IUD that secretes progestin. It is my understanding that you need both hormones, so if you don&#x27;t have a hormone secreting IUD, you will probably need the Progesta-care as well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t take the pill version of estrogen because it nauseates me.  The patch has latex in the adhesive, giving me huge welts.  The vaginal estrogen cream interferes with our sex life.  I can&#x27;t eat soy because it interferes with thyroid medication (ask your pharmacist).  So, I tried this instead. This, along with Remifemin day and night formulations, is the only thing that&#x27;s worked to get rid of the thrice-hourly sweating hot flashes.  I like that the pump is measured.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Item came I time stated. This is my second time purchasing and it has been working wonders for me.</li>
            <li> Great product.thanks.  just had to say it. I have not tried it though, but my wife has. I take her word for it.</li>
            <li> I love this! I had full hysterectomy and was on the patch at first. I hated my symptoms.  Did some research and found this. My symptoms are much less and I&#x27;m less moody using this.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product will definitely use again just wish I had known about it sooner relief at last it works brilliant</li>
            <li> I am so surprised that there are not more comments about the feel of this cream....I was using Estro500 but due to the almost unaffordable price of the product, I decided to try the Biestro-care.  I really wanted to like this cream because it is so inexpensive compared to other similar products and contains estradiol, but I just can&#x27;t get past the stickiness of this cream.  Another review compared it to sunscreen, but I think it is way worse.  My clothes stick to it, my skin sticks to it - it never really seems to absorb completely.  There is a slight order as well, which I could get past if it weren&#x27;t for the thick consistency of this cream.  I was taking the Phyto-B until they pulled it off the market, and unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t found anything else that compares.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered years from symptoms of low hormone levels, but only recently gotten tested. The labs revealed postmenopausal levels of estradiol and progesterone, which is sad considering I&#x27;m still in my forties. I&#x27;ve started taking 1/2 pump of this cream in the morning and night, and take some progesterone cream at night. Almost immediately, I started getting hyperthyroid symptoms and have had to drastically wean off of my thyroid medication. My energy levels are through the roof. I sure hope this keeps up! I will post an update if anything changes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product. I get night sweats and hot flashes without usage.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and was so happy to get it at a better price... Thank you so much</li>
            <li> This stuff has reduced my night sweats by about 75%.  Not perfect, but I&#x27;ll take it!  Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I had been on prescription HRT for several years, tried tapering down and my hot flashes ect. would come back. I started using Progesta-care complete and Biestro-Care, I have stopped taking the oral HRT and no hot flashes. It&#x27;s also helped with other menopausal symptoms such as dryness. I love this product!</li>
            <li> meh.. smell is kind of strange and it just never dries. I can&#x27;t really say if it is working because I barely used it</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. My mood is much improved. I use one pump a day. I also use progesterone, not a good idea to add just estrogen. Do your research before you start using hormones.</li>
            <li> ON my last doctor&#x27;s visit, I was told I had an estrogen deficiency.  Being post menopausal, this is a concern from an aging point of view.  Hoping this product will bring back some of the spark without causing any of the side effects of synthetic HRT.  I use less of this than recommended as at this stage, I do not have any of the horrible symptoms that come with menopause.  It is very easy to use and feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> This product apparently works for some women but didn&#x27;t work for me.  Give it a try, it may work for you.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, this product is wonderful. I was on HRT for 20 years tried everything under the sun to get off it since it can be harmful long term but nothing worked. I had a full hysterectomy and the doctor immediately popped a pill in my mouth for hot flashes. At that time I was not educated about these things. Over the years I educated myself with more natural  and organic products. I found Life-Flo Biestro-care and decided to try it. within days I had to stop HRT because I had symptoms of too much Estradiol so I decided to stop taking the pill and see what happens. It has been months now and I have not renewed my prescription and never will again. This product is wonderful and I feel great I also use Life Flo Progesta Care Complete along with it. My new doctor knew about Life Flo products and was glad I stopped HRT Therapy. The price is very good on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday. Cheaper than compounded</li>
            <li> Switching to a pill supplement.  There is too much cream mix with the product.  The cream/lotion is really industrial feeling and not what I would normally want on my body.  The packaging is also bulky and rather clumsy to handle.</li>
            <li> This product really caused some massive pain in my breasts!</li>
            <li> I am a woman who has had a total hysterectomy. I had the surgery in 1996 and was not on any estrogen afterwards, because basically, I was afraid of the  hormone therapy that is usually offered in a doctor&#x27;s office. So for 16 years, I suffered through my hot flashes and other symptoms. Last year, my hot flashes got worse-- it really became a quality of life issue for me. I did research and found that estrogen replacement that resembled more like what the body would produce could be beneficial. I chose this product because of the cost and the reviews of others. I have been using it, about 6 months. It took about 2 months, twice a day usage to build up in my body. I am happy to say that this product keeps me hot flash free, at least 85-90% of the time. My internal shaking (that I have seen no information about as menopause symptom) has stopped. I also believe this product is helping somewhat with my mental fog. If you take this product or any estrogen, you should also take progesterone, even you don&#x27;t have uterus.</li>
            <li> This is well formulated and the pre-measured dose that the pump dispenses is handy and tidy.  Also, there is no worry about contaminating the unused portion of the product or exposing it to the air.  If you like a cream based estrogen formula this is a very nice one.  Would love a little &amp;#34;window&amp;#34; in the container so you can see when it&#x27;s getting low.</li>
            <li> Had zero problems with the pump.  Works well, can actually feel a difference.  I think it works as well as some of the prescription stuff.</li>
            <li> Love it, works wonderful for my hormone changes I am currently having. Helps my mood &amp; hot flashes greatly, Thanks.</li>
            <li> i like this creme and it has really helped me over the winter; we&#x27;ll see if it works as well in summer as hot air tends to bring warm flushes(awful!). it contains estrodial and estriol. the only thing i don&#x27;t care for is that cremes take longer to absorb or you have to apply over a large area. i wish this came in gel form.</li>
            <li> I was a Phyto-B rescue victim who depended on that product for over 10 years to stave off hot flashes and night sweats. When they discontinued the pellets I was mortified and when I saw their replacement product and calculated  how many drops of the oil I would have to use and then figured out how many days a bottle would last, I passed. Ridiculous. Thank you Amazon for offering this wonderful alternative but it isn&#x27;t perfect:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I used 4 Phyto-Bs a day. When I used one pump of this, after a few days I was drowning in my own sweat at night. So, I then tried 2 pumps and success! No more night sweats and it has been over 4 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I also use the Progesta-care (1 pump a day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The cream is thick and takes a little while to soak in. I use it on the inner arms, tummy and upper inner thighs. Feels icky and I don&#x27;t like it. But hey, it beats the alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) On my second order of Biestro I found that I couldn&#x27;t pump anything from the bottle. Banging it on the side of the sink in various places about 100 times a night usually gets me enough to equal 2 pumps, but I can&#x27;t wait til this thing is done and I can try another bottle. It is not a good way to get ready for bed (blood pressure rises with every bang). Are you listening Life-flo?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) The cream has a bit of a smell that I don&#x27;t like so I only use it at night. Plus, I wouldn&#x27;t trust it under my clothing--could stain.</li>
            <li> The product is so sticky, I hate using it.  It may be great, but I&#x27;ll have to find something else.</li>
            <li> BiEstro is a very great product. My wife feels much better when she uses it.  Her hair has gotten much thicker and better looking now that she uses Biestro.  We thank you very much for having Biestro available for us to purchase!</li>
            <li> I have been using this since it arrived and I do see many changes in my body.  I&#x27;m experiencing many less hot flashes, I&#x27;ve lost some weight and I feel a general improvement in my moods and energy.  I&#x27;m going to continue to use and I&#x27;m exploring adding other Life-Flo products to my &amp;#34;bag of tricks&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Started using this kind of hormonal creams and feel much better. I wish it will last me longer.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well to heal postpartum tears. I used a very small amount, every other day, and the difference was amazing!</li>
            <li> This very mild dosage of estriol and estradiol (2 of the 3 main hormones women&#x27;s bodies produce - estrone is the 3rd) is just enough to provide me with the good benefits of estradiol without the high risk of prescription strenght. Just enough to do help my body do what it needs hormones to do, AND reduce menopause symptoms!! AND I CAN THINK CLEARLY!!! I&#x27;ve read TONS about this, to be safe. Studies show that when the lower-potency estrogen, estriol, is administered topically, it does not increase the risk of hormone-dependent cancers of the breast or endometrium (uterine lining). Be sure to use Progesterone Cream at the same time! Important for cancer prevention.</li>
            <li> This works really well for me - I am 51 and still cycling, but with some low estrogen symptoms (not many). I use one pump on the skin of my legs the first two weeks of my cycle.  It keeps those symptoms at bay. (I also use progesterone cream by the same manufacturer, and I use it the last 3 weeks of my cycle).</li>
            <li> like most of Life Flo&#x27;s estriol/progesterone and related products, the odour on this is pretty horrible, but I will keep using for as long as it 1/ works and 2/ is affordable.  The company should really do something about the odor  though. fix the problem!</li>
            <li> This cream really helped to decrease and almost eliminate my severe hotflashes. I used it along with Mendapause Progesterone Cream with Phytoestrogens.</li>
            <li> I started using this product, as my medications for migraine stopped working and nothing would prevent them.  I discussed this wit my doctor, which I would encourage all women to do before using this type of product, as it IS ESTROGEN!  I have had good results with it, but be careful - too much is also a bad thing!  Can cause even worse headaches!  Love the measured pump, so you know about how much dosage you are getting.  Of course, I am not using it for replacement therapy, so I don&#x27;t use a full pump at once.  I am not peri-menopausal or menopausal or post-menopausal.  I just use it for headache prevention during &amp;#34;placebo week.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> need this for night sweats - I keep buying in since I don&#x27;t know what else to use but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped it would</li>
            <li> This product has my hot flashes and mood swings under control and is so easy to use...so glad I found it!</li>
            <li> I do see a big improvement with hot flashes. I gave it four stars, because the smell is a little off. Not obnoxious, just a little plastic-like. I don&#x27;t notice it being sticky, as others have stated in their reviews. It does take a lot of rubbing to absorb.</li>
            <li> Never realized this was available online, so I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the ingredients were probably identical.  I&#x27;ve been using for several weeks now and feel absolutely great, no difference that I can note, so this will be my new cream.  Yea!!!</li>
            <li> OMG, I will be honest with you.  I can not live comfortably without this.  I have a vaginal problem that came with  menopause that is common in women who haven&#x27;t had children and let me tell you... it&#x27;s impossible to live with.  This stuff shuts all that down.  I mean was a relief!!!  If you have a need for estradiol, I highly recommend this dose.  It&#x27;s effective but it&#x27;s not super strong.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I have reordered, so it must be good.</li>
            <li> I have use this product for over two years but this is the first time that both bottles the pump failed to work.</li>
            <li> I have definitely noticed a difference in how I feel right away with this product (using it for menopausal symptoms.) A subtle return to &amp;#34;feeling like myself again.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s hit and miss with products for menopausal and this one is a definite hit with me.</li>
            <li> After taking myself off harmful synthetic hormones (after reading Suzanne Somers book Ageless) I knew I needed Estrogen but was not happy with just the Estriol cream as it didn&#x27;t seem to help very much with my hot flashes.  I am surgically post-menopause fyi.  I found the Biestro Cream that contained both Estriol and the more powerful Estradiol as well.  This seemed to work perfectly for me and it does not contain the harmful Estrone that has health risks.  Benefits include:&lt;br /&gt; ■Improves energy levels&lt;br /&gt; ■Improves mood&lt;br /&gt; ■Eliminates night sweats and hot flashes&lt;br /&gt; ■Improves memory and concentration&lt;br /&gt; ■Improves sex drive&lt;br /&gt; ■Prevents vaginal thinning &amp; dryness&lt;br /&gt; ■Improves fat loss and muscle tone&lt;br /&gt; ■Decreases skin winkles&lt;br /&gt; ■Protects bones from osteoporosis&lt;br /&gt; ■Reduces risks of heart disease&lt;br /&gt;I find this cream is beneficial for all these reasons and I will order it again.</li>
            <li> Works exactly for what I need it for!</li>
            <li> Upon using this product I started to feel relief almost immediately.  I am a sensitive person age of 61.  I have been suffering for over a year with horrible effects of vaginal dryness , brain fog, hot flashes all those menopausal symptoms.  With this cream I was able to get off premarin and I feel so thankful for this product, I believe for me that the estradiol is what actually gave me this satisfaction, most creams do not have this, plus I love that it is paraben free.  I use this with progesterone also.  I couldn&#x27;t afford to be tested but I know that is works every single day.&lt;br /&gt;Hope it will always be available!!!  Thank you for this GREAT PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> This company always sends the product right out, no worries.  I highly recommend.  Great product as well. really cannot be with out it!</li>
            <li> OMG, I am so happy that I decided to try this one as well as the Progestra Care.  With this version my hot flashes have almost stopped happening altogether.  I&#x27;m really shocked at this.  I tried the Progestra Care and while my hot flashes had really decreased I still had them once or twice a day and they were mild when I did.  However, this version they have just about diminished altogether.  I&#x27;m telling my friends about it.  My skin feels so much better and I&#x27;ve been sleeping thru the night.  I would have never thought that something over the counter would help so much and a great price.  I had a hsyterectomy some years ago but I was left with one ovary and I just wasn&#x27;t sure if I should be using this alone or with the progestra.  My doctor had just prescribed Premarin and not Prempro.  I just didn&#x27;t like what it was made of (the Prempro), it kind of freaked me out.  I am going to do a bit more research just to be sure I&#x27;m okay just using the Biestro but I will not be without it from this point on.  I hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m post menopause and found out that over a year ago my Estradiol level was just about nothing. Starting having different issues from feeling tired, depressed, hot flashes and worst of all painful sex. Also had this sinus thing were my sinuses would continually swell up making it hard to breath. I&#x27;ve been using this along with natural progesterone cream for the past four months.My dosage was every morning , one pump and I&#x27;d use the progesterone at night. I started to feel really pumped up and decided to back off using the creams every other day but started having heart palpitations, trouble sleeping and anxiety. So I decided it might be wise to check my levels.  Got my results today and my levels are in a normal balance for the most part but I just need to increase my progesterone to every night to balance the Estrogen/Progesterone level. So I had become estrogen dominant. This cream works! In over four months I went from almost nothing regarding my Estradiol to within a normal with supplementation range. Note: Just as others had posted, if you still have your uterus it is wise to also use a natural progesterone cream with it.  *Update 04/07/2015 After repetitively having heart palpitations/racing after many attempts to lower or spread out the dosage I just cannot use this. I also felt it contributed to having anxieties at night. Bad because my energy level is so low since I&#x27;m not taking it. I am going to again use the Estriol cream.</li>
            <li> I cannot really say that this is a bad product because for some women it may work great for.  I had a total hysterectomy with everything removed and have been using BHRT ever since.  I decided to try this after reading the recommendations on here.  It just did not do the job for me.  But that is not to say that it would not work great for someone who is going through natural menopause.  Just be aware as others have said it does leave your skin feeling sticky and kind of clammy.</li>
            <li> Keeps my wife&#x27;s post menopausal health in much better condition.</li>
            <li> I began using this cream about 10 days ago, and so far, it has been a real blessing to me.  I had been using various herbal supplements for the past 8 or 10 years for pre-menopausal symptoms, and after a year or so of using something, my body would get used to it, and I would have to either up my dosage, or switch to some other product.  My last cycle was about a year ago, and I noticed (as did my husband and children), that I began having much more intense symptoms a couple of months ago.  The hot flashes became very intense, and sometimes I would have a hot flash followed by another one  only 10 or 15 minutes later.  Not only that, but I would have emotional responses in the first couple of minutes of a hot flash -- I am not an angry person, but I felt like throwing a brick through a window or something.  I had no energy or motivation to do all the things I love best.  The skin on the inside of my elbows was wrinkly and saggy . . .  my neck was more and more wrinkled and dry.  I was dry all over!  I also felt like Eyeore  in Winnie the Pooh -- nobody loved me and nobody cared about me anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just a couple of days of the cream, I began to get my energy back.  My skin is improving on my neck, and I know my family loves me (they always did, I just couldn&#x27;t believe it).  I haven&#x27;t felt like throwing a brick all week.  I can hold a conversation with a teenager or young adult child who doesn&#x27;t totally agree with me, and I don&#x27;t lay awake for hours in the night fearful that they will turn out to be drug addicts or something.  I can smile when they walk into the kitchen for breakfast and not wonder if they have been talking about me behind my back in the next room.  If you are nodding your head to all this, try this cream.  I think you&#x27;ll like it, and if you don&#x27;t, it won&#x27;t have cost you a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOUR WEEKS NOW:  After four weeks of using this cream, things are still slowly improving.  I still have more energy, and don&#x27;t need three short naps a day to make it past 8 in the evening.  (Still need one though!  I am 57 after all, not 27.)  I am much more cheerful, and I feel like tackling the fall housecleaning that I couldn&#x27;t even make myself think about in September.  One pump twice a day helped me, but I still had hot flashes (milder and less frequent, but still there).  I began slowly upping the dosage, waiting 4 or 5 days between, until I got to where the hot flashes finally are gone.  Also, don&#x27;t get discouraged if you have bloating, gas, etc. those first weeks while you figure out what your dosage needs to be.  It will all straighten out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One More Update:  I have been using this stuff for a year and a half now . . . Still love it.  HOWEVER, I ended up being wrong about not needing any progesterone cream to balance things out.  I did great for 8 months, then began a cycle of heavy bleeding that lasted for WEEKS.  A tiny amount (1/8 tsp. twice daily) of natural progesterone ended the bleeding and I have not had a problem since.  I guess that I was so deficient in estrogen that it took 8 months for my body to catch up on the estrogen before needing the progesterone. I am having VERY light cycles again, but that&#x27;s okay with me to feel so good.that I need a lot more of the cream that I thought I would at first.  Please don&#x27;t go by what I need -- everyone is different.  One pump twice a day helped me, but I still had hot flashes (milder and less frequent, but still there).  I began slowly upping the dosage, waiting 4 or 5 days between, until I got to where the hot flashes finally are gone.  Once in a while, I will have a mild &amp;#34;heat surge&amp;#34;, but not often -- maybe once a day, if that.  But it took 3 pumps morning and evening to get there for me.  Maybe that&#x27;s due to a REALLY low estrogen level before I began the cream.  After all, I know a lot of women my age, and I only know of one woman that had hot flashes worse than mine in the last 10 years.  Also, don&#x27;t get discouraged if you have bloating, gas, etc. those first weeks while you figure out what your dosage needs to be.  Things do get better, especially if you can cut way back on carbs.  Don&#x27;t cut them out, just cut back, and eat plenty of protein and good fats.  At least that&#x27;s what worked for me.  (If you are old enough to need this cream, perhaps you remember the old commercial that said, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not a doctor, but I play one on TV.&amp;#34;  Well, I don&#x27;t even play one on TV! So this is NOT medical advice.)  My thinking is still clearer, and yes, I do think my muscles are responding better to exercise.  Let&#x27;s face it, we&#x27;ll never look or feel 25 again, but I am telling you that there is truly some improvement.  Just the more cheerful outlook on life is worth every penny and every extra pound that I now will have to fight off.  (Not like I didn&#x27;t have some to lose before, anyway.)  One More Update:  I have been using this stuff for well over a year now . . . I think about 18 months. Still love it.  HOWEVER, I ended up being wrong about not needing any progesterone cream to balance things out.  I did great for 8 months, then began a cycle of heavy bleeding that lasted for WEEKS.  A tiny amount (1/8 tsp. twice daily) of natural progesterone ended the bleeding and I have not had a problem since.  I guess that I was so deficient in estrogen that it took 8 months for my body to catch up on the estrogen before needing the progesterone. No problems at all for the past 8 months now. So yes, you might need some progesterone cream along with the estrogen, sooner or later.</li>
            <li> I put this after showering in the morning or at night. Either way, 10 hours or even 24 hours later I can still feel it on my skin, and it isn&#x27;t pleasant. It seems to just sit on top of the skin, not absorb. I used to use Estradiol in a gel (Oestraclin was the brand name) that I bought OTC in Europe. It absorbed like you would expect it to. This Biestro product is the closest thing I could find OTC in the US. It might be having the desired hormonal effect, I am not sure yet, maybe the inactive ingredients are the ones that sit on top of the skin (doesn&#x27;t seem likely though). I will try to find something else that absorbs better.</li>
            <li> Saved my Marriage, and my SANITY after total hysterectomy due to cancer!</li>
            <li> No complaints, like others about the stickiness. I find it to be a great product. I am only using half a pump every other night as I alternate between this one and the progestacare.</li>
            <li> So far I like it, I decided to use it every other day, I am 68 yr. old and I think it has helped just a  tiny bit with energy and sleep.Too soon to know  for sure? Good smelling,not sticky. I would be cautious about using too much, could cause swelling or water retention? It will take awhile to know for sure.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Love the pump which makes it easier to use.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff ever!  It seems like you have your natural hormones back.  Just rub it on and you will start feeling better within just a few days.  Make sure to use it with progesterone cream too.  Its also awesome.  Just follow directions on both and adjust it to when you feel it is right for you.</li>
            <li> I am very happy to see that bioidentical hormones such as this are now available over the counter. These bioidentical hormones are so much safer for the body than synthetic hormones that are often given to women for menopausal symptoms. HOWEVER, in order to sell these over the counter, there is a difference in the dosage. These contain far less of the estrogens (estradiol and estriol) than one would usually get if a doctor prescribed them.  I used to have mine prescribed and made up by a compounding pharmacy, but since insurance doesn&#x27;t cover it anyway, decided to try this, along with the Life Flo Progesta-Care. In order to equal my prescriptive dosage, I have to use six pumps of the Bi-Estro care and it keeps my menopausal symptoms at bay. (which were HORRENDOUS). So, if you feel this does not work for you, it would most likely be a dosage problem. (too little  But always keep in mind, this MUST be taken in conjunction with progesterone.  I use the Life Flo Progesta-Care. I also have to use four pumps of progesta care to equal my former Rx. The more Bi-estro care one uses, the more progesta-care has to be used since there has to be a healthy balance of estrogens to progesterone.&lt;br /&gt;If you have perimenopausal or  menopausal symptoms, I would definitely recommend this to you. If you don&#x27;t know anything about bioientical hormones, yo can get tons of info on the web.</li>
            <li> I have had hot flashes for about 4 tears now. I was under the care of Naturopath who ordered Rx creams. They worked wonderfully, but this cream is half the price. I do recommend a saliva or urine test to determine which hormone you are lacking so you take the ones you need. Life Flo products work just as well as the Rx.</li>
            <li> Really works but is sticky and doesn&#x27;t absorb as quickly as RX.</li>
            <li> Finally the cure for my insomnia, inadvertently discovered after the doctors couldn&#x27;t help. Granted they didn&#x27;t try very hard, half-heartedly dispensing the kind of advice that you can find on any generic website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this along with the progesterone version and simply, it works.</li>
            <li> I really have enjoyed using this product.  One of the  BEST!! It is one of the most affordable I have found.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> the company will not offer a refund and the product is unusable, alcohol is an irritant on the highly sensitive area this is meant for and it never sated it had alcohol in it until you receive the product and read it on the back of the bottle</li>
            <li> MENOPAUSE, AND NON MENOPAUSE IF YOU ARE HEADING THERE, DO NOT DO IT WITHOUT THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream, I had to find a more affordable alternative for my HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy), and this works very well. I was spending $50 each month for a compounded version from a compounding pharmacy that my doctor prescribed, so I was a little hesitant to switch to this brand but I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised, I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle now, and no hot flashes, the price is right too!</li>
            <li> I am glad it is available OTC finally</li>
            <li> After one month of use, I had a light period for 3 days..plus sore nipples, fuller breasts, no more vaginal dryness, plump vaginal outer labia (vaginal atrophy reduces them), increased eyebrow and vaginal hair - which has come back to the original color of brown!  However, I put the creme on the inner labia of the vagina - which is the most direct route, recommended by Dr. Jonathan Wright, the &amp;#34;father&amp;#34; of bio-identical hormones according to Suzanne Somers.  The problem with applying it to fatty areas of the body like the inner thighs is that it doesn&#x27;t get to where it needs to go nearly as well.  What&#x27;s closer than the vagina?  BTW, once my estrogen receptors absorbed the estrogens, the period stopped by the 2nd month, but everything else has continued.  I also use it on my face as a wonderful moisturizer and collagen builder.</li>
            <li> this product is great, i like it better than just the estriol.  it keeps the hot flashes down better and lessens anxiety better than the esirol alone.  talk to you doctor though.  and never use without progresterone. my doctor wanted me to try just using estirol instead of the dormulation with both estirol and estrodial but it wasn&#x27;t as effective for me, it may be all you need. i love the price of this product and the potency and would defibately recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Product is wonderful...if you can get it out of the pump!  If you purchase you will have the same issue.  This is what I did ( I really thought I would find they had shipped an empty bottle):  poked a hole in bottle with a kitchen fork.  I was able to cut the bottle with kitchen shears and found it full of product.  I have purchased 3 bottles...2 had pump issues.  It is not a top you can unscrew or pop off.  Very frustrating.  You will find this issue in other reviews.</li>
            <li> I will say that I didn&#x27;t expect this to work but it did! I showed my Dr. this and he approved!</li>
            <li> This product is great, I feel so much better! This is a natural way to get your hormones, it&#x27;s plant based bio-identical and has made all the difference for me.</li>
            <li> it has the right ingredients but it is too greasy</li>
            <li> I have bought this before and I think the product works just o.k. (no miracles here ladies!!)It&#x27;s better than nothing, but on 2 of the bottles I got I took the plastic off the bottom of container and it had a false bottom in it. I had not even used any yet and there was at least a little over an inch of space between the bottom and where the product began. You think you are getting this really large bottle of product, but you are not! I realize most all companies do this in one way or another, but it really makes me angry and I think it insults our intelligence...I mean come on....just give us what we pay for without the gimmicks! Consumers aren&#x27;t stupid...if you are in desperate need of estrogen I don&#x27;t think this will help you, but for us older women who just need a slight boost now and then I think it&#x27;s just o.k.</li>
            <li> This is pure and natural--a good way to supplement estrogen in menopause without all the risk of oral supplements. It is one of the brands recommended by respected sources, such as Dr. Lee and Christine Northrup, experts on menopause the natural way.</li>
            <li> I was using another brand estradiol but I think my body got too use to it and became immune. I noticed my energy increased shortly after taking this.</li>
            <li> This product is great,  took about 8 days to kick in.  Stick with it and the Hot Flashes will just be a heat surge now and then.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite effective to reduce the hotflashes.</li>
            <li> I added this onto my progesterone cream and I find that I am getting better results.  Less hot flashes and better sleep.</li>
            <li> I am not sure this really works.  I have purchased several bottles, one pump was broken.  It was too late to return it as I used the other two bottles first.</li>
            <li> I ordered this while waiting for my regular topical estradiol to come in the mail. It seems to work fine hormonally but the base it is in is awful, very thick and damp-feeling. Your clothes and sheets stick a bit to the areas it&#x27;s applied and you kinda sweat behind it, a very odd and uncomfortable feeling. I even wondered if it were meant for the vaginal area but it&#x27;s not. It makes me feel cold and clammy and I can&#x27;t wait to get it off. I&#x27;m on my second week of it. Hurry, post office!!</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT THE REAL THING.  I have been taking compounded estriol for years.  I thought I would see if a OTC Bi-est would work for me.  I switched over on Dec. 5.  Today,  Dec. 13 (8 days later), I am in complete and utter misery.  This is not the real estriol.  Constant hot flashes,  dry eyes, dry skin, dry fingernails,  redness that won&#x27;t go away.  Going back to my compounded bi-est  (prescription).  I do have one nice thing to say for this, tho.  This makes a very nice face cream.... but, do not depend on it for relief of menopausal symtoms.</li>
            <li> This cream goes on sticky on my skin, regardless of the placement (chest, abdomen, thighs).  I&#x27;ve been using another brand for several months so I can&#x27;t comment on its effectiveness.  However, the stickiness of it is uncomfortable enough for me in the summertime that I will have to wash it off during the day and may go back to my previous brand and save this for colder weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liken it to wearing sunscreen on my body...I hate wearing it when I do yard work and wash it off the instant I come inside...this feeling is similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a heads up to anyone else who may live in a humid climate.</li>
            <li> I first used this product as my doctor moved me down from my customized estrogen prescription. My doctor  gave me a prescription when I  had very intense menopause symptoms. She was clear that she would reduce the estrogen dosage over time and as soon as I adjusted to a smaller dose. I was delighted to find this product! It really works, and I am comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. I would also suggest working with your doctor who understands estrogen and how to prescribe for custom prescriptions. This can be a useful part of the whole treatment!</li>
            <li> I think this is working for me.....took care of the night sweats and insomnia.  Dr was impress with it when I took in the label at my last appointment....he took a picture of it and stated he would recommend it to others.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to relieve the vaginal dryness so need to use an additional product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all and made me feel kindy crappy. I have tried other bio-identical estrogens and they typically make me feel really good. I e-mailed the company to ask them what the source of their hormones were and were they bio-identical. Their response to my e-mail was to call their customer number. I have no idea why they couldn&#x27;t just answer my question instead of sending me to a call center? I threw out both bottles...total waste of money.</li>
            <li> It contains a good mix of real human estrogens, but it is sticky and weak.  However, I realize that low strength is required to be available over-the-counter, with no need for prescription.   I appreciate very much that this product is so clean, free from harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> It does work pretty well. The only problem, its stickiness, can be tolerated during the winter.</li>
            <li> Have used for 4 months, does nothing for my hotflashes and night sweats at all. I have perimenopause so cant imagine what it will be like for menopause</li>
            <li> This is a product I have come to love/use, and find effective. I like topical hormones, as safer and subject to fewer side effects. Coupled with a progesterone cream, one with use can expect growth in a feminizing-body direction.</li>
            <li> I have used birth control pills for years and then patches to help with my chronic headaches and then menopause symptoms. The pills made it hard for me to control my weight. I then went on patches which again made me gain. I went off and began to have more headaches and mood swings. After several months of natural estrogen cream I found it works almost as well as the patches and birth control pills and I have been able to lose weight plus the cost is less than the patches. This 4 oz bottle last me about six weeks when I use one pump twice a day. I am happy with product. It takes a couple of months to build up to help symptoms the most. I am happy and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Life-Flo Biestro-care, 4-Ounce&lt;br /&gt;Nutraceutical Corporation  i cant really give a rating as it wasn&#x27;t for me, i have received no feed back</li>
            <li> This product has really helped me with hot flashes.  Have had my Dr. take a look and he gave it an ok if it works</li>
            <li> Not all hot flashes are caused by low estrogen.  I tried this and my hot flashes got a lot worse.  If a woman needs more estrogen, then this product will probably work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying this, I had my hormones tested.  It turned out that my estrogen and progesterone were both normal, with my progesterone being comfortably high in proportion to estrogen.  The problem turned out to be high cortisol.  Apparently high cortisol can cause hot flashes, too.  I started taking L-theanine throughout the day to lower my cortisol and that stopped the hot flashes.  BTW, I went to that website called yourhormones.com and took the test (questionaire).  It said I was low in testosterone and estrogen --  I had a blood test soon after and this was completely wrong.  If you really want to be sure about your hormones, you should get tested.  You can go to lifeextension.com  and get their hormone panel or you can order a saliva hormone test here on amazon.  I ordered the life extension test online and had the blood drawn for the test at a local office.</li>
            <li> All problems disappeared after only 1 week and with half of the dose. Feeling great now, so it´s very efficient. Cycles back to normal. Very happy! I like the consistence since my skin is dry. I use the progesterone also 10 days every month, also natural but FDA approved. Not orally since it has so many more side effects.&lt;br /&gt;This cream even cured my dry eyes.</li>
            <li> I wished this was the solution for me but it didn&#x27;t have any noticeable effect on me. :( I rubbed the cream on my skin, rotating areas every time, but it always left a greasy layer on my skin. I don&#x27;t think it gets absorbed easily (unlike a progesterone cream I tried from another brand).</li>
            <li> Urine results showed it did not increase the estrogen balance in the body. No increase was noted on the lab tests.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get my usual estrogen product so thought I&#x27;d try this. Ingredients looked safe and all, and reviews were good. So I ordered 2 and finished my current supply before starting. I put it on at night, and within a week, found I&#x27;d wake up at night itchy and sore wherever I&#x27;d applied it. So I&#x27;d get up and wash off the cream in order to get back to sleep. (I hate to wake up at night like this, don&#x27;t you?) I&#x27;d only used a fraction of my first bottle, and found I couldn&#x27;t return either to Amazon, so I&#x27;m stuck with 2 bottles of something I can&#x27;t use. So, maybe it&#x27;s just me, but try a bottle first and limit the damages:)</li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of time. Didn&#x27;t help any of my symptoms  Tried for 2 months really had high hopes! Bummer!</li>
            <li> This cream is okay, it has a kind of rank smell and it is greasy, therefore, not suitable for daytime use on the face.  I use it on my face at night as a moisturizer, however, can&#x27;t say I have seen any improvement over a month in wrinkles.  This cream does help with hot flashes and is good when used in conjunction with HRT.</li>
            <li> I got mine in yesterday. I was in a tailspin. Felt like I was losing my mind...so tired, confused crying...I bought this and the progesterone cream. Within hours I was out of bed and feeling so much better. It works!!! Make sure u use both progesterone and the estrogen cream together. The progesterone helps to calm u and the estrogen gives u energy. I was on bio identical hormone therapy for a month and then my doc pulled me off of it until I got a mammogram done. I did and they found some dense tissue in my right breast. No cancer..nothing else. He refused to give me anymore until  I had another one done in six months. My body went crazy and I was worried that this stuff wouldn&#x27;t work....well it did.</li>
            <li> Progesta-Care Plus and BiEstro-Care have saved me!  I was ready to kill myself and others - dealing with severe hot flashes, night sweats, insomnia, fatigue, and depression for well over 3 years.  I tried many other natural products over the years and nothing else helped me.  I love these two creams and recommend them to any and all.  I do recommend consulting with a medical professional prior to beginning the use of these products.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this product. It has made an incredible difference for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even understand how this is otc but it&#x27;s the real deal. Five months ago at age 32 I had to have surgery and got put into surgical menopause. Life as I knew it was over. I can not handle not having estrogen, became very depressed, and mentally so foggy I couldn&#x27;t even respond verbally at its worse. So Dr. Put me on estrace. I had horrible headaches on the pill so I got switched to vivelle dot. That gave me horrible back and leg pains, so much I couldn&#x27;t walk or sleep. I then tried femring but the pain it caused was excruciating in my abdominal area. I then tried climara and got so dizzy I couldn&#x27;t walk. After that I tried divigel and again the back pain and dizziness came back. My bp went from a normal 120/60 to 190/105. I felt like I was dying. I could barley see out of my left eye since surgery and I was so moody all I could do was isolate myself. I was getting sicker and sicker, so Dr said I had to go off all estrogen. I made it three days before I broke down and bought a bunch of OTC stuff off amazon. This was one of the items. I have been using this for two weeks. I use two pumps in morning, another pump three hours later and another three hours after that. If I take it too late in day I can&#x27;t sleep. I apply to inner thigh. Yes its sticky but who cares; it works. I promise it works. I don&#x27;t get how it has real estradiol in it but it does. my skin looks great, dryness everywhere is gone. I sleep normal. I have normal energy again. Not a single hot flash since first day. I really have zero menopausal symptoms. Before I had zero sex drive, its close to normal now. I&#x27;m still a little weepy but I will take it. I&#x27;m not a screaming lunatic anymore. I have spent close to 800 on Rx prescriptions... This is around $20. I could not be happier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for three years and yes, it helped with my hot flashes, however I have just been diagnosed with BREAST CANCER.......estrogen/progesterone dependent cancer. I had my hormone levels taken before I went on it and I was truly menopausal and out of the estrogen and progesterone that my body once produced. THIS IS A WARNING.....I Absolutely believe that using this product fanned the flames of my cancer. Talk to your doctor first!</li>
            <li> Life-Flo came through for me and I especially like the convenience of the pump measuring out the dose.  Good texture and didn&#x27;t take long to absorb, no bad smell. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews but felt it was my obligation to all the menopause women suffering from hot flashes.  First off I used ProgestraCare Complete for over a month and it did not do much for my hot flashes but helped with dryness a lot.  I knew from experience that I needed Estrogen but had awful side effects from the birth control pill my doc prescribed.  I was very edgy and irritable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to go ahead and give this product a shot.  This is the only bioidentical estrogen I have tried so I can&#x27;t comment on others.  Great news though, I have been using both ProgestraCare Complete and BiestroCare together for two weeks and my how flashes are almost gone.  I do still have 3 or 4 a day but they are barely noticeable.  I am not awakened at night by them woohooo!!!!!  I figure another week and they will be completely gone.  And no side effects, which is great!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only using 1 pump of each in the morning daily.  Ifigured I should mention that since I read some women used it twice a day.  Also I rotate where I apply it as recommended.  Thank you so much Life-Flo!</li>
            <li> I have never written a review for any of the multiple and numerous items I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon.  However, I feel compelled to write a review for anyone who might be on the fence about purchasing BiEstro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my first hot flash a year and a half ago at a convention for my job.  As always, these conventions are very stressful events and I ended up spending the entire day having one hot flash every twenty minutes for ten hours.  By the end of the day I was a drenched, frazzled and wilted mess.  By the following day the hot flashes were gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had approximately five menstrual cycles in the last year and a half.  Just when I think my cycles are behind me, I menstruate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During this time-frame, I would have occasional hot flashes during the week of my cycle.  Instead of menstruating, I would get hot flashes.  So, during the normal drop in estrogen,  I must have been down regulating more that normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to the present:  I have been miserable for the last two months.  I have been having hot flashes, mood swings,  acne, sleeplessness, cognitive issues and a myriad of other issues.  Two weeks before my purchase, I have had a hot flash almost every half hour for twenty-four hours a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hot flashes for me consist of nausea, intense heat  lasting two minutes and a drenching, wringing wet sweat for two minutes.  Every. Fifteen. Minutes.  Constantly.  In public, social settings, family events, shopping, the grocery store and everywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was walking around with makeup streaked down my face, wet hair, clothes stuck to me.  I looked like a drug addict or a crazy woman.  By the end of a shopping expedition, people would be looking at me oddly.  I must have been a sight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, last week I ordered a bottle of BiEstro because I read the reviews here.  I wasn&#x27;t going to buy because I thought there is no way it will actually work.  But, I was so very,  very desperate.  I took it on faith.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so absolutely grateful to the women who took the time to write about their experiences. That is why I am writing. To pay it forward.  Because it worked. It really does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After three days I am starting to feel like me again.  Yes, the results were mild the first day.  Yes, I did have to increase my dose.  Quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I have devised:  Twice daily application spaced twelve hours apart.  Began with two pumps in the morning and two before bed. It help but did not completely resolve my problems  I noticed a difference and some improvement,  but not resolution. Hot flashes were half as bad and by the 10th hour were severe again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By day three, I was up to four pumps morning and  four pumps evening.  Hot flashes are COMPLETELY GONE.  GONE. GONE. GONE.  By the 10th hour I will have one tiny break through hot flash and another on the 11th hour.  That&#x27;s it and I can live with that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are undecided but feel unable to function due to menopause, please give it a chance.  For those who have tried and feel it didn&#x27;t work, maybe you need to increase the dose.  One pump is a minimum.  Some need more. Some quite a bit more.  Also, rotate application sites.  Remember to use some Progesterone cream. Experiment to find what works for you because we are all different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps someone as others have helped me.  Menopause really sucks and I see no evolutionary or biological purpose for it.  But there it is.  Good luck and peace.h.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so absolutely grateful to the women who took the time to write about their experiences. That is why I am writing. To pay it forward.

            <li> I have started a hormone replacement therapy with these products because my body no longer produces them on a regular basis.  I started peri-menopause about 18 months ago and thought I must have something dreadful happening with my body for everything to be so broken and horrid all of a sudden.  Much to my dismay, I had started menopause and didn&#x27;t know what was going on.  My doc recommended that I not take HRT because I had taken birth control pills for so many years, she thought I was much too high risk and basically booted me to the curb to find my own way after a brief discussion about what I should try.  This has been my goal since then.  I am now almost, ALMOST, normal but I have had a long ugly run with the menopause beast!  I have two things I don&#x27;t like about this product: you can&#x27;t tell how much is left in the container for calculating reorder and the cream never &amp;#34;dries&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;ve used other products that do so I know it&#x27;s something in this particular product.  Other than that, this is the easiest Bio Estrogen I&#x27;ve used.  Love the dispensing method of getting exactly what you need without measuring and there is no guessing that way either so each and every dispensed dose is the same. I use progesterone, dhea and a cortisol controller along with this product to manage my sanity.  I have not eaten any little children or cried uncontrollably in public since I started using hormone creams!  Praise God!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to help my daughter treat her menstrual migraines. She has been treated with every kind of anti-depressant and anti-seisure drug on the market along with birth control pill. All of these have so many terrible side effects. She decided to try something more natural and we started with progesterone on day 12-28 of her cycle and Life-Flo Biestro-care two days before her period until the end of her period. It has worked wonderfully so far. We have to be careful what she puts on her skin since she is terribly allergic to propylene glycol and this product is free from that chemical. We are so thankful that we seem to have found a better solution to keep her migraines at bay. It has been 2 months now and she has not had a bad one since she first went off her birth control pill. That was the toughest part since she dropped it cold turkey which was a big mistake. If she only had this product to use as a substitute for the first few days I think she could have avoided the 5 day migraine that resulted from a huge estrogen drop. When she feels one coming on, she uses Biestro along with magnesium glyconate and it seems to help immediately. We couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I used this cream for two weeks and did not feel a bit of change. I stopped using it. I am thinking about returning it!</li>
            <li> Excellent relief for my menopause symptoms.  I added in this product after using Progesta-care for awhile, which took care of most of my menopausal symptoms but I was still suffering with painful dryness, it literally hurt to use toilet tissue (Too much information!).  I only use a pea sized dab, several times a day and another pea sized dab before bed and that seems to do the trick for me.  So much better!  I still use the Progesta-care full amount, per instructions, and my menopausal symptoms are mostly relieved.  Happy dance!</li>
            <li> After having my ovaries removed at age 16 due to severe PCOS, I have been on several different hormone replacement products, from traditional HRT like PremPro and Premarin, birth control pills like Alesse and Seasonique, and then transdermal patches like the CombiPatch.  My latest experiment with HRT has been in using bioidentical hormone cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to clarify things for the reader, I did not do well on traditional HRT.  No matter what method was used, I tended to get horrible migraines occasionally.  PremPro and Premarin, being the two products with the highest dosage, gave me a near-constant headache that could not be relieved without using high-potency prescription medication prescribed by a neurologist.  &amp;#34;The pill&amp;#34; reduced my headaches to a couple of days a week but came with horrific, painful bleeding during the placebo days.  After quitting HRT entirely, my migraines had a significant drop in frequency, allowing me to be almost 100% pain free.  I felt normal.  My skin, ravaged by PCOS, started clearing up.  Then, my doctor became concerned about my hormone levels due to being only 30 years old.  Without even taking a hormone panel, I was given CombiPatch.  Here came the pain... again.  I knew there would be an adjustment period, but that adjustment period never really ended.  After three months of feeling terrible, I quit using the patch and &#x27;fired&#x27; my doctor for not listening to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After horrible experiences with a string of other products, I decided to try bioidentical hormone cream in the hopes that it wouldn&#x27;t make me sick.  After all, I don&#x27;t want to deal with  osteoporosis and other problems down the line.  I combined this product with a progesterone cream, and used as directed.  The first three or four days were wonderful; I felt completely normal.  Then, again, came the headaches, the hot flashes, the mild nausea.  I figured this might be part of the adjustment period.  And, then, I experienced one day where I felt absolutely PREGNANT.  I had a crushing headache with an aura, combined with terrible morning sickness that didn&#x27;t subside until I took prescription pain medication.  I persisted for three more days just to rule out the possibility of a stomach bug, but my problems stopped almost immediately after I stopped using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the upside, my experience tells me that the product is effective.  The cream itself is not sticky and absorbs easily into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moral of my story is this: only use this product if you have a legitimate need for it.  Convince your doctor to provide you with a hormone panel!  And, if you&#x27;ve been through surgical menopause, your body might very well be acclimated to a lower hormone level.  Your body may be producing adequate hormones on its own.  Don&#x27;t just assume that your doctor knows what they&#x27;re talking about if they haven&#x27;t gathered empirical evidence (blood work, hormone panels).  Once the evidence is in hand, then, and only then, should you consider supplementation.utely PREGNANT.

            <li> So far so good I will buy it again, I have been using four pumps am and pm and definitely notice a calming less anxious feeling.</li>
            <li> I started using Life-Flo Biestro-care for dryness issues.  I had been using a different brand that was not working for me and so started searching.  Wow, I am a happy woman again!  Life-Flo products work very well for me and am very happy I found them.</li>
            <li> Very nice item. Prompt shipping. Thank you</li>
            <li> I am allergic. Red dots under my eyes. Darn! Tried another brand also, and same thing. Tried bio-identical creme and same thing so went to under the tongue Bio-idental drops from the doctor. Now no problem. I am sure I must be very rare!!</li>
            <li> Might help others, but it did nothing for me. Followed the directions, I gave it a month, just to see.</li>
            <li> This product is great and the price was excellent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and have not been disappointed. It works well and I would recommend it to anyone searching for good brands.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a couple of weeks. I have noticed some weight gain. I am using Progesterone cream as well. I am not sure if it is due to this particular cream or both. My skin was dry.. I am guessing it is due to the lack of estrogen in my body that was replaced by this cream.  I have noticed that it is softer and more moisturized. If I continue to gain weight, I may stop using it or cut back on it.</li>
            <li> I have been in full blown parimenopause for three years. Was using Emeritta natural progesterone and phytoestrogen with good results till last summer when symptoms returned with a vengeance, was slathering the stuff on but my symptoms were still debilitating. Back to research, nothing was working, was almost ready to allow dr to prescribe the dreaded hrt, then tried this product along with Allvia progesterone, pregnenolen and dhea. Twice a day was doing nothing for me, then just out of pure desperation tried 3 times a day. That did the trick. Minimal hot flashes and night sweats and when I do get them, they are minimal. Hang in there girls, try 3 times a day, just might be the magic bullet for you as it was for me.</li>
            <li> The reason, as a physician, I DO NOT recommend Biestro - otherwise a great product - is because it contains phenoxyethanol. This toxic preservative is an endocrine disruptor and a skin irritant and should not be inside a hormone formula that gets applied on sensitive skin areas.&lt;br /&gt;Time to change the formula for a safer, cleaner product.</li>
