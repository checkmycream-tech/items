            <li>wonderful.</li>
            <li>This scent on my boyfriend is amazingly wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product!</li>
            <li>Otherwise an awesome product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just a really great deal.  </li>
            <li>I think they are great.</li>
            <li>It works great and smells great</li>
            <li>It has a very nice smell when it dries.</li>
            <li>Smells good (if you like patchouli).</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it &amp; buy it over &amp; over again!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This deodorant is amazing.</li>
            <li>Makes you feel good because you are genuinely doing your body good. :)</li>
            <li>But this sensitive deodorant is so excellent that I no longer even think about my arm pits and if I have to wash off my deodorant.  </li>
            <li>If you have to use natural deodorant, this is excellent and a hint of patchouli covers up a lot.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay ...</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t so sure about this scent.  </li>
            <li>Love kiss my face products.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so natural and smells so great</li>
            <li>I love the roll on and enjoy the coolness when it is applied.</li>
            <li>I tried it, but it was too strong for me to wear.</li>
            <li>This deodorant smells great, lasts through exercising and general running around all day without it fading.</li>
            <li>Really enjoy Kiss My Face products.</li>
            <li>Liquid glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I love it, even bought a multi pack after I tried out the first one I bought...</li>
            <li>I have used many, many natural deodorants and this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t have the true patchouli scent I was hoping it would</li>
            <li>Scent is fresh and light, not overbearing.  </li>
            <li>Strong smell at first, not unpleasant, and then as others say, goes away.</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>but it dries quick.</li>
            <li>Not unpleasant at all.</li>
            <li>This is a nice product if you are looking for a natural deodorant with out the additives of most commercial ones.</li>
            <li>Smells like fresh patchouli and works very well, most natural deo types I have tried</li>
            <li>The others say they are super savers but are not and the shipping is very steep.</li>
            <li>The new ones drip too much, I go through a bottle too fast, and there&#x27;s always dried/crusted deodorant around the roller and top.</li>
            <li>It is not an antiperspirant so if it&#x27;s hot you will sweat.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t always use it on really hot summer days.</li>
            <li>If you follow the directions and put this on after every shower or bath (clean skin), your body odor will eventually go away completely.</li>
            <li>My only wish is that the Patchouli was stronger, it is very very mild.</li>
            <li>but doesn&#x27;t smell much like patchouli.  </li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>I love this natural stuff-no harmful chemicals like in other deodorants/antiperspirants.</li>
            <li>Not too strong or offensive and lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;A little pricey for deodorant.</li>
            <li>This is the only natural deodorant that really does work!</li>
            <li>It has a natural smell that can sometimes be overpowering.  </li>
            <li>My husband isn&#x27;t too sensitive about things, but he said I smelled when wearing it.  </li>
            <li>The scent fades away after a few minutes, but I remain odor free throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a heavy sweater, just wanted to try it out.</li>
            <li>Not too crazy about this product, it doesn&#x27;t smell good and really didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>Kiss my Face needs to go back to the older bottles.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it is very liquidy and sometimes runs down my armpit onto my side if I put too much.</li>
            <li>Item arrived in a timely manner and was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>It does not smell like a great patchouli type smell but doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell either.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work extremely well and is very pungent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, and the first few times I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>At times I thought it was a bit sweet after a few hours, but then other times it wasn&#x27;t,</li>

            <li> I have used this product for years. It is all natural and does its job no matter how hard I work. I love it!</li>
            <li> Kiss my Face needs to go back to the older bottles. The new ones drip too much, I go through a bottle too fast, and there&#x27;s always dried/crusted deodorant around the roller and top.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works okay but doesn&#x27;t smell much like patchouli.  I wanted something without all of the harsh chemicals while breastfeeding so I decided to try this out.  It doesn&#x27;t work extremely well and is very pungent.  It does not smell like a great patchouli type smell but doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell either.  I will continue to use it but will not order it again.</li>
            <li> NOPE!!! This deodorant, like so many other natural/cruelty-free deodorants, made me stiiiiink worse than not wearing deodorant at all!</li>
            <li> It has a natural smell that can sometimes be overpowering.  My husband isn&#x27;t too sensitive about things, but he said I smelled when wearing it.  Kids commented too on the smell.  Won&#x27;t be wearing&lt;br /&gt;unless I&#x27;m by myself!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had issues with other deodorants where I go to sleep and itch my armpits like mad and it can even get so bad that I lose my underarm hair if I ignore the issue.  To avoid this in the past I would wash the deodorant off of my armpits before bed.  But this sensitive deodorant is so excellent that I no longer even think about my arm pits and if I have to wash off my deodorant.  It&#x27;s so natural and smells so great it&#x27;s just a really great deal.  Makes you feel good because you are genuinely doing your body good. :)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay ... doesn&#x27;t have the true patchouli scent I was hoping it would and it took forever to ship.</li>
            <li> Just the patchouli sent i was looking for, wonderful. Seems to work well on hotter days too. Really enjoy Kiss My Face products.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t so sure about this scent.  At times I thought it was a bit sweet after a few hours, but then other times it wasn&#x27;t,</li>
            <li> Was tough to find an all natural deodorant that actually keeps my underarms from smelling in the middle of summer.</li>
            <li> This scent on my boyfriend is amazingly wonderful.  I tried it, but it was too strong for me to wear.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Keeps me dry all day and the scent lasts all day too.</li>
            <li> Living in arizona I definitely sweat. I was tired of an antiperspirant/deodorant that left me not only sweating but also left me smelling like bo combined with whatever scent the deodorant was. This deodorant is amazing. Even on 100+ degree days I still sweat but it only smells like patchouli. Not unpleasant at all. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it is very liquidy and sometimes runs down my armpit onto my side if I put too much. Otherwise an awesome product.</li>
            <li> If you have to use natural deodorant, this is excellent and a hint of patchouli covers up a lot.  Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> Liquid glides on smoothly. Scent is fresh and light, not overbearing.  The scent fades away after a few minutes, but I remain odor free throughout the day.  Works for me!</li>
            <li> This is the only natural deodorant that really does work! I love it &amp; buy it over &amp; over again!</li>
            <li> Not too crazy about this product, it doesn&#x27;t smell good and really didn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;m not a heavy sweater, just wanted to try it out.</li>
            <li> Item arrived in a timely manner and was exactly what I expected. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love kiss my face products. I think they are great. Especially this deodorant! And definitely the patchouli body wash. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> This product really works. If you follow the directions and put this on after every shower or bath (clean skin), your body odor will eventually go away completely. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, and the first few times I noticed a difference. It has a very nice smell when it dries. Not overpowering. I love this natural stuff-no harmful chemicals like in other deodorants/antiperspirants. I am a faithful user now. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have used many, many natural deodorants and this is one of my favorites. It actually works.  You will still perspire but you will not stink.</li>
            <li> I love it, even bought a multi pack after I tried out the first one I bought...It works great and smells great</li>
            <li> Kiss my face has once again made my day. This deodorant smells great, lasts through exercising and general running around all day without it fading.</li>
            <li> I used to use a typical supermarket variety antiperspirant but skin irritation caused me to seek an alternative. The Kiss My Face Liquid Rock in Patchouli scent is definitely working for me. I love the roll on and enjoy the coolness when it is applied. My only wish is that the Patchouli was stronger, it is very very mild.</li>
            <li> I have tried it all. Just refuse to put anything toxic esp aluminum anywhere on my body esp where lymph nodes reside. Strong smell at first, not unpleasant, and then as others say, goes away. Buy from Cosmetic Solutions as date of the date of this review and add multiples. I just bought 6 for approx $4 each with only $3 shipping. The others say they are super savers but are not and the shipping is very steep.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product if you are looking for a natural deodorant with out the additives of most commercial ones. It is called liquid rock so it goes on very wet but it dries quick. It is not an antiperspirant so if it&#x27;s hot you will sweat.  I don&#x27;t always use it on really hot summer days.</li>
            <li> Smells good (if you like patchouli). Not too strong or offensive and lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;A little pricey for deodorant.</li>
            <li> Smells like fresh patchouli and works very well, most natural deo types I have tried did not work long, this works all day! will buy again.</li>
