            <li>I have always liked the Stetson Sierra Cologne however most of the stores do not carry it.</li>
            <li>IM glad Stetson still makes the Sierra cologne.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the one I know and love.  </li>
            <li>My favorite cologne that my husband uses.</li>
            <li>and I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>My favorite cologne.</li>

            <li>Thanks for sending this to me - I love it - and the man I bought it for LOVES it too!!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem quite a concentrated as the original bottle I had but its still pretty good.</li>
            <li>The cologne lasts a long time and I&#x27;m always getting comments like how good it smells, and what kind of cologne is that?</li>
            <li>so this is not the original stetson just to let you know</li>
            <li>It smells manly, and not perfume scented like a woman&#x27;s, unlike the Original one, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Nice clean not heavy scent.</li>
            <li>Service was fast and dependable also able to track your order thanks Fragrancenet.com.</li>
            <li>My dad has worn this cologne my whole life and he loves it!</li>
            <li>and if it is I want proof from this seller cause other than that it is a scam and this company is not being true to the buyer or who ever..................!!</li>
            <li>This product was 100 percent real.</li>
            <li>This is not the REAL STETSON COLOGNE....</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>This has been an old favorite for years and it is becoming hard to find.  </li>
            <li>I had some original left when I ordered this.</li>
            <li>no matter how brief, includes her smile.</li>
            <li>but I have notice the scent is a little off and is not as strong as my real bottle of stetson</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s possible I&#x27;m just not remembering it right, but I recall the scent being softer.</li>
            <li>,also the sticker was higher in this one than the $30 cologne I have bought prior to this.</li>
            <li>The new didn&#x27;t smell anything like the old Sierra</li>
            <li>Drives women wild.</li>

            <li> Hi everyone just to let you know this cologne comes in the same bottle and sticker and has the same label that says NY.NY but I have notice the scent is a little off and is not as strong as my real bottle of stetson,also the sticker was higher in this one than the $30 cologne I have bought prior to this. So yes same color bottle and close scent but week. so this is not the original stetson just to let you know and if it is I want proof from this seller cause other than that it is a scam and this company is not being true to the buyer or who ever..................!!</li>
            <li> A great cologne/after shave product.  It is so hard to find ANYWHERE!  I hesitate to leave a 5-star rating as I don&#x27;t want other people buying up the worldwide limited supply.  I usually only find it at flea markets. I have used this brand for 30 years and it hasn&#x27;t been made for the past 15 years or so.</li>
            <li> This product was 100 percent real. I will shop this site again it was Fragrancenet.com. Service was fast and dependable also able to track your order thanks Fragrancenet.com.</li>
            <li> I like it and have for several years.  So when a woman tells me she likes Sierra, our conversation, no matter how brief, includes her smile.</li>
            <li> Had purchased the cologne before, but could not find it in any local stores, so, I ORDERED IT ONLINE FOR MY FRIEND.  He likes it that well. Two thumbs up!!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the purchase, Stetson Sierra is one of my favorite colognes...</li>
            <li> Hey, this is really good for a hunk of manhood - manly, not too spicy or strong.  My husband loves it - makes him smell GREAT.</li>
            <li> I have worn this one scent since it&#x27;s start back in the 90&#x27;s. IM not much for change, so IM glad Stetson still makes the Sierra cologne. Nice clean not heavy scent.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the one I know and love.  I&#x27;d ordered the aftershave by mistake.  Big mistake.  The cologne lasts a long time and I&#x27;m always getting comments like how good it smells, and what kind of cologne is that?</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne that my husband uses. It smells manly, and not perfume scented like a woman&#x27;s, unlike the Original one, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> No one in my circle smell like me!!!</li>
            <li> Drives women wild. I have been using this cologne for years. Get with it men.</li>
            <li> Never cared for other Stetson colognes but Sierra I really like and its hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;I guess Coty must have made a deal to make or remake it.  It doesn&#x27;t seem quite a concentrated as the original bottle I had but its still pretty good.</li>
            <li> This is just what I and wanted it&#x27;s hard to find.  So am happy to have found it and received it quickly.</li>
            <li> I wore this stuff as a boy. Got a bottle out of nostalgia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a little off. It&#x27;s possible I&#x27;m just not remembering it right, but I recall the scent being softer. This one smells a little sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a smell similar to this, but softer, buy &amp;#34;Michael Jordan&amp;#34; cologne.</li>
            <li> Thanks for sending this to me - I love it - and the man I bought it for LOVES it too!!  He smells wonderful !!</li>
            <li> This has been an old favorite for years and it is becoming hard to find.  It smells great and is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This cologne is a knock off. I had some original left when I ordered this. The new didn&#x27;t smell anything like the old Sierra and I used it for years. Just an expensive con. If they aren&#x27;t selling it in the stores it&#x27;s because they don&#x27;t make it anymore.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to have found this cologne. My husband loves it and I love the fragrance. I do not think that they make this anymore.&lt;br /&gt;IF and when they do, I will buy it by the truck load!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the cologne. I have worn this for 8-10 years and this is not made with the same smell as years ago. This is not the REAL STETSON COLOGNE....</li>
            <li> My dad has worn this cologne my whole life and he loves it! Of course, this cologne is what I associate my dad with now and I love it too :D!</li>
            <li> Always one of my favorites. It has had a different scent as the day lingers lately, not like I remember from past experience. This fragrance is a bit hard for me to find in stores so Amazon is the place I go to. Time for a re-order.</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne. Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I have always liked the Stetson Sierra Cologne however most of the stores do not carry it. The price has jumped to about double the price</li>
            <li> The only cologne I have used since it came out years ago. It is great. Will never change. Be hard past to replace it.</li>
            <li> My husband use to wear this cologne and it was wonderful but we couldn&#x27;t find it anymore in local stores.  I saw it on amazon and gladly ordered it.  It is not the same.  It seems watered down or something.  Maybe they don&#x27;t use oils to make it anymore???  Don&#x27;t know.  All I know is what use to last all day doesn&#x27;t even last a few hours now.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great smell for my night shift job. One of my favorite colognes of all time. Will continue to buy this</li>
