            <li>It came quick and I was able to wrap it nicely.</li>
            <li>It was a pretty good deal and I recommend buying it.</li>
            <li>It was easy to wrap and I am sure will be used.</li>
            <li>Seemed like there could have been more of the bath stuff, but the lotions smell great and look like they will last awhile.</li>
            <li>It is that easy.</li>
            <li>this was a gift, I was told they liked it very much.</li>

            <li>lol...Have not heard much about it, so, I am assuming they were nice, but, perhaps, nos</li>

            <li>A Nice gift set for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Packaged well and delivery was quick and easy.</li>
            <li>is so rich.  </li>
            <li>she called me excited to thank me for</li>
            <li>/&gt;They say it smell really nice and the scent last as well.&lt;br /&gt;They also find use for the cute basket</li>
            <li>Yeah I probably won&#x27;t buy this product again because its nothing special.. Just a basket of lotions, which is what I asked for and what I got.</li>
            <li>I received earlier than expected....always a good thing.</li>
            <li>it was ok, but it really reminded me of the cheapo baskets you get from WalMart.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Cheap but still a nice gift when you short one.</li>
            <li>Very pleased overall.</li>
            <li>The value of the product was well worth it.</li>
            <li>Nice gift - bought it as one item among several for a raffle -</li>
            <li>She smells pretty, I approve.</li>
            <li>This product came at a resonable price and pretty much as described.</li>
            <li>I cannot comment on the quality of its ingredients, since I gave it as a gift, but it was very well-received.</li>
            <li>I bought as a gift, but my friends really like them.</li>
            <li>I would like to see the lotion  available in a larger bottle as well.</li>
            <li>There were no broken pieces</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It was mailed directly to her</li>
            <li>but well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>The bottles are made of cheap and bendy plastic, and the caps are not sealed tight and almost came open when I opened the box.  </li>
            <li>Presentation of this basket is nice but the bath items are very poor quality - worse than the cheap store brand at the grocery store.</li>

            <li> The basket looks presentable only with the items arranged as pictured, but what the photograph does not show is the supporting piece at the bottom - a dusty sponge wrapped in used tapes.  </li>
            <li> I got the package on time, but the the soap was leaking and it was empty.</li>
            <li> Just one of those things that photograph well but are not especially good when you get the item.</li>
            <li> and it was sealed tightly.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hopeless trying to tear them or conceal them a little.  </li>
            <li> She loves the scent and uses the products everyday.</li>
            <li> Only a few ounces in bottles, weird sponge.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t want to get anything very expensive since it wasn&#x27;t the main gift.</li>
            <li> I wanted to send my friend just a small gift to let her know I was thinking of her.</li>
            <li> At least I didn&#x27;t get it damaged</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a secret!</li>

            <li> This was a gift for my daughter-in-law and she was very pleased.  It is as advertised and it was shipped promptly.</li>
            <li> This was a good gift to give a woman &amp;#34;you don&#x27;t know what to get for Christmas.&amp;#34;  The quality seemed fine to me, and I really liked the basket it was in.  I cannot comment on the quality of its ingredients, since I gave it as a gift, but it was very well-received.</li>
            <li> my step-mom really liked this</li>
            <li> pricey for what was included.</li>
            <li> very nice set and love the aroma of it. packed well &amp; arrived fast (less than a week from purchase date!!) would buy from again.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mother-in-law as a birthday gift. It was mailed directly to her so all I had to go on were the photos and reviews. She loves it and said it looks just like the photo and the basket is really nice. She loves the scent and uses the products everyday.</li>
            <li> I got the package on time, but the the soap was leaking and it was empty.</li>
            <li> This gift set is what one would expect for a $16 purchase (shipping included).  The bottles are made of cheap and bendy plastic, and the caps are not sealed tight and almost came open when I opened the box.  Cheap-looking \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot; tags are found everywhere and on everything and it&#x27;s hopeless trying to tear them or conceal them a little.  The basket looks presentable only with the items arranged as pictured, but what the photograph does not show is the supporting piece at the bottom - a dusty sponge wrapped in used tapes.  If you take it out then there is no way to make the same arrangement.  I bought it as a gift for a friend, but now I&#x27;ll need to find an alternative one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried the product itself, so this review pertains only to its appearance as a gift.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother, if she is happy I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Seems nice.  Not &amp;#34;out of this world&amp;#34; but nice.  This was a present to someone else...of courst...lol...Have not heard much about it, so, I am assuming they were nice, but, perhaps, nos so wonderful.  The packing was great!</li>
            <li> This was a gift &amp; the receiver loved it. I received earlier than expected....always a good thing. Very pleased overall.</li>
            <li> Smells really nice and good quality basket. I bought as a gift, but my friends really like them. Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Bought as a Xmas present to present a spa gift card so I didn&#x27;t want to get anything very expensive since it wasn&#x27;t the main gift. Presentation of this basket is nice but the bath items are very poor quality - worse than the cheap store brand at the grocery store. You&#x27;d end up with a nicer basket if you took the same amount of money and bought a basket and individual bath items. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll do next time.</li>
            <li> It was a gift so I don&#x27;t know about the product itself but it was a cutie set. The basket appears to be sturdy.</li>
            <li> Yeah I probably won&#x27;t buy this product again because its nothing special.. Just a basket of lotions, which is what I asked for and what I got. At least I didn&#x27;t get it damaged</li>

            <li> Chose it for a Christmas gift, but didn&#x27;t give it because disapppointed with it.  Only a few ounces in bottles, weird sponge. Just one of those things that photograph well but are not especially good when you get the item.</li>
            <li> This item more than lived up to my expectations!  I love the wonderful vanilla scent and the lotion is so rich.  Love it, love it, love it.  The cord box is great for holding bathroom items.</li>

            <li> this was a xmas gift for one of my dearest friends,&lt;br /&gt;and she called me excited to thank me for&lt;br /&gt;the delicious smell of vanilla and lovely&lt;br /&gt;presentation.</li>
            <li> I believe this product came wrapped neatly. There were no broken pieces and it was sealed tightly. The value of the product was well worth it. I plan on giving this to my mother for Christmas, so I am happy with the results. It was easy to wrap and I am sure will be used. It came quick and I was able to wrap it nicely. Thanks</li>

            <li> love how it smells&lt;br /&gt;doesnt feel geasy or slimy like some bath products ive used before. not a lot in the pkg tho</li>
