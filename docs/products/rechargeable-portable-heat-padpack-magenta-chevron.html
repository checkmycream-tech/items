            <li>Greatly helps with all sorts of injuries and pain.</li>
            <li>Why the happy fuss?</li>
            <li>This heat pad works great.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled that I can take it with me almost anywhere, and the heat holds its temperature for a very nice period of time.</li>
            <li>Heats up super quick!!!!!</li>
            <li>Perfect size and gears quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is HOT, wrapping it around with a towel, it&#x27;ll be your best friend.</li>
            <li>Charging option is amazing abt this product</li>
            <li>within minutes and stays nice and toasty for HOURS.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to look at, charges quickly, and is a nice size for using on my neck or shoulders.  </li>
            <li>very fast warm up!</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Still, I love this heating pad.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute too.</li>
            <li>it was such a wonderful product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure he will tell me</li>
            <li>Love....</li>
            <li>It does charge nice and quick, but to say it holds heat for 2 - 3 hours depending on application?  </li>
            <li>Also one that gets really warm and stays warm which this one has so far.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a just the right size for me and perfect for body sores.</li>
            <li>I love how quickly it heats up and the convenience of not having to go to the faucet to fill the bottle up with water.  </li>
            <li>It was working great until a few weeks ago when I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t turning off on its own....</li>
            <li>Love it, takes about 12 minutes to warm up completely then stay warm for the whole night under the blankets.</li>
            <li>It might be slightly warm in hour two, but it only holds full heat for 20 minutes at the very most in my home, using it against my neck.  </li>
            <li>This item has become the household favorite, so much so that within two days I needed to order one for every member of the family.</li>
            <li>Easy and fast heat up!</li>
            <li>I only wish it came in different sizes, this one is around 10x 7 which as I stated is perfect for my shoulder</li>
            <li>The only reason I tried it was for the good reviews, and they are right on.</li>
            <li>a strong plastic smell that I am very concerned about, in terms of environmental carcinogens.</li>
            <li>I actually love this item, however, I can&#x27;t very well give it a full five stars when its advertised attributes aren&#x27;t really borne out in reality.  </li>
            <li>Great little heating pad.</li>
            <li>The warm liquid is just enough to mold to your targeted body part without feeling like it will burst.</li>
            <li>Stays warm for hours and actually gets hot within a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>It still gets hot..</li>
            <li>highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>It was here exactly when I wanted it here.</li>
            <li>and the auto shut off feature when it is hot</li>
            <li>I have seen a few good reviews for this product an I am amazed.</li>
            <li>Once I saw it on here I wanted to try it and was very excited when it arrived earlier than the projected shipping date</li>
            <li>, that was certainly a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My mother charges the unit at home, and then takes it with her in the car to ease certain discomforts while driving.</li>
            <li>but I wish there was something like a 5 x7 that would fit the back of the neck.  </li>
            <li>haha)</li>
            <li>Holds heat for reasonable time.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>do ENJOY the HELL outta yours while it last maybe 60 to 90 days</li>
            <li>It is about the size of my 16&amp;#34; laptop screen and charges so fast there is NO downtime.</li>
            <li>Everyone in the office wants one now.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>but so far it is exactly what I was looking for, a heating pad for my shoulder that doesn&#x27;t have to stay plugged in and doesn&#x27;t have to be warmed in the microwave.</li>
            <li>I love this little heating pad.</li>
            <li>trying to figure out if it&#x27;s heated enough by touch is impossible as the bottom will be cooler than the top until you jiggle it around to use it, and then it can become just warm when it felt too hot just moments before.  </li>
            <li>( the new smell + plastic</li>
            <li>There may be a strong plastic smell while is being charged, I made myself a little cotton wrap</li>
            <li>but I had had it 3 months by now an that should be long enough for a fine water bottle like this one ?</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t leave it plugged in as long as the manufacturer recommends or it gets extremely hot</li>
            <li>Just an idea, so far this one can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>instead it just keeps going then gets really loud..</li>
            <li>very quickly&lt;br /&gt;-Holds heat for several hours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Please so far.</li>
            <li>and then you have to wait for it to cool down.</li>
            <li>The only noticeable &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; part of this product is that there is a particular plastic/</li>
            <li>It heats as fast as they advertise and the heat lasts just as long!</li>
            <li>While you can&#x27;t charge this in a car, it lasts long enough that you might get away with taking it to a local soccer game and staying pretty warm for quite awhile.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got this just in time for two nights that heat in my home was broken.  </li>
            <li>Spilled a little bit of juice in it and it wiped right off.</li>
            <li>but the other day the part that you plug it into (the white circle with the logo seen in the picture) like popped out because it got so hot.</li>
            <li>After a month the little red hot button never turned itself off I kept waiting</li>
            <li>The 16 year old grabbed it the second night and took it to bed; my husband has used it on his back and arthritic fingers; I used it to warm my bed in a cold bedroom before sleep.</li>

            <li> Great little heating pad. Stays warm for hours and actually gets hot within a couple of minutes. Don&#x27;t leave it plugged in as long as the manufacturer recommends or it gets extremely hot and then you have to wait for it to cool down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got this just in time for two nights that heat in my home was broken.  There may be a strong plastic smell while is being charged, I made myself a little cotton wrap I personally like the touch of cotton.  Overall, it&#x27;s a just the right size for me and perfect for body sores.</li>
            <li> I have only used this twice but so far it is exactly what I was looking for, a heating pad for my shoulder that doesn&#x27;t have to stay plugged in and doesn&#x27;t have to be warmed in the microwave. Also one that gets really warm and stays warm which this one has so far. Once I saw it on here I wanted to try it and was very excited when it arrived earlier than the projected shipping date, that was certainly a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I only wish it came in different sizes, this one is around 10x 7 which as I stated is perfect for my shoulder but I wish there was something like a 5 x7 that would fit the back of the neck.  Just an idea, so far this one can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> It was working great until a few weeks ago when I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t turning off on its own....instead it just keeps going then gets really loud..I&#x27;m kind of afraid that its going to (quite literally) explode..so I&#x27;m being cautious. It still gets hot..but the other day the part that you plug it into (the white circle with the logo seen in the picture) like popped out because it got so hot. To the point that I had to push it back in (on the plus side I got to see what was inside it...some red looking stuff haha) But ya..it&#x27;s a bit annoying since one reason I got it was because it would automatically turn off if I forgot about it..so.....meh I think it&#x27;s too late for me to exchange it.........</li>
            <li> very fast warm up! highly recommend!! used during my labor and will continue to use for just about anything, back or any sort of injury</li>
            <li> Performed well. My mother charges the unit at home, and then takes it with her in the car to ease certain discomforts while driving. Fully charged heat lasts about 40 minutes. Well made, attractive.</li>
            <li> I like this product. But the 6 hours charge/heat is a fantasy like the info says when i got the device it last 2-3 hours. I love it, I just wish it lasted the 6 hours i read that it would.</li>
            <li> Heats up super quick!!!!! Spilled a little bit of juice in it and it wiped right off. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> A sealed plasticpouch of water with an aquarium heater inside. Made in China, shipped from Oklahoma.&lt;br /&gt;seriously lacking in safety features inculding claimed auto-shut-off.</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t anyone think of this before? For years I&#x27;ve been struggling with too short cords and uncomfortable positions just to get some heat on my aching back or neck. Genius!</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Charges very quickly&lt;br /&gt;-Holds heat for several hours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-Has a strong plastic smell that I am very concerned about, in terms of environmental carcinogens. While I really like how well it works otherwise, this is a big enough con that I am seriously considering returning the item.</li>
            <li> I actually love this item, however, I can&#x27;t very well give it a full five stars when its advertised attributes aren&#x27;t really borne out in reality.  It does charge nice and quick, but to say it holds heat for 2 - 3 hours depending on application?  It might be slightly warm in hour two, but it only holds full heat for 20 minutes at the very most in my home, using it against my neck.  You&#x27;ll probably want to get a cover for this and just let it heat all the way.... trying to figure out if it&#x27;s heated enough by touch is impossible as the bottom will be cooler than the top until you jiggle it around to use it, and then it can become just warm when it felt too hot just moments before.  Still, I love this heating pad.  It&#x27;s nice to look at, charges quickly, and is a nice size for using on my neck or shoulders.  I&#x27;ve been dragging it from room to room!</li>
            <li> I love this little heating pad. I am thrilled that I can take it with me almost anywhere, and the heat holds its temperature for a very nice period of time. It&#x27;s cute too.</li>
            <li> Charging option is amazing abt this product</li>
            <li> Perfect size and gears quickly.  Holds heat for reasonable time. Reasonably priced.  Please so far.</li>
            <li> Love it, takes about 12 minutes to warm up completely then stay warm for the whole night under the blankets.</li>
            <li> It was here exactly when I wanted it here. It heats as fast as they advertise and the heat lasts just as long! I&#x27;ve recommended it to all of my colleagues! All in all-very impressed and very happy!!!</li>
            <li> I have seen a few good reviews for this product an I am amazed. I purchased this product an it was delivered sometime in December. It in the beginning worked properly meaning it shut it self off at a set temperature like it was claimed it would do. After a month the little red hot button never turned itself off I kept waiting but it never happened. So I let it sit for a month an used it again. It still never turned off an it was such a wonderful product it one night just exploded but I had had it 3 months by now an that should be long enough for a fine water bottle like this one ?&lt;br /&gt;So I imagine that if you want to purchase something like this which all in ll is not that attractive go ahead then you can repurchase it.&lt;br /&gt;I am saving it to show to my electrician so he can perform a test on it I&#x27;m sure he will tell me it is just plain garbage an a very bad purchase.&lt;br /&gt;BUT do ENJOY the HELL outta yours while it last maybe 60 to 90 days</li>
            <li> Love....love....love this thing!!</li>
            <li> Greatly helps with all sorts of injuries and pain. For ladies, cramps go away in an instant. It is HOT, wrapping it around with a towel, it&#x27;ll be your best friend. Muscle inflammations can be relieved as well, or if you&#x27;re simply cold. The only noticeable &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; part of this product is that there is a particular plastic/some smell coming from the outside of the heat pad ( the new smell + plastic smell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if this dies, I&#x27;ll buy it again anytime.</li>
            <li> This item has become the household favorite, so much so that within two days I needed to order one for every member of the family. Why the happy fuss? This little water bottle heats...and I mean HEATS....within minutes and stays nice and toasty for HOURS. The 16 year old grabbed it the second night and took it to bed; my husband has used it on his back and arthritic fingers; I used it to warm my bed in a cold bedroom before sleep. While you can&#x27;t charge this in a car, it lasts long enough that you might get away with taking it to a local soccer game and staying pretty warm for quite awhile. It is about the size of my 16&amp;#34; laptop screen and charges so fast there is NO downtime. The warm liquid is just enough to mold to your targeted body part without feeling like it will burst. So, yeah, go ahead and lay down with in in the small of your back without worry. This is a purchase you won&#x27;t regret. The only reason I tried it was for the good reviews, and they are right on. I&#x27;ve seen others in animal shapes that have lesser reviews, but I can attest that this one does what it says. I&#x27;ll try to update after a few months to let you know how it holds up.</li>
            <li> I love how quickly it heats up and the convenience of not having to go to the faucet to fill the bottle up with water.  and the auto shut off feature when it is hot is great!</li>
            <li> Perfect for the Wife! Her office is a icebox, leaving her with backaches at work. Easy and fast heat up! Everyone in the office wants one now. haha</li>
            <li> This heat pad works great.</li>
