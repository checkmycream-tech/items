            <li>People should be able to know what they are buying in health and beauty products before ordering!</li>
            <li>Love this cream!</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s nice and creamy and not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>it was great and fast delivery!!</li>
            <li>The smell of blackberries is quite potent in an intoxicating sort of way, and the quality of the body butter is amazing.  </li>
            <li>My wonderful mother gave me a jar of this Royal Jelly Body butter as an early birthday gift when she came in town to visit.</li>
            <li>It has great moisturizing properties and lasts on the skin a good while and the fragrance is wonderful:  Not heavy, but light, clean and barely sweet.  </li>
            <li>1) Packaging is gorgeous, so it makes for a nice gift right from the post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>The box is beautiful and well-made, I&#x27;m even keeping it, and the container is high class and creative.</li>
            <li>I have used many hand products during my lifetime.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I really love the Savannah Bee Company Royal Jelly Body Butter, and I want more.</li>
            <li>I wish they had more stock available SOON!</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gifted this to a friend who was suffering from the effects of chemo therapy and radiation treatments for breast cancer.</li>
            <li>The red box was impressive as well.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light scent and glides on like magic.</li>
            <li>Newer version is smooth and the extracts seem to have reduced (bummer!)</li>
            <li>Nothing better for the aging face.  :)</li>
            <li>My daughters and I love this hand cream....</li>
            <li>I love the smell and texture of this cream.  </li>
            <li>I want more moisture.</li>
            <li>People should be able to know what they are buying in health and beauty products before ordering!e.</li>
            <li>I want more moisture.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>It is still my all time favorite.</li>
            <li>I really do love the scent , it is light and can be worn with your favorite perfume or on its own.</li>
            <li>Love this body cream.</li>
            <li>but I really am a fan of royal jelly for good health and was thrilled to find it in cream form for the body.  </li>
            <li>Soooo glad I did.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the smell and the way it made my skin feel</li>
            <li>Fortunately, my lovely father stepped in and bought a jar for me and one for himself.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will gladly fork over $34 for this stuff.</li>
            <li>It comes in a vanity-worthy bottle in a cute keep-worthy box.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only drawback is that it is pricey--so perfect for a gift!!</li>
            <li>It has a nice light scent that I can tolerate as well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Savannah Bee Company anyway because the honey is awesome as well!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>box really makes the presentation of this as a gift, very nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a great product, with much better ingredients in it than the old moisturizers I was using.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a great product, with much better ingredients in it than the old moisturizers I was using.</li>
            <li>Its rich, softens the skin for a long time, and smells awesome.</li>
            <li>More importantly, this is the best product I have ever used for my super dry legs and arms.</li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly</li>
            <li>and I keep it in my kitchen for easy access.  </li>
            <li>Its so strong</li>
            <li>But it is STRONG.</li>
            <li>Its so strong</li>
            <li>But it is STRONG.</li>
            <li>- the scent isn&#x27;t strong, but it lingers so if you don&#x27;t like scented moisturizers, this might not be for you.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic body cream.</li>
            <li>it is a great moisturizer and you only need a dime size amount of it for you face.</li>
            <li>Those I have gifted it to love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>It is soft as butter and feels so good on your skin.  </li>
            <li>Royal Jelly from bee&#x27;s has a unique smell.</li>
            <li>Royal Jelly from bee&#x27;s has a unique smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is definitely one of the best natural products for skin!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth its weight in gold!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended and if your lucky enough to be in Savannah stop by the savannah bee company because they have  some AWESOME honey mead.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pleasant enough that some of the guys around here like to borrow some on occasion.</li>
            <li>In doing a lot of reading on ingredients, I&#x27;ve come to learn Honey really is a special and unique substance.</li>
            <li>very nice for dry hands and elbows</li>
            <li>It is super rich and creamy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is great for rough patches of skin.  </li>
            <li>However, red box product was kept in was in good condition, and the glass jar was in mint condition.  </li>
            <li>In that case full disclosure is a MUST.</li>
            <li>It has been such a good friend to my skin during the winter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and creamy and provides excellent moisture without being greasy or sticky.  </li>
            <li>The scent is unusual in the beginning but the results are outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Hands-down, this is my absolute favorite product EVER.</li>
            <li>i work in a lab, which involves a LOT of hand washing per day - a product that&#x27;s rinsed easily away the first time you wash your hands is therefore not helpful.  </li>
            <li>quick result I saw of the cream is that it reduced the scabs I had on my chin.</li>
            <li>I just scoop some out, quickly shut the jar, and rub it in</li>
            <li>I just scoop some out, quickly shut the jar, and rub it in</li>
            <li>So anything that wasn&#x27;t primarily \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; or was higher</li>
            <li>But this is strong, and I really dislike the smell.</li>
            <li>But this is strong, and I really dislike the smell.</li>
            <li>I really like this product however the fragrance in the jar I received is very mild.</li>
            <li>I plan to buy several more!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice enough for display!</li>
            <li>I thought the blue seal on the jar was a nice touch.</li>
            <li>but totally worth it</li>
            <li>For me, this is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>yeah, that jar is pricey, but i get a year&#x27;s use out of it, so it&#x27;s easily worth the money.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion - Pricey, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>besides the fact that it is paraben  free and all natural it is incredibly smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I received this as a gift and instantly fell in love with the rich berry/pecan scent.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as the baby Vaseline while still wet after bath or shower!</li>
            <li>just a little bit of this stuff goes a really long way, and once it&#x27;s absorbed into your hands, you&#x27;re good to go for hours (where hours in my life means a dozen handwashings or more!).  </li>
            <li>Normally it has a smooth texture and lighter color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just bought this at our local whole foods and love it!</li>
            <li>I tried it in Savannah when we were on vacation - bought some there, shipped it home, sent some to a friend, bought more from Amazon when I ran out and have it constantly on my wish list.</li>
            <li>Not greasy, not watery, just smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>The Sibu body cream is what I use first out of the shower, and this follows on the parts of my body</li>
            <li>The Sibu body cream is what I use first out of the shower, and this follows on the parts of my body</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love the lasting benefits.</li>
            <li>I mostly use it at night for a deep softening treatment.</li>
            <li>I first bought it at the Savannah Bee Company in Savannah,</li>
            <li>I received a jar as a gift last year, and this  year I bought all my girl-pals a jar... LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>I came across this cream, I bought it based on the positive reviews on it and also because it had honey in it.</li>
            <li>Seriously, if you are still searching for the perfect moisturizer, look no further.</li>
            <li>Most lotions, I apply and within minutes back to normal skin.</li>
            <li>She loved the feel on her skin (not the irritated places,  I don&#x27;t remember what she used on her ruptured places) but for the very dry, and fragile skin which was caused by chemo</li>
            <li>Rich, creamy, not too greasy and quickly absorbed, really hydrates dry arms, legs, feet.  </li>
            <li>My wife especially enjoys my using this product since I caress her body gently and smoothly during our bedtime activities</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>I really like this cream.</li>
            <li>Using this cream, that area seems much smoother and</li>
            <li>Really keeps the skin hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work very well</li>
            <li>Thankfully they held the product for me when some came in, knowing how much I wanted it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping....</li>
            <li>maybe that&#x27;s too much information, but</li>
            <li>Initially when you open the jar, it smells pretty good upon the first whiff, but after a second or two it can be overpowering, so much that I don&#x27;t want to smell it anymore.</li>

            <li>whether it be from the humidity, hormones, certain facial products, etc.. I have tried SO many products, from drugstore to high end to natural oils/moisturizers.</li>
            <li>No more ruddiness, skin tone is even, skin feels supple and smooth, and the fine line that had begun to show on my forehead is GONE.</li>
            <li>This is great cream, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>but I will say that it spared me many nights of extreme discomfort and buckets of tears.&lt;br</li>
            <li>in the wintertime, where the super low humidity worsens the impact of all that soap, this magic bee stuff becomes an essential part of my life by completely preventing splits and cracks in my skin from happening.  </li>
            <li>aromatic extract\\&quot;), pecan oil, shea butter, natural beeswax, orange peel wax, chondrus crispus extract &amp; glucose, sodium levulinte, Kaolin (natural rose clay), natural alpha bisabolol, glyceryl caprylate, acetyl hydroxyethyl cellulose, sodium anisette, honey, allantoin, tocopherol (natural vitamin e), sea buckthorn fruit oil, &amp; sodium phytate (naturally derived from rice bran).</li>
            <li>This is a relatively expensive cream, beautifully packaged, that really softens my skin.  </li>
            <li>If you find that your skin if fine after your morning application of body care but by evening, you&#x27;re dry again, try this product.</li>
            <li>I have bought this cream at Whole Foods but they quit caring it, this is a excelent ptoduct I bought a few for my friends for a Christmas present and they loved it</li>
            <li>A new staple!</li>
            <li>The older version was grainy and had lots of extracts.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly care for it</li>
            <li>Once or twice a week I will alternate it with my facial products and use it on my face and neck when I go to bed - I have to tell you, it makes your skin feel so silky smooth!</li>
            <li>If you use it daily on your arms and legs, etc., you will  be able to tell such a difference over time.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to grab this during Bath and Body Work&#x27;s semi-annual sale.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this item.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li>It only takes a very small amount (about the size of a pea) to moisturize your face and your skin feels great.</li>
            <li>I just finished and bought 3 more to last a long time, but in case it ever goes out of stock.  </li>
            <li>I definitely like rotating between this product and another product, so it is definitely worth the price for the quality of the product.</li>
            <li>It was my new year&#x27;s resolution to reduce the chemicals I expose my body to.</li>
            <li>My parents live in Savannah and the Savannah Bee Company is always on my list of places to visit when I go home</li>
            <li>I live in SW Florida</li>
            <li>It makes your hands feel like new and are very soft.</li>
            <li>thank you, Savannah Bee Company, for my little jar of miracles! :)&lt;</li>
            <li>Used it for the first time last night.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>, I was so excited to have found it on Amazon for less.  </li>
            <li>I am  absolutely addicted to this amazing body butter.</li>
            <li>Luckily it sinks in fast and once it does I don&#x27;t really smell it anymore.</li>
            <li>Luckily it sinks in fast and once it does I don&#x27;t really smell it anymore.</li>
            <li>Will make your hands, face, arms soooo soft.  </li>
            <li>Packaging was a bit larger than the product itself, and the mailing box (although arriving in a timely manner) had arrived showing much wear and tear.  </li>
            <li>I am prone to eczema, contact dermatitis, and have sensitive skin, so I am picky about my skin care products.  </li>
            <li>99% Natural Ingredients.\\</li>
            <li>Since using this my skin has become uber soft.</li>
            <li>So much that my bf is constantly stroking my skin in awe, and I must admit, he&#x27;s right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since using this my skin has become uber soft.</li>
            <li>So much that my bf is constantly stroking my skin in awe, and I must admit, he&#x27;s right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried nearly every product on the market &amp; this far exceeds anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I think it has to do with the Royal Jelly and all of the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Your skin just becomes so soft.  </li>
            <li>have ridiculously sensitive skin when it comes to scented ANYTHING as well as season changes.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t go so far as to say that this changed my life...</li>
            <li>i received the first jar of this as a gift several years ago (when this product line was briefly sold at bath &amp; body works), and it&#x27;s now a must-have for my office.  </li>
            <li>More long lasting than any other fragrance I&#x27;ve ever tried before.  </li>
            <li>I use no other type of lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a little bit pricey, but totally worth</li>
            <li>and so a following of Savannah Bee&#x27;s has developed.</li>
            <li>The butter is so rich and thick</li>
            <li>skin feels so soft and supple all day long, but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;You have to try it to believe it.</li>
            <li>I started using it on my hands, upper arms and chest, and within a few days, my skin (including the little rough bumps I get sometimes on my arms) was completely soft, smooth and clear!</li>

            <li> This is the best body butter I&amp;#34;ve</li>
            <li> (their granny smith apple/honeycomb tastings are the best!).</li>
            <li> The best part is, I didn&#x27;t even have to use it all that often.</li>
            <li> This is very attractively packaged and works wonderfully well as a skin softening product.</li>

            <li> People should be able to know what they are buying in health and beauty products before ordering!</li>
            <li> Love this cream!</li>
            <li> I would prefer that the scent was stronger like when I first purchased it but even with a lighter one it is still the best body butter you will ever use.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  </li>
            <li> I love this body butter!  </li>
            <li> The Savannah Bee Company&#x27;s Royal Jelly Body Butter is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li> Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> AMAZING.</li>
            <li> It smelled and felt so nice</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful ingredients inside, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The cream felt really nice</li>
            <li> Also, up until I tried this cream, nothing helped the itching/red bumps go away until they ran their own course</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and creamy and not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> it was great and fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> The smell of blackberries is quite potent in an intoxicating sort of way, and the quality of the body butter is amazing.  </li>
            <li> My wonderful mother gave me a jar of this Royal Jelly Body butter as an early birthday gift when she came in town to visit.</li>
            <li> It has great moisturizing properties and lasts on the skin a good while and the fragrance is wonderful:  Not heavy, but light, clean and barely sweet.  </li>
            <li> 1) Packaging is gorgeous, so it makes for a nice gift right from the post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> The box is beautiful and well-made, I&#x27;m even keeping it, and the container is high class and creative.</li>
            <li> I have used many hand products during my lifetime.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I really love the Savannah Bee Company Royal Jelly Body Butter, and I want more.</li>
            <li> I wish they had more stock available SOON!</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gifted this to a friend who was suffering from the effects of chemo therapy and radiation treatments for breast cancer.</li>
            <li> The red box was impressive as well.</li>
            <li> It has a nice light scent and glides on like magic.</li>
            <li> Newer version is smooth and the extracts seem to have reduced (bummer!)</li>
            <li> Nothing better for the aging face.  :)</li>
            <li> My daughters and I love this hand cream....</li>
            <li> I love the smell and texture of this cream.  </li>
            <li> I want more moisture.</li>
            <li> People should be able to know what they are buying in health and beauty products before ordering!e.</li>
            <li> I want more moisture.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> It is still my all time favorite.</li>
            <li> I really do love the scent , it is light and can be worn with your favorite perfume or on its own.</li>
            <li> Love this body cream.</li>
            <li> but I really am a fan of royal jelly for good health and was thrilled to find it in cream form for the body.  </li>
            <li> Soooo glad I did.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the smell and the way it made my skin feel</li>
            <li> Fortunately, my lovely father stepped in and bought a jar for me and one for himself.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will gladly fork over $34 for this stuff.</li>
            <li> It comes in a vanity-worthy bottle in a cute keep-worthy box.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only drawback is that it is pricey--so perfect for a gift!!</li>
            <li> It has a nice light scent that I can tolerate as well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Savannah Bee Company anyway because the honey is awesome as well!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> box really makes the presentation of this as a gift, very nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a great product, with much better ingredients in it than the old moisturizers I was using.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a great product, with much better ingredients in it than the old moisturizers I was using.</li>
            <li> Its rich, softens the skin for a long time, and smells awesome.</li>
            <li> More importantly, this is the best product I have ever used for my super dry legs and arms.</li>
            <li> It arrived very quickly</li>
            <li> and I keep it in my kitchen for easy access.  </li>
            <li> Its so strong</li>
            <li> But it is STRONG.</li>
            <li> Its so strong</li>
            <li> But it is STRONG.</li>
            <li> - the scent isn&#x27;t strong, but it lingers so if you don&#x27;t like scented moisturizers, this might not be for you.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fantastic body cream.</li>
            <li> it is a great moisturizer and you only need a dime size amount of it for you face.</li>
            <li> Those I have gifted it to love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> It is soft as butter and feels so good on your skin.  </li>
            <li> Royal Jelly from bee&#x27;s has a unique smell.</li>
            <li> Royal Jelly from bee&#x27;s has a unique smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is definitely one of the best natural products for skin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth its weight in gold!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended and if your lucky enough to be in Savannah stop by the savannah bee company because they have  some AWESOME honey mead.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pleasant enough that some of the guys around here like to borrow some on occasion.</li>
            <li> In doing a lot of reading on ingredients, I&#x27;ve come to learn Honey really is a special and unique substance.</li>
            <li> very nice for dry hands and elbows</li>
            <li> It is super rich and creamy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is great for rough patches of skin.  </li>
            <li> However, red box product was kept in was in good condition, and the glass jar was in mint condition.  </li>
            <li> In that case full disclosure is a MUST.</li>
            <li> It has been such a good friend to my skin during the winter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and creamy and provides excellent moisture without being greasy or sticky.  </li>
            <li> The scent is unusual in the beginning but the results are outstanding.  </li>
            <li> Hands-down, this is my absolute favorite product EVER.</li>
            <li> i work in a lab, which involves a LOT of hand washing per day - a product that&#x27;s rinsed easily away the first time you wash your hands is therefore not helpful.  </li>
            <li> quick result I saw of the cream is that it reduced the scabs I had on my chin.</li>
            <li> I just scoop some out, quickly shut the jar, and rub it in</li>
            <li> I just scoop some out, quickly shut the jar, and rub it in</li>
            <li> So anything that wasn&#x27;t primarily \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; or was higher</li>
            <li> But this is strong, and I really dislike the smell.</li>
            <li> But this is strong, and I really dislike the smell.</li>
            <li> I really like this product however the fragrance in the jar I received is very mild.</li>
            <li> I plan to buy several more!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice enough for display!</li>
            <li> I thought the blue seal on the jar was a nice touch.</li>
            <li> but totally worth it</li>
            <li> For me, this is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> yeah, that jar is pricey, but i get a year&#x27;s use out of it, so it&#x27;s easily worth the money.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion - Pricey, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> besides the fact that it is paraben  free and all natural it is incredibly smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and instantly fell in love with the rich berry/pecan scent.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as the baby Vaseline while still wet after bath or shower!</li>
            <li> just a little bit of this stuff goes a really long way, and once it&#x27;s absorbed into your hands, you&#x27;re good to go for hours (where hours in my life means a dozen handwashings or more!).  </li>
            <li> Normally it has a smooth texture and lighter color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just bought this at our local whole foods and love it!</li>
            <li> I tried it in Savannah when we were on vacation - bought some there, shipped it home, sent some to a friend, bought more from Amazon when I ran out and have it constantly on my wish list.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, not watery, just smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> The Sibu body cream is what I use first out of the shower, and this follows on the parts of my body</li>
            <li> The Sibu body cream is what I use first out of the shower, and this follows on the parts of my body</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love the lasting benefits.</li>
            <li> I mostly use it at night for a deep softening treatment.</li>
            <li> I first bought it at the Savannah Bee Company in Savannah,</li>
            <li> I received a jar as a gift last year, and this  year I bought all my girl-pals a jar... LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> I came across this cream, I bought it based on the positive reviews on it and also because it had honey in it.</li>
            <li> Seriously, if you are still searching for the perfect moisturizer, look no further.</li>
            <li> Most lotions, I apply and within minutes back to normal skin.</li>
            <li> She loved the feel on her skin (not the irritated places,  I don&#x27;t remember what she used on her ruptured places) but for the very dry, and fragile skin which was caused by chemo</li>
            <li> Rich, creamy, not too greasy and quickly absorbed, really hydrates dry arms, legs, feet.  </li>
            <li> My wife especially enjoys my using this product since I caress her body gently and smoothly during our bedtime activities</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream.</li>
            <li> Using this cream, that area seems much smoother and</li>
            <li> Really keeps the skin hydrated.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work very well</li>
            <li> Thankfully they held the product for me when some came in, knowing how much I wanted it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping....</li>
            <li> maybe that&#x27;s too much information, but</li>
            <li> Initially when you open the jar, it smells pretty good upon the first whiff, but after a second or two it can be overpowering, so much that I don&#x27;t want to smell it anymore.</li>
            <li> Initially when you open the jar, it smells pretty good upon the first whiff, but after a second or two it can be overpowering, so much that I don&#x27;t want to smell it anymore.</li>
            <li> whether it be from the humidity, hormones, certain facial products, etc.. I have tried SO many products, from drugstore to high end to natural oils/moisturizers.</li>
            <li> No more ruddiness, skin tone is even, skin feels supple and smooth, and the fine line that had begun to show on my forehead is GONE.</li>
            <li> This is great cream, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> but I will say that it spared me many nights of extreme discomfort and buckets of tears.&lt;br</li>
            <li> in the wintertime, where the super low humidity worsens the impact of all that soap, this magic bee stuff becomes an essential part of my life by completely preventing splits and cracks in my skin from happening.  </li>
            <li> aromatic extract\\&quot;), pecan oil, shea butter, natural beeswax, orange peel wax, chondrus crispus extract &amp; glucose, sodium levulinte, Kaolin (natural rose clay), natural alpha bisabolol, glyceryl caprylate, acetyl hydroxyethyl cellulose, sodium anisette, honey, allantoin, tocopherol (natural vitamin e), sea buckthorn fruit oil, &amp; sodium phytate (naturally derived from rice bran).</li>
            <li> This is a relatively expensive cream, beautifully packaged, that really softens my skin.  </li>
            <li> If you find that your skin if fine after your morning application of body care but by evening, you&#x27;re dry again, try this product.</li>
            <li> I have bought this cream at Whole Foods but they quit caring it, this is a excelent ptoduct I bought a few for my friends for a Christmas present and they loved it</li>
            <li> A new staple!</li>
            <li> The older version was grainy and had lots of extracts.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly care for it</li>
            <li> Once or twice a week I will alternate it with my facial products and use it on my face and neck when I go to bed - I have to tell you, it makes your skin feel so silky smooth!</li>
            <li> If you use it daily on your arms and legs, etc., you will  be able to tell such a difference over time.  </li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to grab this during Bath and Body Work&#x27;s semi-annual sale.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this item.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> It only takes a very small amount (about the size of a pea) to moisturize your face and your skin feels great.</li>
            <li> I just finished and bought 3 more to last a long time, but in case it ever goes out of stock.  </li>
            <li> I definitely like rotating between this product and another product, so it is definitely worth the price for the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> It was my new year&#x27;s resolution to reduce the chemicals I expose my body to.</li>
            <li> My parents live in Savannah and the Savannah Bee Company is always on my list of places to visit when I go home</li>
            <li> I live in SW Florida</li>
            <li> It makes your hands feel like new and are very soft.</li>
            <li> thank you, Savannah Bee Company, for my little jar of miracles! :)&lt;</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time last night.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> , I was so excited to have found it on Amazon for less.  </li>
            <li> I am  absolutely addicted to this amazing body butter.</li>
            <li> Luckily it sinks in fast and once it does I don&#x27;t really smell it anymore.</li>
            <li> Luckily it sinks in fast and once it does I don&#x27;t really smell it anymore.</li>
            <li> Will make your hands, face, arms soooo soft.  </li>
            <li> Packaging was a bit larger than the product itself, and the mailing box (although arriving in a timely manner) had arrived showing much wear and tear.  </li>
            <li> I am prone to eczema, contact dermatitis, and have sensitive skin, so I am picky about my skin care products.  </li>
            <li> 99% Natural Ingredients.\\</li>
            <li> Since using this my skin has become uber soft.</li>
            <li> So much that my bf is constantly stroking my skin in awe, and I must admit, he&#x27;s right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since using this my skin has become uber soft.</li>
            <li> So much that my bf is constantly stroking my skin in awe, and I must admit, he&#x27;s right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried nearly every product on the market &amp; this far exceeds anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I think it has to do with the Royal Jelly and all of the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Your skin just becomes so soft.  </li>
            <li> have ridiculously sensitive skin when it comes to scented ANYTHING as well as season changes.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t go so far as to say that this changed my life...</li>
            <li> i received the first jar of this as a gift several years ago (when this product line was briefly sold at bath &amp; body works), and it&#x27;s now a must-have for my office.  </li>
            <li> More long lasting than any other fragrance I&#x27;ve ever tried before.  </li>
            <li> I use no other type of lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a little bit pricey, but totally worth</li>
            <li> and so a following of Savannah Bee&#x27;s has developed.</li>
            <li> The butter is so rich and thick</li>
            <li> skin feels so soft and supple all day long, but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;You have to try it to believe it.</li>
            <li> I started using it on my hands, upper arms and chest, and within a few days, my skin (including the little rough bumps I get sometimes on my arms) was completely soft, smooth and clear!</li>
            <li> Last time I got my order obviously with an outdated greyish substance that only smelled like the original cream.</li>
            <li> This is a keeper, and the box is a fantastic hard box with lid that you can keep trinkets, laundry quarters, hidden stash - anything in.  </li>
            <li> The royal jelly really softens your skins and also helps helps heal small cuts, mosquito bites, etc.  </li>
            <li> This product is wonderful-----I use it as a moisturizer on my face with great results--much less expensive too!!</li>
            <li> but I swear you will smell like raspberry all day long.  </li>
            <li> packaging, the jar looks very vintage chic and the cream is slightly thick - can guess it has a lot of beeswax and royal jelly.</li>
            <li> my only comment is the smell is a little different than I thought it would be</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but worth it!</li>
            <li> Literally any time the season changes my legs decide to go on protest and bedazzle themselves with tons of extremely itchy red bumps.</li>
            <li> It delivered as promised, and the dry skin problem was solved.  </li>
            <li> However, its a small price to pay fro the unbelievably soft skin it gives me.</li>
            <li> However, its a small price to pay fro the unbelievably soft skin it gives me.</li>
            <li> Have given to family/friends who had very dry and cracked hands and has worked well for them, including those who were taking chemo and had their skin dry and cracked from the chemo.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend for someone who doesn&#x27;t have very dry feet &amp; hands.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is really wonderful cream. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have used many hand products during my lifetime.  Since I have worked in farming ventures and my hands are subject to getting chapped and my skin becomes rough.  This product is the best I have ever used.  My wife especially enjoys my using this product since I caress her body gently and smoothly during our bedtime activities</li>
            <li> This stuff works GREAT I love it my only comment is the smell is a little different than I thought it would be but my husband likes it so no big.</li>
            <li> I saw this product on one of our weekends in Napa.  It smelled and felt so nice but it was just a little pricey, I was so excited to have found it on Amazon for less.  Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> very nice for dry hands and elbows</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I tried it in Savannah when we were on vacation - bought some there, shipped it home, sent some to a friend, bought more from Amazon when I ran out and have it constantly on my wish list. This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> I really love the Savannah Bee Company Royal Jelly Body Butter, and I want more. I wish they had more stock available SOON!</li>
            <li> This cream is so silky.  Feels wonderful going on. Not greasy, not watery, just smooth and soft.  I would compare it to silk fluff in butter but that would imply greasiness, and it is just not that greasy.  It has great moisturizing properties and lasts on the skin a good while and the fragrance is wonderful:  Not heavy, but light, clean and barely sweet.  You literally feel good when you use it because the feel and fragrance together lift your spirits.  I keep a tiny disposable plastic spoon or paddle nearby to dip it with, so that I don&#x27;t have to stick my fingers into it and get it under my nails.  I&#x27;ve tried some expensive lotions and creams. This is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes gift this to my mom.  She loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gifted this to a friend who was suffering from the effects of chemo therapy and radiation treatments for breast cancer. She loved the feel on her skin (not the irritated places,  I don&#x27;t remember what she used on her ruptured places) but for the very dry, and fragile skin which was caused by chemo therapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box really makes the presentation of this as a gift, very nice.</li>
            <li> Will make your hands, face, arms soooo soft.  The moisterizing effect of this item results in a dewey-fresh feeling.  The scent is absolutely delightful.    Highly recommend this item.  I had a jar for years and finally started using it - I just finished and bought 3 more to last a long time, but in case it ever goes out of stock.  This is a keeper, and the box is a fantastic hard box with lid that you can keep trinkets, laundry quarters, hidden stash - anything in.  It&#x27;s nice enough for display!</li>
            <li> Coolest gift ever, according to my wife.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and instantly fell in love with the rich berry/pecan scent.  The silky feeling and that wonderful scent lasts for hours.     The Royal jelly and other nutrients are all bonuses for me.  I thought the blue seal on the jar was a nice touch. The red box was impressive as well.</li>
            <li> Fantastic body cream. The scent is heavenly. Used it for the first time last night.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Excellant product have used for the last year and have allergys that at times my skin itches. This is the only product I have tried that stops that itching! Absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li> This product is not easy to find in my area, and at the time was cheaper to buy it from Amazon than the official website the product comes from.  Packaging was a bit larger than the product itself, and the mailing box (although arriving in a timely manner) had arrived showing much wear and tear.  Inside the product itself was protected by packing paper, so I was a little worried that the glass jar inside the red box would be damaged.  However, red box product was kept in was in good condition, and the glass jar was in mint condition.  The Savannah Bee Company&#x27;s Royal Jelly Body Butter is an amazing product.  The smell of blackberries is quite potent in an intoxicating sort of way, and the quality of the body butter is amazing.  It is thick, and hydrates well.  I am prone to eczema, contact dermatitis, and have sensitive skin, so I am picky about my skin care products.  Husband also has allergies, so it makes me happy to find any scented skin care products that make my skin look amazing and give me a lovely scent to boot.  I definitely like rotating between this product and another product, so it is definitely worth the price for the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream. However it is a butter cream and is very thick. It has a nice light scent and glides on like magic. It is a bit heavy so you want to use it sparingly. This is a great cream when you body needs a little TLC.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! They seem to have changed the formula and ingredients. The older version was grainy and had lots of extracts. Newer version is smooth and the extracts seem to have reduced (bummer!) but the scent has improved slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding packaging, the jar looks very vintage chic and the cream is slightly thick - can guess it has a lot of beeswax and royal jelly. Ingredient list has some chemical names but no parabens or glycols, which is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cream is quite expensive for the quantity but totally worth it compared to buying creams containing mineral oils or glycols, parabens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One quick result I saw of the cream is that it reduced the scabs I had on my chin. I had had a split chin and needed to get 10 stitches there. After that, my chin always has these scabs and nicks around the area. Using this cream, that area seems much smoother and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is good for the face too, although it is marketed as body butter. A little goes a long way! I am very happy with this product and waiting to see more marvelous products like this, from Savannah Bee!</li>
            <li> Nothing better for the aging face.  :)</li>
            <li> I bought a small jar when I visited Savannah in August. it lasted till January. This time I bought the big jar. it is a great moisturizer and you only need a dime size amount of it for you face. the moisture last from the time you out it on till the time you go to sleep. Great stuff!!</li>
            <li> It is a great body butter.  Really keeps the skin hydrated.  It smells good as well.  The packaging is very nice.</li>
            <li> My daughters and I love this hand cream....it is truly like butter!!  We started using it about 5 years ago and I buy it for them every Christmas.  We&#x27;ve also recommended it to friends and they swear by it also.  Fast delivery, wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and texture of this cream.  It is great for rough patches of skin.  It is expensive, but worth it!</li>
            <li> I have just purchased my 4th jar of this cream. Two for myself and 2 for gifts. Those I have gifted it to love it as much as I do. It only takes a very small amount (about the size of a pea) to moisturize your face and your skin feels great.</li>
            <li> This is a great body butter. Rich, creamy, not too greasy and quickly absorbed, really hydrates dry arms, legs, feet.  For me, this is worth the money.  It feels so good with a pleasant but not too overpowering smell.</li>
            <li> I recently went cold turkey on all my old products that had Parabens in it, BHT, BHA, etc etc (the list is long). It was my new year&#x27;s resolution to reduce the chemicals I expose my body to. So anything that wasn&#x27;t primarily \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; or was higher then a 3-4 on skin deep&#x27;s website went in the trash. Even some of my cosmetics sadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I came across this cream, I bought it based on the positive reviews on it and also because it had honey in it. In doing a lot of reading on ingredients, I&#x27;ve come to learn Honey really is a special and unique substance. Especially Royal Jelly. So I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. I also ordered Sibu Seabuckthorn Moisturizing Body Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is thick, creamy and all natural. The actual list of ingredients, since Amazon fails to properly list all components. Tisk tisk Amazon/Vendor, and I say this because it has peacan oil in it, and other nut butter/oils. I mean what if the person was allergic to nuts?!? In that case full disclosure is a MUST. Anyways the ingredients are the following: \\&quot;purified water, organic aloe vera leaf juice, isoamyl laureate, cetearyl alcohol, babassu butter, hydrogenated cocoglycerides, glycerin &amp; raw royal jelly, glyceryl stearate citrate, capuacu butter, cocoa butter, ethylhexyl olivate, d-panthenol (provitamin B5), sodium behenoyl lactylate, lauryl laureate, olive oil unsaponifiables, propolis extract, fragrance (\\&quot;blackberry aromatic extract\\&quot;), pecan oil, shea butter, natural beeswax, orange peel wax, chondrus crispus extract &amp; glucose, sodium levulinte, Kaolin (natural rose clay), natural alpha bisabolol, glyceryl caprylate, acetyl hydroxyethyl cellulose, sodium anisette, honey, allantoin, tocopherol (natural vitamin e), sea buckthorn fruit oil, &amp; sodium phytate (naturally derived from rice bran). 99% Natural Ingredients.\\&quot; It also says \\&quot;No animal testing, No petroleum-based ingredients, No parabens or preservatives in it\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like how moisturized this leaves me. I use this in conjunction with the Sibu Seabuckthorn Moisturizing Body Cream on parts  where my body needs a little extra moisturizer. The Sibu body cream is what I use first out of the shower, and this follows on the parts of my body I want more moisture. I only use about a quarter or two sized amount. Since using this my skin has become uber soft. So much that my bf is constantly stroking my skin in awe, and I must admit, he&#x27;s right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only gripe I have is the smell. While subjective, this stuff is pungent. Initially when you open the jar, it smells pretty good upon the first whiff, but after a second or two it can be overpowering, so much that I don&#x27;t want to smell it anymore. Its so strong it can give you a little bit of a headache. Luckily it sinks in fast and once it does I don&#x27;t really smell it anymore. My perfume also masks it. But it is STRONG. Royal Jelly from bee&#x27;s has a unique smell. I recognize it from royal jelly bee vitamin supplements I take. It smells the same. But this is strong, and I really dislike the smell. However, its a small price to pay fro the unbelievably soft skin it gives me. I just scoop some out, quickly shut the jar, and rub it in so I am not whiffing the stuff for too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a great product, with much better ingredients in it than the old moisturizers I was using. Just not a fan of the smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further Amazon needs to properly disclose ALL ingredients in product. Failing to do so is not properly advertising a product to a consumer. People should be able to know what they are buying in health and beauty products before ordering!e.

            <li> I have tried nearly every product on the market &amp; this far exceeds anything I have ever used. Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic! It is luxurious and the scent is unbelievable. I have psoriasis and this product helps. I think it has to do with the Royal Jelly and all of the natural ingredients. You cannot go wrong with this one!!</li>
            <li> Love this cream! And the packaging is so awesome that it will make a great gift! I plan to buy several more! A new staple!</li>
            <li> This is great cream, a little goes a long way.  It feels good after it is on your face and body..</li>
            <li> If you find that your skin if fine after your morning application of body care but by evening, you&#x27;re dry again, try this product. It has been such a good friend to my skin during the winter. You&#x27;ll love the lasting benefits.</li>
            <li> Update on the review: not so good. Last time I got my order obviously with an outdated greyish substance that only smelled like the original cream. Next time I won&#x27;t buy this through internet. I added a picture to show how flaky the cream actually was. Normally it has a smooth texture and lighter color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely one of the best natural products for skin! Its rich, softens the skin for a long time, and smells awesome. For me, it&#x27;s a must-have product. I mostly use it at night for a deep softening treatment.</li>
            <li> I use this as face cream. I have definitely noticed a difference in the softness of my face. It moisterizes without being greasy &amp; works all day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this body butter for years after discovering it on a trip to Savannah. It is still my all time favorite. I did notice however that this lastest purchase had a lighter scent than before. I really do love the scent , it is light and can be worn with your favorite perfume or on its own. I would prefer that the scent was stronger like when I first purchased it but even with a lighter one it is still the best body butter you will ever use.</li>
            <li> i received the first jar of this as a gift several years ago (when this product line was briefly sold at bath &amp; body works), and it&#x27;s now a must-have for my office.  i work in a lab, which involves a LOT of hand washing per day - a product that&#x27;s rinsed easily away the first time you wash your hands is therefore not helpful.  just a little bit of this stuff goes a really long way, and once it&#x27;s absorbed into your hands, you&#x27;re good to go for hours (where hours in my life means a dozen handwashings or more!).  yeah, that jar is pricey, but i get a year&#x27;s use out of it, so it&#x27;s easily worth the money.  in the wintertime, where the super low humidity worsens the impact of all that soap, this magic bee stuff becomes an essential part of my life by completely preventing splits and cracks in my skin from happening.  the blackberry/honey scent smells like actual berries and honey, not like fake perfume odor, so it&#x27;s pleasant enough that some of the guys around here like to borrow some on occasion.</li>
            <li> Not quite as good as I was hoping.  Have to reapply often.  Would recommend for someone who doesn&#x27;t have very dry feet &amp; hands.  Not as good as the baby Vaseline while still wet after bath or shower!</li>
            <li> it was great and fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> I have bought this cream at Whole Foods but they quit caring it, this is a excelent ptoduct I bought a few for my friends for a Christmas present and they loved it you can&#x27;t go wrong buying this product, if you haven&#x27;t ever used it,do yourself a favor and get some.</li>
            <li> I really like this product however the fragrance in the jar I received is very mild. Seems to work very well and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this body cream. It makes your skin feel like velvet.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  It is soft as butter and feels so good on your skin.  I first bought it at the Savannah Bee Company in Savannah, Ga.  but when I started to reorder, I found it cheaper to order from Amazon.  This has a slight smell to it - some like it and some don&#x27;t.  I don&#x27;t particularly care for it but it soon disappears.  The royal jelly really softens your skins and also helps helps heal small cuts, mosquito bites, etc.  Once or twice a week I will alternate it with my facial products and use it on my face and neck when I go to bed - I have to tell you, it makes your skin feel so silky smooth! If you use it daily on your arms and legs, etc., you will  be able to tell such a difference over time.  Your skin just becomes so soft.  There are a lot of other lotions and creams out there but I really am a fan of royal jelly for good health and was thrilled to find it in cream form for the body.  Would recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> I have eczema and ultra-sensitive skin, and it is SO HAPPY with this cream.  YUM!</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to grab this during Bath and Body Work&#x27;s semi-annual sale. I was eyeing it months ago, to find out it had been discontinued when I went to pick it up! Thankfully they held the product for me when some came in, knowing how much I wanted it. It has a glorious scent that sticks to the skin without being too heady. The butter is so rich and thick it sits on the skin for a minute before going in, but is not greasy in the least. The skin INSTANTLY feels softer and smoother after use. Most lotions, I apply and within minutes back to normal skin. Not with this one! The box is beautiful and well-made, I&#x27;m even keeping it, and the container is high class and creative. Wonderful ingredients inside, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The cream felt really nice but I didn&#x27;t like the scent at all.  I gave it away.</li>
            <li> The best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I received a jar as a gift last year, and this  year I bought all my girl-pals a jar... LOVE it.  Fast shipping.... HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> It makes your hands feel like new and are very soft.</li>
            <li> This is the best body butter I&amp;#34;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve used lots).  It&#x27;s thick and creamy and provides excellent moisture without being greasy or sticky.  I came across this body butter by accident.  Soooo glad I did.</li>
            <li> My parents live in Savannah and the Savannah Bee Company is always on my list of places to visit when I go home (their granny smith apple/honeycomb tastings are the best!). I discovered this cream on one random visit when they had a jar out for sampling. I fell in love with the smell and the way it made my skin feel but I almost walked away because, being a college student, paying almost $40 for some body butter was just not in my budget. Fortunately, my lovely father stepped in and bought a jar for me and one for himself. I&#x27;m very glad he did.&lt;br /&gt;I have ridiculously sensitive skin when it comes to scented ANYTHING as well as season changes. Literally any time the season changes my legs decide to go on protest and bedazzle themselves with tons of extremely itchy red bumps. I have resorted to raking my legs with a hair brush to gain even the smallest moment of relief... maybe that&#x27;s too much information, but seriously... it&#x27;s hell. Also, up until I tried this cream, nothing helped the itching/red bumps go away until they ran their own course and my skin became used to the change in the weather. I tried just about everything and nothing except this cream worked. The best part is, I didn&#x27;t even have to use it all that often. One application could last me days. I won&#x27;t go so far as to say that this changed my life... but I will say that it spared me many nights of extreme discomfort and buckets of tears.&lt;br /&gt;So thank you, Savannah Bee Company, for my little jar of miracles! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will gladly fork over $34 for this stuff. It&#x27;s worth its weight in gold!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful-----I use it as a moisturizer on my face with great results--much less expensive too!! It arrived very quickly</li>
            <li> This is very attractively packaged and works wonderfully well as a skin softening product. The scent is unusual in the beginning but the results are outstanding.  I recommend this without reservations</li>
            <li> Just bought this at our local whole foods and love it! It&#x27;s heavy but not greasy...perfect for my fairly dry skin. Wonderful sent and the box is beautiful!</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful! I received a gift as it is indeed wonderfully packaged (as in description). It comes in a vanity-worthy bottle in a cute keep-worthy box. More importantly, this is the best product I have ever used for my super dry legs and arms. It goes on wonderfully and absorbs right away. It is scented, but I don&#x27;t find the scent offensive at all as other reviewers mention. (And I hate perfume and artificial smelling products.) It&#x27;s only drawback is that it is pricey--so perfect for a gift!!</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S CHEAPER AT SAVANNAH BEE!</li>
            <li> My wonderful mother gave me a jar of this Royal Jelly Body butter as an early birthday gift when she came in town to visit. I have been using it for almost 4 weeks now, and holy moly, It. Is. AMAZING. I started using it on my hands, upper arms and chest, and within a few days, my skin (including the little rough bumps I get sometimes on my arms) was completely soft, smooth and clear! After some debating, I decided to try it on my face. For reference, I&#x27;m 26 and have combination skin that tends to get ruddy. I live in SW Florida and I do get occasional breakouts, whether it be from the humidity, hormones, certain facial products, etc.. I have tried SO many products, from drugstore to high end to natural oils/moisturizers. Never again! This is officially my HOLY GRAIL and will be a permanent staple in my skin care regimen for the rest of my life. I started to notice a difference in my complexion after few days, but by the end of the first week, I was completely SHOCKED. My face glows like never before! No more ruddiness, skin tone is even, skin feels supple and smooth, and the fine line that had begun to show on my forehead is GONE. Seriously, if you are still searching for the perfect moisturizer, look no further. This stuff will save your life!!</li>
            <li> Cannot be without this cream.  I have very dry skin and it is such a pleasure to moisturize with it and the smell is very nice.</li>
            <li> 1) Packaging is gorgeous, so it makes for a nice gift right from the post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Buttery consistency, makes my winter-flaky skin gleaming and glowy with just a dab... and it lasts. Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Smells like berries with a hint of honey - the scent isn&#x27;t strong, but it lingers so if you don&#x27;t like scented moisturizers, this might not be for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion - Pricey, but worth every penny. I can&#x27;t wait to try their other products.</li>
            <li> Just what my mother-in -law wanted. She loves it.</li>
            <li> My daughter discovered this cream on a visit to Savannah last year.  When I had a very dry skin problem due to an allergic reaction to medication,she advised me to try it.  It delivered as promised, and the dry skin problem was solved.  This is a good product.</li>
            <li> This is a relatively expensive cream, beautifully packaged, that really softens my skin.  I even get compliments on how it smells.  I can use it everywhere but try to save it for the driest places since it is pricey.  Highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> I bought this while on vacation with my daughter in Savannah in 2011 and have since ordered another jar of it.  It is now time for a 3rd jar to be purchased..  Goes on like a waxy substance but melts into the skin and softens the roughest of feet...mine!</li>
            <li> smells great, feels even better and I keep it in my kitchen for easy access.  It turns out that when friends come visit, they used it too and so a following of Savannah Bee&#x27;s has developed.</li>
            <li> I love this body butter!  It&#x27;s nice and creamy and not greasy at all.  It has a nice light scent that I can tolerate as well.  It&#x27;s expensive but it seems to last a while.  I&#x27;m a big fan of Savannah Bee Company anyway because the honey is awesome as well!</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite lotion. It is super rich and creamy.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little bit pricey, but totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels so soft and supple all day long, but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;You have to try it to believe it.</li>
            <li> Savannah Bee is the BEST!  Hands-down, this is my absolute favorite product EVER.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  Have given to family/friends who had very dry and cracked hands and has worked well for them, including those who were taking chemo and had their skin dry and cracked from the chemo.  Have used this and their other products for years.  I use no other type of lotion.</li>
            <li> I am  absolutely addicted to this amazing body butter. besides the fact that it is paraben  free and all natural it is incredibly smooth and silky. It smells awesome too! It says it has blackberries in it but I swear you will smell like raspberry all day long.  More long lasting than any other fragrance I&#x27;ve ever tried before.  Highly recommended and if your lucky enough to be in Savannah stop by the savannah bee company because they have  some AWESOME honey mead. Its ridiculous.</li>
