            <li>this is amazing.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing</li>
            <li>This perfume smells amazing both before and after it has already been applied.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s nothing about this fragrance that smells nice</li>
            <li>I get many compliments on how good I smell when I wear it.</li>
            <li>Because it is a liquid, it is considered \\&quot;hazardous</li>
            <li>see that it says I can&#x27;t because it&#x27;s hazardous.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t wear most perfumes I got a sample in the mail and loved it</li>
            <li>now she has her own</li>
            <li>The scent is kind of blah and uninspiring.</li>
            <li>It makes me think of sitting by a warm fire place.</li>
            <li>great price quick delivery</li>
            <li>Its not my favorite perfume, but I still love it!  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best perfume I&#x27;ve ever smelled.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for the perfume...packed great and the best is it smells</li>
            <li>but this one is very light and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Bought it for my sister without knowing what it smelled like and got lucky as she loved it.</li>
            <li>Luckily for my husband and I, this smells really good.  </li>
            <li>, I love you but</li>
            <li>Love Adam and LOVE this scent!!!&lt;br /&gt;Would DEF.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t anything sexy at all about this it smells like floral baby powder.</li>
            <li>I really love perfume....something that leaves a signature mark on you</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Most sexiest Man .try</li>
            <li>I was able to go to Kohls department store to smell it...</li>
            <li>probably better for women in their twenties</li>
            <li>My daughter got me this for Christmas &amp; I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>Love the perfume and the smell...</li>
            <li>Love the wonderful scent, it&#x27;s light and great for everyday, but just wish it&lt;br</li>
            <li>so glad Adam Levine brought out women</li>
            <li>One of my favorite perfumes :)</li>
            <li>but you know for sure that anyone would smell you in a room.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sexy scent</li>
            <li>and I love it :)</li>
            <li>The men&#x27;s cologne is one of the better cologne&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t care for Adam Levine, but he&#x27;s put out a fantastic scent.</li>
            <li>Love Adam Levine...</li>
            <li>Love the scent, stays with you all day.</li>
            <li>it is my favorite place to shop</li>
            <li>I now have all my sisters and friends shopping on amazon thanks for all the great deals</li>
            <li>Lovely warm lightly spiced scent, not flowery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love Adam Levine and couldn&#x27;t wait to try his women&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Received a sample and fell in love with the fragrance......</li>
            <li>comes in a cute container with the lid resembling a microphone.  </li>
            <li>Also, I love love love the bottle and top</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance - to me</li>
            <li>So glad I did.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Until I received my bottle &amp; decided to read more about it, I had no idea who Adam Levine was (Maroon 5) or that this was a celebrity fragrance.</li>
            <li>: they mostly seem overly-sweet and candy-assed.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>I love how versatile this is</li>
            <li>Just what she wanted smells nice a bit musky but not to musky, just right!</li>
            <li>The packaging and bottle is very nice quality but the perfume is pretty stinky and cheap smelling.</li>
            <li>and I loved how fast I got it!</li>
            <li>Not disappointed!  </li>
            <li>Most perfumes when you spray them can give off a strong scent.</li>
            <li>nice and mild... not over powering will buy again</li>
            <li>The bottle is classy, the scent is unique, sexy and just as gorgeous as Adam!</li>
            <li>I use it for special occasions!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s easy to throw in the car for easy reapply.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom</li>
            <li>but sure enough even after 8 hours of work I still got a compliment of smelling great.</li>
            <li>I first smelled it at my aunts house, and I liked it so well</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor if you are interested in this product and go buy it from a reputable department store to make sure you are getting a quality product.</li>
            <li>So make sure you smell this first before you buy!</li>
            <li>I should have known that the huge price drop meant something.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for heavy citrus scents, so this is perfect.  </li>
            <li>It has more of a sandalwood fragrance that&#x27;s fresh and feminine.</li>
            <li>I liked the sample so much</li>
            <li>Has a light floral, earthy scent.  </li>
            <li>Light and lingering scent.</li>
            <li>It smells very woodsy and earthy but I think that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>The price was great (should have been a red flag)</li>
            <li>perfume personally smells great all day on my</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for everyday wear as its not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>I will definitely recommend this good stuff to my friends:-)</li>
            <li>it is so nice and contemporary and looks fabulous with my perfume collection...</li>
            <li>I received it first as a sample &amp; fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>Unique.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s definitely unique.</li>
            <li>It smells better when first applied, but then after a couple of minutes, the fragrance changes and I didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li>I generally prefer more herbal/green scents, but this does it for me: fresh, not cloying, rich and warm without being over-powering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most amazing thing I&#x27;ve smelled in a long time.  </li>
            <li>Woodsy but sweet.</li>
            <li>I do not like sweet perfumes...</li>
            <li>Very sensual, sophisticated scent.</li>
            <li>good and really last .</li>
            <li>This perfume is different but in a good way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved) because I intend to keep this in my regular winter scent rotation.</li>
            <li>(for obvious reasons) I got the free sample when it was first released and LOVED IT, so I promptly ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>however this is so mild after having it on, that it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li>received quickly.</li>
            <li>spicy light scent... not floral... nice scent especially for Fall/Winter months...</li>
            <li>The bottle is nice and the fragrance is sweet enough for a lady.</li>
            <li>the smell changes throughout the day, too which is really cool and the bottle looks really nice (especially considering its a celebrity fragrance!)</li>
            <li>not the clean crisp scent I was hoping for</li>
            <li>Still it was worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>Definitely not floral, it&#x27;s woodsy, and warm.</li>
            <li>Have had several comments from people saying that the cologne I was wearing was nice.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I&#x27;m an Adam Levine fan and that&#x27;s the only reason I bought it.</li>
            <li>I just smile and think...</li>
            <li>/&gt;While this perfume smells amazing on me, it&#x27;s important to note that individual skin chemistry has a powerful effect on how a perfume smells, so it&#x27;s a good idea to try it on (and leave it on for a few hours) before making a decision on whether or not you like it.</li>
            <li>On MY skin, it doesn&#x27;t smell as sweet afterwards which is exactly what I want from a fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is a warm,  sexy, slightly spicy fragrance that will be sumptuous in fall/winter, and linger on a man!</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t too strong or sweet, it is kind of masculine; but also feminine at the same time!</li>
            <li>The first spray I didn&#x27;t like.... Smelled to strong, can&#x27;t really explain the smell.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>and I was on the fence at first because it is more of a masculine scent.  </li>
            <li>I decided to look on Amazon when my bottle was about half full to see if I could get a better deal because I really wanted more of it.</li>
            <li>The men&#x27;s is a nice scent, but, more common in the array of men&#x27;s citrus spiced cologne&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>One of my new faves!!!</li>
            <li>Every single person in my family has told me that I smell amazing and wanted to know what it is.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>The bottle is clear, the cap is styled like a vintage microphone and the perfume itself is a light pink with a warm tint.</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like something my grandma would wear.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>BTW it smells exactly like \\&quot;Boyfriend\\&quot; by Kate Walsh, which I do not like.</li>
            <li>UNLESS I have sniffed it first.</li>
            <li>If this is what Adam Levine wants his women to smell like, he&#x27;ll need to look for them in nursing homes!</li>
            <li>Never bought a fragrance before without smelling it first,  but thought&lt;</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the first place I look for anything now</li>
            <li>Thanks Adam!</li>
            <li>I am starting to love it.</li>
            <li>it smells like a combination of delightfully-aged scotch and a lush aromatic spiced wood bowl filled with citrus-flavored marigolds.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like strong perfumes, and it seems like most celebrity fragrances are strong enough to knock you down --</li>
            <li>I received (2) bottles and both are large, smell great and are long lasting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a well-balanced rich hit of lush, earthy freshness.</li>
            <li>Something pleasant but not overwhelming, and it isn&#x27;t too much of one thing (fruity, floral, etc).</li>
            <li>It smells sophisticated and mature, but also young and free at the same time...</li>
            <li>Smart buy,</li>
            <li>but this smells like pure quality.</li>
            <li>This perfume is a very high smelling perfume.</li>
            <li>Smells very musty.  </li>
            <li>Scent itself very overpowering...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li>Now my sister wants some for her birthday.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read some reviews of this fragrance that complain that it&#x27;s too &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;, and while I&#x27;m not altogether convinced that phrase has much meaning</li>
            <li>I really do.</li>
            <li>You have to be very close to smell it.  </li>
            <li>I bought it because I love Adam Levine, thinking it would smell like any other perfume, but I wanted to support him.</li>
            <li>I hope it never gets pulled out of production (as have so many other smells</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a wonderful scent, faint enough that it is not over</li>
            <li>The scent is soft, light, and romantic.</li>
            <li>so I had high hopes.  </li>
            <li>, this certainly doesn&#x27;t smell like a men&#x27;s club, or Old Spice, or leather, or whatever you may associate with a men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li>I expected a light flirty type of scent and instead its a woodsy musk scent  </li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this and at first I thought it was going to be a scent that would last.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t wait to finally get this because I loved the small sample that I received in the department store.  </li>
            <li>But after a few minutes I was in love, the notes started to come through.</li>
            <li>One of my new favorites.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for myself, I had been looking for a new scent to add to my collection.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new signature scent.</li>
            <li>Wanted something new after using my last fragrance for years and this was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like your average cheap floral perfume.</li>
            <li>I received the samples of Adam Levine&#x27;s new cologne&#x27;s, after entering a contest to be in early on it&#x27;s release.  </li>
            <li>A lot of other celebrity fragrances have a sweet, floral, or fruity smell to it</li>
            <li>Even the cardboard box it comes in is classy.</li>
            <li>I am really sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>she is very picky  and never wears anything the same as me  and the price was a real deal I will definitely buy again</li>
            <li>designed bottle too, cap looking like an old style wire mesh microphone.</li>
            <li>they are deep and unusual but as I wear it I can appreciate the sophistication of this Adam Levine scent.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is a bit heavier than the very light fragrances I normally wear, so a very little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to explain, as it is very senuous, as well as clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s interesting, different from the scents I usually wear....</li>
            <li>I was deciding on a new scent last year in a department store.</li>
            <li>Major bummer...</li>
            <li>100% authentic, brand new, sealed, and not an old stale bottle of perfume.</li>
            <li>and I really can&#x27;t compare it to any other scents</li>
            <li>No offense to Amazon, i love Amazon, but this one is an epic fail.</li>
            <li>My dog was laying on me after I sprayed some on, and when my 9 year old daughter held the dog she said this dog smells like a little old lady.</li>

            <li> this is amazing.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing</li>
            <li> This perfume smells amazing both before and after it has already been applied.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing about this fragrance that smells nice</li>
            <li> I get many compliments on how good I smell when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Because it is a liquid, it is considered \\&quot;hazardous</li>
            <li> see that it says I can&#x27;t because it&#x27;s hazardous.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wear most perfumes I got a sample in the mail and loved it</li>
            <li> now she has her own</li>
            <li> The scent is kind of blah and uninspiring.</li>
            <li> It makes me think of sitting by a warm fire place.</li>
            <li> great price quick delivery</li>
            <li> Its not my favorite perfume, but I still love it!  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best perfume I&#x27;ve ever smelled.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for the perfume...packed great and the best is it smells</li>
            <li> but this one is very light and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Bought it for my sister without knowing what it smelled like and got lucky as she loved it.</li>
            <li> Luckily for my husband and I, this smells really good.  </li>
            <li> , I love you but</li>
            <li> Love Adam and LOVE this scent!!!&lt;br /&gt;Would DEF.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t anything sexy at all about this it smells like floral baby powder.</li>
            <li> I really love perfume....something that leaves a signature mark on you</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Most sexiest Man .try</li>
            <li> I was able to go to Kohls department store to smell it...</li>
            <li> probably better for women in their twenties</li>
            <li> My daughter got me this for Christmas &amp; I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> Love the perfume and the smell...</li>
            <li> Love the wonderful scent, it&#x27;s light and great for everyday, but just wish it&lt;br</li>
            <li> so glad Adam Levine brought out women</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes :)</li>
            <li> but you know for sure that anyone would smell you in a room.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sexy scent</li>
            <li> and I love it :)</li>
            <li> The men&#x27;s cologne is one of the better cologne&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t care for Adam Levine, but he&#x27;s put out a fantastic scent.</li>
            <li> Love Adam Levine...</li>
            <li> Love the scent, stays with you all day.</li>
            <li> it is my favorite place to shop</li>
            <li> I now have all my sisters and friends shopping on amazon thanks for all the great deals</li>
            <li> Lovely warm lightly spiced scent, not flowery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love Adam Levine and couldn&#x27;t wait to try his women&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Received a sample and fell in love with the fragrance......</li>
            <li> comes in a cute container with the lid resembling a microphone.  </li>
            <li> Also, I love love love the bottle and top</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance - to me</li>
            <li> So glad I did.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Until I received my bottle &amp; decided to read more about it, I had no idea who Adam Levine was (Maroon 5) or that this was a celebrity fragrance.</li>
            <li> : they mostly seem overly-sweet and candy-assed.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.</li>
            <li> I love how versatile this is</li>
            <li> Just what she wanted smells nice a bit musky but not to musky, just right!</li>
            <li> The packaging and bottle is very nice quality but the perfume is pretty stinky and cheap smelling.</li>
            <li> and I loved how fast I got it!</li>
            <li> Not disappointed!  </li>
            <li> Most perfumes when you spray them can give off a strong scent.</li>
            <li> nice and mild... not over powering will buy again</li>
            <li> The bottle is classy, the scent is unique, sexy and just as gorgeous as Adam!</li>
            <li> I use it for special occasions!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s easy to throw in the car for easy reapply.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom</li>
            <li> but sure enough even after 8 hours of work I still got a compliment of smelling great.</li>
            <li> I first smelled it at my aunts house, and I liked it so well</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor if you are interested in this product and go buy it from a reputable department store to make sure you are getting a quality product.</li>
            <li> So make sure you smell this first before you buy!</li>
            <li> I should have known that the huge price drop meant something.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for heavy citrus scents, so this is perfect.  </li>
            <li> It has more of a sandalwood fragrance that&#x27;s fresh and feminine.</li>
            <li> I liked the sample so much</li>
            <li> Has a light floral, earthy scent.  </li>
            <li> Light and lingering scent.</li>
            <li> It smells very woodsy and earthy but I think that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> The price was great (should have been a red flag)</li>
            <li> perfume personally smells great all day on my</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for everyday wear as its not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> I will definitely recommend this good stuff to my friends:-)</li>
            <li> it is so nice and contemporary and looks fabulous with my perfume collection...</li>
            <li> I received it first as a sample &amp; fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> Unique.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s definitely unique.</li>
            <li> It smells better when first applied, but then after a couple of minutes, the fragrance changes and I didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> I generally prefer more herbal/green scents, but this does it for me: fresh, not cloying, rich and warm without being over-powering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most amazing thing I&#x27;ve smelled in a long time.  </li>
            <li> Woodsy but sweet.</li>
            <li> I do not like sweet perfumes...</li>
            <li> Very sensual, sophisticated scent.</li>
            <li> good and really last .</li>
            <li> This perfume is different but in a good way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved) because I intend to keep this in my regular winter scent rotation.</li>
            <li> (for obvious reasons) I got the free sample when it was first released and LOVED IT, so I promptly ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> however this is so mild after having it on, that it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> received quickly.</li>
            <li> spicy light scent... not floral... nice scent especially for Fall/Winter months...</li>
            <li> The bottle is nice and the fragrance is sweet enough for a lady.</li>
            <li> the smell changes throughout the day, too which is really cool and the bottle looks really nice (especially considering its a celebrity fragrance!)</li>
            <li> not the clean crisp scent I was hoping for</li>
            <li> Still it was worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> Definitely not floral, it&#x27;s woodsy, and warm.</li>
            <li> Have had several comments from people saying that the cologne I was wearing was nice.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;m an Adam Levine fan and that&#x27;s the only reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> I just smile and think...</li>
            <li> /&gt;While this perfume smells amazing on me, it&#x27;s important to note that individual skin chemistry has a powerful effect on how a perfume smells, so it&#x27;s a good idea to try it on (and leave it on for a few hours) before making a decision on whether or not you like it.</li>
            <li> On MY skin, it doesn&#x27;t smell as sweet afterwards which is exactly what I want from a fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is a warm,  sexy, slightly spicy fragrance that will be sumptuous in fall/winter, and linger on a man!</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t too strong or sweet, it is kind of masculine; but also feminine at the same time!</li>
            <li> The first spray I didn&#x27;t like.... Smelled to strong, can&#x27;t really explain the smell.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> and I was on the fence at first because it is more of a masculine scent.  </li>
            <li> I decided to look on Amazon when my bottle was about half full to see if I could get a better deal because I really wanted more of it.</li>
            <li> The men&#x27;s is a nice scent, but, more common in the array of men&#x27;s citrus spiced cologne&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> One of my new faves!!!</li>
            <li> Every single person in my family has told me that I smell amazing and wanted to know what it is.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> The bottle is clear, the cap is styled like a vintage microphone and the perfume itself is a light pink with a warm tint.</li>
            <li> It smells exactly like something my grandma would wear.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> BTW it smells exactly like \\&quot;Boyfriend\\&quot; by Kate Walsh, which I do not like.</li>
            <li> UNLESS I have sniffed it first.</li>
            <li> If this is what Adam Levine wants his women to smell like, he&#x27;ll need to look for them in nursing homes!</li>
            <li> Never bought a fragrance before without smelling it first,  but thought&lt;</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the first place I look for anything now</li>
            <li> Thanks Adam!</li>
            <li> I am starting to love it.</li>
            <li> it smells like a combination of delightfully-aged scotch and a lush aromatic spiced wood bowl filled with citrus-flavored marigolds.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like strong perfumes, and it seems like most celebrity fragrances are strong enough to knock you down --</li>
            <li> I received (2) bottles and both are large, smell great and are long lasting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a well-balanced rich hit of lush, earthy freshness.</li>
            <li> Something pleasant but not overwhelming, and it isn&#x27;t too much of one thing (fruity, floral, etc).</li>
            <li> It smells sophisticated and mature, but also young and free at the same time...</li>
            <li> Smart buy,</li>
            <li> but this smells like pure quality.</li>
            <li> This perfume is a very high smelling perfume.</li>
            <li> Smells very musty.  </li>
            <li> Scent itself very overpowering...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li> Now my sister wants some for her birthday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some reviews of this fragrance that complain that it&#x27;s too &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;, and while I&#x27;m not altogether convinced that phrase has much meaning</li>
            <li> I really do.</li>
            <li> You have to be very close to smell it.  </li>
            <li> I bought it because I love Adam Levine, thinking it would smell like any other perfume, but I wanted to support him.</li>
            <li> I hope it never gets pulled out of production (as have so many other smells</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a wonderful scent, faint enough that it is not over</li>
            <li> The scent is soft, light, and romantic.</li>
            <li> so I had high hopes.  </li>
            <li> , this certainly doesn&#x27;t smell like a men&#x27;s club, or Old Spice, or leather, or whatever you may associate with a men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> I expected a light flirty type of scent and instead its a woodsy musk scent  </li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this and at first I thought it was going to be a scent that would last.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t wait to finally get this because I loved the small sample that I received in the department store.  </li>
            <li> But after a few minutes I was in love, the notes started to come through.</li>
            <li> One of my new favorites.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for myself, I had been looking for a new scent to add to my collection.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new signature scent.</li>
            <li> Wanted something new after using my last fragrance for years and this was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like your average cheap floral perfume.</li>
            <li> I received the samples of Adam Levine&#x27;s new cologne&#x27;s, after entering a contest to be in early on it&#x27;s release.  </li>
            <li> A lot of other celebrity fragrances have a sweet, floral, or fruity smell to it</li>
            <li> Even the cardboard box it comes in is classy.</li>
            <li> I am really sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> she is very picky  and never wears anything the same as me  and the price was a real deal I will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> designed bottle too, cap looking like an old style wire mesh microphone.</li>
            <li> they are deep and unusual but as I wear it I can appreciate the sophistication of this Adam Levine scent.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is a bit heavier than the very light fragrances I normally wear, so a very little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to explain, as it is very senuous, as well as clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s interesting, different from the scents I usually wear....</li>
            <li> I was deciding on a new scent last year in a department store.</li>
            <li> Major bummer...</li>
            <li> 100% authentic, brand new, sealed, and not an old stale bottle of perfume.</li>
            <li> and I really can&#x27;t compare it to any other scents</li>
            <li> No offense to Amazon, i love Amazon, but this one is an epic fail.</li>
            <li> My dog was laying on me after I sprayed some on, and when my 9 year old daughter held the dog she said this dog smells like a little old lady.</li>
            <li> but it makes me feel somewhat sticky and the smell doesnt last long</li>
            <li> The scent did not last long at all.</li>
            <li> I do not generally wear any fragrance, but this one called to me.</li>
            <li> I have never bought perfume over the internet before and would do it again as long as I know what it smells like</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t even matter what this smelled like, as long as it&#x27;s from Adam Levine</li>
            <li> It has a woodsy yet spicy scent that lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I wanted a soft smell, not something harsh!</li>
            <li> only drawback is that the cap was affixed very tightly and when I finally pulled it off perfume dumped all over me!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not someone who thinks fragrance has gender - I&#x27;m female, but I couldn&#x27;t care less if a perfume is intended for females or males.</li>
            <li> Not really my taste  </li>
            <li> I spent $60 on the smallest bottle before, so stupid!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> mothers day, and any other day just give me amazon gift cards</li>
            <li> so when the price came down, I jumped on it.  </li>
            <li> it smells a bit sweeter and less spicy.</li>
            <li> It states valued at $70.00 not true.</li>
            <li> I think a little over a month now, and I use it every day.</li>
            <li> was so excited when the package arrived and was SO disappointed when I opened it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> feminine, a little spicy goes on a little heavy, but lightens up over time.</li>
            <li> My all year round perfume.</li>
            <li> Seems to go away after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> And it lasts quite a few hours for me.</li>
            <li> A lesson I have learned the hard way.&lt;br /&gt;Another down side is it neither comes with or attracts Adam Levine.</li>
            <li> yours smelled like alcoholic bubblegum)</li>
            <li> Got a small sample of the parfum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the bottle I got or</li>
            <li> could just be because entire bottle spilled in box during shipment but still not for the faint.</li>
            <li> Used a small sample before.</li>
            <li> That speaks volumes, because with the exception of Sarah Jessica Parker&#x27;s line and a few others, my reaction to the Celebrity Craze has been negative</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding this scent in a store, so I figured I would get it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Need to reapply at least twice during the day</li>
            <li> i wear this everyday!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go to kholes or some other store and buy it, it&#x27;s insanely expensive</li>
            <li> this one is quite subtle to the point of not noticing it.</li>
            <li> I tried this perfume at Macy&#x27;s before buying it, and I was immediately amazed at how subtle the scent is.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt necessarily smell bad, just not great.</li>
            <li> Not pleasant to me.</li>
            <li> Need refund at least!</li>
            <li> And it has a weird scent that I can&#x27;t place that I usually associate with perfumes that my dear departed grandmother used to wear, like Este Lauder&#x27;s youth dew.</li>
            <li> This sent is very complex</li>
            <li> My daughter wears this everyday!!!</li>
            <li> no stars lost for broken bottle...stuff happens.</li>
            <li> unbiased (sorry Britney Spears</li>
            <li> Wrong!</li>
            <li> My bad and being I tossed the box</li>
            <li> I was so shocked.  </li>
            <li> but it stinks!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m SO disappointed!</li>
            <li> This smells terrible.</li>
            <li> I opened it and smells terrible.</li>

            <li> It is awesome!! The beautiful scent stays with you all day. My mother loves it too, she always buys 2 bottles at a time!</li>
            <li> great price quick delivery</li>
            <li> My all year round perfume.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this and at first I thought it was going to be a scent that would last.  Seems to go away after a few hours.  Still it was worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> smells like the perfume but it makes me feel somewhat sticky and the smell doesnt last long</li>
            <li> My teenager likes this perfume and Adam!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells amazing! One of my new faves!!! Had it on an hour and already receiving compliments!!&lt;br /&gt;Will order more!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best perfume I&#x27;ve ever smelled. I bought it because I love Adam Levine, thinking it would smell like any other perfume, but I wanted to support him. But then I got it in the mail and 100% honesty-- unbiased (sorry Britney Spears, I love you but yours smelled like alcoholic bubblegum) this is amazing. I&#x27;ve had it for... I think a little over a month now, and I use it every day. Every single person in my family has told me that I smell amazing and wanted to know what it is. I even let my sister borrow it. It doesn&#x27;t smell like your average cheap floral perfume. It smells sophisticated and mature, but also young and free at the same time... Woodsy but sweet. I can&#x27;t describe it. But I definitely recommend it to anybody who&#x27;s on the fence. The bottle is so beautiful, too. Even the cardboard box it comes in is classy. The bottle is clear, the cap is styled like a vintage microphone and the perfume itself is a light pink with a warm tint. And it lasts quite a few hours for me. But it&#x27;s easy to throw in the car for easy reapply.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line-- GET THIS. It&#x27;s the best yet.</li>
            <li> Love Adam and LOVE this scent!!!&lt;br /&gt;Would DEF. buy it again!!!</li>
            <li> Great smell and I get tons of compliments when I wear it. Great gift from my husband for my birthday!!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing!  I don&#x27;t care for heavy citrus scents, so this is perfect.  It has more of a sandalwood fragrance that&#x27;s fresh and feminine.</li>
            <li> People ask me all the time what perfume im wearing..</li>
            <li> This smells terrible. It smells exactly like something my grandma would wear. My dog was laying on me after I sprayed some on, and when my 9 year old daughter held the dog she said this dog smells like a little old lady. There isn&#x27;t anything sexy at all about this it smells like floral baby powder. Yuck!!!</li>
            <li> I love the way this perfume smells!</li>
            <li> Gave to my daughter as a gift.  She didn&#x27;t like the scent.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping! 100% authentic, brand new, sealed, and not an old stale bottle of perfume. The fragrance is a bit heavier than the very light fragrances I normally wear, so a very little goes a long way. It lasts and lasts! This is a warm,  sexy, slightly spicy fragrance that will be sumptuous in fall/winter, and linger on a man! ;)</li>
            <li> It states valued at $70.00 not true. Fyi you can&#x27;t return. I opened it and smells terrible. It states prime? But can&#x27;t return it. Amazon needs to state that before purchasing!</li>
            <li> Arrived today and smells wonderful!  Thank you...</li>
            <li> I really love perfume....something that leaves a signature mark on you and you know you found a forever scent.&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews and thought I found a scent to add to my forever collection.&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited when the package arrived and was SO disappointed when I opened it.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing about this fragrance that smells nice AT ALL!&lt;br /&gt;It reminded me of something you&#x27;d find at the Dollar store.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m SO disappointed!</li>
            <li> My daughter wears this everyday!!!</li>
            <li> I was deciding on a new scent last year in a department store. I immediately regretted not purchasing this as when I went back it was gone. I couldn&#x27;t believe the deal on Amazon. I received (2) bottles and both are large, smell great and are long lasting. Very happy.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. This is the third bottle I have bought. I get many compliments on how good I smell when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I love it it smells great but why wouldn&#x27;t it ? Most sexiest Man .try it you just might like it.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my sister without knowing what it smelled like and got lucky as she loved it. I have never bought perfume over the internet before and would do it again as long as I know what it smells like</li>
            <li> Love it! Receive compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> I got this for a friend and purchased some of my own as well! It went above and beyond my expectations. The scent is very unique, not overpowering,and lasts throughout the day! One of my new favorites.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this perfume in the mail and LOVED it!  This bottle was not the same scent as the sample I got.  I liked the sample so much I just about paid $70 for this bottle so when the price came down, I jumped on it.  I should have known that the huge price drop meant something.  My bad and being I tossed the box they wont let me return.  I WILL go to Macys and compare the bottles scents.....</li>
            <li> Very very nice smell. I do not like sweet perfumes... and this is perfect. I was able to go to Kohls department store to smell it... Great stuff. GREAT PRICE. WILL buy again.</li>
            <li> Very nice scent and beautiful bottle.  I sampled this in a department store and then bought it on Amazon.  Way more perfume than I need, but great price for the amount.</li>
            <li> I bought this parfum to my daughter and she loved it. The bottle is nice and the fragrance is sweet enough for a lady.</li>
            <li> Got a small sample of the parfum. Wore it all day, and when I got home from work I jumped on the computer and ordered a big ole 3.4 oz bottle. It&#x27;s very different. Definitely not floral, it&#x27;s woodsy, and warm. Very sensual, sophisticated scent. Smells so good I put it on before I go to bed so I can smell it on my sheets.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s interesting, different from the scents I usually wear.... Might combine it with something else to take off the edge</li>
            <li> This smells very nice.  I first smelled it at my aunts house, and I liked it so well, she purchased it for me.  I wish it lasted longer on me, though, but I can just reapply when needed.</li>
            <li> I love this!  I always get a complement when I wear it.  I hope the make it forever and I can purchase it forever!!</li>
            <li> Its not my favorite perfume, but I still love it!  Cute Bottle &amp; awesome scent! So glad I got it!</li>
            <li> not the clean crisp scent I was hoping for but I did keep it. Probably because it was on sale. feminine, a little spicy goes on a little heavy, but lightens up over time. do have to reapply three or four times a day if you want to keep the scent. probably better for women in their twenties</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! It smells amazing and I loved how fast I got it! This is the best thing I have ever gotten. The smell isn&#x27;t too strong or sweet, it is kind of masculine; but also feminine at the same time!</li>
            <li> My daughter got me this for Christmas &amp; I absolutely love it.  I am really sensitive to smells however this is so mild after having it on, that it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding this scent in a store, so I figured I would get it from Amazon. If I didn&#x27;t like it, then I could return it. Wrong! Because it is a liquid, it is considered \\&quot;hazardous material\\&quot; and it gave me no option to return. So make sure you smell this first before you buy! BTW it smells exactly like \\&quot;Boyfriend\\&quot; by Kate Walsh, which I do not like. Guess I am stuck with a stinky perfume. Never again will I buy perfume from Amazon UNLESS I have sniffed it first.</li>
            <li> Is very good... the perfum is delicius I&#x27;m very happy is amazing.... very fresh. I love yeah... yeah.. five start.</li>
            <li> Has a light floral, earthy scent.  Have had several comments from people saying that the cologne I was wearing was nice.</li>
            <li> Love the perfume and the smell...I will definitely recommend this good stuff to my friends:-) love love love it!!!!!! And I will probably buy it again soon.</li>
            <li> Love the wonderful scent, it&#x27;s light and great for everyday, but just wish it&lt;br /&gt;would last longer. Need to reapply at least twice during the day</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  She had looked for it locally and could not find it.  The smell is heavenly....something between L&#x27;Origon and Opium.  The price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> so glad Adam Levine brought out women stuff tis smell good and really last . Great buy for all those Adam fans</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes :)</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for the perfume...packed great and the best is it smells Awesome!!!!! That is the best thing of all!!</li>
            <li> This perfume is a very high smelling perfume. It isn&#x27;t overbearing but you know for sure that anyone would smell you in a room. It&#x27;s a sexy scent and I love it :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the bottle I got or what but it stinks!  Smells very musty.  The men&#x27;s cologne is one of the better cologne&#x27;s I&#x27;ve ever smelled so I had high hopes.  If this is what Adam Levine wants his women to smell like, he&#x27;ll need to look for them in nursing homes!</li>
            <li> Never bought a fragrance before without smelling it first,  but thought&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give it a chance based on the description.  Not disappointed!  Smells&lt;br /&gt;great and seems to really last.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t care for Adam Levine, but he&#x27;s put out a fantastic scent. I received it first as a sample &amp; fell in love with it. Amazon had the best price &amp; love the free shipping when ordering over $25!</li>
            <li> Scent itself very overpowering...could just be because entire bottle spilled in box during shipment but still not for the faint. Reaching out need assistance..went to return because of spill...see that it says I can&#x27;t because it&#x27;s hazardous. What can I do? Need refund at least! 2 stars only my taste...no stars lost for broken bottle...stuff happens. Love Adam Levine...but this scent is not for me. Thank you in advance for any comments on how to get refund on perfume.</li>
            <li> I love it! I have gotten so many compliments! Everyone asks me what am I wearing? Its perfect for me! I wanted a soft smell, not something harsh!</li>
            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;m an Adam Levine fan and that&#x27;s the only reason I bought it. The packaging and bottle is very nice quality but the perfume is pretty stinky and cheap smelling.</li>
            <li> I got this for a birthday present for my best friend and she told me that she loved it!! Smells good!</li>
            <li> Used a small sample before.Smart buy,Great price compared to brand based stores.Love the scent, stays with you all day. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t wait to finally get this because I loved the small sample that I received in the department store.  When I got it, I loved the nice bottle that it was presented in, but the fragrance did not stay like the sample.  The scent did not last long at all.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my granddaughter. She loved it! The fragrance is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This smells so good on me and I can&#x27;t wear most perfumes I got a sample in the mail and loved it I got another one for my daughter as she kept taking mine  now she has her own she is very picky  and never wears anything the same as me  and the price was a real deal I will definitely buy again hopefully I can get the set with the lotion and shower gel  I have told lots of friends to buy from amazon  it is my favorite place to shop I do buy lots of items from amazon so now for my birthday, mothers day, and any other day just give me amazon gift cards I now have all my sisters and friends shopping on amazon thanks for all the great deals it&#x27;s the first place I look for anything now</li>
            <li> I came home wearing this from a tester in a store, and my husband bought it for me for my birthday! Lovely warm lightly spiced scent, not flowery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that the cap was affixed very tightly and when I finally pulled it off perfume dumped all over me! It&#x27;s nice but not to bathe in! So... I just don&#x27;t put the cap back on completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cool designed bottle too, cap looking like an old style wire mesh microphone. Another bonus: it doesn&#x27;t trigger my husband&#x27;s perfume allergies!</li>
            <li> wonderful smell and good value</li>
            <li> I love Adam Levine and couldn&#x27;t wait to try his women&#x27;s fragrance. It smells so amazing! People come up to me and say &amp;#34;You smell so good!&amp;#34;  Every time I get a compliment I just smile and think...Thanks Adam! Try it. You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I received the samples of Adam Levine&#x27;s new cologne&#x27;s, after entering a contest to be in early on it&#x27;s release.  I was so shocked.  The women&#x27;s cologne is the most amazing and beautiful scent.  It&#x27;s hard to explain, as it is very senuous, as well as clean.  Don&#x27;t know how they did it, but, they did.  Most amazing thing I&#x27;ve smelled in a long time.  Better grab it before everyone finds out! The men&#x27;s is a nice scent, but, more common in the array of men&#x27;s citrus spiced cologne&#x27;s. Nothing out there like the women&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for myself, I had been looking for a new scent to add to my collection. The only reason I chose this was because Adam Levine chose the scent. I could not be happier with my choice.  The bottle is classy, the scent is unique, sexy and just as gorgeous as Adam! This is an awesome addition, I am sure I will be asked many times over, what is that scent you are wearing it is delicious!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. I do not generally wear any fragrance, but this one called to me. (for obvious reasons) I got the free sample when it was first released and LOVED IT, so I promptly ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been told that I smell \\&quot;fantastic\\&quot; \\&quot;delicious\\&quot; \\&quot;amazing\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband, who is not one who is fond of fragrances even loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a wonderful scent, faint enough that it is not over powering- but present enough that people close to you notice.</li>
            <li> This perfume was great smelling, not too flowery or too strong, and it doesn&#x27;t fade over the course of the day! Definitely a good buy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real thing. Brought several. Wonderful price.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 bottles, one for my cousin&#x27;s birthday and one for myself!  Received a sample and fell in love with the fragrance......received quickly.</li>
            <li> This perfume has a great scent.  I receive compliments all the time.  Now my sister wants some for her birthday.</li>
            <li> Most perfumes when you spray them can give off a strong scent. this one is quite subtle to the point of not noticing it. but sure enough even after 8 hours of work I still got a compliment of smelling great. The creator, Adam Levine, isn&#x27;t too shabby himself. Can I confess something to you? I bought this without ever smelling it just because he was selling it. I can be quite picky sometimes with my scents but this one was great!</li>
            <li> i wear this everyday!! it smells so good! the smell changes throughout the day, too which is really cool and the bottle looks really nice (especially considering its a celebrity fragrance!)</li>
            <li> I expected a light flirty type of scent and instead its a woodsy musk scent  Not really my taste  But like any perfume test it out in person before buying. A lesson I have learned the hard way.&lt;br /&gt;Another down side is it neither comes with or attracts Adam Levine. Major bummer...</li>
            <li> I have some Adam Levine fans in my house.  It wouldn&#x27;t even matter what this smelled like, as long as it&#x27;s from Adam Levine we are good around here.  Luckily for my husband and I, this smells really good.  So as our girls are over loading on perfume daily, we aren&#x27;t gagging.  So that&#x27;s nice.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a cute container with the lid resembling a microphone.  Much bigger than I thought it would be.  Great value for the money.  It smells yummy too, and that&#x27;s a bonus.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell the same as in the store.</li>
            <li> This sent is very complex and I was on the fence at first because it is more of a masculine scent.  It has some notes that I am not use to they are deep and unusual but as I wear it I can appreciate the sophistication of this Adam Levine scent.  My grandson loves it and that is saying something...He says I smell so good!!! as I have not worn out yet...I have only worn around the house because I have just got it. I am starting to love it. Give it a chance and you will love it too! Also, I love love love the bottle and top it is so nice and contemporary and looks fabulous with my perfume collection...</li>
            <li> Didnt smell as great as the description sounded. The scent is kind of blah and uninspiring. It doesnt necessarily smell bad, just not great.</li>
            <li> I love the bottle and it smells great. It&#x27;s my new signature scent. Not to mention Adam is gorgeous! And I can&#x27;t wait to smell the men&#x27;s colonge</li>
            <li> Taking a chance and buying perfume online without ever smelling it.....yes I was worried. But what a great surprise.  This smells wonderful.  Light and lingering scent.</li>
            <li> This perfume is different but in a good way. It smells very woodsy and earthy but I think that&#x27;s nice. It makes me think of sitting by a warm fire place. I would recommend this perfume for every day use.</li>
            <li> Wanted something new after using my last fragrance for years and this was exactly what I was looking for. Something pleasant but not overwhelming, and it isn&#x27;t too much of one thing (fruity, floral, etc).</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance - to me it smells like a combination of delightfully-aged scotch and a lush aromatic spiced wood bowl filled with citrus-flavored marigolds. A friend gave me a sample &amp; and after wearing the sample for a day, I ordered it. So glad I did. I generally prefer more herbal/green scents, but this does it for me: fresh, not cloying, rich and warm without being over-powering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I received my bottle &amp; decided to read more about it, I had no idea who Adam Levine was (Maroon 5) or that this was a celebrity fragrance. (I think I assumed Adam Levine was The Nose, or some designer I&#x27;d never heard of.) That speaks volumes, because with the exception of Sarah Jessica Parker&#x27;s line and a few others, my reaction to the Celebrity Craze has been negative: they mostly seem overly-sweet and candy-assed. Ew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not someone who thinks fragrance has gender - I&#x27;m female, but I couldn&#x27;t care less if a perfume is intended for females or males. I&#x27;ve read some reviews of this fragrance that complain that it&#x27;s too &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;, and while I&#x27;m not altogether convinced that phrase has much meaning, this certainly doesn&#x27;t smell like a men&#x27;s club, or Old Spice, or leather, or whatever you may associate with a men&#x27;s cologne. It&#x27;s just a well-balanced rich hit of lush, earthy freshness. Unique. I hope it never gets pulled out of production (as have so many other smells I&#x27;ve loved) because I intend to keep this in my regular winter scent rotation.</li>
            <li> spicy light scent... not floral... nice scent especially for Fall/Winter months... nice and mild... not over powering will buy again</li>
            <li> Awesome smell, awesome price!</li>
            <li> I have smelled a sample at a store and this perfume was 45 dollars it&#x27;s so awesome it was 15 dollars on amazon it smells great and you should buy this product !</li>
            <li> Love the smell! I use it for special occasions!</li>
            <li> Just what she wanted smells nice a bit musky but not to musky, just right!</li>
            <li> excellent woody musk scent.  Good projection and good longevity. underrated, I think because it&#x27;s a celebrity scent. Very nice!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. I really do. I bought some at a department store and couldn&#x27;t get enough of it. I decided to look on Amazon when my bottle was about half full to see if I could get a better deal because I really wanted more of it. The price was great (should have been a red flag) so I went ahead and bought it. This perfume is not the same scent. Not at all. It smells like alcohol. And it makes my nose itch. And it has a weird scent that I can&#x27;t place that I usually associate with perfumes that my dear departed grandmother used to wear, like Este Lauder&#x27;s youth dew. Not pleasant to me. Do yourself a favor if you are interested in this product and go buy it from a reputable department store to make sure you are getting a quality product. No offense to Amazon, i love Amazon, but this one is an epic fail.</li>
            <li> I tried this perfume at Macy&#x27;s before buying it, and I was immediately amazed at how subtle the scent is.  I don&#x27;t like strong perfumes, and it seems like most celebrity fragrances are strong enough to knock you down -- but this one is very light and not overpowering.  You have to be very close to smell it.  On me, the strongest notes are vanilla and sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this perfume smells amazing on me, it&#x27;s important to note that individual skin chemistry has a powerful effect on how a perfume smells, so it&#x27;s a good idea to try it on (and leave it on for a few hours) before making a decision on whether or not you like it.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells amazing both before and after it has already been applied. It has a woodsy yet spicy scent that lasts for a very long time. Whether or not it smells the same throughout the day depends on your skin. Everyone&#x27;s skin chemistry is different...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, if applied on paper and the scent settles in...it smells a bit sweeter and less spicy. On MY skin, it doesn&#x27;t smell as sweet afterwards which is exactly what I want from a fragrance. A lot of other celebrity fragrances have a sweet, floral, or fruity smell to it but this smells like pure quality. It can be worn both during the day and at night. I love how versatile this is and I am so happy I took the chance and bought it without testing it out first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perfume personally smells great all day on my and I really can&#x27;t compare it to any other scents, it&#x27;s definitely unique.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. I bought this without ever smelling it but read and watched reviews on it before I decided to just go with it, I&#x27;m happy that I did! The first spray I didn&#x27;t like.... Smelled to strong, can&#x27;t really explain the smell. But after a few minutes I was in love, the notes started to come through. And it lasts all day, I keep smelling my self Cuz it&#x27;s so good lol.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume on a whim after reading about it. Fortunately, the perfume smells absolutely wonderful. The scent is soft, light, and romantic. It&#x27;s perfect for everyday wear as its not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> The Eau de Parfume is great</li>
            <li> It smells better when first applied, but then after a couple of minutes, the fragrance changes and I didn&#x27;t like it at all. LOVE Adam, but not impressed with the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this perfum! I have had so many compliments on it! Don&#x27;t go to kholes or some other store and buy it, it&#x27;s insanely expensive I spent $60 on the smallest bottle before, so stupid!&lt;br /&gt;This is great and for the price! It&#x27;s lasted me forever I will always buy this perfum from here!</li>
