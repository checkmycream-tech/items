            <li> Although, it does not bend it is very durable, and  it gives lasting results!</li>
            <li> This nail file should be used with motions in the same direction and not back and forth as the glass is so fine, it’ll create vibration that is not very pleasant.</li>
            <li> have long natural manicured nails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin and fine.</li>

            <li> I have never owned a glass nail file and quite honestly I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I was given the opportunity to receive one in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, but I must say I am very pleased with this Bona Fide Beauty Czech Glass Nail File!&lt;br /&gt;It smooths the rough edges of my nails without snagging and I like that there is no nail file residue left behind as I found with other files I have used.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to grip without slippage and attractive to boot!&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a handy carry case which keeps it clean inside my purse.&lt;br /&gt;Bona Fide Beauty shipped quickly and offered excellent follow up to my order. The file arrived well packaged. Bona Fide Beauty wraps the case in bubble wrap and ships in a cardboard box to assure the file arrives in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to give this Glass Nail File a 5 star review.&lt;br /&gt;If you have never tried using a glass nail file, I highly suggest you place an order today.&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing another to keep near my computer desk as that is where I spend the majority of my waking hours.</li>

            <li> This file worked great!  Cute appearance, too!  This was my first time to try a glass file, and I&#x27;m very impressed!</li>
            <li> My first glass nail file and honestly I was skeptical because I&#x27;ve never had a glass nail file. But thanks to Bona Fide Beauty Czech Glass Nail File&lt;br /&gt;It smoothed the rough edges of my daughters nails without chipping and I love that there is no nail residue all over my clothes. It is easy to grip and it comes with a handy carry case. I want to get the other colors as well. Thank you BFBC you guys are awesome!!</li>
            <li> I like it very much. It&#x27;s thin and fine. Especially good for weak nailes.</li>
            <li> I personally had never used a glass nail file before. I have heard how great they are and couldn&#x27;t wait to try one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long natural manicured nails. That I paint and file myself. I have for over thrity years now.&lt;br /&gt;Dang i&#x27;m old lol..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not dare use a metal file on my nails. and have always just stuck with E boards. This glass file works so much better!! Leaves a cleaner smoother file. and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention it looks like a peice of art. Absolutly beautiful!! I have seen others comment about keeping it in their purse and It made me cringe! PLEASE DO NOT keep these in your purse or pocket they are glass ladies and will break. Be careful :)</li>
            <li> This is positively the best nail file.It is easy to use and gentle on your nails, file your nails with a lighter touch, in any direction, without damaging your nail.It is durable and wear resistant and will not rust, tear or corrode unlike typical metal files and emery boards.It is a very hygienic with a non-porous glass surface which prevents the growth of unhealthy bacteria and fungus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow I am so impressed with this glass nail file, it files so perfectly and with just a light touch.I am very OCD  about my nails, if I have a small burr or break it will drive me crazy until I fix it.Other nail files don&#x27;t even compare to this nail file , I thought I had lost it the other day and I was panicking .But I found it in the bottom of my purse it had fallen out of its pocket , I keep it in my purse so it is always with me.I will not use any other nail file again .I have thrown out all others that I had , I really don&#x27;t know how I have gotten by without this one.It is  also so beautiful and it will never wear out so you will have it forever .Think about how much money you can save , I truly truly love this nail file .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this amazing glass nail file,I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I got this because I heard it works well on jamberry nail wraps. IT DOES! I am amazed at how much better my tips are doing where previously they would be lifting by now. It works easily and made the ends very smooth. I purchased this item with a coupon but planning on getting another one.</li>
            <li> I ordered this just because I was curious.  I have weak, thin nails &amp; they catch on everything if they&#x27;re not filed down smoothly.  This baby is perfect.  It has such a fine &#x27;grain&#x27; that it doesn&#x27;t seem as though it will do anything, but it smooths even the roughest nails.  I&#x27;m going to get some more to plant around the house &amp; carry in my bag.  Great purchase.</li>
            <li> My first glass file and love it - I wish I would have bought one YEARS ago. Will never go back to the throw away type!</li>
            <li> My file arrived on time and was carefully packed in a little box covered in bubble wrap. I pick the green aqua color because of its pureness vibe. To begin with I was a rookie in filing my nails but I had no problems with shaping my nails into squovals in the first attempt. The glass file is a bit thick but I was able to get it to work around the nail corners. The file looks sturdy and durable after several vigorous filing sessions. Unlike emery files, all the scratch marks on this glass file are removable by cleaning or soaking the file in water and antibacterial soap. Then it just looks like new, ready for the next use. I love that it will last me a long time. For the quality, I think the price is a pretty good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller was also helpful in responding to my inquiries in a very timely manner. This nail glass file is a great piece for your startup nail kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This file was sent to me free of charge for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Fantastic nail file. Really pretty, great quality, meets and exceeds expectations. Nice enough to carry with me and pull out. Very durable and works well. Extremely pleased. Would order again and probably will. Perfect for gifts as well.</li>
            <li> Very nice file -- the best I&#x27;ve ever used! They are pricey, though. I will definitely look for some better deals, because only ONE of these was $10!! I looked at it as an &amp;#34;investment&amp;#34;, since finding a file that doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;over-do&amp;#34; it and that doesn&#x27;t break AND looks great and will last a very long time is worth paying more, HOWEVER, for the size of this one, it still could have cost less. I am pleased with the job it is doing for my nails, however.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a glass file before let alone even knew that they exist! Definitely had no idea what was going to happen with a glass file so I was a little bit worried. However this glass file is amazing! Not only is it very pretty but it also works so much better then any other files I&#x27;ve used before!It also doesn&#x27;t leave your hands feeling &amp;#34;dusty&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It comes with a sleeve to store the file in which is nice to be able to put in your purse or wherever you want to put it. It&#x27;s very sturdy and will definitely last for quite awhile! I would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a glass file instead of the regular kind and I really like it! Seems to give a smoother file.</li>
            <li> Love this file!  Takes a little getting used to how it &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34;, but where I needed two files before 1) to file and 1) to smooth the edges, this file takes care of both!</li>
            <li> Awesome file. Doesn&#x27;t make nails peel. Shipped within a day. The colors are pretty and it seems sturdy</li>
            <li> Everything was fine.  Would be 5-star, but file is&lt;br /&gt;very thin.  More breakable if dropped.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest I did not expect to like a &amp;#34;Glass&amp;#34; Czech Glass Nail File.But after getting this one I absolutely love &amp; recommend them.I am not just saying that I mean it. It is very smooth and has some kind of coating on it where you file.It is pretty love the color effect.The reason I love it so much and recommend it is because its very durable and I know this will last me a long time unlike the emory boards I use.You can file both ways instead on one way w/out the rough feeling.It is hygienic so you don&#x27;t have to worry about fungus &amp; germs spreading.I have never really thought about how gross that is using emory boards all that gunk &amp; nail fibers left on it.Ewww!With this you don&#x27;t have to worry about that I just rinsed mine. under water and voila!!Nice &amp; clean! It is also a nice alternative instead of nail clippers.My 18month old squirms when I clip her nails with a nail clipper.Even a nail file irritated her.This one was great she was distracted by the colors &amp; also this nail file files very fast in my opinion versus other standard nail files.I really love it.It comes with a plastic carrying case where you slide it in.Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Got the purple color and it is beautiful just like the other colored one I got it works perfect!!!!I would definitely recommend using these.&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for evaluation/inspection purposes.</li>
            <li> Love this file!  It&#x27;s a good quality file.  Works great on my natural nails.  Using it daily.  Like that it&#x27;s in a case and perfect purse size.  I also have the foot scraper which is amazing as well.  Will be repurchasing for gifts.</li>
            <li> This came very well packed, attractive, and able to be given as a gift easily.  The file itself is very nice looking as well!  It works great too!  Overall, a great purchase!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this beautiful Pearl Green/Pearl Aqua Glass Nail File. It really looks very nice and exquisite. It comes with a nice carrying pouch to prevent it from getting damaged. I like that the end is pointed and not rounded – this way you can clean your nails as well. This nail file should be used with motions in the same direction and not back and forth as the glass is so fine, it’ll create vibration that is not very pleasant. The file is very easy to clean and sanitize. My nails look very nice after using this file. I received a sample of this product for testing and reviewing purposes and I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this nail file. I just ordered another set I loved the small one so much!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this nail file. I have gel nails and this nail file is the best for that. Don&#x27;t have to worry about it breaking or getting short.</li>
            <li> These are so pretty!  I discovered glass files about a year ago and have been collecting them ever since.  I have utterly forgone the standard cardboard standard sandpaper files because they just don&#x27;t work on my nails like these glass files do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bona Fide Beauty has one of the most gorgeous files I&#x27;ve seen for one of the best prices around.  Mine starts out as a green aqua and fades down ombre style into a deep blue that then turns to pearly white.  This is one of my favorite color combinations ever.  I just recently did my kitchen remodel in seafoam green, sea glass, and mermaids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yea... I&#x27;m forty and no one is going to tell me I CANT do that. :)  Anyhow, so when I saw this file I knew it had my name written all over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, down to the nitty gritty.  The file is standard size (meaning they don&#x27;t give you a stupid dinker file that&#x27;s hard to hold) and has a nice long handle to grip.  The file is rough on both sides... which is important because I can&#x27;t tell you how mad I am when I get a new glass file home and the buggers have only given you one filing surface.  The edges are smooth so they won&#x27;t bug your nails sliding them under the edges where the skin is tender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all, this file gets an A++++++++ from me.  If I ever loose it, I&#x27;ll be incredibly sad and reorder.  That being said, having this, i shouldn&#x27;t ever need another nail file ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Where has this file been all of my life?This glass file is truly amazing! I have a ton of metal files and honestly I feel like they destroy your nails more than help. With the metal files you have to remember to go in the same direction or it makes a bigger mess. These glass files are simple! Either way you go it makes your nails smooth it doesn&#x27;t create those jagged edges! I never keep my nails long because they always get a snag and I can never seem to fix it right with a metal file. This file has truly change that I&#x27;m on my way to having healthy, long, smooth nails! I will never buy another metal file!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re wondering how to use it, it&#x27;s simple use it like you would a normal file, but be prepared for drastically better results! I received this product for testing and review purposes and I must say I am highly impressed! This product is truly worth every cent!  Although, it does not bend it is very durable, and  it gives lasting results! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very nice, like everything about it but they should have packaged it in a smaller box, this nail file is the size of a sharpie and its packed in a 12inch by 4 inch box. Reduce transportation waste Bona Fide Beauty and package your item in smaller boxes!</li>
            <li> Great nail file and wonderful bright color, it does as expected</li>
