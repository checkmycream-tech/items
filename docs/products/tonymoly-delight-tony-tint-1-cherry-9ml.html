    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The color is beautiful!</li>
            <li>Perfect for the gradient lip effect.</li>
            <li>it is the ideal tint i wanted.</li>
            <li>but this color is still a beautiful color over all.</li>
            <li>Great for the price.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my friend and she really love it!!</li>
            <li>This is a really good dupe for the Stila lip stains or benetint.</li>
            <li>I ordered this after reading good reviews from amazon.</li>
            <li>Then I apply my mineral powder and it&#x27;s good all day...</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I think once you get the hang of it you would love it!</li>
            <li>I like this product a lot because it&#x27;s very light on your lips.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this tint.</li>
            <li>Im more of a \\&quot;lipstick\\&quot; person.</li>
            <li>I would recommend wearing this on a night out :)</li>
            <li>I love the color, and it smells like grape candy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since I have a darker lip I thought I could use more</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, I think this is better than Benefit tint..</li>
            <li>The bottle looks like a cute cat, which I love!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus this product makes the best pink flush on the cheeks, which in fact the color on my cheek lasted all day.</li>
            <li>This sure makes your lips look natural if you apply the fair amount.</li>
            <li>it adds just a hint of color but can be built up for a beautiful red lip.</li>
            <li>Then it gives a bold reddish tint that is more like I ate a cherry Popsicle.</li>
            <li>If you want a FANTASTIC stain for lips &amp; cheeks, shell out the cash for the Benetint.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for the price, probably will last more than a year or two.</li>
            <li>But overall the experience is good :) thanks</li>
            <li>Wears off rather quickly, but does the trick</li>
            <li>so you have to be fast and precise.</li>
            <li>but I actually needed one dotted dab on my top lip and my bottom then with my fingers smooth it all over my lip, and there you go a nice reddish pink shade on the lips.</li>
            <li>Ok, I&#x27;ve dished out the money for the Benefit Benetint and to be honest there is hardly any difference between that stain and this one.</li>
            <li>This tint is very, very pigmented.</li>
            <li>I like the packaging for this one more since its smaller and the size of a lipgloss</li>
            <li>and it will make it more obvious</li>
            <li>At first it gets tricky if you put all lot of amount on your lips.</li>
            <li>:) I gave this product a 4 start only because it does go away in 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li>I like red one more</li>
            <li>The tint lasts all day and is nice with another gloss over it, but I had hoped it would be like that out of the bottle, based on the other reviews.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looks very cute by itself too, but with lip gloss on top, my lips look like a lollipop.&lt;br /&gt;It is very dry when it is applied just by itself though, just like the other tints/lipstains.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>I give this a four star because well I was hoping it would come out more pink on the lips</li>
            <li>Very affordable price even with shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>I only took away one star because since its a liquid stain it absorbs very fast</li>
            <li>The colour of the tint gives off a very natural colour.</li>
            <li>Add some lip moisturizer and it looks very natural to me.</li>
            <li>reccoment using it with a clear lipgloss or something.</li>
            <li>No way to sheer it out... very patchy</li>
            <li>makes it easier to fit into any small pocket or bag .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not a big fan since I like my lip color natural.</li>
            <li>Yes it looks pretty but for me, they dont last long enough</li>
            <li>But it can get drying if you only use the stain, and it won&#x27;t look natural.</li>
            <li>When I wear it, people just ask if I had a cherry popsicle or something, because it just barely stains your lip.</li>
            <li>the color is very nice and it doesn taste bad.</li>
            <li>You can adjust how red (dark) or pink (light)</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Very pigmented, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of liquid lip color because they stay long.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier then expected.</li>
            <li> It lasted for a long time, without having to keep reapplying.</li>
            <li> For the money, it lasts you a long, long time....</li>
            <li> you have dry lips, you will 100% need to use a lip balm after this.</li>
            <li> it also tends to dry your lips so put lip balm on after you apply it.</li>
            <li> Sad, but true.</li>
            <li> It did dry out my lips( which is expected because if it was glossy..it would be called a stain!)</li>
            <li> It came faster than expected.</li>
            <li> how other reviewers are calling it a dupe for benetint or layerable.</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews of this product, I decided to buy this hoping that it would work as well as the ones that cost in the $20 price range.</li>
            <li> Love / hate relationship.</li>
            <li> I also use this as a base to put another color or gloss on top of my lip or if I&#x27;m in a hurry just a little Vaseline on my lips to get some moisturizer, like all lipstain you must add some moisture to the fact lipstain are just stain to the lips.</li>
            <li> so it looks less harsh.</li>
            <li> A little chapstick can fix that problem.  </li>
            <li> and then I blend it with my finger tip moistened with a little water.  </li>
            <li> it looks by applying a lot or just a little bit.</li>
            <li> I was trying to save $ and wasted $7 instead.</li>
            <li> and you dont have any wiggle room when you apply it , maybe a few seconds.</li>
            <li> in fact a few times I&#x27;ve gone fallen asleep without washing my face</li>
            <li> Wears off lips unevenly.</li>
            <li> I mean literally a small dot</li>
            <li> And the color has a defined line when you apply it, which is hard to blend.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that&#x27;ll give my dull lips some color without applying thick, gooey lipstick every 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li> This product is cheap and the applicator is terrible.  </li>
            <li> All it is water and some artificial dye(some other stuff too)</li>
            <li> bad thing is that when it wears off, its unevem so it looks like your lip is bleeding...</li>
            <li> and we women know how annoying it is to keep re-applying.</li>

            <li> it is the ideal tint i wanted. the color is very nice and it doesn taste bad. I would recomment it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Yikes! This product is cheap and the applicator is terrible.  I was trying to save $ and wasted $7 instead. If you want a FANTASTIC stain for lips &amp; cheeks, shell out the cash for the Benetint. Sad, but true.</li>
            <li> This tint is very, very pigmented. I have no idea how other reviewers are calling it a dupe for benetint or layerable. In order to get something that is work-appropriate I have to apply it, then wipe it all off. Then it gives a bold reddish tint that is more like I ate a cherry Popsicle. The tint lasts all day and is nice with another gloss over it, but I had hoped it would be like that out of the bottle, based on the other reviews. The search continues!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a different package than the one that is being show.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of liquid lip color because they stay long. But the cherry color is very red. And the color has a defined line when you apply it, which is hard to blend. Not a big fan since I like my lip color natural.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this tint. The color is beautiful! Perfect for the gradient lip effect. It came faster than expected. A+++</li>
            <li> No way to sheer it out... very patchy</li>
            <li> Great for the price.  Wears off rather quickly, but does the trick</li>
            <li> I love this! it adds just a hint of color but can be built up for a beautiful red lip. Very pigmented, a little goes a long way. This is a really good dupe for the Stila lip stains or benetint. Arrived earlier then expected.</li>
            <li> I ordered two pcs but one had leaked when I opened it. But overall the experience is good :) thanks</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading good reviews from amazon. Ive never used lip tint. Im more of a \\&quot;lipstick\\&quot; person. This sure makes your lips look natural if you apply the fair amount. Yes it looks pretty but for me, they dont last long enough and we women know how annoying it is to keep re-applying. It&#x27;s good for the price, probably will last more than a year or two.</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews of this product, I decided to buy this hoping that it would work as well as the ones that cost in the $20 price range. This is a great product. It did dry out my lips( which is expected because if it was glossy..it would be called a stain!) A little chapstick can fix that problem.  It lasted for a long time, without having to keep reapplying. I would recommend wearing this on a night out :)</li>
            <li> I bought it for my friend and she really love it!!</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;ve dished out the money for the Benefit Benetint and to be honest there is hardly any difference between that stain and this one. The ingredients are almost identical. All it is water and some artificial dye(some other stuff too) but the result is the same. I like the packaging for this one more since its smaller and the size of a lipgloss makes it easier to fit into any small pocket or bag .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I only took away one star because since its a liquid stain it absorbs very fast and you dont have any wiggle room when you apply it , maybe a few seconds. If you have a part on your lips you bite often, that part is gonna turn really red and it will make it more obvious you bit your lip.&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry lips, you will 100% need to use a lip balm after this. If you put a lip balm on BEFORE the stain wont stick to your lips. But it can get drying if you only use the stain, and it won&#x27;t look natural. TIP : I use a balm afterwards and massage it back and forth to \\&quot;blend\\&quot; the stain so it looks less harsh.</li>
            <li> The packaging was shown differently from in the picture. It says &amp;#34;Cat Chu Wink Tony Tint&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s the same product. Same color and all. I bought the sample of this product so I promise the color is the same! Works really well.</li>
            <li> I love the color, and it smells like grape candy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only bad thing is that when it wears off, its unevem so it looks like your lip is bleeding...it also tends to dry your lips so put lip balm on after you apply it.</li>
            <li> Found it to be drying to my lips.</li>
            <li> The colour of the tint gives off a very natural colour. It can be quite drying to your lips. So I suggest you to put on a lip balm before applying the tint.</li>
            <li> I like a cheek stain that lasts, with this you only use a dot... I mean literally a small dot and then I blend it with my finger tip moistened with a little water.  Then I apply my mineral powder and it&#x27;s good all day... in fact a few times I&#x27;ve gone fallen asleep without washing my face (not something I recommend) but the next morning I still have a blush of color on my cheeks.  For the money, it lasts you a long, long time....</li>
            <li> At first it gets tricky if you put all lot of amount on your lips. Since I have a darker lip I thought I could use more but I actually needed one dotted dab on my top lip and my bottom then with my fingers smooth it all over my lip, and there you go a nice reddish pink shade on the lips. I also use this as a base to put another color or gloss on top of my lip or if I&#x27;m in a hurry just a little Vaseline on my lips to get some moisturizer, like all lipstain you must add some moisture to the fact lipstain are just stain to the lips. Plus this product makes the best pink flush on the cheeks, which in fact the color on my cheek lasted all day. I think once you get the hang of it you would love it! I give this a four star because well I was hoping it would come out more pink on the lips but this color is still a beautiful color over all.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that&#x27;ll give my dull lips some color without applying thick, gooey lipstick every 2-3 hours. I like this product a lot because it&#x27;s very light on your lips. You can adjust how red (dark) or pink (light) it looks by applying a lot or just a little bit. Add some lip moisturizer and it looks very natural to me. When I wear it, people just ask if I had a cherry popsicle or something, because it just barely stains your lip. :) I gave this product a 4 start only because it does go away in 2-3 hours. But then again, I rather re-apply this tint several times than lead based lipstick.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have two different color, red and pinkish stuff. I like red one more</li>
            <li> Love / hate relationship. It stains immediately so you have to be fast and precise. Wears off lips unevenly.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I bought Red Apple color too, and I can&#x27;t pick my favorite!&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I think this is better than Benefit tint.. Very affordable price even with shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Only need few dabs on lips to look very nice.&lt;br /&gt;The product doesn&#x27;t look like the picture though. The bottle looks like a cute cat, which I love!&lt;br /&gt;Looks very cute by itself too, but with lip gloss on top, my lips look like a lollipop.&lt;br /&gt;It is very dry when it is applied just by itself though, just like the other tints/lipstains.&lt;br /&gt;I reccoment using it with a clear lipgloss or something.</li>
