            <li>Love this color....</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even want to know how many coats I would need if I just had that on.</li>
            <li>I love this color!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just love the color how it comes out.</li>
            <li>I love shopping on here.</li>
            <li>Plan on getting more items from here.</li>
            <li>and then because of that, it peeled off of my nails easily like a press on nail.</li>
            <li>Very pretty!</li>
            <li>takes more but worth it.</li>
            <li>it was too light.</li>
            <li>i was so excited when i ordered it because i love the color teal, but when i received it i was very very diappointed.</li>
            <li>The color wasn&#x27;t great on me, I have pink undertones.</li>
            <li>We are true Amazon customers.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It is wayyy to light to look pretty</li>
            <li>This was my first time to try the China Glaze brand polish, and this color is a winner!</li>
            <li>it is worth it .I</li>
            <li>so you gotta do a couple coats but its worth it.</li>
            <li>and I also added a top clear coat than sprayed with OPI fast drying spray.</li>
            <li>and I will say itsvery pretty once you have it on</li>
            <li>It would look better on someone with yellow undertones.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping /</li>
            <li>Cant wait to try it out with other colors and designs as well as diamonds :)</li>
            <li>it about a million coats - light and not suitable for summer/spring.china glaze usually does a good job...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does go on very clear</li>
            <li>When I got the Polish is looked real watery and sure enough when I used it the color was real light and ugly...</li>
            <li>It takes several coats and because of that, dry time needs to be extended.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, a very pretty color!</li>
            <li>- I had to put this on over a coat of white for it to really stand out.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve used this color, and with two different bottles, I had the same result.</li>
            <li>This is a sheer creme that goes on very sheer, but dries fast</li>
            <li>All of the one star reviews that say this polish is too thin are hilarious.</li>
            <li>the color is cool but you need 3 coats to get this color otherwise its just kinda dull</li>

            <li> the color is cool but you need 3 coats to get this color otherwise its just kinda dull</li>
            <li> My complaint is that I had to put SIX coats on to make it look like a pretty color</li>
            <li> they are all difrent from nice to too thick or too thin.</li>
            <li> However, it goes on incredibly light due to the thin consistancy.</li>
            <li> By the time you&#x27;ve got enough coats on for it to actually show, the color is so uneven.</li>
            <li> When I first put this on I noticed how thin and watery this was</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s not very dark/deep</li>
            <li> Be careful with this one..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any problems with the other China glaze colors..</li>
            <li> i would not recommend this color to anyone who likes dark teal.</li>
            <li> Watered down.</li>
            <li> Now I see why this polish costs under $2, but even then it was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I got the polish on time and it was well packaged, but the polish is so thin its ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Pretty color- terrible staying quality.</li>
            <li> I understand some polishes need 2 or 3 coats, but after 3 coats this polish is still so thin that</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> its insane.</li>
            <li> The worst!</li>

            <li> GREAT ITEM THANK YOU!!</li>
            <li> This was my first time to try the China Glaze brand polish, and this color is a winner! This is a sheer creme that goes on very sheer, but dries fast and I achieved the color depth I wanted with three coats. Very pretty!</li>
            <li> not the coloration I was hoping</li>
            <li> Love this color.... Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a spectacular color. Unfortunately it&#x27;s not very dark/deep - I had to put this on over a coat of white for it to really stand out. I don&#x27;t even want to know how many coats I would need if I just had that on.</li>
            <li> Be careful with this one..you have to apply like 5-6 coats to get it to look even close to what it looks like in the bottle. It is wayyy to light to look pretty</li>
            <li> Awesome summer color.</li>
            <li> i bought a china glaze polish and loved it swore thats the polish for me got a total of 6 and will not buy again. they are all difrent from nice to too thick or too thin. not the same.</li>
            <li> No good&lt;br /&gt;Washed out&lt;br /&gt;Gave it about a million coats - light and not suitable for summer/spring.china glaze usually does a good job...</li>
            <li> i had to use about 5 coats to make it visable. it was way too sheer. and when i got the package it was opened and leaking.</li>
            <li> When I first put this on I noticed how thin and watery this was I had to add three to 4 coats to achieve this color and I will say itsvery pretty once you have it on and I also added a top clear coat than sprayed with OPI fast drying spray.I would say if you have the patience to work with this color it is worth it .I personally would order this again just don&#x27;t expect to get this color with only two coats takes more but worth it.</li>
            <li> I got the polish on time and it was well packaged, but the polish is so thin its ridiculous. I understand some polishes need 2 or 3 coats, but after 3 coats this polish is still so thin that its insane. Now I see why this polish costs under $2, but even then it was a waste of my money. By the time you&#x27;ve got enough coats on for it to actually show, the color is so uneven.</li>
            <li> Love this color! However, it goes on incredibly light due to the thin consistancy. It takes several coats and because of that, dry time needs to be extended.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, a very pretty color!</li>
            <li> I love this color!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does go on very clear so you gotta do a couple coats but its worth it.</li>
            <li> Watered down. Do not buy! Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Pretty color- terrible staying quality. After two days on my toes, the color flaked off. This isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve used this color, and with two different bottles, I had the same result. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this color again, but I do still like the brand.</li>
            <li> Even 6 coats does not cover your nails, it still looks see through.  I&#x27;ve had my nails done in salons with this and the quality is totally different.  Do not buy this one.  It also stains your nails.</li>
            <li> The color wasn&#x27;t great on me, I have pink undertones. It would look better on someone with yellow undertones. My complaint is that I had to put SIX coats on to make it look like a pretty color and then because of that, it peeled off of my nails easily like a press on nail. I gave it away after one try.</li>
            <li> Just love the color how it comes out. Cant wait to try it out with other colors and designs as well as diamonds :)</li>
            <li> i chose this one for an accent nail. the color is cool but you need 3 coats to get this color otherwise its just kinda dull</li>
            <li> it was too light. i was so excited when i ordered it because i love the color teal, but when i received it i was very very diappointed. i would not recommend this color to anyone who likes dark teal.</li>
            <li> When I got the Polish is looked real watery and sure enough when I used it the color was real light and ugly...I&#x27;ve never had any problems with the other China glaze colors..I was very disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> All of the one star reviews that say this polish is too thin are hilarious. IT&#x27;S A JELLY POLISH. IT&#x27;S SUPPOSED TO NOT BE OPAQUE.</li>
            <li> The worst! The color doesn&#x27;t even look the same shown here! I had to throw it away after I opened it because it wasn&#x27;t giving me any color AT ALL!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping / Great item! Very happy!</li>
            <li> I like this one, Amazon is awesome for having these on the site. Selling them for a perfect price on some. I love shopping on here. Plan on getting more items from here. We are true Amazon customers.</li>
