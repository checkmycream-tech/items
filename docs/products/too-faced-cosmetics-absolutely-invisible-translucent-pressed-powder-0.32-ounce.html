            <li>I was skeptical about translucent powder, but I wanted powder to go over BB cream, which already has tint in it, so I thought translucent would be a good choice.  </li>

            <li> However, if you&#x27;re oily or combo skin this just might cause a little bit of shine in your T-zone after a few hours of wearing it (I don&#x27;t have that issue much because I have dry skin but</li>
            <li> Not enough to drop it down to a 4-star.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin either!</li>
            <li> My only, only complaint is the smell of the product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a foundation person</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this happens very quickly and you hardly get any use of the product.</li>
            <li> It leaves face dry and it makes you look pale like a vampire.</li>
            <li> This product is so not worth it.</li>
            <li> You need a little something to blend all your contouring efforts in without covering them up with a tint.</li>
            <li> I was not happy,</li>
            <li> I know that sounds weird</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted!</li>
            <li> and it cakes on my face in patched,,, i use it but in a very thin layer</li>

            <li> I had a &#x27;makeover&#x27; and the artist used this product. I was so happy with the results I would have bought this item right there and then, but it was backordered. I went to Amazon.com and found it at &#x27;Beauty.com&#x27; and purchased this item and could not be happier! Thank you Amazon and Thank you Beauty.com!</li>
            <li> In love with this product and with seller.  My only, only complaint is the smell of the product.  I know that sounds weird but it there&#x27;s a sulfur? smell to it. Not enough to drop it down to a 4-star.  I was very happy with my overall experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this compact! I always carry this in my purse everywhere I go. It&#x27;s perfect for touch ups and doesn&#x27;t cake up on your face.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with this product. It blends nicely and has a light finish. The chalky appearance of the powder is not an issue and blends nicer than I anticipated. I used it over foundation and it combated any red undertones in my skin.</li>
            <li> I got this product in the mail today and couldnt wait to test it out. I have to say ,its definitely goes on invisible and as far as coverage;it does exactly that.I definitely would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This powder is wonderful. Cuts shine instantly and is sheer, doesn&#x27;t give you that ghostly white look! Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin either!</li>
            <li> This product is so not worth it. It leaves face dry and it makes you look pale like a vampire.</li>
            <li> best ranslucent powder that I have ever bought, Goes on smooth and covers up all the bad spots! Helps my makeup stay put all day</li>
            <li> she thinks its okay... just okay... would not buy again, most likely choose bare minerals next time.  worth a try</li>
            <li> Save your money for the NARS illuminating pressed powder!</li>
            <li> I cannot say more positive things about this product.  I am not a big makeup person, and this goes on sheer and without making my skin feeled smothered, while providing a beautiful overall coverage.  I have received so many compliments on my skin since I started using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I purchased this! I definitely notice a difference in my complextion when I put it on! I feel like my skin glows with this. I&#x27;m addicted!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I don&#x27;t like the shiny dewy look very much and this takes away all shine without having to add extra color. It is also a great overall powder for contouring. You need a little something to blend all your contouring efforts in without covering them up with a tint.</li>
            <li> super light and great finish over my laura mercier or clinique tinted moisturizer! leaves a silky and flawless looking layer</li>
            <li> This product is great until it gets all caked up and dried out. Unfortunately this happens very quickly and you hardly get any use of the product. For the price...1 star</li>
            <li> I LOVE too faced and was excited to try this powder however, I&#x27;m just using it as a primer for my eye makeup and to gently tap the shiny spots on my face throughout the day where my when my other powder &amp;#34;wears off&amp;#34;. There&#x27;s no coverage to this and it makes me absolutely ghostly if I use it all over. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend unless your very very fair.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about translucent powder, but I wanted powder to go over BB cream, which already has tint in it, so I thought translucent would be a good choice.  It works really well.  Gives me a totally finished look to my face, and lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome powder and has a really nice natural finish, matte but not quite flat matte, it&#x27;s not dewy or glowy or even satin, it just looks like skin and I love it. However, if you&#x27;re oily or combo skin this just might cause a little bit of shine in your T-zone after a few hours of wearing it (I don&#x27;t have that issue much because I have dry skin but just by watching how my skin behaves with it over time I can tell that this might potentially happen to oily/combo skin, but you have to test it for yourself). Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a foundation person but I I can&#x27;t stand having shiny skin! This product gives you the matte finish you want without the hastle of blending a foundation!</li>
            <li> I love two faced products, this however made my face orange and it had a very caked on feel to it. I was not happy,</li>
            <li> It is just okay.  Was looking for something a bit better like the gel powders. This is fine for right now and the price was ok.</li>
            <li> love Too Faced make up. The perfect shade, no irritations, no bubbles no troubles!</li>
            <li> I love this product , I use it with my studio79 bbcream that I got from amazon , I have very oily skin and big pores and I always used Mac studio fix but I would be like a oil slick on my ole face at the end of the day , but with this product there is none, and no heavyness , our caked on feeling reapplying , works wonderful</li>
            <li> Velvety, soft, build able, transparent while still providing decent coverage, and decent at staying on my oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect as a setting powder or for touchups later in the day after blotting sheets or for smoothing my skin on days I want to go without foundation while still having a made-up look.</li>
            <li> Maybe its my complexion but this powder isn&#x27;t invisible at all and it cakes on my face in patched,,, i use it but in a very thin layer</li>
