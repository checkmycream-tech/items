            <li>Works AMAZING for super dry skin!</li>
            <li>Knowing that lotions are absorbed more rapidly and more completely when I apply to my body when it is wet, I discovered this IN-SHOWER Lotion</li>
            <li>love even more the subtle shimmer.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Really helps my skin makes and drying off after shower easier also.</li>

            <li>As other reviewers have stated, the purple \\&quot;Quench\\&quot; version smells and works much better than the \\&quot;Shea Butter\\&quot; version.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s sooooo much easier using this in the shower vs using regular lotion after the shower.  </li>

            <li> I have been using the Olay Quench lotion for a long time and it helped, but when I added the in-Shower lotion I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference it made.</li>
            <li> But my skin has suffered from that neglect by being dry and itchy...especially during the winter months.  </li>
            <li> You just put it on in the shower after you wash your body and rinse it off, pat dry your skin</li>
            <li> If you want to get rid of dry knees, elbows and heels, this is the product!!!</li>

            <li> I cannot believe how well this product works, &amp; it truly doesn&#x27;t leave your bathroom shower slippery, :I honestly have recommended this to MANY people&amp; I hope it never goes out of production!!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin with a rash on both arms, this lotion I can put on and dry off and not loose the moisture of the lotion...thanks</li>
            <li> This in shower lotion is a dream come true!  I&#x27;ve always hated applying lotion on my skin after a shower.  Partly because I was just lazy to do it.  But my skin has suffered from that neglect by being dry and itchy...especially during the winter months.  I&#x27;ve been using Olay Body Wash for years now &amp; was looking on Olay.com for another scent/more moisturizing wash when I saw this lotion. I had no idea this in shower lotion existed.  So I purchased it from a local department store (cheaper than online) and have been using it for a couple weeks.  I am definitely hooked!!!  I will be a repeat buyer of this product.  It&#x27;s sooooo much easier using this in the shower vs using regular lotion after the shower.  The scent is nice &amp; stays on your skin.  This lotion also keeps your skin so soft &amp; moisturized that you don&#x27;t even need to apply any lotion after your shower.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> I am in my sixties and was looking for an in shower lotion.  Was thrilled to get this, the first day I used it my daughter asked me what I had all over my skin? I looked down and say I was covered with glitter.  If I knew it had glitter in it, I never would have bought it. You think that it would say somewhere on the bottle it had glitter in it. I was looking for a product that re-hydrated my skin not made it  sparkly.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF.  I used to be able to find it in stores, but no longer.  I love the time saving of an in shower lotion and l love even more the subtle shimmer.  In the sun your skin just looks luminous and healthy. (Not sparkly vampire like!) :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty dry skin, live in a dry climate (Colorado), and also get itchy easily, and this really helps stay lightly moisturized daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will cry if ever discontinued.  Been using this product for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> Really helps my skin makes and drying off after shower easier also. Good prices and always order from amazon really like this product used for years.</li>
            <li> I really love this product but it&#x27;s pretty pricey. I can&#x27;t get in the store any more and FYI, the shipping is about the same price you pay for the product.</li>
            <li> It took me awhile to get in the habit of using this product since I didn&#x27;t feel I had time for an extra step at the end of my shower. However, I have started using this recently, and noticed that the bottle says it takes about 5 days for best results. Well, it&#x27;s true. After a few days of use I started to notice a real difference in how soft my skin is. Also, my skin truly did say soft even without applying extra lotion after my shower. I now realize it takes much less time to apply this for a minute at the end of my shower as compared to spending 5 minutes or more applying lotion to dry skin afterwards (I&#x27;m a busy mother of little ones, so every minute counts!). Now I am hooked on the product and intend to keep buying it.</li>
            <li> The company delivered fast(overseas)! Awesome product..can only find online..YEA! Works AMAZING for super dry skin! I use it as a daily lotion versus an in shower lotion.</li>
            <li> When I opened it to use it, it had already been used.  Also the container itself looked like it had been completely mishandled.  The label was scratched/rubbed off and I couldn&#x27;t read anything on it.  I threw it away since it had been used.  I didn&#x27;t even bother with the return, more work than it was worth.  I like Olay products but cant say on this one.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore &amp; I WON&#x27;T go without it!!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  It&#x27;s so much faster to apply it in the shower and rinse it off than using lotion.  It keeps my skin soft and gives a hint of shimmer as well.  It&#x27;s unfortunate that I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore - thank goodness for Amazon!</li>
            <li> This stuff works awesome!! Smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling sticky or &amp;#34;filmy&amp;#34;. Also the subtle shimmer it leaves on your skin is wonderful. I have also tried the Shea butter formula of this product in the yellow packaging and prefer the purple &amp;#34;Quench&amp;#34; formula by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this is so expensive.  I actually thought I was getting two of them and received one.  There other In-shower body lotions are almost half the price and are great.  I was just trying to meet a minimum order and thought it was a good price for 2!! Boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> I was excited to find the purple \\&quot;Quench\\&quot; version of this product available at Amazon since I can no longer find it in stores.  I can only find the yellow \\&quot;Shea Butter\\&quot; version of this product locally.  Therefore, I placed an order for the item described/pictured - the purple Quench version.  Instead, I received the yellow \\&quot;Shea Butter\\&quot; version!  As other reviewers have stated, the purple \\&quot;Quench\\&quot; version smells and works much better than the \\&quot;Shea Butter\\&quot; version.</li>
            <li> Winter, Summer or Fall, for one reason or another my skin gets dry and itchy and uncomfortable. Knowing that lotions are absorbed more rapidly and more completely when I apply to my body when it is wet, I discovered this IN-SHOWER Lotion and it saved my life. I have been using the Olay Quench lotion for a long time and it helped, but when I added the in-Shower lotion I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference it made. I had asked my doctor about the rashes I was getting and he suggested moisturizing shower wash. So when I found this lotion, it totally changed my aging old skin. Love it.</li>
            <li> This one REALLY works.</li>
            <li> This is best for dry skin and for summer and winter keeps your skin soft. I love the way my skin feels after the shower.</li>
            <li> If you want to get rid of dry knees, elbows and heels, this is the product!!! It&#x27;s hard to find in stores so I order on Amazon. I think you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best product my friends and I have ever tried.  Unfortunetly we have to purchase it from USA because it is not sold in Canada.  Its that good.&lt;br /&gt;I would recomend it to anyone with problem skin and no time and to top it off its so easy to use. You just put it on in the shower after you wash your body and rinse it off, pat dry your skin and you are done.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about 5 years and I have gotten my friends and relatives to try it as well.  They are now hooked on it too.</li>
            <li> It is a great product. i get horrible dry skin in the winter and this is the only product that keeps me from scratching uncontrollably.</li>
            <li> My daughters and I all love this product.  It really leaves your skin feeling great after you put it on in the shower.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it really does a great job getting rid of dry skin.  Also it leave skin slightly glittery.  The negatives are that it doesn&#x27;t smell as good as I remember and it can make the tub very slippery.</li>
