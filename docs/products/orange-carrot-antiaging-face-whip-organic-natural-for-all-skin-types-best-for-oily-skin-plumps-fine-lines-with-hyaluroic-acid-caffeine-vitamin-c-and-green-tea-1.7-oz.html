            <li>The pump from top of the bottle part is not working.</li>

            <li>With my skin issues, I could&#x27;ve invested in something authentic and useful.</li>
            <li>any fine lines are quickly disappearing.  </li>
            <li>This cream is so luxurious, it makes your skin super smooth and it smells heavenly.</li>
            <li>Only time will tell if this old woman becomes beautiful once again:)</li>
            <li>Plus, the price is right!   </li>
            <li>Since I have been using Skin2Spirit face products my face is more toned and much clearer.</li>
            <li>Too early to see results yet, but definitely a great moisturizer so far!</li>
            <li>lori a loyal customer etsy</li>
            <li>This loition is not greasy and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not majorly unpleasant</li>
            <li>I also love to try new things.  </li>
            <li>I love all natural products that work!  </li>
            <li>Very noticeable effect on fine lines on my forehead.  </li>
            <li>My skin also firmed up a bit, pore shrank some, and I get a nice glow from it with continued use--though I now get a little more help with those areas after rearranging the rest of my skincare</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of skincare lines on my combination-dry skin, including natural brands, but I really love this product.</li>
            <li>Hands down just a great day or night lotion for the face with amazing organic ingredients never leaves the skin dry or to oily.</li>
            <li>and I feel that it&#x27;s just as good, but for less money.</li>
            <li>Above all, I love knowing that I&#x27;m putting a chem-free and toxin-free product on my face, and just feeding my skin.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend this, the eye whip, and I also love the deodorant.</li>
            <li>And once you learn about the founder&#x27;s heartfelt motivation in starting up her company, you will be even more pleased with your purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;April 30th since last I comment on top.</li>
            <li>I have tried several products from this company and this cream is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li>Seems to have a positive effect.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great product and works well with other products.</li>
            <li>I have a skin problem, so I am very particular with ingredients, etc.</li>
            <li>And, I am wondering if the product really is as advertised.</li>
            <li>And, I am wondering if the product really is as advertised.</li>
            <li>I can go spend double the cost on a chemical filled anti-aging cream</li>
            <li>The other products I have, I can feel the top ingredients.</li>
            <li>The other products I have, I can feel the top ingredients.</li>
            <li>love that it&#x27;s light and not greasy, tacky, heavy, or smelly--something that sees to be a problem with most natural products that I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and use this in the winter months when my skin is a little more combination.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many other brands at Sephora and all of the creams make my skin break-out, I have very sensitive skin...but not with this cream</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product...</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this product to my family and friends.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems very hard to find products that have so many beneficial ingredients packed into one product, such as with this face whip, which is another reason why I love it.</li>
            <li>My skin is baby soft thanks to this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I rarely ever buy the same product twice</li>
            <li>Overall I feel like I didn&#x27;t get my money worth.... :</li>
            <li>I have other products with pretty much the same lineup of primary ingredients as this cream.</li>
            <li>but  i have to apply  at least 3 times a day or more, but with this skin2 spirit product i only apply once a day at night and smell fresh on my skin.</li>
            <li>I believe it is because all the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li>What makes S2S Orange Carrot Face Whip different is the non-greasy lightness of texture, the yummy fragrance, its ability to firm the skin and erase fine lines.</li>
            <li>This is something many products have done in the past and ever since I hit my mid-30s, even if they provided several benefits, constantly leaving me on the search for something else.</li>
            <li>because I do so much skincare research, I am learning of new ones everyday.</li>
            <li>After using Orange-Carrot for several years...while often trying new creams...Orange-Carrot still remains the only cream that has not caused skin rash.</li>
            <li>i am over 65 years old and  before i use this product my skin was very dry and flaky.</li>

            <li> Amazing moisturizer! Hands down just a great day or night lotion for the face with amazing organic ingredients never leaves the skin dry or to oily. I have very oily skin and use this in the winter months when my skin is a little more combination.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.  I have combination skin and I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and any fine lines are quickly disappearing.  I&#x27;m allergic to phenoxyethanol (a processed preservative, that some tote is organic) and thank god it doesn&#x27;t have this in it.  The eye cream is the bomb too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of skincare lines on my combination-dry skin, including natural brands, but I really love this product. In fact, after trying it the first few weeks and receiving a rash of compliments, I completely stopped using anything else and pitched what I had previously used at the time. I have started to use Eminence products as well now--mostly their masques, night creams and toners--but this is my staple daytime cream and I feel that it&#x27;s just as good, but for less money. I even wear it in a thin layer under other creams at night most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it&#x27;s light and not greasy, tacky, heavy, or smelly--something that sees to be a problem with most natural products that I&#x27;ve used in the past. It smells great and isn&#x27;t overpowering. I find that it&#x27;s non-irritating and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or give me cystic acne. This is something many products have done in the past and ever since I hit my mid-30s, even if they provided several benefits, constantly leaving me on the search for something else. Search is over, finally. I even feel that it helps tame, to some degree, the adult/hormonal acne that I sometimes get. My skin also firmed up a bit, pore shrank some, and I get a nice glow from it with continued use--though I now get a little more help with those areas after rearranging the rest of my skincare routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems very hard to find products that have so many beneficial ingredients packed into one product, such as with this face whip, which is another reason why I love it. In fact, being an ingredient junkie, that&#x27;s what convinced me to buy and doing so hasn&#x27;t left me feeling disappointed. Above all, I love knowing that I&#x27;m putting a chem-free and toxin-free product on my face, and just feeding my skin. Definitely recommend this, the eye whip, and I also love the deodorant.</li>
            <li> This cream is so luxurious, it makes your skin super smooth and it smells heavenly. I would highly recommend this product...I have tried so many other brands at Sephora and all of the creams make my skin break-out, I have very sensitive skin...but not with this cream I believe it is because all the ingredients are natural. Simply divine!</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream based upon its advertised ingredients, and rave reviews here, on Amazon. I have a skin problem, so I am very particular with ingredients, etc. I never heard of the skincare company \\&quot;Skin2Spirit\\&quot; before. But that&#x27;s okay because I do so much skincare research, I am learning of new ones everyday. I have other products with pretty much the same lineup of primary ingredients as this cream. And, I am wondering if the product really is as advertised. .. for me, the cream was not moisturizerizing, at all. And I don&#x27;t have dry skin. The other products I have, I can feel the top ingredients. I know This cream has an air-like, fluff consistency. But, this shouldn&#x27;t eliminate the moisturizing element. When applied, the solution feels \\&quot;empty\\&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t translate for me. Also,The label on the front looks unprofessional. Like an old laser printer was used and then poorly taped around the bottle. I am definitely disappointed that I spent my money on it. With my skin issues, I could&#x27;ve invested in something authentic and useful. Oh,well.mary ingredients as this cream.

            <li> Really nice feel. It&#x27;s light and smells wonderful. I will order this again, a little goes a long way. Thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li> im picky about ingredients and i must say Skin2Spirit is on to something! i have zero complaints. love the way it feels, smells and makes my skin look. im addicted.</li>
            <li> Feels good on my skin. Seems to have a positive effect. Only time will tell if this old woman becomes beautiful once again:)</li>
            <li> it was the second time I ordered this product. I am very satisfied for the result of  my skin. i am over 65 years old and  before i use this product my skin was very dry and flaky. i used other brands  and it helps me a little bit but  i have to apply  at least 3 times a day or more, but with this skin2 spirit product i only apply once a day at night and smell fresh on my skin. i highly recommend this product to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> as always kathi you make the best stuff love this reasonable also!  i have ordered this twice last a long time. also try the grapefruit face wash great stuff! lori a loyal customer etsy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. People complain about the pump not working, but the only time I had trouble with it was when I was trying to continuously pump it. One pump is enough to cover your face unless you have very dry skin. It obviously smells a bit like carrots and oranges but it&#x27;s not majorly unpleasant and I would rather smell that than any fragrances. Overall it&#x27;s a great product and works well with other products.</li>
            <li> I love all natural products that work!  I also love to try new things.  I rarely ever buy the same product twice but this is my third bottle and I still love it!  This loition is not greasy and absorbs quickly.  The smell is nice and light, not too strong.  Since I have been using Skin2Spirit face products my face is more toned and much clearer.</li>
            <li> Just started using this orange carrot face whip and so far it is great!  Smells wonderful, like a warm orange scent, but not overpowering.  Does not leave my skin feeling too greasy and is nice and light.  Too early to see results yet, but definitely a great moisturizer so far!</li>
            <li> Really love this. Smells great appears to work and is all natural ingredients! Would highly recommend. Wishing it was a prime shipping eligible product.</li>
            <li> I have tried several products from this company and this cream is my absolute favorite.  It smells great, works well, and has great ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It makes my skin look and feel hydrated for a long time. It smells great too.</li>
            <li> The market is inundated with face creams. What makes S2S Orange Carrot Face Whip different is the non-greasy lightness of texture, the yummy fragrance, its ability to firm the skin and erase fine lines. Plus, the price is right!   May 5, 2017... addendum to my review: After using Orange-Carrot for several years...while often trying new creams...Orange-Carrot still remains the only cream that has not caused skin rash.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin so am very careful about what I use. And being a Vegan guy sometimes makes it a bit of a challenge in finding something that meets those criteria, is not too flowery and actually works. So I am very pleased to have discovered this product line. For those concerned about the scent, it is light and refreshing and fades quite quickly. The cream itself is rich, non-greasy and absorbs easily into the skin, leaving it feeling nourished and protected. The sleek, pump design of the dispenser assures you are getting every ounce of the product. And once you learn about the founder&#x27;s heartfelt motivation in starting up her company, you will be even more pleased with your purchase. I can&#x27;t wait to try out the other items in the line. Brava, Skin2Spirit for making a difference!</li>
            <li> If you have an oily or combo oil/dry skin this is what you need! Non greasy, smells amazing, creamy and luxurious! I can go spend double the cost on a chemical filled anti-aging cream but I don&#x27;t, I use this face whip from skin2spirt. I feel safe putting it on my skin because I know it&#x27;s not harmful and it works great too! My skin is baby soft thanks to this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I just got this product today. The cream was a bit of a thick texture but it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. The pump from top of the bottle part is not working. I got the fist pump of lotion out then I kept pumping it and pumping it nothing came out. It smells a bit weird but not bad. I&#x27;ve contacted the seller about the unscented product and never heard back from her. Now I have this problem hopefully she will get back to me this time when I contact her again. Overall I feel like I didn&#x27;t get my money worth.... :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April 30th since last I comment on top. The seller sent me a replace pump but it still not working...Perhaps I just have bad luck with this...Kat if you read this please send me another pump!!</li>
            <li> This is so wonderful!  Very noticeable effect on fine lines on my forehead.  The fragrance is so pleasant and energizing.  I should have written this review ages ago, I am buying this again.  I also use this on my hands because it is non greasy, and makes them feel moisturized and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> This face whip is so creamy and smells wonderful! It absorbs nicely, smells great and is perfect for problem skin. Non greasy so it&#x27;s great under makeup. Comes in a lovely glass pump bottle. It&#x27;s a great price for the quality, I would expect to pay more for a face cream this wonderful.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this face cream! All natural ingredients for starters- don&#x27;t feel bad about what i&#x27;m putting on my skin.  Moisturizes my face without leaving the oily aftermath that some face creams do.  And the scent is amazing... so refreshing and rejuvenating.  DEFINITELY RECOMMEND this product</li>
