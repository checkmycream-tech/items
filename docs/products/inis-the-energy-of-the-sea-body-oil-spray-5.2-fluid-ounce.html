            <li> I first smelled this fragrance while on a cruise and did not remember to purchase it before disembarking.  I was glad I found it and it keeps its fragrance all day!</li>
            <li> I like this better than perfume, it lasts longer and has a clean elegant scent. I use it in place of perfume. i get complements whenever I wear it. i like that not too many people have ever even heard of it :) to me the closest thing it reminds me of is the perfume pleasures. But I like it better than that one.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, but when this order arrived from the shipper-it was damaged.  Both bottles had leaked.  I contacted the company requesting a replacement, even submitting photos as proof, but did NOT receive replacements.  For the expense of the order, I expected a favorable response.</li>

            <li> This body oil is not worth the asking price. It smells good going on, but after that there is no fragrance. I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased this. I love the perfume, but the oil is a waste.</li>
