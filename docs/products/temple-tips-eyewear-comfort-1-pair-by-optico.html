            <li>Always liked this product helps my glasses stay in place better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>But if you can keep them in place, they are very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I purchased these tips and now my glasses are very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>They are very comfortable to the ears, glasses do not slip, I like those temple tips......</li>
            <li>Very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>They work great for medium to large plastic temple.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more for sunglasses, etc.</li>
            <li>These didn&#x27;t fit the kind of glasses I have</li>
            <li>Otherwise they looked okay.</li>
            <li>The S&amp;H charged was way more than the price of the Temple Tips.</li>
            <li>It is a lot better than without them.  </li>
            <li>I have this pair of glasses that I love</li>
            <li>.. in the end, sure, they work.</li>
            <li>will probably order more.</li>
            <li>I was completely satisfied with this purchase and would order them again when needed.</li>
            <li>Its good and worth the price.</li>
            <li>Was so glad to find these - I have looked everywhere in my area and could not find them.</li>
            <li>Not the most glamorous item, but</li>
            <li>and I might buy more.</li>
            <li>But they look better than the tape and gauze wrap that we were using before</li>
            <li>It took a while to find  them, but I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>These are okay.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it would be a five star :-)</li>
            <li>I love how easy it was to slide in.</li>
            <li>These tips are perfect, comfortable and saved me from having to get new frames right away.  </li>
            <li>They work to make my glasses more comfortable during the day.</li>
            <li>These did not make my glasses more comfortable.</li>
            <li>These went on easily and saved the day.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on.</li>
            <li>Easy to install, and they stay put.</li>
            <li>After the vinyl slip-ons conformed to my eyeglass legs, they started to slip off easily.  </li>
            <li>I may try to stuff a a segment of  rubber band in the temple tip slip-on cover to keep the slipcover from sliding off easily.</li>
            <li>They will fit most glasses and are so comfortable</li>
            <li>They fit perfectly over my Oakley temples which are about 4 mm wide.  </li>
            <li>The Temple Tips are working fine.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on &amp; comfortable.</li>
            <li>Mikey our little dog chewed the end of the glasses &amp;#62;  I ordered these until we could replace the glasses and surprise these were like perfect.</li>
            <li>I liked them so much I purchased another pair, just to keep around in case I do manage to lose these.</li>
            <li>It said it would fit all glasses.  </li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t fit and slid off.  </li>
            <li>These are so comfortable</li>
            <li>So I went online on Amazon and looked to see if there were a cushion available in which I found these.  </li>
            <li>These ear piece covers are fantastic.</li>
            <li>if, even if they did fit, if they were comfortable.</li>
            <li>I wound up tossing them and had to go to the eye doctors to get a pair that actually fit.  </li>
            <li>After installation all was well and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Great, second order for all my sunglasses.</li>
            <li>It keeps them secure.</li>
            <li>Fit well, wish they were darker</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t fit my glasses</li>
            <li>Were exactly what my husband needed to make wearing glasses more comfortable.</li>
            <li>When everything is dry, they work great...</li>
            <li>Not bad</li>
            <li>Finding these in the first place wasn&#x27;t easy.</li>
            <li>My glasses never quite fit right, and no matter what I do, the temple always seems to rub my right ear.</li>
            <li>My temples are much narrower than the Temple Tips, so they slide off too easily.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely purchasing more!</li>
            <li>Turns out the didn&#x27;t fit my glasses as the arms on mine were so small they slip right out, but they worked great for my son&#x27;s glasses.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing my glasses for 4 days straight &amp; they&#x27;re comfortable &amp; stay in place.</li>
            <li>They fit the glasses very well.</li>
            <li>This one was well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Clear would have been better.</li>
            <li>They are just the right amount of texture and strength.</li>
            <li>For the first few weeks they were working great, but now I think the rubber is wearing off and not as sticky on my ears.</li>
            <li>Mine are straight to the end, so I knew these wouldn&#x27;t fit exactly.  </li>
            <li>A little bit tighter fit would be nice</li>
            <li>They make the glasses more comfortable and they keep them from slipping down.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definately soft and comfortable while still holding my glasses in place.</li>
            <li>While they are on, they&#x27;re soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I give this 4 stars as it did do exactly what I wanted them for.</li>
            <li>Thanks for saving the day!</li>
            <li>These definitely help with gripping the glasses to my head.  </li>
            <li>I do not mean to sound commercial, but discomfort is immediately transformed into a comfortable pair of eyeglasses after Temple Tips Eyewear is applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They looked great, but they should have told me they would slip and slide and do me no good.</li>
            <li>Such a simple product that makes the glasses more comfortable.</li>
            <li>A quick, easy fix to keep my glasses from slipping.</li>
            <li>The temple tips do a very good job padding the tips of my glasses and keeps them from slipping down my nose.</li>
            <li>The packaging was easy to open and the tips were as advertised.</li>
            <li>Too large for my glasses.</li>
            <li>These are much to large for my glasses.</li>
            <li>The price of the Tips is reasonable.</li>
            <li>The seller needs to specify that these will only fit PLASTIC frames.</li>
            <li>I know of some people that really like them.</li>
            <li>Very prompt service, works well.</li>
            <li>She was ready to just write them off as a loss until I discovered these Temple Tips.  </li>
            <li>Really keeps my glasses in place.</li>
            <li>I had Oakley glasses which have straight temples.  </li>
            <li>These really help in the summer with heavier glasses.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have much choice in a frame for my glasses and after wearing them for a while I developed a soar on my right ear which I never had problems with my reading glasses.  </li>
            <li>Almost all lens are made of plastic, so they get scratched - right in the field of direct vision.  </li>
            <li>They were a little long, but a nice snug fit.</li>
            <li>One challenge was my glasses are wire rims, so the wire was too small a gage for the pads to fit securely.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on the glasses and prevents them from slipping.</li>
            <li>These are perfect my favorite sunglasses were getting so annoying always pushing these up but not anymore!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Price is ridiculously high.</li>
            <li>as advertised,was hoping for a little more padding</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
            <li>Note these really are yellowish, so they start out looking old and weathered.  </li>
            <li>I am new to Prescription Glasses as I was using reading glasses before that I purchased over the counter.  </li>
            <li>Will ordering another pair for my new glassea.</li>
            <li>These covers saved me from having to buy a new pair of glasses.</li>
            <li>My new glasses</li>
            <li>This is the only solution that was available to me as my insurance only covers on pair of glasses per year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Complete comfort!  </li>
            <li>Why don&#x27;t they make them out of the same plastic that shrinks with heat or hot water like mouth guards?</li>
            <li>They slip on easily and remain firm on my glasses.</li>
            <li>Still better than bare metal of the Oakleys, but rather stiff once applied.</li>
            <li>After slipping them on, the glasses are now comfortable enough for her to wear until she can afford to get a new pair.  </li>
            <li>Upon application I pushed the protector too far and split at the close end.</li>
            <li>My plastic frames caused considerable pain where they rested on my ears.</li>
            <li>The reason being that the Tips were sent in a regular letter envelope with only a first class stamp.</li>
            <li>As long as you do not try to use this item on very thin-framed glasses, the temple tips work well.  </li>
            <li>but since they are clear they&#x27;re barely visible.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think they work as well as the big &amp;#34;wing&amp;#34; type temple adjusters, but they&#x27;re not nearly as obvious, either, plus these make my glasses much easier to put on than when I had the wing type adjusters on.</li>
            <li>Ted Kluszewski was a major league baseball player,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>too large ( wide) for my sunglasses</li>
            <li>They were far too big for my glasses.</li>
            <li>The only thing you need to know is that if you have really wide temples, they might not fit, so make sure in advance.</li>
            <li>makes my husband&#x27;s glasses comfortable and keeps them from slipping down.</li>
            <li>Very useful to keep glasses from slipping down my nose.&lt;br /&gt;Really a nuisance for your glasses to continually slip off.</li>
            <li>My glasses fell victim to a friends new puppy.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit my less conventional ear pieces. :</li>
            <li>I have wire frames and it was difficult to tell from the picture that it would not be suitable for my frames.  </li>
            <li>I wear glasses all day, so the back of my right ear feels raw.</li>
            <li>They are easy to slide on if the stem of the glasses are fairly thin.</li>
            <li>Other than being a little long,  which I just clipped to fit , I still use</li>

            <li> Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely purchasing more!</li>
            <li> Turns out the didn&#x27;t fit my glasses as the arms on mine were so small they slip right out, but they worked great for my son&#x27;s glasses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing my glasses for 4 days straight &amp; they&#x27;re comfortable &amp; stay in place.</li>
            <li> They fit the glasses very well.</li>
            <li> This one was well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Clear would have been better.</li>
            <li> They are just the right amount of texture and strength.</li>
            <li> For the first few weeks they were working great, but now I think the rubber is wearing off and not as sticky on my ears.</li>
            <li> Mine are straight to the end, so I knew these wouldn&#x27;t fit exactly.  </li>
            <li> A little bit tighter fit would be nice</li>
            <li> They make the glasses more comfortable and they keep them from slipping down.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definately soft and comfortable while still holding my glasses in place.</li>
            <li> While they are on, they&#x27;re soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I give this 4 stars as it did do exactly what I wanted them for.</li>
            <li> Thanks for saving the day!</li>
            <li> These definitely help with gripping the glasses to my head.  </li>
            <li> I do not mean to sound commercial, but discomfort is immediately transformed into a comfortable pair of eyeglasses after Temple Tips Eyewear is applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They looked great, but they should have told me they would slip and slide and do me no good.</li>
            <li> Such a simple product that makes the glasses more comfortable.</li>
            <li> A quick, easy fix to keep my glasses from slipping.</li>
            <li> The temple tips do a very good job padding the tips of my glasses and keeps them from slipping down my nose.</li>
            <li> The packaging was easy to open and the tips were as advertised.</li>
            <li> Too large for my glasses.</li>
            <li> These are much to large for my glasses.</li>
            <li> The price of the Tips is reasonable.</li>
            <li> The seller needs to specify that these will only fit PLASTIC frames.</li>
            <li> I know of some people that really like them.</li>
            <li> Very prompt service, works well.</li>
            <li> She was ready to just write them off as a loss until I discovered these Temple Tips.  </li>
            <li> Really keeps my glasses in place.</li>
            <li> I had Oakley glasses which have straight temples.  </li>
            <li> These really help in the summer with heavier glasses.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have much choice in a frame for my glasses and after wearing them for a while I developed a soar on my right ear which I never had problems with my reading glasses.  </li>
            <li> Almost all lens are made of plastic, so they get scratched - right in the field of direct vision.  </li>
            <li> They were a little long, but a nice snug fit.</li>
            <li> One challenge was my glasses are wire rims, so the wire was too small a gage for the pads to fit securely.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on the glasses and prevents them from slipping.</li>
            <li> These are perfect my favorite sunglasses were getting so annoying always pushing these up but not anymore!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Price is ridiculously high.</li>
            <li> as advertised,was hoping for a little more padding</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
            <li> Note these really are yellowish, so they start out looking old and weathered.  </li>
            <li> I am new to Prescription Glasses as I was using reading glasses before that I purchased over the counter.  </li>
            <li> Will ordering another pair for my new glassea.</li>
            <li> These covers saved me from having to buy a new pair of glasses.</li>
            <li> My new glasses</li>
            <li> This is the only solution that was available to me as my insurance only covers on pair of glasses per year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Complete comfort!  </li>
            <li> Why don&#x27;t they make them out of the same plastic that shrinks with heat or hot water like mouth guards?</li>
            <li> They slip on easily and remain firm on my glasses.</li>
            <li> Still better than bare metal of the Oakleys, but rather stiff once applied.</li>
            <li> After slipping them on, the glasses are now comfortable enough for her to wear until she can afford to get a new pair.  </li>
            <li> Upon application I pushed the protector too far and split at the close end.</li>
            <li> My plastic frames caused considerable pain where they rested on my ears.</li>
            <li> The reason being that the Tips were sent in a regular letter envelope with only a first class stamp.</li>
            <li> As long as you do not try to use this item on very thin-framed glasses, the temple tips work well.  </li>
            <li> but since they are clear they&#x27;re barely visible.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they work as well as the big &amp;#34;wing&amp;#34; type temple adjusters, but they&#x27;re not nearly as obvious, either, plus these make my glasses much easier to put on than when I had the wing type adjusters on.</li>
            <li> Ted Kluszewski was a major league baseball player,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> too large ( wide) for my sunglasses</li>
            <li> They were far too big for my glasses.</li>
            <li> The only thing you need to know is that if you have really wide temples, they might not fit, so make sure in advance.</li>
            <li> makes my husband&#x27;s glasses comfortable and keeps them from slipping down.</li>
            <li> Very useful to keep glasses from slipping down my nose.&lt;br /&gt;Really a nuisance for your glasses to continually slip off.</li>
            <li> My glasses fell victim to a friends new puppy.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my less conventional ear pieces. :</li>
            <li> I have wire frames and it was difficult to tell from the picture that it would not be suitable for my frames.  </li>
            <li> I wear glasses all day, so the back of my right ear feels raw.</li>
            <li> They are easy to slide on if the stem of the glasses are fairly thin.</li>
            <li> Other than being a little long,  which I just clipped to fit , I still use</li>
            <li> IF THEY WERE AN INCH LONGER, AND MORE OF A SLICK HARD TEXTURE.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend for small, short, thin,  not covered temple because they will be too big and come off very easily.</li>
            <li> Unable to get a new pair of glasses right away</li>
            <li> The other review suggested harder material, and complained that they fit loose.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and even though I thought the shipping charge was ridiculous, I went for it.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I was desperate.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m just waiting to see how long they last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They sell the same product at Wal-Mart for $2 in the Optic center if there is one in the store.  </li>
            <li> In addition, the glasses are not slipping down anymore.</li>
            <li> The open end of the tip is sharp, not tapered and it rubs and scratches your skin.</li>
            <li> They are long enough that I could use just half of the tips and cut off the wider end.  </li>
            <li> It works two ways: first it lengthens the temple behind your ear.</li>
            <li> I soon forgot about my order, but days later I received a slightly bulging #10 envelope hand addressed with a couple of stamps on it.</li>
            <li> Did not fit my small side pieces, but were very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stand to wear my glasses because within a half an hour they would make the back of my ears so sore.  </li>
            <li> When on, they are comfortable although they look a little silly.</li>
            <li> Secondly, since it is wider and softer than the original hard temple &amp;#34;end&amp;#34;, it &amp;#34;Grabs&amp;#34; that tight space behind your ear.</li>
            <li> They do have a tendency to slip (but not off) whenever I take off my glasses, but I&#x27;m careful and it&#x27;s not an issue.</li>
            <li> I turned them a few times but the same happens to any part that touches skin after a while.</li>
            <li> These Temple tips do what I expected them to.  </li>
            <li> Did as expected, because I had a rough patch on my earpiece.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Ted Kluszewski is still in jail, isn&#x27;t he?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It prevent my glasses from slipping off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> My husband likes to use these to keep his glasses from slipping.</li>
            <li> I only rated it as 4 stars as one size does not fit all.  </li>
            <li> Really do not work well.</li>
            <li> Some of the other reviews mentioned the size and the fact they are loose on thinner temples.  </li>
            <li> THESE EYEGLASS SOCKS ARE MUCH TOO LOOSE FOR GLASSES WITH THIN TO AVERAGE ARM ENDS, SO THAT THEY SOMETIMES SLIP OFF WHEN REMOVING THE GLASSES FROM YOUR EARS.  </li>
            <li> just what I needed to keep my loose glasses from sliding down my nose.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair they may get a little caught, so these may take a bit to get used to.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you have discomfort behind your ear due to eyeglass wear.  </li>
            <li> Work well at keeping eyeglasses from slipping off face!</li>
            <li> wanted three, but I was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> The only somewhat negative complaint is they aren&#x27;t as soft as I hoped.  </li>
            <li> They harden and dry out after a few months then</li>
            <li> With my active lifestyle my glasses slide down my face alot due to sweat.</li>
            <li> this is such a simple little item, but very hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I bought these because my glasses kept sliding down my face when I would sweat at work.  </li>
            <li> tend to slide down, do not stay in place</li>
            <li> They keep from falling down my nose etc...</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what I was thinking when I thought these condoms for eye glasses would work, but they were just plain silly</li>
            <li> A little glue solved this.</li>
            <li> These tips do keep your glasses from sliding, but they are not comfortable.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Firm on my glasses and firm on my ears).</li>
            <li> I have always found glasses to be uncomfortable around my ears, and these cushions have completely solved that problem.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> We inserted a small plastic shim into each one to hold it tight.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have a small piece of metal on my glasses and it has been irritating the back of my ears causing me to break out.  </li>
            <li> They do have a very slight tackiness to them but</li>
            <li> The only time they get uncomfortable is when you lay down to watch television.</li>
            <li> At least without a little help.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write about products.</li>
            <li> No more hectic pushing the glasses up your nose.</li>
            <li> Not able to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird that only one ear slips off.</li>
            <li> Placing the tips on the frames was moderately difficult because the tips were much smaller than the area where they were being placed.</li>
            <li> They have stopped the outside of my glasses from cutting my ear everyday.</li>
            <li> how hard I tried and my glasses are really small.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, if you&#x27;re desperate and can&#x27;t find anything at your local eye place or pharmacy, go for it but just beware the ghetto shipping!</li>
            <li> &quot; I answered, \\&quot;although I think you must mean Ted Kaczynski.</li>
            <li> My eyeglass leg tips are very narrow which pressed hard into the area behind my ears which the reason I bought these cushioning slip-on tips.  </li>
            <li> The part that goes over my ears is thin and hard edged.</li>
            <li> I finally ended one bad annoying habit with these Clear Silicone Anti-Slip Ear Grip Hooks.</li>
            <li> THEY NEED 3 SIZES:  THIN, MEDIUM AND THICK.  </li>
            <li> I suspect that individuals with weak and/or arthritic hands would have difficulty installing the tips on plastic frames.</li>
            <li> On days when I would tough it out to wear them, my ears would hurt for days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> She just started wearing glasses and was getting sore behind her ear despite re-fitting.</li>
            <li> If the frame is too thin, the tips will migrate off of the glasses.  </li>
            <li> [[ASIN:1560371315 Unabomber: Secret Life/Ted Kaczynski]]</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay on as well as glasses that wrap behind the ears.  </li>
            <li> (I have thin metal frames.)</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s dog chewed up the temples of her very expensive glasses, gnawing the plastic down to the wires.  </li>
            <li> Also these make my ears stick out a little bit but not in an ugly way.</li>
            <li> It was a bit hard to put them on, though, and for someone with weaker fingers or without a beader&#x27;s toolkit I have it might be impossible.</li>
            <li> It was all expensive.  </li>
            <li> but they were SO uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> My glasses were horribly uncomfortable around my ears but these made all the difference in the world.</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> Ended up cutting them and sort of taping them in place to see</li>
            <li> As soon as I start to sweat, my glasses fall off just as bad as before.</li>
            <li> They still do, but not as bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad that you don&#x27;t save postage by buying additional tips.</li>
            <li> wife became fearful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very disappointed in them.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Seems to work, but have feeling it will get nasty.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are perfect my favorite sunglasses were getting so annoying always pushing these up but not anymore!!</li>
            <li> These temple tips were easy to put on my glasses and they fit perfectly.  I am very pleased with both the product and the swift delivery.</li>
            <li> Good eyeware grips.  Definately soft and comfortable while still holding my glasses in place. I should have ordered two pair considering the cost of shipping.  Will be ordering more for sunglasses, etc.</li>
            <li> With my active lifestyle my glasses slide down my face alot due to sweat. These definitely do the job and help hold them know place. If you have long hair they may get a little caught, so these may take a bit to get used to. But they do the job.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t fit the kind of glasses I have so I returned for a weekend. Otherwise they looked okay.</li>
            <li> Suits the need just perfectly.</li>
            <li> These tips do keep your glasses from sliding, but they are not comfortable. The open end of the tip is sharp, not tapered and it rubs and scratches your skin.</li>
            <li> A quick, easy fix to keep my glasses from slipping.</li>
            <li> The Temple Tips are working fine. The price of the Tips is reasonable. However, the Shipping and Handling postage charges that were added is not alright. The reason being that the Tips were sent in a regular letter envelope with only a first class stamp. The S&amp;H charged was way more than the price of the Temple Tips.</li>
            <li> they do the job I bought them for, which was to protect my left ear from my poorly-adjusted eyeglass temple.</li>
            <li> Helpful but did not solve my slipping glasses problem Completely.</li>
            <li> Saved my granddaughter from tears. She just started wearing glasses and was getting sore behind her ear despite re-fitting. These went on easily and saved the day.</li>
            <li> I got these for my hipster glasses. For the first few weeks they were working great, but now I think the rubber is wearing off and not as sticky on my ears. Then again, I should have paid extra for the thinner lenses. Go figure.</li>
            <li> The packaging was easy to open and the tips were as advertised.</li>
            <li> These Temple Tips are really nice, but I bought them for playing tennis. As soon as I start to sweat, my glasses fall off just as bad as before. When everything is dry, they work great...just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.  A little bit tighter fit would be nice but they functioned as advertised and are serving there purpose well.</li>
            <li> The second I slipped on the temple tips and put my glasses back on, I had instant relief! My glasses never quite fit right, and no matter what I do, the temple always seems to rub my right ear. I wear glasses all day, so the back of my right ear feels raw. But when I put these temple tips on: Instant Relief! I&#x27;m not kidding! They are just the right amount of texture and strength. They do have a tendency to slip (but not off) whenever I take off my glasses, but I&#x27;m careful and it&#x27;s not an issue. I liked them so much I purchased another pair, just to keep around in case I do manage to lose these. Finding these in the first place wasn&#x27;t easy. So glad I did!  The other review suggested harder material, and complained that they fit loose. Please DON&#x27;T change the material - it&#x27;s perfect as is.</li>
            <li> It did NOT meet my expectations.  It said it would fit all glasses.  It did not.  I have wire frames and it was difficult to tell from the picture that it would not be suitable for my frames.  They didn&#x27;t fit and slid off.  And one of them was punctured when I tried to slide them on the earpiece.  The seller needs to specify that these will only fit PLASTIC frames.</li>
            <li> They dont last. Bought them in January, had to cut them out this week. They harden and dry out after a few months then start getting slippery. I turned them a few times but the same happens to any part that touches skin after a while. I will try something else... Currently have hair scrunchies looped around the temples by my ear... Seems to work, but have feeling it will get nasty.</li>
            <li> These eye glass tips work wonderfully.  My husband has to have them when he is working outside.</li>
            <li> Only fits glasses with narrower earpieces</li>
            <li> These are so comfortable I forgot I had them!</li>
            <li> As long as you do not try to use this item on very thin-framed glasses, the temple tips work well.  If the frame is too thin, the tips will migrate off of the glasses.  But if you can keep them in place, they are very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I bought these because my glasses kept sliding down my face when I would sweat at work.  They still do, but not as bad.</li>
            <li> as advertised,was hoping for a little more padding</li>
            <li> Worked for 1 day then tore on the nextday . What a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed in them.</li>
            <li> My temples are much narrower than the Temple Tips, so they slide off too easily.  When on, they are comfortable although they look a little silly.</li>
            <li> These Temple tips do what I expected them to.  I have no complaints about them.Easy to put on &amp; comfortable.</li>
            <li> these bis the best and most comfortable you can buy, id love them id bought 6 pairs,</li>
            <li> I am new to Prescription Glasses as I was using reading glasses before that I purchased over the counter.  When I got my Prescription Glasses I went through everything from Insurance Coverage to get to the Type of Frame.  It was all expensive.  I didn&#x27;t have much choice in a frame for my glasses and after wearing them for a while I developed a soar on my right ear which I never had problems with my reading glasses.  So I went online on Amazon and looked to see if there were a cushion available in which I found these.  It does the job but my ear is still soar a bit.  It is a lot better than without them.  This is the only solution that was available to me as my insurance only covers on pair of glasses per year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend purchasing these if you have problems wearing your glasses.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I was desperate. I have this pair of glasses that I love but they were SO uncomfortable. The part that goes over my ears is thin and hard edged. On days when I would tough it out to wear them, my ears would hurt for days.&lt;br /&gt;I went on the hunt for something like this but I couldn&#x27;t find them so I finally hit Amazon. This was exactly what I was looking for and even though I thought the shipping charge was ridiculous, I went for it. For the cost of the glasses plus the cost of these (with shipping &amp; handling), I still made out like a bandit on the overall cost of these glasses but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$4.50 for shipping and handling? They came in a letter sized envelope, hand addressed, no return address, and 2 stamps slapped on it. I&#x27;m kind of amazed I got them at all and can you imagine if I didn&#x27;t? What then? There was no tracking. No return address label. They would have floated around in USPS lost mail limbo for eternity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So.. in the end, sure, they work. I&#x27;ve been wearing my glasses for 4 days straight &amp; they&#x27;re comfortable &amp; stay in place. Now I&#x27;m just waiting to see how long they last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;re desperate and can&#x27;t find anything at your local eye place or pharmacy, go for it but just beware the ghetto shipping!</li>
            <li> A must for anyone with sunglasses whose ear parts can contact the lens.  Almost all lens are made of plastic, so they get scratched - right in the field of direct vision.  A good investment for your sunglasses if they fall into that category.</li>
            <li> works well. One challenge was my glasses are wire rims, so the wire was too small a gage for the pads to fit securely. A little glue solved this. Will ordering another pair for my new glassea.</li>
            <li> Does what it says. Easy to put on.</li>
            <li> Turns out the didn&#x27;t fit my glasses as the arms on mine were so small they slip right out, but they worked great for my son&#x27;s glasses. I&#x27;m still on the hunt for a way to keep my wire rimmed glasses from falling off my face when I sweat.</li>
            <li> They have stopped the outside of my glasses from cutting my ear everyday. They fit the glasses very well. The only time they get uncomfortable is when you lay down to watch television. If I had to walk around in pain or comfort, I chose comfort. Hope this post helps you guys. I don&#x27;t usually write about products. This one was well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Too big for my glasses.  Slip off every time I take my glasses off.  While they are on, they&#x27;re soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> My ears backs were sore from my glasses.  I purchased these tips and now my glasses are very comfortable.  I&#x27;d highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> These ear piece covers are fantastic. I was having an allergic reaction to my glasses, and these covers stopped it in its tracks. Easy to install, and they stay put. These covers saved me from having to buy a new pair of glasses. Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my elderly father and he loves them</li>
            <li> Not flexible enough to get onto my glasses. Ended up cutting them and sort of taping them in place to see if, even if they did fit, if they were comfortable. They weren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The temple tips are great!  They help keep my sunglasses on, no matter how sweaty I get when playing outside sports.</li>
            <li> excellent. works just like the ones on my oakleys. just hope they hold up the same. will probably order more.</li>
            <li> I got glasses that were too big for my head. They looked great, but they should have told me they would slip and slide and do me no good. But, they didn&#x27;t so, I purchased these and the nose pads. They are helpful. The only thing you need to know is that if you have really wide temples, they might not fit, so make sure in advance.</li>
            <li> I had hoped these would be the solution to my ear pain but they ripped the next day.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Nice fitting. They don&#x27;t work well for me. I got my glasses adjusted and I don&#x27;t need them. I know of some people that really like them.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. They work great for medium to large plastic temple. I do not recommend for small, short, thin,  not covered temple because they will be too big and come off very easily.</li>
            <li> I was completely satisfied with this purchase and would order them again when needed. They work to make my glasses more comfortable during the day.</li>
            <li> Very prompt service, works well.</li>
            <li> Great and works so well.  Mikey our little dog chewed the end of the glasses &amp;#62;  I ordered these until we could replace the glasses and surprise these were like perfect.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have a small piece of metal on my glasses and it has been irritating the back of my ears causing me to break out.  I couldn&#x27;t even get these on no matter how hard I tried and my glasses are really small.  I wound up tossing them and had to go to the eye doctors to get a pair that actually fit.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
            <li> Never had the opportunity to use the product. Upon application I pushed the protector too far and split at the close end.</li>
            <li> Work well at keeping eyeglasses from slipping off face! Not bad</li>
            <li> TURNS YELLOW AFTER 2 WEARRINGS</li>
            <li> Its good and worth the price.</li>
            <li> The temple tips do a very good job padding the tips of my glasses and keeps them from slipping down my nose.</li>
            <li> Did as expected, because I had a rough patch on my earpiece.  This covered it nicely and helped keep my glasses on my head!</li>
            <li> It works two ways: first it lengthens the temple behind your ear. Secondly, since it is wider and softer than the original hard temple &amp;#34;end&amp;#34;, it &amp;#34;Grabs&amp;#34; that tight space behind your ear. No more hectic pushing the glasses up your nose. I finally ended one bad annoying habit with these Clear Silicone Anti-Slip Ear Grip Hooks.</li>
            <li> Was so glad to find these - I have looked everywhere in my area and could not find them. Now i can wear my favorite sunglasses again!</li>
            <li> Good quality, doesn&#x27;t slip, still using them.</li>
            <li> These did not make my glasses more comfortable.</li>
            <li> tend to slide down, do not stay in place</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the Temple Tips!!! My ears no longer hurt and my hair is not being torn out from my designer frames.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you have discomfort behind your ear due to eyeglass wear.  They are easy to slide on if the stem of the glasses are fairly thin.</li>
            <li> I give this 4 stars as it did do exactly what I wanted them for. My new glasses the frames by the ears were irritated either by what they are made of or the sharpness of the edges. They were a little long, but a nice snug fit.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  They make the glasses more comfortable and they keep them from slipping down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, they are being sold on this site for about $6 that includes shipping and handling.  They sell the same product at Wal-Mart for $2 in the Optic center if there is one in the store.  You get them instantly and the technician there will put them on for you.  You will save time and the added expense of shipping.</li>
            <li> Do not stay in place.</li>
            <li> Temple Tips are beneficial for those who are experiencing eyeglass discomfort above the ears. They slip on easily and remain firm on my glasses. (Firm on my glasses and firm on my ears). I do not mean to sound commercial, but discomfort is immediately transformed into a comfortable pair of eyeglasses after Temple Tips Eyewear is applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted three, but I was skeptical at first. Consequently, I ordered just one pair. I soon forgot about my order, but days later I received a slightly bulging #10 envelope hand addressed with a couple of stamps on it. The envelope was without return address.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife became fearful. \\&quot;Ted Kluszewski is still in jail, isn&#x27;t he?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I believe so,\\&quot; I answered, \\&quot;although I think you must mean Ted Kaczynski. KacZYNski. Ted Kluszewski was a major league baseball player,\\&quot; whereupon I opened the envelope and quite obviously lived to tell about it.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:0786469994 Big Klu: The Baseball Life of Ted Kluszewski]] [[ASIN:1560371315 Unabomber: Secret Life/Ted Kaczynski]]</li>
            <li> Did not fit my small side pieces, but were very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> works well to prevent rubbing in back of the ear</li>
            <li> According to my vision insurance I can only get glasses every two years.  I had just gotten these glasses and my dog got ahold of them and chewed one of the ear pieces.  I was so upset.  These tips are perfect, comfortable and saved me from having to get new frames right away.  So pleased!</li>
            <li> Good ..Good stuff .  They are very comfortable to the ears, glasses do not slip, I like those temple tips......</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s dog chewed up the temples of her very expensive glasses, gnawing the plastic down to the wires.  She was ready to just write them off as a loss until I discovered these Temple Tips.  After slipping them on, the glasses are now comfortable enough for her to wear until she can afford to get a new pair.  Thanks for saving the day!</li>
            <li> Not able to use.  Too large for my glasses.</li>
            <li> Vert good. Really keeps my glasses in place.</li>
            <li> The product was as described works well</li>
            <li> After installation all was well and comfortable.  After the vinyl slip-ons conformed to my eyeglass legs, they started to slip off easily.  My eyeglass leg tips are very narrow which pressed hard into the area behind my ears which the reason I bought these cushioning slip-on tips.  I may try to stuff a a segment of  rubber band in the temple tip slip-on cover to keep the slipcover from sliding off easily.</li>
            <li> Not the most glamorous item, but it saved me a pair of glasses I like quite a lot, so thank you dear seller and I might buy more. In addition, the glasses are not slipping down anymore. It was a bit hard to put them on, though, and for someone with weaker fingers or without a beader&#x27;s toolkit I have it might be impossible.</li>
            <li> THESE EYEGLASS SOCKS ARE MUCH TOO LOOSE FOR GLASSES WITH THIN TO AVERAGE ARM ENDS, SO THAT THEY SOMETIMES SLIP OFF WHEN REMOVING THE GLASSES FROM YOUR EARS.  THEY NEED 3 SIZES:  THIN, MEDIUM AND THICK.  IT WOULD ALSO HELP ALOT IF THEY WERE AN INCH LONGER, AND MORE OF A SLICK HARD TEXTURE.</li>
            <li> Excellent item and have solved the problem!</li>
            <li> like others reported, the tips were too big. We inserted a small plastic shim into each one to hold it tight. You could probably cut off the points of a couple of toothpicks and do the same. Price is ridiculously high. But they look better than the tape and gauze wrap that we were using before</li>
            <li> Pros: It works. It prevent my glasses from slipping off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the left ear slips off from time to time. It&#x27;s weird that only one ear slips off. Also these make my ears stick out a little bit but not in an ugly way.</li>
            <li> It took a while to find  them, but I&#x27;m glad I did.  It&#x27;s too bad that you don&#x27;t save postage by buying additional tips.</li>
            <li> My husband likes to use these to keep his glasses from slipping.</li>
            <li> My glasses were horribly uncomfortable around my ears but these made all the difference in the world. I&#x27;m definitely purchasing more!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what I was thinking when I thought these condoms for eye glasses would work, but they were just plain silly and I threw them away.</li>
            <li> Complete comfort!  I have always found glasses to be uncomfortable around my ears, and these cushions have completely solved that problem.  What else can I say but five stars!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but liked what I got.  I had Oakley glasses which have straight temples.  They don&#x27;t stay on as well as glasses that wrap behind the ears.  I had bent my temples some, but still not enough to keep the glasses from sliding.  I bought these tips to help.  These are designed for temples where the end flairs out.  Mine are straight to the end, so I knew these wouldn&#x27;t fit exactly.  They are long enough that I could use just half of the tips and cut off the wider end.  They fit perfectly over my Oakley temples which are about 4 mm wide.  These definitely help with gripping the glasses to my head.  The only somewhat negative complaint is they aren&#x27;t as soft as I hoped.  Still better than bare metal of the Oakleys, but rather stiff once applied.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on the glasses and prevents them from slipping.</li>
            <li> Very useful to keep glasses from slipping down my nose.&lt;br /&gt;Really a nuisance for your glasses to continually slip off.</li>
            <li> this is such a simple little item, but very hard to find.  makes my husband&#x27;s glasses comfortable and keeps them from slipping down.</li>
            <li> Great, second order for all my sunglasses.</li>
            <li> These are okay. I don&#x27;t think they work as well as the big &amp;#34;wing&amp;#34; type temple adjusters, but they&#x27;re not nearly as obvious, either, plus these make my glasses much easier to put on than when I had the wing type adjusters on.</li>
            <li> Such a simple product that makes the glasses more comfortable. I love how easy it was to slide in.</li>
            <li> My plastic frames caused considerable pain where they rested on my ears. I obtained instantaneous relief when I put the temple tips on the frames. Placing the tips on the frames was moderately difficult because the tips were much smaller than the area where they were being placed. I suspect that individuals with weak and/or arthritic hands would have difficulty installing the tips on plastic frames. This review is not applicable to wire frames.</li>
            <li> I just received these and put them on my glasses.  Makes a big difference.  Some of the other reviews mentioned the size and the fact they are loose on thinner temples.  But there is a solution.  I put a nose pad at the end of each temple before sliding them on.  It keeps them secure. Try it.  You may like it. I only rated it as 4 stars as one size does not fit all.  At least without a little help. Otherwise it would be a five star :-)</li>
            <li> just what I needed to keep my loose glasses from sliding down my nose. They will fit most glasses and are so comfortable</li>
            <li> These were just what was needed to repair a friend&#x27;s eyeglasses.  Timely delivery would definitely recommend again.</li>
            <li> Were exactly what my husband needed to make wearing glasses more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy the allergic reaction on my ear tops is gone. Note these really are yellowish, so they start out looking old and weathered.  Clear would have been better.</li>
            <li> Too big to stay on. Really do not work well. And to add insult to injury, they rip you off on shipping. DO NOT PURCHASE.</li>
            <li> These are much to large for my glasses. Why don&#x27;t they make them out of the same plastic that shrinks with heat or hot water like mouth guards? I used &amp;#34;heat shrink&amp;#34; wire insulators on my glasses instead.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable.  My glasses fell victim to a friends new puppy.  Unable to get a new pair of glasses right away I bought these to take roughness out of the ear piece. Other than being a little long,  which I just clipped to fit , I still use</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stand to wear my glasses because within a half an hour they would make the back of my ears so sore.  These have made such a big difference.  I was worried about them being visible because I wear my hair short but since they are clear they&#x27;re barely visible.  They do have a very slight tackiness to them but nothing you can feel while wearing.</li>
            <li> Perfect just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Useless. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Tore as I tried to slide on glasses.</li>
            <li> too large ( wide) for my sunglasses</li>
            <li> Fit well, wish they were darker</li>
            <li> Perfect for most of my glasses.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t fit my glasses</li>
            <li> These really help in the summer with heavier glasses.  They keep from falling down my nose etc...&lt;br /&gt;wish I would have ordered these years ago, since I don&#x27;t like to wear contacts.</li>
            <li> They were far too big for my glasses. (I have thin metal frames.)</li>
            <li> Always liked this product helps my glasses stay in place better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my less conventional ear pieces. : (</li>
