            <li>Perfect for French manicures.  </li>
            <li>I think it depends on how many coats you use.</li>
            <li>Lovely on my darker complexion as well.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Try it and you will see :-)</li>
            <li>I  love the OPI Gelcolor nail polish.  </li>
            <li>I love the color, Bubble Bath.  </li>
            <li>so be sure you like the color.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s SO much better than the gelish line.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this color.</li>
            <li>This was my favorite color at the salon</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m okay with it.  </li>
            <li>version which I like much better.</li>
            <li>Love OPI.  </li>
            <li>Love that I was able to get my favorite polish in a gel.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I am also glad that it doesn&#x27;t have glitter/shimmer.</li>
            <li>They also mentioned that I need to purchase the bottom AND top coats for the OPI polish.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful natural looking color!</li>
            <li>will it&#x27;s sexy classy and beautiful</li>
            <li>Make sure you go lightly with application.</li>
            <li>It also goes on easily for a ge</li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason that I don&#x27;t like this gel polish is that it&#x27;s easily peeling off layer after layer.</li>
            <li>I am really happy with the purchase and will buy more in the future.  </li>
            <li>Easy application</li>
            <li>; no chips after a week and a half&lt;br /&gt;- Soaks off easily</li>
            <li>Beautiful on french manicures or all by itself.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing this soft pink polish for more than two weeks has no peals yet, and I am a working mom of 3 with many house chores, so many of my polishes even gel chip so very happy with this one s durability.</li>
            <li>The gel color was easy to apply and went on smoothly after two coats.  </li>
            <li>This is a gorgeous color that looks very natural on my nails.</li>
            <li>OPI Bubble Bath is the perfect color for a classy, natural looking manicure.</li>
            <li>Free shipping means nothing to me if the product is not what it says it is.</li>
            <li>I use a light color gel polish (like this one)</li>
            <li>; I&#x27;ve done gel nails maybe 5 times and still came out streak free</li>
            <li>Looks great as a French though.</li>
            <li>I should add I am fair skinned so perfect for me may be very different for other complexions.</li>
            <li>Nice and light, not thick at all.</li>
            <li>It goes on great, and you won&#x27;t experience wrinkling as long as you don&#x27;t let it pool on the edges of the nail or the free edge.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>Beautiful pink nude.</li>
            <li>I occasionally like to wear color but for the most part I&#x27;m a neutral kind of girl.</li>
            <li>I got Bubble Bath based on reviews that said it was a nice neutral and natural - looking color.</li>
            <li>FINALLY, I can have a manicure that is very smooth, shiny and stays on for more than one week.  </li>
            <li>I had gotten OPI Bubble Bath at the salon several times and liked the color, so when I switched to a new salon that didn&#x27;t carry it, I decided to get my own.</li>
            <li>I have my own light and wanted to the same color at home.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and was exactly what I was expecting!</li>
            <li>&amp; the shipping was fast!!</li>
            <li>I just expected a very light neutral color I could wear most of the time.</li>
            <li>I may do three coats next time to get more of a pink, but a great nude.</li>
            <li>I finally bought my own and am saving $100 / month.</li>
            <li>My favorite &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; natural nail color.</li>
            <li>Removing it is actually really fun.</li>
            <li>Great neutral color, extremely pale pink/beige (will match any</li>
            <li>The perfect shade of sheer pink!  </li>
            <li>Starts to chip right away</li>
            <li>This review is purely about the colour, as the seller gets 5 stars for responding promptly and giving me a full refund right</li>
            <li>Previously I have only used Gelish gel nail polish, but this stuff is great too!  </li>
            <li>color is not exactly as pink as the bottle color shows, it is more on the rusty beige look.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be good with 2 coats, for a more sheer look, or 3 coats for a more solid pink.  </li>
            <li>A good neutral when you want just a little color that goes with everything.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a more sheer color.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>Still pretty, but not the one I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I have had this done at many salons and it is the same color there as well.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this color along with Samoan Sand and Bubble Bath for anyone that needs a pretty neutral for day to day wear.  </li>
            <li>Very nature color !</li>
            <li>its the exact color</li>
            <li>But it is pretty</li>
            <li>the gel seems to help the regular polish adhere better and not chip.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this color when I do French tips.  </li>
            <li>As for the OPI Soak Off nails, it&#x27;s the only type I&#x27;ve been able to get to stick to my nails.</li>
            <li>pretty natural color  goes on smooth</li>
            <li>Perfect pink fo rme for a french mani not too pink not too light.</li>
            <li>I did two coats and while no totally opaque it made a nice kind of natural looking french manicure on my nails that  have grown out without me even needing to put white on them!</li>
            <li>It is a very light opaque pink skin toned color.  </li>
            <li>It is quite a bit more pink than nude</li>
            <li>So looks very clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I used two coats and it was a more natural nail color, but when I added a third coat it was more pink.</li>
            <li>I have read that the newer versions are more pink.</li>
            <li>I really like this color</li>
            <li>Lovely pink-</li>
            <li>I like the color very well.  </li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Ordered 2x bubble bath and one came bright pink (in complete bubble bath packaging) instead of light pink</li>
            <li>PERFECT pale pink!!!</li>
            <li>, I have had better results with other brands.</li>
            <li>Use this with Alpine Snow plus base and top coat for beautiful nails.</li>
            <li>Its fairly sheer, but such a nice shade of light pink.  </li>
            <li>My new fav color!</li>
            <li>I love it, however it is not the same shade as the regular BubbleBath OPI polish.</li>
            <li>So, if you like pink add more coats, but this polish is opaque with just one coat if you like the natural look.</li>
            <li>The older whitish color that they have in my salon</li>
            <li>Looks good for everyday wear especially when you don&#x27;t want to worry about your nail color not matching your attire.</li>
            <li>Quick review: great neutral color, would recommend for those who like more natural looking nails or possibly for a base french.&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li>Others have been too orange or tan, this is the perfect sheer pink to wear alone, with french manicure or layered with other colors.</li>
            <li>I would describe it as light to medium bubblegum pink.  </li>
            <li>Kind of a sheer, natural pink.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this color for years now and this is definitely NOT the right color.</li>
            <li>but I do not like the new color.</li>
            <li>During growing out phase, less obvious due to more natural tone :)</li>
            <li>It also looks very professional in my opinion, and can be worn with literally any outfit or in any occasion.</li>
            <li>Looks natural and shiny!</li>
            <li>Looks almost like I have no polish on at all but is much prettier than bare nails.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that this looks exactly like regular OPI Bubble Bath</li>
            <li>Matches exactly like the regular polish.</li>
            <li>This was a large extra expense.  </li>
            <li>When I had my gel nails done at a salon, I always wore this sheer, light pink color by OPI.  </li>
            <li>Natural.  </li>
            <li>Also can&#x27;t tell too much if it chips (which it only does when I pick at it)</li>
            <li>More of a Barbie pink than a soft pink.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like nearly as well.</li>
            <li>The color is a little more pink than I had expected but it is so pretty!</li>
            <li>This is the same high end OPI formula</li>
            <li>When you are ready to remove it though, you simply need to pull a corner up (the tough part) and then it peels off in 1-3 pieces, leaving a healthy nail underneath.</li>
            <li>I saw that some reviewers commented that this Bubble Bath seems a little more pink.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not a pink lover, not for you!</li>
            <li>Seller would not reimburse for there are no other complaints of this issue.</li>
            <li>but it is a very sheer, almost clear color.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that was unexpected was the color.  </li>
            <li>Soaking off is the only way it actually benefits your natural nails.</li>
            <li>and then when I am tired of it, I put regular nail polish on top of it.  </li>
            <li>Bubble Bath is shear enough to still show your natural nail bed but has enough color to look like a natural colored pink.  </li>
            <li>I have about a half dozen other OPI gel shades that are true to color, but this one, definitely not.</li>
            <li>I just did a half manicure when my new UV lamp arrived and it all works!</li>

            <li> Free shipping means nothing to me if the product is not what it says it is.</li>
            <li> I use a light color gel polish (like this one)</li>
            <li> ; I&#x27;ve done gel nails maybe 5 times and still came out streak free</li>
            <li> Looks great as a French though.</li>
            <li> I should add I am fair skinned so perfect for me may be very different for other complexions.</li>
            <li> Nice and light, not thick at all.</li>
            <li> It goes on great, and you won&#x27;t experience wrinkling as long as you don&#x27;t let it pool on the edges of the nail or the free edge.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Beautiful pink nude.</li>
            <li> I occasionally like to wear color but for the most part I&#x27;m a neutral kind of girl.</li>
            <li> I got Bubble Bath based on reviews that said it was a nice neutral and natural - looking color.</li>
            <li> FINALLY, I can have a manicure that is very smooth, shiny and stays on for more than one week.  </li>
            <li> I had gotten OPI Bubble Bath at the salon several times and liked the color, so when I switched to a new salon that didn&#x27;t carry it, I decided to get my own.</li>
            <li> I have my own light and wanted to the same color at home.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and was exactly what I was expecting!</li>
            <li> &amp; the shipping was fast!!</li>
            <li> I just expected a very light neutral color I could wear most of the time.</li>
            <li> I may do three coats next time to get more of a pink, but a great nude.</li>
            <li> I finally bought my own and am saving $100 / month.</li>
            <li> My favorite &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; natural nail color.</li>
            <li> Removing it is actually really fun.</li>
            <li> Great neutral color, extremely pale pink/beige (will match any</li>
            <li> The perfect shade of sheer pink!  </li>
            <li> Starts to chip right away</li>
            <li> This review is purely about the colour, as the seller gets 5 stars for responding promptly and giving me a full refund right</li>
            <li> Previously I have only used Gelish gel nail polish, but this stuff is great too!  </li>
            <li> color is not exactly as pink as the bottle color shows, it is more on the rusty beige look.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be good with 2 coats, for a more sheer look, or 3 coats for a more solid pink.  </li>
            <li> A good neutral when you want just a little color that goes with everything.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a more sheer color.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> Still pretty, but not the one I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have had this done at many salons and it is the same color there as well.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this color along with Samoan Sand and Bubble Bath for anyone that needs a pretty neutral for day to day wear.  </li>
            <li> Very nature color !</li>
            <li> its the exact color</li>
            <li> But it is pretty</li>
            <li> the gel seems to help the regular polish adhere better and not chip.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this color when I do French tips.  </li>
            <li> As for the OPI Soak Off nails, it&#x27;s the only type I&#x27;ve been able to get to stick to my nails.</li>
            <li> pretty natural color  goes on smooth</li>
            <li> Perfect pink fo rme for a french mani not too pink not too light.</li>
            <li> I did two coats and while no totally opaque it made a nice kind of natural looking french manicure on my nails that  have grown out without me even needing to put white on them!</li>
            <li> It is a very light opaque pink skin toned color.  </li>
            <li> It is quite a bit more pink than nude</li>
            <li> So looks very clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used two coats and it was a more natural nail color, but when I added a third coat it was more pink.</li>
            <li> I have read that the newer versions are more pink.</li>
            <li> I really like this color</li>
            <li> Lovely pink-</li>
            <li> I like the color very well.  </li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Ordered 2x bubble bath and one came bright pink (in complete bubble bath packaging) instead of light pink</li>
            <li> PERFECT pale pink!!!</li>
            <li> , I have had better results with other brands.</li>
            <li> Use this with Alpine Snow plus base and top coat for beautiful nails.</li>
            <li> Its fairly sheer, but such a nice shade of light pink.  </li>
            <li> My new fav color!</li>
            <li> I love it, however it is not the same shade as the regular BubbleBath OPI polish.</li>
            <li> So, if you like pink add more coats, but this polish is opaque with just one coat if you like the natural look.</li>
            <li> The older whitish color that they have in my salon</li>
            <li> Looks good for everyday wear especially when you don&#x27;t want to worry about your nail color not matching your attire.</li>
            <li> Quick review: great neutral color, would recommend for those who like more natural looking nails or possibly for a base french.&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li> Others have been too orange or tan, this is the perfect sheer pink to wear alone, with french manicure or layered with other colors.</li>
            <li> I would describe it as light to medium bubblegum pink.  </li>
            <li> Kind of a sheer, natural pink.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this color for years now and this is definitely NOT the right color.</li>
            <li> but I do not like the new color.</li>
            <li> During growing out phase, less obvious due to more natural tone :)</li>
            <li> It also looks very professional in my opinion, and can be worn with literally any outfit or in any occasion.</li>
            <li> Looks natural and shiny!</li>
            <li> Looks almost like I have no polish on at all but is much prettier than bare nails.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that this looks exactly like regular OPI Bubble Bath</li>
            <li> Matches exactly like the regular polish.</li>
            <li> This was a large extra expense.  </li>
            <li> When I had my gel nails done at a salon, I always wore this sheer, light pink color by OPI.  </li>
            <li> Natural.  </li>
            <li> Also can&#x27;t tell too much if it chips (which it only does when I pick at it)</li>
            <li> More of a Barbie pink than a soft pink.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like nearly as well.</li>
            <li> The color is a little more pink than I had expected but it is so pretty!</li>
            <li> This is the same high end OPI formula</li>
            <li> When you are ready to remove it though, you simply need to pull a corner up (the tough part) and then it peels off in 1-3 pieces, leaving a healthy nail underneath.</li>
            <li> I saw that some reviewers commented that this Bubble Bath seems a little more pink.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not a pink lover, not for you!</li>
            <li> Seller would not reimburse for there are no other complaints of this issue.</li>
            <li> but it is a very sheer, almost clear color.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that was unexpected was the color.  </li>
            <li> Soaking off is the only way it actually benefits your natural nails.</li>
            <li> and then when I am tired of it, I put regular nail polish on top of it.  </li>
            <li> Bubble Bath is shear enough to still show your natural nail bed but has enough color to look like a natural colored pink.  </li>
            <li> I have about a half dozen other OPI gel shades that are true to color, but this one, definitely not.</li>
            <li> I just did a half manicure when my new UV lamp arrived and it all works!</li>
            <li> Very pretty, very pale shimmery pink.</li>
            <li> I get bored quickly with the color on my nails and like to change colors frequently.  </li>
            <li> Large bottle which is still lasting me at least one year.</li>
            <li> If you are wanting an everyday pretty pink, this is the color for you!!</li>
            <li> Even when polishing the tip of the nail, this brand shrinks back from the edge, making it very difficult to get complete and smooth coverage.</li>
            <li> The color was a darker pink than the last bottle.  </li>
            <li> It came and the bottle looks the same, but the color is a baby pink.  </li>
            <li> Original BB was a very faint pink but mainly nude color.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bubble Bath for years at a local nail salon, however, this bottle was almost baby pink!</li>
            <li> This one was very pink, almost salmon-colored, and not sheer at all.  </li>
            <li> nice base for french manicure</li>
            <li> Iv used a lot of different no ship brands and this one is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed as I love the milky white version!</li>
            <li> not what i expected</li>
            <li> Too much pink.  </li>
            <li> This colour is NOT Bubble Bath - it is a darker pink.</li>
            <li> This polish is everything that I expected.  </li>
            <li> I expected this color to have some pink shade.</li>
            <li> Also, the gel lacquer is much harder and protects my nails from breaking.  </li>
            <li> and it was carefully and neatly packaged.</li>
            <li> used this polish with an inexpensive lamp ($50, I believe) and was worried that would effect its adhesion, but there are absolutely no problems there.</li>
            <li> To all of you who said the color is wrong-have you actually put it on, with the base and top coat and cured it?  </li>
            <li> Mistakes are much less obvious due to the pale color.</li>
            <li> think , if I got dark color skin, would not pretty at all .</li>
            <li> This product is not worth that money.</li>
            <li> Also works well to lighten some dark polishes.</li>
            <li> I used it with OPI&#x27;s base and top coat gel.  </li>
            <li> Just wish it was a teeny less translucent.  </li>
            <li> I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> so I have trouble finding &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; tones that don&#x27;t look brown on me and make my skin look pasty.</li>
            <li> You can apply a few coats for a very natural looking manicure or just apply one coat as a base for a French manicure.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the color is different.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t horrible, but it has more of a peach shade than the one I had gotten at the salon.</li>
            <li> I usually get a week plus on a DIY gel manicure but with bubble bath, it starts peeling within a day or two.</li>
            <li> Im not sure I like the OPI gel color system though</li>
            <li> The Axxium polish by the same manufacturer is absolutely horrible, and much more difficult to apply.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure why,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely obsessed with OPI soak off, and ESPECIALLY this color.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, but I like pink, so it&#x27;s not a total waste.</li>
            <li> Just mentioning for those notorious few who get mad purchasing gel colors only to find they aren&#x27;t drying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to take off.</li>
            <li> Yea hello take a look at your negative reviews and tell me that again.</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED, THIS WAS TO BE A SPECIAL GIFT FOR MYSELF.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Thin layers of nail ALWAYS come off with it.</li>
            <li> NOt HAPPY ABOUT THIS</li>
            <li> wrong color and not a good experience.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t peel off unintentionally, nor does it tempt you to pick at at, even during boring meetings or long car rides.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love it, however it is not the same shade as the regular BubbleBath OPI polish. It is quite a bit more pink than nude</li>
            <li> color is not exactly as pink as the bottle color shows, it is more on the rusty beige look. not what i expected</li>
            <li> If you want a nice sheer/neutral color, this works well. It also goes on easily for a ge if you di your ownl.</li>
            <li> nice base for french manicure</li>
            <li> The color was a darker pink than the last bottle.  I wanted a more sheer color.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> My skin color yellow. So looks very clean.&lt;br /&gt;I think , if I got dark color skin, would not pretty at all .</li>
            <li> This is a great gel polish and a great color!  Previously I have only used Gelish gel nail polish, but this stuff is great too!  I LOVE this color! Its fairly sheer, but such a nice shade of light pink.  I did two coats and while no totally opaque it made a nice kind of natural looking french manicure on my nails that  have grown out without me even needing to put white on them!</li>
            <li> The perfect shade of sheer pink!  You&#x27;ll be good with 2 coats, for a more sheer look, or 3 coats for a more solid pink.  My new fav color!</li>
            <li> I have used this polish for the last year in color bubble bath.  This came in a different shade.  Too much pink.  I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> PERFECT pale pink!!! Not too pinky, not too white, not too sheer. Like the perfect French manicure color or by itself. Looks just like the opi bubble bath In regular polish. Fabulous!!</li>
            <li> wrong color and not a good experience. Took it back. Please for your sanity to not buy this product as there are much better gel polishes out ther like Gellish</li>
            <li> Perfect for French manicures.  I&#x27;ve been getting French manis for a year- this is what my manicurist always uses. I finally bought my own and am saving $100 / month. Use this with Alpine Snow plus base and top coat for beautiful nails.</li>
            <li> I bought this color because I love it in the salon!  I have my own light and wanted to the same color at home.  It came and the bottle looks the same, but the color is a baby pink.  It is not the iridescent color that it is in the salon.</li>
            <li> This is the newer version of Bubble Bath. Original BB was a very faint pink but mainly nude color. This is the same high end OPI formula but I do not like the new color.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what it says. I saw that some reviewers commented that this Bubble Bath seems a little more pink. I think it depends on how many coats you use. I used two coats and it was a more natural nail color, but when I added a third coat it was more pink. So, if you like pink add more coats, but this polish is opaque with just one coat if you like the natural look. Lovely on my darker complexion as well.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This review is purely about the colour, as the seller gets 5 stars for responding promptly and giving me a full refund right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Bubble Bath for years both at home (regular polish) and at the salon (gel polish). This colour is NOT Bubble Bath - it is a darker pink. Still pretty, but not the one I was looking for. When I contacted the seller, they immediately gave me a refund and explained that they were having the same problem with Passion. When they asked OPI, they were told that the colour supposedly lightens during the curing process. Granted, I don&#x27;t have a pro LED lamp (mine is a drugstore version), but whenever I&#x27;ve had this one done at the salon, the colour in the bottle has matched the brush and didn&#x27;t need to lighten during curing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;re looking to purchase BUBBLE BATH or PASSION, be warned that it may not be the colour you were expecting!</li>
            <li> When I had my gel nails done at a salon, I always wore this sheer, light pink color by OPI.  When I started doing my own gel nails, of course I bought this one.  For whatever reason, it is NOT the same color.  This one was very pink, almost salmon-colored, and not sheer at all.  My sister also tried it and said that it is not the same &amp;#34;Bubble Bath&amp;#34; OPI gel color that she gets at her salon, either.  I have about a half dozen other OPI gel shades that are true to color, but this one, definitely not.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and was exactly what I was expecting!</li>
            <li> To all of you who said the color is wrong-have you actually put it on, with the base and top coat and cured it?  probably because the ingredients to make gel polish are different than what goes into a regular polish makes the color look different in the bottle. However, once it is on your nails it is just like the regular polish! I have had this done at many salons and it is the same color there as well. Try it and you will see :-) Anywho, great seller!!! Quick shipping, items still shrink-wrapped, will definitely buy from again!!!</li>
            <li> I  love the OPI Gelcolor nail polish.  FINALLY, I can have a manicure that is very smooth, shiny and stays on for more than one week.  I love the color, Bubble Bath.  It is a very light opaque pink skin toned color.  Natural.  Nice.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bubble Bath for years at a local nail salon, however, this bottle was almost baby pink! I have read that the newer versions are more pink. I am disappointed as I love the milky white version!</li>
            <li> I was using the gelish nail products from Sally&#x27;s prior to purchasing OPI&#x27;s gel color.  I will never go back.  The OPI product is great.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey so be sure you like the color.  If price is an issue, check out Sally Hansen but if you are an OPI fan like myself you will be really happy with their Gelcolor.  It&#x27;s SO much better than the gelish line.  Nice and light, not thick at all.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this soft pink polish for more than two weeks has no peals yet, and I am a working mom of 3 with many house chores, so many of my polishes even gel chip so very happy with this one s durability.</li>
            <li> Perfect pink fo rme for a french mani not too pink not too light. Its perfect. its always agreat color to just put on them put RNP over it.</li>
            <li> This polish is everything that I expected.  This is the same opi bubble bath gel polish that they use at the nail salons.</li>
            <li> I love OPI gel and this color (bubble bath) is a great neutral/nude/pinkish color. I am very fair skinned so I have trouble finding &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; tones that don&#x27;t look brown on me and make my skin look pasty. Well this one doesn&#x27;t do that. It looks great. Its my go to color now. Also can&#x27;t tell too much if it chips (which it only does when I pick at it)</li>
            <li> Bubble Bath is shear enough to still show your natural nail bed but has enough color to look like a natural colored pink.  The gel color was easy to apply and went on smoothly after two coats.  I used it with OPI&#x27;s base and top coat gel.  Looks natural and shiny! It set great after drying under the UV lights.</li>
            <li> I love this color!! I would recommend this color along with Samoan Sand and Bubble Bath for anyone that needs a pretty neutral for day to day wear.  All the OPI gels I&#x27;ve used at home last between 10-14 days.  Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I had gotten OPI Bubble Bath at the salon several times and liked the color, so when I switched to a new salon that didn&#x27;t carry it, I decided to get my own. Unfortunately, the color is different. It isn&#x27;t horrible, but it has more of a peach shade than the one I had gotten at the salon.</li>
            <li> I got Bubble Bath based on reviews that said it was a nice neutral and natural - looking color. It is definitely not neutral. I would describe it as light to medium bubblegum pink.  Disappointed, but I like pink, so it&#x27;s not a total waste. I just expected a very light neutral color I could wear most of the time. If you&#x27;re not a pink lover, not for you!</li>
            <li> Awesome I love the color and it stay on very will it&#x27;s sexy classy and beautiful</li>
            <li> Gorgeous neutral color. I occasionally like to wear color but for the most part I&#x27;m a neutral kind of girl. This is a gorgeous color that looks very natural on my nails.</li>
            <li> This is my go to color for creating a French nail look in soak off gel.  It goes on great, and you won&#x27;t experience wrinkling as long as you don&#x27;t let it pool on the edges of the nail or the free edge.</li>
            <li> I have found my go-to! I absolutely love this color. It is by far the best neatral shade I have found. Others have been too orange or tan, this is the perfect sheer pink to wear alone, with french manicure or layered with other colors. I should add I am fair skinned so perfect for me may be very different for other complexions.</li>
            <li> Excellent product beautiful color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fair skinned girl and this color is the perfect nude for me. Looks almost like I have no polish on at all but is much prettier than bare nails.</li>
            <li> Free shipping means nothing to me if the product is not what it says it is. I&#x27;ve been using this color for years now and this is definitely NOT the right color. Seller would not reimburse for there are no other complaints of this issue. Yea hello take a look at your negative reviews and tell me that again.</li>
            <li> I expected this color to have some pink shade. I don&#x27;t think that this looks exactly like regular OPI Bubble Bath color.&lt;br /&gt;The reason that I don&#x27;t like this gel polish is that it&#x27;s easily peeling off layer after layer. I used this with LED lamp and UV lamp, same results. Stays on only for 1 week. This product is not worth that money.</li>
            <li> This was my favorite color at the salon and now I can get the same results at home. Great, great investment!</li>
            <li> Very nature color ! Love it !</li>
            <li> Very pretty, very pale shimmery pink.</li>
            <li> The color is a little more pink than I had expected but it is so pretty! You can apply a few coats for a very natural looking manicure or just apply one coat as a base for a French manicure. &amp; the shipping was fast!! Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I just did a half manicure when my new UV lamp arrived and it all works! I also like the idea of taking in my own Gel colors to the salon because then I know it has only been used on me, its the exact color and I want and I can touch at home if I want.</li>
            <li> More of a Barbie pink than a soft pink. Translucent.</li>
            <li> I really like this color but it does not last for me. I usually get a week plus on a DIY gel manicure but with bubble bath, it starts peeling within a day or two. I have used this color several times now, all with the same result.  I also bought this color for my daughter and she is experiencing the same issue.  I am going to look for a similar shade in the Gelish line. Unfortunately, this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> My OPI polish arrived on time.  I am really happy with the purchase and will buy more in the future.  The only thing that was unexpected was the color.  I thought it would be pinker but it is a very sheer, almost clear color.  But it is pretty and I&#x27;m okay with it.  I get bored quickly with the color on my nails and like to change colors frequently.  I use a light color gel polish (like this one) and then when I am tired of it, I put regular nail polish on top of it.  the gel seems to help the regular polish adhere better and not chip.  When I get bored again, I use a NON acetone nail polish remover to take the top polish off and keep the gel polish.  That way, I get a lot of mileage out of my gel color (about 3 weeks), but I still bounce around with darker colors as often as I like.  Also, the gel lacquer is much harder and protects my nails from breaking.  Just remember to use non acetone polish remover if you want to keep the gel manicure intact.  Acetone remover will wreck the gel.  Hope this gives good information for you.</li>
            <li> OPI Bubble Bath is the perfect color for a classy, natural looking manicure. I wear it all the time. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Quick review: great neutral color, would recommend for those who like more natural looking nails or possibly for a base french.&lt;br /&gt;Used in combination with these items:&lt;br /&gt;Lamp: [[ASIN:B008FXFH6Q B008FXFH6Q]]&lt;br /&gt;Gel kit: [[ASIN:B0057JCYYE B0057JCYYE]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Great neutral color, extremely pale pink/beige (will match any outfit)&lt;br /&gt;- Easy application; I&#x27;ve done gel nails maybe 5 times and still came out streak free&lt;br /&gt;- Good endurance; no chips after a week and a half&lt;br /&gt;- Soaks off easily&lt;br /&gt;- During growing out phase, less obvious due to more natural tone :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- REQUIRES LED/UV lamp for curing. Just mentioning for those notorious few who get mad purchasing gel colors only to find they aren&#x27;t drying.&lt;br /&gt;- REQUIRES gel nail application kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helpful tips:&lt;br /&gt;- Don&#x27;t paint all the way to the edges or cuticles, it will leave a raised border from where it rested against the skin. Polish will spread some during curing.&lt;br /&gt;- Don&#x27;t peel away, as tempting as it can be. Thin layers of nail ALWAYS come off with it. Soaking off is the only way it actually benefits your natural nails.</li>
            <li> Wonderful color for summer...doesn&#x27;t get better than OPI</li>
            <li> Lovely pink- almost nude. Beautiful on french manicures or all by itself. Also works well to lighten some dark polishes.</li>
            <li> Beautiful natural looking color!</li>
            <li> I like the color very well.  I don&#x27;t like how it shrinks on the nail as I&#x27;m applying it.  Even when polishing the tip of the nail, this brand shrinks back from the edge, making it very difficult to get complete and smooth coverage.</li>
            <li> Starts to chip right away and it&#x27;s hard to take off. Iv used a lot of different no ship brands and this one is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great color. Matches exactly like the regular polish. Im not sure I like the OPI gel color system though, I have had better results with other brands.</li>
            <li> Got this OPI gel color (Bubble Bath)promptly and it was carefully and neatly packaged. It was the &amp;#34;pinker&amp;#34; version which I like much better. The older whitish color that they have in my salon I don&#x27;t like nearly as well. Glad to have found Sparkle and Shine!</li>
            <li> If you are wanting an everyday pretty pink, this is the color for you!! Love OPI.  Stays on great and wears well.  would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love that I was able to get my favorite polish in a gel. I&#x27;ve been doing my own gels for about 8 months now - and am super happy with this product!</li>
            <li> My favorite &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; natural nail color.</li>
            <li> A good neutral when you want just a little color that goes with everything.  Looks good for everyday wear especially when you don&#x27;t want to worry about your nail color not matching your attire.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this color when I do French tips.  Kind of a sheer, natural pink.</li>
            <li> Great color perfect neutral tone and goes on smooth and easy! Large bottle which is still lasting me at least one year. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> This is the best polish for people who want durable gel polish, but who aren&#x27;t good at perfect application. Mistakes are much less obvious due to the pale color. It also looks very professional in my opinion, and can be worn with literally any outfit or in any occasion. As for the OPI Soak Off nails, it&#x27;s the only type I&#x27;ve been able to get to stick to my nails. The Axxium polish by the same manufacturer is absolutely horrible, and much more difficult to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this polish with an inexpensive lamp ($50, I believe) and was worried that would effect its adhesion, but there are absolutely no problems there. Just be sure to use alcohol BEFORE the nail bond, and you&#x27;ll be good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removal: This is the best part. It doesn&#x27;t peel off unintentionally, nor does it tempt you to pick at at, even during boring meetings or long car rides. When you are ready to remove it though, you simply need to pull a corner up (the tough part) and then it peels off in 1-3 pieces, leaving a healthy nail underneath. Removing it is actually really fun. Not sure why, but it just feels very satisfying. I&#x27;m definitely obsessed with OPI soak off, and ESPECIALLY this color.</li>
            <li> Beautiful pink nude. Sheer. Like all gels, lasts about 7 days when not salon applied.</li>
            <li> This color is perfect for the look I want,and the spa is fine with me bringing my own set.  This works great for me!!  I</li>
            <li> Just wish it was a teeny less translucent.  Looks great as a French though. Make sure you go lightly with application.</li>
            <li> Good nude color. I may do three coats next time to get more of a pink, but a great nude.</li>
            <li> Timeless color that goes with practically any outfit for any occasion. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Ordered 2x bubble bath and one came bright pink (in complete bubble bath packaging) instead of light pink</li>
            <li> it arrived pretty quickly and it is awesome!  I love it, loved the color too!  Great product, i would buy it again</li>
            <li> pretty natural color  goes on smooth</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product and how it looks when applied.  It&#x27;s a good neutral color for very fair skinned people.  I am also glad that it doesn&#x27;t have glitter/shimmer.</li>
            <li> Read about it in People Magazine.  Reason for only 3 star &#x3D; Did not mention that I needed to buy a UV Lamp to set the polish!!!  This was a large extra expense.  NOt HAPPY ABOUT THIS AT ALL.  E-mailed seller stating that no where did it say this was needed in their add on Amazon.  They wrote back that all gel needs the lamp.  How was I supposed to know that!!  They also mentioned that I need to purchase the bottom AND top coats for the OPI polish.  Did not say that either in add.  Now I have to order that too.  Person I e-mail to:  Michelle Nguyen  San Jose, CA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO VERY DISAPPOINTED, THIS WAS TO BE A SPECIAL GIFT FOR MYSELF.</li>
