            <li>He is even able to ride his bike and wear a helmet twice in one day with his hair still looking just as awesome as it did when he first did it in the morning.</li>

            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>Honestly, that is the reason I ordered from this company originally, but I have been VERY satisfied with the company and the product when it arrives.  </li>

            <li>I love this product and was happy to see I could purchase it online at a reasonable price</li>
            <li>i got a better deal hear</li>
            <li>A perfect product for my short spiky hair.  </li>
            <li>Love Joico Spiker and will order again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many brands of gels, mousse, hairspray, and a combination of those to get my hair to stay put.  </li>
            <li>Been using the Joico Ice Spiker for many years.</li>
            <li>Favorite hair product</li>
            <li>I love the ease of it just showing up at my door and the added bonus of no shipping charges.&lt;br /&gt;THANK</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s his favorite gel.  </li>
            <li>This order was sent to him as a gift:)</li>
            <li>and I was in love.</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with it every since.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Actually looks best about 4 hours after application.</li>
            <li>L.A. Looks brands when I had more hair.  </li>
            <li>it comes right out looking good.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for getting subborn hair to stay in place and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with this purchase, getting ready to re-order!</li>
            <li>Other gels get flakey or don&#x27;t hold up, but I have to say, this is the best.</li>
            <li>But, it washes out quite easily.  </li>
            <li>Washes away easy with water.</li>
            <li>where I started 2 years ago, searching for a strong hair glue again from scratch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this online because the local hair places were selling it anywhere from 21-23 dollars LOL.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s waterproof which is fantastic and it doesn&#x27;t glob up or attract any flying bugs like some hair product.</li>
            <li>Super strong but not so strong it will stab you in the face.</li>
            <li>HOLDS HAIR REALLY WELL!!!</li>
            <li>find a replacement for their original formula</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant sweet smell - kind of a light vanilla but not a strong girly vanilla.  </li>
            <li>Dries tacky and thick, but excellent for intended purpose.  </li>
            <li>I have had it in for almost 12 hours now with no flaking and it is still as strong as it was when I first put it in.</li>
            <li>The salt is a different hair follicle than the once light brown follicle, it has a mind of its own.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product and worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works Great To Hold Up A Curled Mustache, And Lasts All Day Without Drooping At All, And Only A Very Lit</li>
            <li>- really works (like glue) but washes out easily.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Pauly D was not wrong about this product!</li>
            <li>I have fine straight hair and this holds my hair in any hairstyle I want.</li>
            <li>Style mostly with my fingers as I blow dry and my short hair looks great with lots of volume, body and shine.</li>
            <li>My package shipped very quickly and was much more economical than buying in the local hair stylist shops that carry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additional Information - Smells great, and gives you a little shine to give you a sleek look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This also smells good, washes out more easily than most other spikers, and actually makes your heir really soft when you wash it out for some reason.</li>
            <li>It is very water resistant and even being exposed to light rainy days</li>
            <li>Great for the messy look or the spike look or just to add volume.  </li>
            <li>as good as i expected</li>
            <li>I came across this product from researching online about what will be a good product to spike my hair since I have thick hair, and many recommended this.</li>
            <li>This is the only one that both held my hair and provided a nice shine.</li>
            <li>My favorite styling gel so far.</li>
            <li>It sticks but isn&#x27;t sticky; it holds but comes right out.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>I have very soft, fine hair that if you even look at it it falls out of place.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it isn&#x27;t oily or greasy, which is great for fine or thin hair.</li>
            <li>Good product holds my edges down all day</li>
            <li>Exactly as listed, cheaper than the salon price, was what I was looking to order.  </li>
            <li>, my hair held up pretty well.  </li>
            <li>hope I helped, thank you so much for reading!</li>
            <li>used this on my coarse hair for a side comb style, and it works better than any high-numbered hair gel on the market.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s this bottle and a big one with a pump if you need more than 5 ounces.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great and 1 bottle lasts for a very long time; been using it for over a year and still have tons left</li>
            <li>I love this product so much that I even get the Spiker Glue in colors, I love the Pink to add some WOW to my tips.</li>
            <li>this stuff hold tall and straight and has very little moisture, which is good because i have curly hair</li>
            <li>I rub it in, then I scrunch it after it is dry, rubbing most of it into my hair.  </li>
            <li>It definitely keeps shape, and it washes out easily.</li>
            <li>It just seems like they added more water to this formula so it takes longer to dry</li>
            <li>It really makes my flat-top stand up and stay up.  </li>
            <li>so I bought it on here to surprise her because it was much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really the premier spiker glue/gel on the market.</li>
            <li>Had a quarter life crisis and decided to turn the fauxhawk into a real mohawk.</li>
            <li>but i blow it straight and any moisture in my product causes curls.</li>
            <li>My son absolutely loves this product.</li>
            <li>He says it really holds his hair in place when he spikes it up.</li>
            <li>This product is just what I was looking for thank you so much.  </li>
            <li>I really appreciate their option for no shipping charge.  </li>
            <li>gel holds MUCH stronger if your hair is damp when you put it in.</li>
            <li>i really like this product</li>
            <li>(nothing is strong enough) and this new version just isnt doing what it used to.  </li>
            <li>much better then other brands i have used</li>
            <li>Well, I am glad I gave this one a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now fellow amazon shoppers, keep in mind that I have really thick hair and every product I was using wasn&#x27;t giving me the full spike I really needed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve used in my hair for most of the last decade.  </li>
            <li>(in the yellow squirt bottle) that stuff is like super glue, this is like a moldable milder glue.</li>
            <li>Small amount of this gel goes a long way works great</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Great product but a bit expensive</li>
            <li>One hour later and most of my hair has already bent over (hair is about 1.5 inches long).  </li>
            <li>I do the messy look like most guys.</li>
            <li>It;s so hard to find this product in salons from where I am from so buying it here make its very easy for me.</li>
            <li>, doesn&#x27;t dry too quickly so it gives me time to comb it the way i want it.</li>
            <li>I have used many products in the past.</li>
            <li>It held strong and instantly, no waiting for it to dry to get my shape.  </li>
            <li>Easily washes out with shampoo, and off your hands with plain water.</li>
            <li>Even in the morning after I wake up and my hair is all flat on one side, all I have to do is a quick brushing and finger styling, and it&#x27;s back, day after day.  </li>
            <li>This was a reasonably priced product compared to the larger specialty stores that sell hair products.</li>
            <li>My hair naturally wants to fall toward my face and this Joico product keeps it back with a soft professional look throughout my business day and evening.</li>
            <li>Ok but not nearly as strong as Hard Up by Short Sexy Hair.  </li>
            <li>It needed to be retrained, and I had only been an avid gel man prior.  </li>
            <li>My husband has very straight and thick hair, and absolutely swears by Spiker Glue!</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s easy to wash out (at least part of it) with just a bit of water.</li>
            <li>It spiked up super strong, even against my thick, heavy, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I have tried different hair gels but this one by far is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t have any chemicals in my hair, so I was surprised with the coverage.  </li>
            <li>But I would prefer if they would just bring back the old formula</li>
            <li>I dont want to have to resort to mixing my own hair care products because it is timely and expensive</li>
            <li>I am sad to drop the rating but in my experience this product isn&#x27;t a good investment for the long term.</li>
            <li>If you have stubborn hair and have been looking high and low for a hair product that will keep your hair in place, look no further, this is the only thing you&#x27;ll need.</li>
            <li>First day when I was trying this glue, to tell you the truth I didn&#x27;t have much expectation because of my previous experiences with other products.</li>
            <li>I have super thick and super stiff hair.  </li>
            <li>It holds down my hair very very well and last for days</li>
            <li>Im on my last tube of the old stuff and am going to be back</li>
            <li>Makes my hair extra sharp and sleek for the whole day.</li>
            <li>It barely melts at all even with sweat pouring off my scalp and face in the middle of doing landscaping work.</li>
            <li>If I apply dry, it will remain relatively soft and fade through the day.</li>
            <li>I have really thick, dark hair, and I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>A little pricier, but worth every single penny.</li>
            <li>A small dab in the palm of my hand, rub palms together, then massage into wet, clean, showered hair.</li>

            <li> Love Joico Spiker and will order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many brands of gels, mousse, hairspray, and a combination of those to get my hair to stay put.  </li>
            <li> Been using the Joico Ice Spiker for many years.</li>
            <li> Favorite hair product</li>
            <li> I love the ease of it just showing up at my door and the added bonus of no shipping charges.&lt;br /&gt;THANK</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s his favorite gel.  </li>
            <li> This order was sent to him as a gift:)</li>
            <li> and I was in love.</li>
            <li> and I fell in love with it every since.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Actually looks best about 4 hours after application.</li>
            <li> L.A. Looks brands when I had more hair.  </li>
            <li> it comes right out looking good.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for getting subborn hair to stay in place and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase, getting ready to re-order!</li>
            <li> Other gels get flakey or don&#x27;t hold up, but I have to say, this is the best.</li>
            <li> But, it washes out quite easily.  </li>
            <li> Washes away easy with water.</li>
            <li> where I started 2 years ago, searching for a strong hair glue again from scratch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this online because the local hair places were selling it anywhere from 21-23 dollars LOL.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s waterproof which is fantastic and it doesn&#x27;t glob up or attract any flying bugs like some hair product.</li>
            <li> Super strong but not so strong it will stab you in the face.</li>
            <li> HOLDS HAIR REALLY WELL!!!</li>
            <li> find a replacement for their original formula</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant sweet smell - kind of a light vanilla but not a strong girly vanilla.  </li>
            <li> Dries tacky and thick, but excellent for intended purpose.  </li>
            <li> I have had it in for almost 12 hours now with no flaking and it is still as strong as it was when I first put it in.</li>
            <li> The salt is a different hair follicle than the once light brown follicle, it has a mind of its own.</li>
            <li> Overall a good product and worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works Great To Hold Up A Curled Mustache, And Lasts All Day Without Drooping At All, And Only A Very Lit</li>
            <li> - really works (like glue) but washes out easily.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Pauly D was not wrong about this product!</li>
            <li> I have fine straight hair and this holds my hair in any hairstyle I want.</li>
            <li> Style mostly with my fingers as I blow dry and my short hair looks great with lots of volume, body and shine.</li>
            <li> My package shipped very quickly and was much more economical than buying in the local hair stylist shops that carry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additional Information - Smells great, and gives you a little shine to give you a sleek look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This also smells good, washes out more easily than most other spikers, and actually makes your heir really soft when you wash it out for some reason.</li>
            <li> It is very water resistant and even being exposed to light rainy days</li>
            <li> Great for the messy look or the spike look or just to add volume.  </li>
            <li> as good as i expected</li>
            <li> I came across this product from researching online about what will be a good product to spike my hair since I have thick hair, and many recommended this.</li>
            <li> This is the only one that both held my hair and provided a nice shine.</li>
            <li> My favorite styling gel so far.</li>
            <li> It sticks but isn&#x27;t sticky; it holds but comes right out.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> I have very soft, fine hair that if you even look at it it falls out of place.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it isn&#x27;t oily or greasy, which is great for fine or thin hair.</li>
            <li> Good product holds my edges down all day</li>
            <li> Exactly as listed, cheaper than the salon price, was what I was looking to order.  </li>
            <li> , my hair held up pretty well.  </li>
            <li> hope I helped, thank you so much for reading!</li>
            <li> used this on my coarse hair for a side comb style, and it works better than any high-numbered hair gel on the market.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s this bottle and a big one with a pump if you need more than 5 ounces.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and 1 bottle lasts for a very long time; been using it for over a year and still have tons left</li>
            <li> I love this product so much that I even get the Spiker Glue in colors, I love the Pink to add some WOW to my tips.</li>
            <li> this stuff hold tall and straight and has very little moisture, which is good because i have curly hair</li>
            <li> I rub it in, then I scrunch it after it is dry, rubbing most of it into my hair.  </li>
            <li> It definitely keeps shape, and it washes out easily.</li>
            <li> It just seems like they added more water to this formula so it takes longer to dry</li>
            <li> It really makes my flat-top stand up and stay up.  </li>
            <li> so I bought it on here to surprise her because it was much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really the premier spiker glue/gel on the market.</li>
            <li> Had a quarter life crisis and decided to turn the fauxhawk into a real mohawk.</li>
            <li> but i blow it straight and any moisture in my product causes curls.</li>
            <li> My son absolutely loves this product.</li>
            <li> He says it really holds his hair in place when he spikes it up.</li>
            <li> This product is just what I was looking for thank you so much.  </li>
            <li> I really appreciate their option for no shipping charge.  </li>
            <li> gel holds MUCH stronger if your hair is damp when you put it in.</li>
            <li> i really like this product</li>
            <li> (nothing is strong enough) and this new version just isnt doing what it used to.  </li>
            <li> much better then other brands i have used</li>
            <li> Well, I am glad I gave this one a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now fellow amazon shoppers, keep in mind that I have really thick hair and every product I was using wasn&#x27;t giving me the full spike I really needed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve used in my hair for most of the last decade.  </li>
            <li> (in the yellow squirt bottle) that stuff is like super glue, this is like a moldable milder glue.</li>
            <li> Small amount of this gel goes a long way works great</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product but a bit expensive</li>
            <li> One hour later and most of my hair has already bent over (hair is about 1.5 inches long).  </li>
            <li> I do the messy look like most guys.</li>
            <li> It;s so hard to find this product in salons from where I am from so buying it here make its very easy for me.</li>
            <li> , doesn&#x27;t dry too quickly so it gives me time to comb it the way i want it.</li>
            <li> I have used many products in the past.</li>
            <li> It held strong and instantly, no waiting for it to dry to get my shape.  </li>
            <li> Easily washes out with shampoo, and off your hands with plain water.</li>
            <li> Even in the morning after I wake up and my hair is all flat on one side, all I have to do is a quick brushing and finger styling, and it&#x27;s back, day after day.  </li>
            <li> This was a reasonably priced product compared to the larger specialty stores that sell hair products.</li>
            <li> My hair naturally wants to fall toward my face and this Joico product keeps it back with a soft professional look throughout my business day and evening.</li>
            <li> Ok but not nearly as strong as Hard Up by Short Sexy Hair.  </li>
            <li> It needed to be retrained, and I had only been an avid gel man prior.  </li>
            <li> My husband has very straight and thick hair, and absolutely swears by Spiker Glue!</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s easy to wash out (at least part of it) with just a bit of water.</li>
            <li> It spiked up super strong, even against my thick, heavy, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have tried different hair gels but this one by far is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t have any chemicals in my hair, so I was surprised with the coverage.  </li>
            <li> But I would prefer if they would just bring back the old formula</li>
            <li> I dont want to have to resort to mixing my own hair care products because it is timely and expensive</li>
            <li> I am sad to drop the rating but in my experience this product isn&#x27;t a good investment for the long term.</li>
            <li> If you have stubborn hair and have been looking high and low for a hair product that will keep your hair in place, look no further, this is the only thing you&#x27;ll need.</li>
            <li> First day when I was trying this glue, to tell you the truth I didn&#x27;t have much expectation because of my previous experiences with other products.</li>
            <li> I have super thick and super stiff hair.  </li>
            <li> It holds down my hair very very well and last for days</li>
            <li> Im on my last tube of the old stuff and am going to be back</li>
            <li> Makes my hair extra sharp and sleek for the whole day.</li>
            <li> It barely melts at all even with sweat pouring off my scalp and face in the middle of doing landscaping work.</li>
            <li> If I apply dry, it will remain relatively soft and fade through the day.</li>
            <li> I have really thick, dark hair, and I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> A little pricier, but worth every single penny.</li>
            <li> A small dab in the palm of my hand, rub palms together, then massage into wet, clean, showered hair.</li>
            <li> It gives your hair so much volume without making it too stiff.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been using it for about four years on a daily basis - it keeps his hair styled all day long.</li>
            <li> I usally write long reviews but for this product it won&#x27;t be necessary.</li>
            <li> Long lasting hold.</li>
            <li> I let go of it and is not strong enough to fight hairs natural waves and curls.  </li>
            <li> I have short fine hair, dirty blonde colored.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair up all day long.</li>
            <li> I also use Got2B Glue, but that tends to flake after a long time.</li>
            <li> The 5.1 ounce size lasts me a long time (about 3-4 months).  </li>
            <li> (long runs)</li>
            <li> It comes out in an almost thick lotion form, but once you rub it in, it gets sticky and really holds the hair</li>
            <li> In a pinch I&#x27;ve tried &amp;#34;Got-2-Bee&amp;#34; and various other hair glues, none held as promptly as this, nor as long.  </li>
            <li> I would apply to dry hair.</li>
            <li> I do have some issues getting the dry application to style</li>
            <li> I asked the people during a hair cut what they would recommend to hold hair where I put it and not take tons of dry time.  </li>
            <li> I use this gel everyday, i love the way it spikes up my hair can&#x27;t go wrong with this gel</li>
            <li> The effects and looks differences between wet and dry application give a lot of room for styling.</li>
            <li> and you only need a little to do the job.</li>
            <li> If my hair is damp when I style, it will firm up solid as a rock!</li>
            <li> It does not in any way maker your hair look wet and it isn&#x27;t crunchy.</li>
            <li> Just run wet hands through it.</li>
            <li> If you watch Jersey Shore and see the absurd hair styles on there (mainly Pauly D), it&#x27;s the same stuff he uses.     </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> He has tried other gels that just do not work as well with keep his hair in place.</li>
            <li> Other gels seem to look clumpy but this one you see his hair and not the gel clumps.</li>
            <li> I have been getting this product for years because all the other ones they sell at salons don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> Wet your hair a little bit and put this stuff in.</li>
            <li> I put a small amount on my palms and rub it in after a shampoo while my hair is wet.</li>
            <li> (needed to retrain this mess).  </li>
            <li> shapes my hair the way i want, and stays firm all day.</li>
            <li> Not as harsh of a hold as Got 2 be glue</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few others over the years and they just can&#x27;t hold up to Joico&#x27;s Ice Spiker.</li>
            <li> I would totally recommend for people with thin hair type.  </li>
            <li> If you apply it with wet hair, you&#x27;ll get a very wet dog look - not attractive at all.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a stiff gel.</li>
            <li> you just walked past, put it in a ziplock bag in your vehicle console or glove box and it will pay for your yearly supply of spiker.</li>
            <li> The styling glue is having a hard time keeping my hair up</li>
            <li> Its the only product that can control my crazy hair.</li>
            <li> Have thick hair</li>
            <li> My age has caused some serious salt and pepper.</li>
            <li> Also the smell is not to bad and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Im afraid that may be the case here.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s go-to hair product. He&#x27;s been using it for about four years on a daily basis - it keeps his hair styled all day long.</li>
            <li> my nephew loves this stuff, he wears a mohawk and this is the only product we have found that actually makes his hair STAY PUT!!</li>
            <li> This also smells good, washes out more easily than most other spikers, and actually makes your heir really soft when you wash it out for some reason.</li>
            <li> have been using this for over 5 years.  shapes my hair the way i want, and stays firm all day.</li>
            <li> I have use ths spiker gel and is one of the best i ever use. I buy the joico spiker and the service was excellent and i received on time. I will recomended and i will buy again. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Love this hair glue.  I have very fine hair and when I use this, it gives my hair more body and texture.  I rub it in, then I scrunch it after it is dry, rubbing most of it into my hair.  It helps my curls to stay curly.  It is a great product!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and excellent vendor!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve used in my hair for most of the last decade.  It really makes my flat-top stand up and stay up.  But, it washes out quite easily.  My barber is always commenting on how well it works.</li>
            <li> Love it - really works (like glue) but washes out easily.</li>
            <li> The wife seems to love this product so I bought it on here to surprise her because it was much cheaper. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! It barely melts at all even with sweat pouring off my scalp and face in the middle of doing landscaping work. Wet your hair a little bit and put this stuff in. Holds all night and day. I have had it in for almost 12 hours now with no flaking and it is still as strong as it was when I first put it in. Not as harsh of a hold as Got 2 be glue (in the yellow squirt bottle) that stuff is like super glue, this is like a moldable milder glue. Super strong but not so strong it will stab you in the face. I got this online because the local hair places were selling it anywhere from 21-23 dollars LOL. Ridicilous.</li>
            <li> This is the best gel ever! Pauly D was not wrong about this product! Keeps my hair up all day long.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it isn&#x27;t oily or greasy, which is great for fine or thin hair. It definitely keeps shape, and it washes out easily. I would apply to dry hair. If you apply it with wet hair, you&#x27;ll get a very wet dog look - not attractive at all.</li>
            <li> Superior to water based styling gel</li>
            <li> This gel is insanely good. It holds really good. Also the smell is not to bad and it lasts a long time. Good shine to it also. GREAT STUFF. Will buy over and over!</li>
            <li> Small amount of this gel goes a long way works great</li>
            <li> Great gel, holds my hair in place all day</li>
            <li> I have fine straight hair and this holds my hair in any hairstyle I want. I also use Got2B Glue, but that tends to flake after a long time. This doesn&#x27;t...I guess its why its more expensive. Definitely go with this if you are on the fence of either or.</li>
            <li> Dries tacky and thick, but excellent for intended purpose.  My up-do for work has never looked sleeker!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair extra sharp and sleek for the whole day.</li>
            <li> Joico Ice Spiker is the only product on the market that actually does what I want my hair to look like.  Plus just one bottle last for over a year. I love this product so much that I even get the Spiker Glue in colors, I love the Pink to add some WOW to my tips. It;s so hard to find this product in salons from where I am from so buying it here make its very easy for me. I would be lost without this product.</li>
            <li> Ok but not nearly as strong as Hard Up by Short Sexy Hair.  It does make your hair shine though.  And I have no clue why you would want water resistant gel.  Isn&#x27;t water what is used to rinse this stuff out of your hair in the shower?</li>
            <li> my son uses this get only! he loves it</li>
            <li> this stuff is like glue. My boyfriends hair doesn&#x27;t move when he uses it. He swears by it.  Give it a shot if you haven&#x27;t yet</li>
            <li> Great item. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> My husband loves this gel. It holds up the style four hours. Great product</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  A little goes a long way! Nice texture easy to apply. Can re-wet if you need to. I love it and don&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> I love this spiker. I&#x27;ve tried a few others over the years and they just can&#x27;t hold up to Joico&#x27;s Ice Spiker. If you watch Jersey Shore and see the absurd hair styles on there (mainly Pauly D), it&#x27;s the same stuff he uses.     It comes out in an almost thick lotion form, but once you rub it in, it gets sticky and really holds the hair well. It&#x27;s waterproof which is fantastic and it doesn&#x27;t glob up or attract any flying bugs like some hair product. It&#x27;s really the premier spiker glue/gel on the market.</li>
            <li> Same staff I they sele on store</li>
            <li> I love this product and was happy to see I could purchase it online at a reasonable price&lt;br /&gt;I hope I can purchase this product again</li>
            <li> Great price and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Happy to get this from amazon !! i got a better deal hear, i have been using this glue for 2 yrs ,I&#x27;m a water person,i believe it is a must..</li>
            <li> Wife used this produce and loves it.</li>
            <li> Strongest hair glue stuff on the market, enough said.</li>
            <li> Spiker is great, once you put it on, your hair doesn&#x27;t change shape. Best hair product I have ever used!</li>
            <li> A perfect product for my short spiky hair.  This was a reasonably priced product compared to the larger specialty stores that sell hair products. Love Joico Spiker and will order again.</li>
            <li> My husband puts this in this hair in the morning and his hair stays put all day. He has tried other gels that just do not work as well with keep his hair in place. Other gels seem to look clumpy but this one you see his hair and not the gel clumps. He is even able to ride his bike and wear a helmet twice in one day with his hair still looking just as awesome as it did when he first did it in the morning.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and 1 bottle lasts for a very long time; been using it for over a year and still have tons left</li>
            <li> This spiking glue is in NO WAY WATER RESISTANT</li>
            <li> Perfect for mohawks. Had a quarter life crisis and decided to turn the fauxhawk into a real mohawk. this stuff hold tall and straight and has very little moisture, which is good because i have curly hair but i blow it straight and any moisture in my product causes curls.</li>
            <li> I have super thick and super stiff hair.  I&#x27;ve used many brands of gels, mousse, hairspray, and a combination of those to get my hair to stay put.  Once I found this stuff I threw everything else out.  This stuff is like cement for your hair, once you put it in and it sets, your hair will not budge.  It has a pleasant sweet smell - kind of a light vanilla but not a strong girly vanilla.  If you need to &amp;#34;reactivate it&amp;#34; just put some water on your hands and run them through your hair and it&#x27;ll &amp;#34;re-set&amp;#34;.  If you have stubborn hair and have been looking high and low for a hair product that will keep your hair in place, look no further, this is the only thing you&#x27;ll need.</li>
            <li> Works great. Holds all day.</li>
            <li> My son absolutely loves this product.He says it really holds his hair in place when he spikes it up. Great!</li>
            <li> great gel and has the ability to withstand wind and rain for a while...much better then other brands i have used</li>
            <li> This is the BEST hair product of any kind, for me, EVER!  I put a small amount on my palms and rub it in after a shampoo while my hair is wet. Style mostly with my fingers as I blow dry and my short hair looks great with lots of volume, body and shine. Even in the morning after I wake up and my hair is all flat on one side, all I have to do is a quick brushing and finger styling, and it&#x27;s back, day after day.  I will never let myself be without this again!</li>
            <li> I have used many products in the past. None have worked as well as Spiker I have used this product since the 1999&#x27;s became the 2000 somethings. A small dab in the palm of my hand, rub palms together, then massage into wet, clean, showered hair. I then comb and part my hair following up with a brush and fingers by blow drying. My hair naturally wants to fall toward my face and this Joico product keeps it back with a soft professional look throughout my business day and evening. My age has caused some serious salt and pepper. The salt is a different hair follicle than the once light brown follicle, it has a mind of its own. Joico Spiker gives all of my hair the needed body to control it my way. No Donald Trump here! I seek out  Amazon as I travel a bit and can never seem to find Spiker when I run out and need it. I use about two tubes a year, thats about .06 of a cent per day. An inexpensive way to look your best. Every day pick up that penny on the ground you just walked past, put it in a ziplock bag in your vehicle console or glove box and it will pay for your yearly supply of spiker. No I don&#x27;t work for Joico or Amazon but I do know what works best for me!</li>
            <li> This product is just what I was looking for thank you so much.  I&#x27;m more than happy!  Definitely buying again  soon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years on my hair, at my wife&#x27;s suggestion; it&#x27;s great. It sticks but isn&#x27;t sticky; it holds but comes right out. My wife uses it on our 8-year-old son&#x27;s spike/faux hawk too and it works great. Cheaper on Amazon than at places like Ulta&#x27;s store.</li>
            <li> I have tried different hair gels but this one by far is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gives you a sexy attractive nice look&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this</li>
            <li> Product provides 24-48 hour coverage to applied areas.  I personally don&#x27;t have any chemicals in my hair, so I was surprised with the coverage.  However may leave white residue after application and the only way to get rid of this would be to wash your hair.  I would suggest this product for someone who washes their hair daily or 2-3 times weekly.  I wouldn&#x27;t suggest continued use of this product for those who was hair weekly or bi-weekly.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t know what to do without this stuff.  By far the best hair product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This gel works great.</li>
            <li> Joico Used to make a similar product, though in a silver and orange tube.  It had the same name as this product but the tube was just different colors.  It spiked up super strong, even against my thick, heavy, curly hair.  It held strong and instantly, no waiting for it to dry to get my shape.  This one droops over the instant I let go of it and is not strong enough to fight hairs natural waves and curls.  One hour later and most of my hair has already bent over (hair is about 1.5 inches long).  I dont know what they did to change the formula and why they discontinued it, but I cannot for the life of me find a replacement for their original formula (nothing is strong enough) and this new version just isnt doing what it used to.  It just seems like they added more water to this formula so it takes longer to dry so it wont instantly hold.  Nice money saving tactic Joico, just sell people water instead of product.  Im quite dissapointed in whoever made the change to this formula.  Im on my last tube of the old stuff and am going to be back where I started 2 years ago, searching for a strong hair glue again from scratch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record I work in the makeup, haircare, and personal hygeine industry.  I am a chemist who formulates this stuff and I know what corners can and are cut to make a product cheaper.  Im afraid that may be the case here.  I dont want to have to resort to mixing my own hair care products because it is timely and expensive but I may have no choice at this point in time.  Then again I could just squirt this stuff out of the tube, leave it on the bathroom counter all smeaered out for 10 minutes then wipe it back off to use it.  But I would prefer if they would just bring back the old formula so I can do my hair in 30 seconds instead of 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> HOLDS HAIR REALLY WELL!!!</li>
            <li> Been using the Joico Ice Spiker for many years. Its the only product that can control my crazy hair. Hope they never discontinue it.</li>
            <li> Favorite hair product</li>
            <li> as good as i expected</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!  This supplier is amazing!  It actually costs about the same as what I pay locally with taxes.  I really appreciate their option for no shipping charge.  Honestly, that is the reason I ordered from this company originally, but I have been VERY satisfied with the company and the product when it arrives.  I love the ease of it just showing up at my door and the added bonus of no shipping charges.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU!!!</li>
            <li> My son loves this stuff. It is like glue!!!! It will hold for the day!!!!</li>
            <li> great stufff hair looks great</li>
            <li> This Spiker Water Resistant Styling Glue is the only hair gel my husband uses now.  We were on vacation with our family and my father-in-law tried my husbands Spiker.  Now it&#x27;s his favorite gel.  This order was sent to him as a gift:)</li>
            <li> Exactly as listed, cheaper than the salon price, was what I was looking to order.  Very pleased with this purchase, getting ready to re-order!</li>
            <li> I usally write long reviews but for this product it won&#x27;t be necessary. I came across this product from researching online about what will be a good product to spike my hair since I have thick hair, and many recommended this. I looked it up on amazon and there was a great deal on it. I thought to myself, hey why not? got nothing to lose. Well, I am glad I gave this one a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now fellow amazon shoppers, keep in mind that I have really thick hair and every product I was using wasn&#x27;t giving me the full spike I really needed. First day when I was trying this glue, to tell you the truth I didn&#x27;t have much expectation because of my previous experiences with other products. As soon as I put it on my hair and styled it, my hair stayed just in place and I was in love. It is very water resistant and even being exposed to light rainy days, my hair held up pretty well.  Overall a good product and worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional Information - Smells great, and gives you a little shine to give you a sleek look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope I helped, thank you so much for reading! If you need any additional information on this product let me know, and I will respond quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDITED 10/23/12 - Hey fellow amazon shoppers, well it seems like after months of usage this product isn&#x27;t performing as well as it used to. The styling glue is having a hard time keeping my hair up and it&#x27;s leaving white residues all over. I am sad to drop the rating but in my experience this product isn&#x27;t a good investment for the long term.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a dozen hair products over the years. This is the only one that both held my hair and provided a nice shine. I have really thick, dark hair, and I love this stuff. Plus, it&#x27;s easy to wash out (at least part of it) with just a bit of water. It&#x27;s amazing. Gotta wait for a good price on it though, it changes all the time on this site.</li>
            <li> I am constantly changing from one hair styling product to another. I have short fine hair, dirty blonde colored. Other gels get flakey or don&#x27;t hold up, but I have to say, this is the best. I will never use another gel. This \\&quot;styling glue\\&quot; holds my hair any way I style it, doesn&#x27;t dry too quickly so it gives me time to comb it the way i want it. It holds it until I wash it out (3+ days) without flaking. Washes out easily, and has a REALLY nice shine. I would highly recommend it to anyone. A little pricier, but worth every single penny.</li>
            <li> Good product holds my edges down all day</li>
            <li> I love it!!! It holds down my hair very very well and last for days and you only need a little to do the job.My stylist used it on my hair and I fell in love with it every since.</li>
            <li> Love the product!! Have thick hair this product holds it great! Been using this product for awhile now. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> For men&#x27;s hair vanity product, it works well.</li>
            <li> I have been getting this product for years because all the other ones they sell at salons don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel holds MUCH stronger if your hair is damp when you put it in. If I apply dry, it will remain relatively soft and fade through the day. If my hair is damp when I style, it will firm up solid as a rock! My favorite styling gel so far.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years, wash, apply &amp; go !</li>
            <li> It is not water resistant like it said it was. It was a very  good gel during the day do</li>
            <li> This product works well.  It is perfect for getting subborn hair to stay in place and lasts a long time.  The best part is how easy it comes out when washed.</li>
            <li> i really like this product</li>
            <li> this is thebest gor shortnhair</li>
            <li> I use this gel everyday, i love the way it spikes up my hair can&#x27;t go wrong with this gel</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I would totally recommend for people with thin hair type.  It gives your hair so much volume without making it too stiff.  My package shipped very quickly and was much more economical than buying in the local hair stylist shops that carry.</li>
            <li> I have very soft, fine hair that if you even look at it it falls out of place. I&#x27;ve tried just about gel, pomme, wax etc out there and nothing holds as well as this. The effects and looks differences between wet and dry application give a lot of room for styling. I do have some issues getting the dry application to style right but my hair is also a bit over 5 inches.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy another hair gel ever. I do the messy look like most guys. But my hair loves to goto a point in the front. This gel keeps it stuck strait up. Even when I wear a winter hat it comes right out looking good. Actually looks best about 4 hours after application. It does not in any way maker your hair look wet and it isn&#x27;t crunchy.</li>
            <li> This sells for $15.95 at Supercuts.  I got 2 bottles with shipping for under $30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this on my coarse hair for a side comb style, and it works better than any high-numbered hair gel on the market.  It also doesn&#x27;t look like dandruff when its combed out.  Easily washes out with shampoo, and off your hands with plain water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this spiker for about 4 years now.  I love it!  Great for the messy look or the spike look or just to add volume.  The 5.1 ounce size lasts me a long time (about 3-4 months).  If you fly, buy the 2.5 ounce size.</li>
            <li> Came out of bootcamp, couldn&#x27;t get my hair to stay in any sort of fashion.  It needed to be retrained, and I had only been an avid gel man prior.  Used those L.A. Looks brands when I had more hair.  I asked the people during a hair cut what they would recommend to hold hair where I put it and not take tons of dry time.  (needed to retrain this mess).  They gave me this bottle and I have never gone back to anything else.  In a pinch I&#x27;ve tried &amp;#34;Got-2-Bee&amp;#34; and various other hair glues, none held as promptly as this, nor as long.  Spiker stays where you put your hair, and after completing exercises (long runs) in the rain it will still be in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it is semi water resistant, it will wash out very easily with shampoo (or soap of any kind) and/or warm water.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend since this is the only gel he swears by. Keeps his hair in place and doesn&#x27;t leave any flaky messes.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this styling glue for years and it&#x27;s the only thing that will actually keep his hair where it needs to be throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Great product, great seller.</li>
            <li> My husband has very straight and thick hair, and absolutely swears by Spiker Glue! He&#x27;s been using it for almost 10 years now !</li>
            <li> Great product but a bit expensive</li>
            <li> Holds my hair so well I am no longer shampooing daily to get rid of bed head.  Just run wet hands through it.</li>
            <li> Works Great To Hold Up A Curled Mustache, And Lasts All Day Without Drooping At All, And Only A Very Lit But Is Needed</li>
            <li> Best hair glue out there</li>
            <li> Great hair glue. It&#x27;s the strongest kind I&#x27;ve tried and never had any issues with it. Long lasting hold. Washes away easy with water. There&#x27;s this bottle and a big one with a pump if you need more than 5 ounces. Can&#x27;t recommend this stuff enough if regular gel isn&#x27;t enough to hold your hair style...this is it.</li>
            <li> what i order, in a great price</li>
            <li> The only product I use to spike my hair and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a stiff gel.</li>
