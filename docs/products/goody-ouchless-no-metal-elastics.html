    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>These are perfect.</li>
            <li>Great elastics that don&#x27;t break!</li>
            <li>They are just the perfect hair tie.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re perfect for my hair.</li>
            <li>AND IT WAS GREAT</li>
            <li>For what these are and for the price they worked great.</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE them!!</li>
            <li>They work best on really fine hair.</li>
            <li>Not as stretchy as I would&#x27;ve liked</li>
            <li>i meant to buy the 4mm version of these, but it&#x27;s my own fault for not reading the description too closely and just throwing it in my cart.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re the perfect thickness for my thin hair and are still incredibly stretchy!</li>
            <li>What more can you say about hair ties.</li>
            <li>In this country, most of these elastics have a seam for some reason, which make them break easily.</li>
            <li>And WOW you get so many, this was a really great deal.</li>
            <li>but I would say these curl and stretch out easily.</li>
            <li>These do not break at the seams easily.</li>
            <li>These do break quite easily but for the price, oh well.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and the thicker ones don&#x27;t hold as well for me.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re cheap.</li>
            <li>Great hair ties, you can never have enough of these.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re comfortable and do not snag on hair.</li>
            <li>The ones that don&#x27;t break work really well though for what it&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;re not stuck with a funny hair</li>
            <li>, that is way stretchier and does not break the first time you try to put it in your hair.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using goody ouchless since middle school to keep my very thick hair in check, and they&#x27;re always of very good quality (i use two of the 4mm ones at once, and they can last me for weeks even with daily/nightly use).</li>
            <li>I figured out that they are fine as long as I double up on hair ties, though.</li>
            <li>Fit on small wrists too.</li>
            <li>Very useful for thick hair.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t have enough elastic, so they barely stretch..  </li>

            <li> I know they won&#x27;t last as long for me as the sturdy fat ones do.</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t expect them to scratch your butt for you or anything like that you won&#x27;t be disapointed.</li>
            <li> basic thin hair ties.</li>
            <li> picture is not accurate</li>
            <li> Take the photo off your listing, it&#x27;s not accurate!</li>
            <li> (i&#x27;ll just need to use like three of them on my thick hair at once).</li>
            <li> SO SERIOUSLY I FEEL SCAMMED AND CHEATED</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t have to so often now with these tough onse.</li>
            <li> These are the thin style of elastic band.</li>
            <li> These were unfortunately TOO thin for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Goody.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not too bad for how inexpensive they are.</li>
            <li> DISAPPOINTED IS A UNDERSTATEMENT!!!!</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re terrible.  </li>
            <li> These hair twisties are awful.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> basic thin hair ties. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I FEEL RIPPED OFF!!!!!! I BOUGHT THIS FOR THE RING I USE TO HAVE ONE AND IT WAS GREAT BUT COULDN&#x27;T FIND A REPLACEMENT TILL NOW.... DISAPPOINTED IS A UNDERSTATEMENT!!!! YOU SHOULD CHANGE THE PICTURE IF THE RING ISN&#x27;T INCLUDED I HAVE ALWAYS TRUSTED AMAZON BECAUSE WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET... BUT NOT IN THIS CASE SO SERIOUSLY I FEEL SCAMMED AND CHEATED SO NO STARS IF I COULD BUT SINCE I HAVE TO GIVE STARS YOU ONLY GET ONE!!!</li>
            <li> Just what my daughter was looking for.</li>
            <li> For what these are and for the price they worked great. Being a guy (growing my hair to donate) I just needed something to tie my hair back all day and not break constantly; these did just that.</li>
            <li> Did not come with ring shown in picture, that is the only reason I ordered it. picture is not accurate</li>
            <li> Has been one of my go-to hair ties for years. These are the thin style of elastic band. I have fine hair and the thicker ones don&#x27;t hold as well for me. These are perfect.</li>
            <li> Great elastics that don&#x27;t break! Fit on small wrists too. Very useful for thick hair.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Goody. They are just the perfect hair tie. And WOW you get so many, this was a really great deal.</li>
            <li> Not as stretchy as I would&#x27;ve liked but it works on my short hair</li>
            <li> These are not the fat elastics- my mistake- but I would say these curl and stretch out easily. But they do their job- I know they won&#x27;t last as long for me as the sturdy fat ones do.</li>
            <li> Aaaaaaaand they&#x27;re cheap. What more can you say about hair ties. As long as you don&#x27;t expect them to scratch your butt for you or anything like that you won&#x27;t be disapointed.</li>
            <li> These do not break at the seams easily. In this country, most of these elastics have a seam for some reason, which make them break easily. Perhaps so we have to keep buying them? I won&#x27;t have to so often now with these tough onse.</li>
            <li> These do break quite easily but for the price, oh well. Just always have back-ups in your car, purse, and desk so you&#x27;re not stuck with a funny hair do while you&#x27;re out of your house! I would say 1 in 3 or 4 break so it&#x27;s not too bad for how inexpensive they are. The ones that don&#x27;t break work really well though for what it&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THESE...  they&#x27;re terrible.  These hair twisties are awful.  They don&#x27;t have enough elastic, so they barely stretch..  they just break.  I couldn&#x27;t even wrap one around my hair twice without it breaking.  they are a piece of junk.  I do not recommend these at all.  I recommend using a different brand, like scunci, that is way stretchier and does not break the first time you try to put it in your hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the metal ring and received an item without it. Take the photo off your listing, it&#x27;s not accurate!</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE them!! They&#x27;re perfect for my hair. I look for these everywhere and never could find them. They&#x27;re the perfect thickness for my thin hair and are still incredibly stretchy!</li>
            <li> Great hair ties, you can never have enough of these. They work best on really fine hair.</li>
            <li> These were unfortunately TOO thin for my thick hair. They snap and break often. I figured out that they are fine as long as I double up on hair ties, though. They&#x27;re comfortable and do not snag on hair.</li>
            <li> i meant to buy the 4mm version of these, but it&#x27;s my own fault for not reading the description too closely and just throwing it in my cart. but these are just the thinner version and work just as well (i&#x27;ll just need to use like three of them on my thick hair at once). i&#x27;ve been using goody ouchless since middle school to keep my very thick hair in check, and they&#x27;re always of very good quality (i use two of the 4mm ones at once, and they can last me for weeks even with daily/nightly use).</li>
