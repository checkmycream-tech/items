            <li>The quality of hold can&#x27;t be disputed, but it does not make my hair pleasant to touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>product itself is really good.  </li>

            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>But, then I liked it.  </li>
            <li>It kind of smells like you just came home from the club.</li>
            <li>Holds nicely</li>
            <li>This is a very strong hold hair goo.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply, so far i am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>and this is the best by far.</li>
            <li>and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Great hold, not greasy, not dry, lasts all day and night, great smell.</li>
            <li>and I would not be able to do without it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Okay.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok...</li>
            <li>It is much more pliable and better for piece-ing the hair.</li>
            <li>Love the product, but my barber sells it for $25.  </li>
            <li>It does not have an overwhelming perfume odor nor is it chemical smelling.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a sexy hair smell.  </li>
            <li>this stuff isn&#x27;t greasy, doesn&#x27;t leave many flakes (unless you reapply and don&#x27;t wash over and over and over).  </li>
            <li>This is a love.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit more of a hold.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different hair paste and i found this one to be the best.</li>
            <li>And after having it for about a month the smell has not been any better.</li>
            <li>It would work better if my hair was shorter</li>
            <li>I just love the packaging.</li>
            <li>onto the actual product: it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li>I also love that it&#x27;s matte because I don&#x27;t like the shiny look.</li>
            <li>This product is so much better than what I was</li>
            <li>This is the best definer for short hair.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>hair paste wouldn&#x27;t sound appealing, however it is super effective where gel isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>iv&#x27;e tried many products, from cheap to pricy</li>
            <li>All in all it doesn&#x27;t take much to get a good look</li>
            <li>Lasts all day, Very maleable, smells good.</li>
            <li>it is easy.</li>
            <li>The Night Rider is wonderful -- only a dime sized amount does the trick for the whole day!</li>
            <li>Super!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and strong...</li>
            <li>It has a light citrus smell that would be fine for men or women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my hair kind of oily and doesn&#x27;t hold very well.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>The Night Rider product lasts a long time and it gives me great control without being all gunky.  </li>
            <li>Unique product.</li>
            <li>well worth trying!</li>
            <li>Hold lasts all day long and my hair looks great until evening.  </li>
            <li>Product is unique and affects your hair style in a significant way.</li>
            <li>I got an amazing new haircut and my stylist recommended this product.  </li>
            <li>My friend has thinner but a full head of hair and won&#x27;t buy anything else.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cool and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li>so thats cool too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like $15 right now with free Prime shipping.</li>
            <li>Otherwise love and live by this stuff.</li>
            <li>I add more if necessary, but best to start with small amount and add.  </li>
            <li>It adds tons of body and texture to my fine straight hair.</li>
            <li>Did not do what I wanted because my hair is too fine and straight.</li>
            <li>A good quarter of it was empty.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have naturally oily skin and hair so most products by the end of day</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li>Pricy but very much worth it.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re like me, and you want soft hair that seems almost untouched by product but has good shape to it check out the Enjoy Dry Wax.</li>
            <li>Being more of a waxy substance, it&#x27;s harder to work with compared to Easy Rider etc.  </li>
            <li>This seller shipped it super fast, got it within a couple of days of purchasing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is THE best hair product for that short messy look.</li>
            <li>Though on hot sweaty days it could wear off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always gotten this from the woman that cuts my hair, as she is the only salon in the area that even carries it, but I haven&#x27;t been able to see her in a while and needed hair product.</li>
            <li>As with everything they make that I have tried so far, this stuff smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>The first time I bought it it was from my hairstylist.</li>
            <li>I love the Matt Texture Paste, but I can get it for 20 bucks from my salon back in Cleveland...</li>
            <li>looks very natural and clean.</li>
            <li>a good value, you get soo much compared to other &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; product!</li>
            <li>Product was good quality but this seller charges DOUBLE the actual cost.</li>
            <li>Only use a nickel sized amount in your hands and it will last you a good 3 months.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a large investment for hair</li>
            <li>I have short, fine blond hair.  </li>
            <li>If you like a messy short style - or great hold for any style - try this out.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll be much happier.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think smells too much like perfume.</li>
            <li>and I really like the consistency.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave any oily/crunchy feeling, and its very malleable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Davines Clay or Mitch Reformer seem MUCH stronger on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I like the stuff, but I absolutely don&#x27;t understand the price of it.</li>
            <li>It leaves it very sticky, and just doesn&#x27;t do what I hoped for.</li>
            <li>and I do not put much thought into my hair at all.</li>
            <li>It also holds up very well to things like sweat, excess movement, etc.</li>
            <li>but I recommend wetting your hair, gently towel drying it</li>
            <li>I also like the fact the product washes out really easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a subtle citrus smell which is super nice.</li>
            <li>Lightly and evenly, don&#x27;t &amp;#34;push&amp;#34; it through your hair with flat hands.</li>
            <li>It also washes out easily, and comes right off of your hands without leaving them a sticky, greasy mess.  </li>
            <li>I have been letting my hair dry naturally and have the messy/piecy look that I LOVE.  </li>
            <li>The hold is fantastic and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>The container was only about 75% full.  </li>
            <li>and when I put it on for the first time it smelled like an old smokey man that sat in a bar all day.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff - have tried a million different products for my short hair - which I like to wear rather \\&quot;messy\\&quot; -</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I know the price seems high</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this stuff if your looking for a no sheen</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>If it gets limp (from people touching it etc), all you need is to dampen your palms and run it through your hair and reshape.</li>
            <li>but it adds so much body to my limp fine hair.</li>
            <li>take a little out with the back of my thumbnail, warm it in my hands and then run it through my damp hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This would be better if my hair were straight and not as thick.</li>
            <li>Good product for thick, short hair.</li>
            <li>Exact same size!</li>
            <li>Just a little bit lasts me throughout an entire twelve (or more) hour day.</li>
            <li>My hair is very thick and straight, about two inches on the top and front</li>
            <li>Unfortunately you&#x27;d have to use WAY too much for such great hold on short hair.     </li>
            <li>My only gripe is that the scent is very &#x27;manly&#x27;.</li>
            <li>After that, you&#x27;ll notice you can grab and style your hair, it&#x27;ll hold the shape and look like it just naturally took that on.</li>
            <li>Thought it would have a stronger hold then Gritty Business, but not so much.</li>
            <li>Last the whole day.</li>
            <li>My product came and was obviously old.  </li>
            <li>Sorry if this review isn&#x27;t fair to people who have hair that it works well with.</li>
            <li>It provides good hold for the days just following my haircut, but tends to get sticky and gunky as my hair grows and becomes thick and coarse again.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for over a year now and it holds better and is less sticky than other products I have used.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased hair product that holds my very thick hair better than this.</li>
            <li>The first box lasted almost a  year so a little goes a long way</li>

            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily skin and hair so most products by the end of day</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li> Pricy but very much worth it.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re like me, and you want soft hair that seems almost untouched by product but has good shape to it check out the Enjoy Dry Wax.</li>
            <li> Being more of a waxy substance, it&#x27;s harder to work with compared to Easy Rider etc.  </li>
            <li> This seller shipped it super fast, got it within a couple of days of purchasing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is THE best hair product for that short messy look.</li>
            <li> Though on hot sweaty days it could wear off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always gotten this from the woman that cuts my hair, as she is the only salon in the area that even carries it, but I haven&#x27;t been able to see her in a while and needed hair product.</li>
            <li> As with everything they make that I have tried so far, this stuff smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> The first time I bought it it was from my hairstylist.</li>
            <li> I love the Matt Texture Paste, but I can get it for 20 bucks from my salon back in Cleveland...</li>
            <li> looks very natural and clean.</li>
            <li> a good value, you get soo much compared to other &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; product!</li>
            <li> Product was good quality but this seller charges DOUBLE the actual cost.</li>
            <li> Only use a nickel sized amount in your hands and it will last you a good 3 months.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a large investment for hair</li>
            <li> I have short, fine blond hair.  </li>
            <li> If you like a messy short style - or great hold for any style - try this out.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll be much happier.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think smells too much like perfume.</li>
            <li> and I really like the consistency.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any oily/crunchy feeling, and its very malleable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Davines Clay or Mitch Reformer seem MUCH stronger on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I like the stuff, but I absolutely don&#x27;t understand the price of it.</li>
            <li> It leaves it very sticky, and just doesn&#x27;t do what I hoped for.</li>
            <li> and I do not put much thought into my hair at all.</li>
            <li> It also holds up very well to things like sweat, excess movement, etc.</li>
            <li> but I recommend wetting your hair, gently towel drying it</li>
            <li> I also like the fact the product washes out really easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a subtle citrus smell which is super nice.</li>
            <li> Lightly and evenly, don&#x27;t &amp;#34;push&amp;#34; it through your hair with flat hands.</li>
            <li> It also washes out easily, and comes right off of your hands without leaving them a sticky, greasy mess.  </li>
            <li> I have been letting my hair dry naturally and have the messy/piecy look that I LOVE.  </li>
            <li> The hold is fantastic and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The container was only about 75% full.  </li>
            <li> and when I put it on for the first time it smelled like an old smokey man that sat in a bar all day.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff - have tried a million different products for my short hair - which I like to wear rather \\&quot;messy\\&quot; -</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I know the price seems high</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this stuff if your looking for a no sheen</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> If it gets limp (from people touching it etc), all you need is to dampen your palms and run it through your hair and reshape.</li>
            <li> but it adds so much body to my limp fine hair.</li>
            <li> take a little out with the back of my thumbnail, warm it in my hands and then run it through my damp hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This would be better if my hair were straight and not as thick.</li>
            <li> Good product for thick, short hair.</li>
            <li> Exact same size!</li>
            <li> Just a little bit lasts me throughout an entire twelve (or more) hour day.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and straight, about two inches on the top and front</li>
            <li> Unfortunately you&#x27;d have to use WAY too much for such great hold on short hair.     </li>
            <li> My only gripe is that the scent is very &#x27;manly&#x27;.</li>
            <li> After that, you&#x27;ll notice you can grab and style your hair, it&#x27;ll hold the shape and look like it just naturally took that on.</li>
            <li> Thought it would have a stronger hold then Gritty Business, but not so much.</li>
            <li> Last the whole day.</li>
            <li> My product came and was obviously old.  </li>
            <li> Sorry if this review isn&#x27;t fair to people who have hair that it works well with.</li>
            <li> It provides good hold for the days just following my haircut, but tends to get sticky and gunky as my hair grows and becomes thick and coarse again.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year now and it holds better and is less sticky than other products I have used.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased hair product that holds my very thick hair better than this.</li>
            <li> The first box lasted almost a  year so a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> That stuff works so well with my thick hair, just take a small/medium finger tips worth and rub it into your hands until it warms up then run your fingers through your hair as if they were brush fingers.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t speak for how this would work for long hair, but if you have short hair I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day long and doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel all sticky and gross.  </li>
            <li> Casual elegance is how i describe the result of using  Night Rider Matte texture Paste, tousled, doesn&#x27;t tkae shine away, and holds easily.  </li>
            <li> Eufora Hero for Men Texture Putty is much stronger for less than half the price.  </li>
            <li> Mighty dang expensive fer us country folk,</li>
            <li> If I perspire a little, I just dampen (not wet or soak!)</li>
            <li> se;;er was extremely responsive and I had the product within 2 days at regular shipping rates.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> It was yellow in color when it should be white and was a bit dried out.  </li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m a guy with medium length, very thick hair.</li>
            <li> It says you can apply it wet or dry</li>
            <li> I like the messy look and use Night Rider with both short and long hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that is is a bit more expensive then the other products out there.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too oily and not too wet.</li>
            <li> (so it&#x27;s still damp but not soaking wet) and then applying night rider (by rubbing it between your palms and then applying into your hair).</li>
            <li> I was turned on to Night Rider by a friend a few years ago, and I&#x27;ve never looked back.</li>
            <li> Your hair has to be completely dry!!  </li>
            <li> My friend is a hairstylist for (6 years) and has always been able to work with my very thick hair, she was shocked by the high price/lacking results.</li>
            <li> but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> this was the only product that has not been  shiny, oily, greasy, and can last all day long without fail.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to find products for women with short hair.</li>
            <li> The product closure was broken upon arrival which has me concerned about how long the paste will hold with constant exposure to the elements.</li>
            <li> The only negative is the cost.</li>
            <li> the wax/paste either didn&#x27;t have enough hold, or was too thick to work in.  </li>
            <li> I have short, thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have maybe an inch and a half of hair all over</li>
            <li> I use about a dime-sized amount - on the tips to bring my hair down or on the roots to bring it up - and it stays ALL DAY!</li>
            <li> I use this on my gf who has short very thick curly/wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> Not too greasy, holds and not too heavy.</li>
            <li> Really firm hold and moldable.</li>
            <li> And, it holds without being &#x27;look, i&#x27;m a douche with a firm hold.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> I like a firm hold that doesn&#x27;t look like you are using a lot of product, and this does the trick.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look stiff.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t stiff or crunchy, but somehow this product manages to hold the style all day.  </li>
            <li> That is typical of this product type though, and it certainly isn&#x27;t difficult to work with, it&#x27;s just different.  </li>
            <li> It makes your hair very heavy, even with just a little bit used.</li>
            <li> The first time I got it it didn&#x27;t have that bad of an odor.</li>
            <li> and I use a #2 with my clippers for the back and sides, so finding something to style my hair without making me look like a porcupine was a difficult task.</li>
            <li> swipe just a tiny bit and rub vigorously between your palms until it gets a lot of &#x27;friction&#x27; (and it feels difficult to rub your hands together).  </li>
            <li> My go-to hair product for the past 4 years...</li>
            <li> but I am definately not satisfied.</li>
            <li> Too hard and stiff to use.  </li>
            <li> It is getting hard to find</li>
            <li> Rotten, vile chemical smell, and thick paste is hard to spread around without clumping.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;my delicate locks.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just my advice to anyone with thick hair like me.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re used to lathering stuff on, please don&#x27;t do it with this stuff because it&#x27;s a waste and is completely unnecessary.</li>
            <li> Now, I don&#x27;t mean this doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I hated the smell of this at first.  </li>
            <li> It also has a smell (not totally pleasant).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Either way, it&#x27;s a tough one to suggest..</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is not particularly pleasant; it is difficult to describe.</li>
            <li> It was an expensive experiment.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s a mere $20..</li>
            <li> This stuff is not for the faint of heart.</li>
            <li> very annoying.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My hair is very thick and straight, about two inches on the top and front and I use a #2 with my clippers for the back and sides, so finding something to style my hair without making me look like a porcupine was a difficult task. Night Rider is amazing! I use about a dime-sized amount - on the tips to bring my hair down or on the roots to bring it up - and it stays ALL DAY! If I perspire a little, I just dampen (not wet or soak!) my hair with water and restyle and voila! Had this box for over three months and I&#x27;m just a quarter of the way through it. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Kevin Murphy makes me so happy!! I have maybe an inch and a half of hair all over and it&#x27;s hard to find products for women with short hair. The Night Rider is wonderful -- only a dime sized amount does the trick for the whole day! Pleasant smell and doesn&#x27;t leave your hands feeling tacky all day. I used Sticky Business before I had all of my hair chopped off, and it was equally as wonderful. Unfortunately you&#x27;d have to use WAY too much for such great hold on short hair.     Super!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for awhile. Not too greasy, holds and not too heavy. Though on hot sweaty days it could wear off.</li>
            <li> Too hard and stiff to use.  Buy the sticky Business Medium hold instead.  you&#x27;ll be much happier.  trust me on this one.</li>
            <li> The container was only about 75% full.  A good quarter of it was empty.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I have a short pixie cut and I would not be able to do without it.  You really dont need that much, and my stylist taught me the secret to &#x27;prepping&#x27; it...swipe just a tiny bit and rub vigorously between your palms until it gets a lot of &#x27;friction&#x27; (and it feels difficult to rub your hands together).  My only gripe is that the scent is very &#x27;manly&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This is a very strong hold hair goo. I think it&#x27;s great, only it costs a fortune, that&#x27;s why the rating was reduced from 5 stars !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always gotten this from the woman that cuts my hair, as she is the only salon in the area that even carries it, but I haven&#x27;t been able to see her in a while and needed hair product. Very happy with delivery speed, and as always it is a great product.</li>
            <li> This is the only hair paste I have found that my husband likes and I don&#x27;t think smells too much like perfume. It is getting hard to find so i am very happy it is avaliable here.</li>
            <li> This is  my second purchase and I really like the consistency. The first box lasted almost a  year so a little goes a long way and it holds up all day. Great product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  I used to use American Crew, but the pomade was too shiny and the wax/paste either didn&#x27;t have enough hold, or was too thick to work in.  The Night Rider product lasts a long time and it gives me great control without being all gunky.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It is amazing and I gave it as a gift too. I buy it all the time. Hope he continues to sell his products.</li>
            <li> This seller shipped it super fast, got it within a couple of days of purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is really good.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any oily/crunchy feeling, and its very malleable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth a try if you&#x27;ve never had it.</li>
            <li> Casual elegance is how i describe the result of using  Night Rider Matte texture Paste, tousled, doesn&#x27;t tkae shine away, and holds easily.  Thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The se;;er was extremely responsive and I had the product within 2 days at regular shipping rates.  Fab!  thank you</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff - have tried a million different products for my short hair - which I like to wear rather \\&quot;messy\\&quot; - and this is the best by far. Great hold, not greasy, not dry, lasts all day and night, great smell. I might buy about 10 just in case they ever stop making it (please don&#x27;t ever stop making it). If you like a messy short style - or great hold for any style - try this out.</li>
            <li> This hair product is excellent! hair paste wouldn&#x27;t sound appealing, however it is super effective where gel isn&#x27;t. Stubborn hair is no match.</li>
            <li> Really firm hold and moldable. I&#x27;ve bought before. Unique product. It doesn&#x27;t look stiff. Holds up for next day. Recommend.</li>
            <li> Amazing. It&#x27;s not too oily and not too wet. Definitely worth the price. Makes axe look like 99 cents store quality</li>
            <li> My favorite! Aaaaaaaand a good value, you get soo much compared to other &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; product!</li>
            <li> People dont know, but this is the best hair product available.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Okay.  It only has a medium hold. I have short, fine blond hair.  It makes my hair kind of oily and doesn&#x27;t hold very well. Davines Clay or Mitch Reformer seem MUCH stronger on my hair.  It also has a smell (not totally pleasant). I gave the rest to my hair stylist.  He was happy to take it.  He asked why I didn&#x27;t like it.  I said,&amp;#34;It makes my hair look greasy as hell!&amp;#34;  So he tried it on me after a cut and HE AGREED! Eufora Hero for Men Texture Putty is much stronger for less than half the price.  It was an expensive experiment.</li>
            <li> I got an amazing new haircut and my stylist recommended this product.  I love it.  It adds tons of body and texture to my fine straight hair. I know the price seems high but a little goes a long way. This  container will last quite awhile.</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m a guy with medium length, very thick hair. I like the stuff, but I absolutely don&#x27;t understand the price of it. I have purchased hair product that holds my very thick hair better than this. Now, I don&#x27;t mean this doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; the hair well, it does that, but it&#x27;s how it does it that bothers me. It makes your hair very heavy, even with just a little bit used. It leaves it very sticky, and just doesn&#x27;t do what I hoped for. I&#x27;ve tried even watching videos on youtube of how to use the product and I couldn&#x27;t get the same results. My friend is a hairstylist for (6 years) and has always been able to work with my very thick hair, she was shocked by the high price/lacking results. It&#x27;s ok... I have a friend who loves it, I guess I&#x27;ll mail it off to him!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, it&#x27;s a tough one to suggest.. it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s a mere $20.. it&#x27;s $40 (when I bought).. that&#x27;s a large investment for hair product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me, and you want soft hair that seems almost untouched by product but has good shape to it check out the Enjoy Dry Wax. It&#x27;s like $15 right now with free Prime shipping. That stuff works so well with my thick hair, just take a small/medium finger tips worth and rub it into your hands until it warms up then run your fingers through your hair as if they were brush fingers. Lightly and evenly, don&#x27;t &amp;#34;push&amp;#34; it through your hair with flat hands. After that, you&#x27;ll notice you can grab and style your hair, it&#x27;ll hold the shape and look like it just naturally took that on. That&#x27;s just my advice to anyone with thick hair like me. Sorry if this review isn&#x27;t fair to people who have hair that it works well with. My friend has thinner but a full head of hair and won&#x27;t buy anything else. So I guess, if you have thinner hair it might work well for you!</li>
            <li> Thought it would have a stronger hold then Gritty Business, but not so much. It is much more pliable and better for piece-ing the hair. Great shine</li>
            <li> I have short, thick, wavy hair. It provides good hold for the days just following my haircut, but tends to get sticky and gunky as my hair grows and becomes thick and coarse again. The quality of hold can&#x27;t be disputed, but it does not make my hair pleasant to touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not particularly pleasant; it is difficult to describe. &amp;#34;Oily&amp;#34; is the best I can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be better if my hair were straight and not as thick. This stuff is not for the faint of heart.</li>
            <li> Great product. Holds almost all day, does not leave &amp;#34;greasy residue&amp;#34; when using.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but my barber sells it for $25.  This is robbery!</li>
            <li> Product is great! Seller charging double!</li>
            <li> Been using it for a while now. Works great.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, it works! Best yet, it works without leaving your hair greasy or crunchy. If anything, I believe that it makes your hair softer over time. I am a man with short hair and I do not put much thought into my hair at all. I do, however, have to keep up a neat appearance and maintain grooming standards and this product is perfect for that.  I am a recent convert to Kevin Murphy products. As with everything they make that I have tried so far, this stuff smells fantastic. It does not have an overwhelming perfume odor nor is it chemical smelling. It also washes out easily, and comes right off of your hands without leaving them a sticky, greasy mess.  Great stuff and well worth trying!</li>
            <li> Good product for thick, short hair. Did not do what I wanted because my hair is too fine and straight.</li>
            <li> My go-to hair product for the past 4 years...</li>
            <li> I hated the smell of this at first.  But, then I liked it.  I use this on my gf who has short very thick curly/wavy hair.  Yeah, I sometimes do her hair.  It kind of smells like you just came home from the club. It grows on you and I like it now.. a sort of- dang that&#x27;s a sexy hair smell.  Anyway- this stuff isn&#x27;t greasy, doesn&#x27;t leave many flakes (unless you reapply and don&#x27;t wash over and over and over).  And, it holds without being &#x27;look, i&#x27;m a douche with a firm hold.&#x27;  i have a love/hate relationship with Kevin Murphy products.  This is a love.  It isn&#x27;t a pomeade.  It&#x27;s a bit more of a hold.  But, it&#x27;s definitely malleable.  If you&#x27;re looking for that in between thing for shorter hair- this is great.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  This is THE best hair product for that short messy look. It&#x27;s all day hold without leaving your hair oily or greasy. Your hair has to be completely dry!!  Rub a dime size amount in your hand vigorously then apply.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different hair paste and i found this one to be the best. I have naturally oily skin and hair so most products by the end of day will make my hair look like i comed it with 10w 40 motor oil....very annoying.  this was the only product that has not been  shiny, oily, greasy, and can last all day long without fail. I highly recommend this stuff if your looking for a no sheen no shine look and all the control you could possibly want. looks very natural and clean.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Great hold throughout the day, without any of the oil and grease that can sometimes come with a product like this. Just a little bit lasts me throughout an entire twelve (or more) hour day. It also holds up very well to things like sweat, excess movement, etc. Good product.</li>
            <li> I got this stuff cause it is a great product. The first time I bought it it was from my hairstylist. The second time I bought I got this one from amazon and when I put it on for the first time it smelled like an old smokey man that sat in a bar all day. And after having it for about a month the smell has not been any better. The first time I got it it didn&#x27;t have that bad of an odor.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year now and it holds better and is less sticky than other products I have used.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The only problem was the packaging. The product closure was broken upon arrival which has me concerned about how long the paste will hold with constant exposure to the elements.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It would work better if my hair was shorter but it adds so much body to my limp fine hair.</li>
            <li> I love the Matt Texture Paste, but I can get it for 20 bucks from my salon back in Cleveland... going to see if I can get them to ship me my future orders.  Otherwise love and live by this stuff.</li>
            <li> I just love the packaging. It&#x27;s so cool and different!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now onto the actual product: it&#x27;s awesome. It says you can apply it wet or dry but I recommend wetting your hair, gently towel drying it (so it&#x27;s still damp but not soaking wet) and then applying night rider (by rubbing it between your palms and then applying into your hair). Also, you don&#x27;t need a lot of the product for it to work. So if you&#x27;re used to lathering stuff on, please don&#x27;t do it with this stuff because it&#x27;s a waste and is completely unnecessary. I also love that it&#x27;s matte because I don&#x27;t like the shiny look. It has a subtle citrus smell which is super nice. The hold is fantastic and lasts a long time. If it gets limp (from people touching it etc), all you need is to dampen your palms and run it through your hair and reshape. I also like the fact the product washes out really easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product! I got it at a discounted price so I picked up two for $40 total (taxes included).</li>
            <li> Like using &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Great product and it is easy. It lasts a long time! 5 stars! I think you will be happy with it!</li>
            <li> Being more of a waxy substance, it&#x27;s harder to work with compared to Easy Rider etc.  That is typical of this product type though, and it certainly isn&#x27;t difficult to work with, it&#x27;s just different.  All in all it doesn&#x27;t take much to get a good look so it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  Hold lasts all day long and my hair looks great until evening.  The only negative is the cost.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and strong...Last the whole day. Very easy to apply, so far i am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Great product but I just bought this 30 minutes ago at an upscale salon for $27.00.  Exact same size!</li>
            <li> Product was good quality but this seller charges DOUBLE the actual cost.</li>
            <li> Rotten, vile chemical smell, and thick paste is hard to spread around without clumping.  But it does hold hair in place well....</li>
            <li> Product is unique and affects your hair style in a significant way.</li>
            <li> Mighty dang expensive fer us country folk, but heck if it isn&#x27;t the only glop that works on&lt;br /&gt;my delicate locks.  It&#x27;s true.  Great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;And I must admit it&#x27;s delicious Delicious!!!</li>
            <li> I have had short hair for years.  The product I was using (Pureology Shine and Control) was discontinued so I went on the search for a replacement.  This product is so much better than what I was using!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take a little out with the back of my thumbnail, warm it in my hands and then run it through my damp hair.  I add more if necessary, but best to start with small amount and add.  I have been letting my hair dry naturally and have the messy/piecy look that I LOVE.  My hair isn&#x27;t stiff or crunchy, but somehow this product manages to hold the style all day.  It has a light citrus smell that would be fine for men or women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak for how this would work for long hair, but if you have short hair I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product with excellent texture.</li>
            <li> This is the best definer for short hair. Only takes a tiny amount. Love it.</li>
            <li> The best hair paste for a man ever.  It lasts all day long and doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel all sticky and gross.  My only complaint is that is is a bit more expensive then the other products out there.  Only use a nickel sized amount in your hands and it will last you a good 3 months.</li>
            <li> I was turned on to Night Rider by a friend a few years ago, and I&#x27;ve never looked back. I like a firm hold that doesn&#x27;t look like you are using a lot of product, and this does the trick. I like the messy look and use Night Rider with both short and long hair. Definitely recommended... also... its called Night Rider... so thats cool too.</li>
            <li> iv&#x27;e tried many products, from cheap to pricy and this is by far the best.Pricy but very much worth it. Lasts all day, Very maleable, smells good. Holds nicely</li>
            <li> My product came and was obviously old.  It was yellow in color when it should be white and was a bit dried out.  I will have to make it work for the price but I am definately not satisfied.</li>
