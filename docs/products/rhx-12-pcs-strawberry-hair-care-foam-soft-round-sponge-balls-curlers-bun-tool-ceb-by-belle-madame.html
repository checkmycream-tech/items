    <ol>
            <li>I loved the results!!</li>
            <li>The concept is awesome.</li>
            <li>and it looks like they would be perfect for conditioning the ends by saturating them with either argon oil or coconut oil and roll up to my shouders, and leaving in overnight.</li>
            <li>Great concept!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with how my hair looks when i use them, as well as the quality and the price!!</li>
            <li>The results were good!</li>
            <li>The curls after night are perfect and they look gorgeous but one thing is that it took out a lot of my hair.</li>
            <li>Very nice I&#x27;m try it and see how it orks</li>
            <li>There are twelve strawberry shaped haircurlers they are good size great gift delivery price</li>
            <li>great as a cat toy though :)</li>
            <li>They work well and are very cute, so</li>
            <li>Very cute sponge curlers.</li>
            <li>Still they are cute and look great.</li>
            <li>They are cute but not as cute as the picture on here !!</li>
            <li>These are absolutely precious!</li>
            <li>But I actually love these a lot!</li>
            <li>They looked so cute, but didn&#x27;t work at all!</li>
            <li>These are so cute!</li>
            <li>Pretty happy since it was definitely a great price for it.</li>
            <li>BUT they work amazing.</li>
            <li>They will look more &amp;#34;strawberry-esque&amp;#34; and probably a good idea anyway, since the Hong Kong environment is toxic.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled..</li>
            <li>They made my hair nice and bouncy.</li>
            <li>When they curl my hair they stay in nicely even while I sleep</li>
            <li>to use, light weight, packs in your suitcase and very nice to sleep in!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Still is very cute and looks adorable as a bathroom d√©cor in a basket. :)</li>
            <li>Very cheap foam and tearing apart.  </li>
            <li>Made of very cheap material.</li>
            <li>So easy to use and the curl is amazing.</li>
            <li>They are very cheap and cute, but do not look 100% like the product&#x27;s photo.</li>
            <li>Wanted to return them but would have to pay more for the shipping than what these cost me.</li>
            <li>Cute idea.</li>
            <li>Also a bit of instruction would have been lovely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;;-(I just wish it was a better  quality foam.</li>
            <li>These are cute</li>
            <li>Cute</li>
            <li>It gives you ok curls, but i recommend the curling iron.</li>
            <li>I got these for my grand daughter for a &#x27;just because&#x27; gift.</li>
            <li>So product may be better for someone with my sisters hair type.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for $2.</li>
            <li>but there so cute</li>
            <li>They are cute but they have the strongest smell ever.</li>
            <li>Plus, these are adorable.</li>
            <li>However, the design is cute.</li>
            <li>But there so cute.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>These are really cute.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>With shoulder length hair - they work ok -</li>
            <li>Most of the curlers were damaged and faded of color.</li>
            <li>You are better off saving your money.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, cute, works well.</li>
            <li>I recommend rinsing them out right when you get them, and giving it a good squeeze to let them air out.  </li>
            <li>For the price, pretty good.</li>
            <li>I will say however that these are the most comfortable curlers I&#x27;ve ever had in my hair,</li>
            <li>They are the most comfortable versions of curlers to sleep in I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>My hair was tangled in these easily.</li>
            <li>They arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>Strong plastic smell out of the bag.  </li>
            <li>These were easy to use (I watched a video tutorial by makeupdiaries on YouTube) and comfortable to sleep</li>
            <li>and they are perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>They work great, just make sure not to leave them in too long</li>
            <li>They look cheap and not well made...</li>
            <li>so I ordered these because they are cheap.  </li>
            <li>And they are that cheap in everyway.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be trying some different ways of the way I roll them to see if it changes up the look, but over all I&#x27;m happy with them.</li>
            <li>I can get those beautiful loose Hollywood waves.</li>
            <li>so the curlers aren&#x27;t true to picture.</li>
            <li>Might work for very curly hair to make cute ringlets..</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind looks, then they are okay and are really comfy to sleep in.</li>
            <li>All in all excellent &#x27;small gift&#x27; to say I remember you&#x27;...she loves them!</li>
            <li>Best usage is for the people who have shorter hair to maybe a little past shoulder length but any more than that will result in overstuffed &amp;#34;strawberries&amp;#34; that won&#x27;t be as effective.</li>
            <li>You can reuse this too, it gives amazing loose pretty curl :)</li>
            <li>The seller is very understanding and easy to talk to.</li>
            <li>These were so cheap, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li>worth a try</li>
            <li>so it was worth it.</li>
            <li>The price was worth the experiment .</li>
            <li>and if I put hair no more than the width of a thumb, and roll up until it is 8 inches from my scalp - being sure that the hair is secure in the top and bottom of each strawberry as I go.&lt;br /&gt;3.)</li>
            <li>I ordered them and they were shipped right away..</li>
            <li>I pop them or rather rolled them right in.</li>
            <li>I thought they looked cute, and that my daughter would like them, but just not worth it at all... go to the Dollar Tree and you will get better curlers.</li>
            <li>Definitely great for little girls!</li>
            <li>They have a very strong chemical smell, but I rinsed them and left them out to air for 2 weeks</li>
            <li>The first time the curls were amazing and the second time they were pretty funky.</li>
            <li>You MUST make sure that the hair is rolled in there evenly, or it will fall out - defeating the purpose of these lovely little things.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can sleep in them and wake up with cute little curls.my daughters love them.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even think it would be worth returning it since it would cost more money to send it back.  </li>
            <li>but the ones that didnt get tangled really curled my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>Soft and easy to sleep on.</li>
            <li>I ended up spraying them down pretty good with fabrez.</li>
            <li>Proper use will result in cute ringlet</li>
            <li>, I would soak em in hot water and some antibacterial soap as soon as I got em too.</li>
            <li>by the time i got it they were pretty smushed.</li>
            <li>I can sleep on them pretty well.</li>
            <li>The first one i took out of the package proceeded to tear as I was trying to roll my hair up in it (which was not at all</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to work as described and doesn&#x27;t curl my hair as much as I want it to!  </li>
            <li>These are exactly like the product description.</li>
            <li>these were OK but smaller than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li>They smell funny at first</li>
            <li>We will see how long that takes; they have been exposed for about a week and still smelling strong!</li>
            <li>very cute for little girls to learn to do their first hair rolls ,</li>
            <li>they do stink but the smell goes fast</li>
            <li>The quality is very inferior.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery...perfect condition.</li>
            <li>these are really cute, but not really practical by any means for curling hair.</li>
            <li>I got these and was so excited to use them for my girls hair the next morning I had to cut them out of their hair in order to get them out without ripping their hair out.</li>
            <li>They came all mushed up and didn&#x27;t pop back to their original form.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work on long hair, took a long time to ship, but it is very cute.</li>
            <li>* Make sure you get the ends of your hair tight into the foam center for better curl results.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>very cute- hard to get out of hair sometimes,soft to sleep on.</li>
            <li>When I took them out in the morning my hair was curly but not quite the soft pretty curls I wanted.</li>
            <li>You have to put your hair product on slightly damp hair (you may be able to go without, but I never have, so can&#x27;t vouch for results)&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>The longer the hair, the less hair you want to start your strawberry with; the shorter the hair, the more hair you can roll in your strawberry.&lt;br /&gt;4.)</li>
            <li>I am able to roll all my hair (slightly longer than shoulder) with some strawberries leftover.</li>
            <li>Arrived smelling like those old markers that&#x27;d get you high, but that was easily fixed with some fresh air and Frebeeze.</li>
            <li>They are better for medium length hair not long long hair.</li>
            <li>Adorable little rollers..</li>
            <li>Very cute but a big waste of money</li>
            <li>The curls last and last - it even is easy to sleep with the curlers in overnight.</li>
            <li>I just received this today (2 weeks before the expected delivery date) and I&#x27;m excited to use this.</li>
            <li>and so I got a new one which wasn&#x27;t a problem at all.</li>
            <li>I ordered these brand new, and they came in 2 separate Zip-lock bags with holes in them.</li>
            <li>its good but only for one time use, loses the structure with repeated use</li>
            <li>Yes, they came flat &amp; distorted, but after a day, they puffed right to the way the showed.  </li>
            <li>If these wear out I may upgrade to the original Etude House ones, even if they&#x27;re more expensive.</li>
            <li>As a bonus, they arrived early!</li>
            <li>Also I&#x27;m glad I bought two packs because a few of these little buggers have gotten caught in my hair to the point I had to rip the berries apparent to free it, at the price of them</li>
            <li>and the scent is completely gone.</li>
            <li>They Are Soft foam..</li>
            <li>Having thick, long hair, and struggling to squeeze all my hair in 12 little strawberries - I had better luck and better looking curls when I upgraded to 24 strawberries.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are small for my hair... but the real problem is that they have a strange, strong chemical odor.</li>
            <li>When I got them they were pretty crushed</li>
            <li>/&gt;The foam did not tear a considerable amount or anything, but I did notice that the non-essential green bits on top were a bit fragile and teared a little, but not enough to matter.</li>
            <li>They only get tangled in my hair if I&#x27;m not careful with how I wrap them.</li>
            <li>This works well for the first few times but then the &amp;#34;strawberries&amp;#34; will start to tear on the edges.</li>
            <li>The first set I got all 12 were squeezed and jam-packed into a little padded envelope, no bigger than an index card.</li>
            <li>I thought I would be wise and get something less expensive than the Etude brand.  </li>
            <li>I put these in the other night and left it in all night long (more than 8 hours) and my hair STILL wasn&#x27;t dry in the morning, not sure how others are using these without help of a hair dryer.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to work as described and doesn&#x27;t curl my hair as much as I want it to!  </li>
            <li> These are exactly like the product description.</li>
            <li> these were OK but smaller than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> They smell funny at first</li>
            <li> We will see how long that takes; they have been exposed for about a week and still smelling strong!</li>
            <li> very cute for little girls to learn to do their first hair rolls ,</li>
            <li> they do stink but the smell goes fast</li>
            <li> The quality is very inferior.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery...perfect condition.</li>
            <li> these are really cute, but not really practical by any means for curling hair.</li>
            <li> I got these and was so excited to use them for my girls hair the next morning I had to cut them out of their hair in order to get them out without ripping their hair out.</li>
            <li> They came all mushed up and didn&#x27;t pop back to their original form.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work on long hair, took a long time to ship, but it is very cute.</li>
            <li> * Make sure you get the ends of your hair tight into the foam center for better curl results.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> very cute- hard to get out of hair sometimes,soft to sleep on.</li>
            <li> When I took them out in the morning my hair was curly but not quite the soft pretty curls I wanted.</li>
            <li> You have to put your hair product on slightly damp hair (you may be able to go without, but I never have, so can&#x27;t vouch for results)&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> The longer the hair, the less hair you want to start your strawberry with; the shorter the hair, the more hair you can roll in your strawberry.&lt;br /&gt;4.)</li>
            <li> I am able to roll all my hair (slightly longer than shoulder) with some strawberries leftover.</li>
            <li> Arrived smelling like those old markers that&#x27;d get you high, but that was easily fixed with some fresh air and Frebeeze.</li>
            <li> They are better for medium length hair not long long hair.</li>
            <li> Adorable little rollers..</li>
            <li> Very cute but a big waste of money</li>
            <li> The curls last and last - it even is easy to sleep with the curlers in overnight.</li>
            <li> I just received this today (2 weeks before the expected delivery date) and I&#x27;m excited to use this.</li>
            <li> and so I got a new one which wasn&#x27;t a problem at all.</li>
            <li> I ordered these brand new, and they came in 2 separate Zip-lock bags with holes in them.</li>
            <li> its good but only for one time use, loses the structure with repeated use</li>
            <li> Yes, they came flat &amp; distorted, but after a day, they puffed right to the way the showed.  </li>
            <li> If these wear out I may upgrade to the original Etude House ones, even if they&#x27;re more expensive.</li>
            <li> As a bonus, they arrived early!</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;m glad I bought two packs because a few of these little buggers have gotten caught in my hair to the point I had to rip the berries apparent to free it, at the price of them</li>
            <li> and the scent is completely gone.</li>
            <li> They Are Soft foam..</li>
            <li> Having thick, long hair, and struggling to squeeze all my hair in 12 little strawberries - I had better luck and better looking curls when I upgraded to 24 strawberries.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are small for my hair... but the real problem is that they have a strange, strong chemical odor.</li>
            <li> When I got them they were pretty crushed</li>
            <li> /&gt;The foam did not tear a considerable amount or anything, but I did notice that the non-essential green bits on top were a bit fragile and teared a little, but not enough to matter.</li>
            <li> They only get tangled in my hair if I&#x27;m not careful with how I wrap them.</li>
            <li> This works well for the first few times but then the &amp;#34;strawberries&amp;#34; will start to tear on the edges.</li>
            <li> The first set I got all 12 were squeezed and jam-packed into a little padded envelope, no bigger than an index card.</li>
            <li> I thought I would be wise and get something less expensive than the Etude brand.  </li>
            <li> I put these in the other night and left it in all night long (more than 8 hours) and my hair STILL wasn&#x27;t dry in the morning, not sure how others are using these without help of a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I got these in the mail very fast about a week and a half !!</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that is just past my shoulders, and I probably need more, but  using these</li>
            <li> the shipping took a really long time.</li>
            <li> the texture of these are not soft and they smell like gasoline.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave them in for too long if you want long loose curls.</li>
            <li> With only one use the white little dots started erasing</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;shipping takes very long thou</li>
            <li> They are pale pink in real life and don&#x27;t have the green stems.</li>
            <li> But after leaving them out for a bit they expanded to there actual size, but we&#x27;re still not exactly true to picture.</li>
            <li> Did not worked as expected.</li>
            <li> They came with absolutely no instructions.  </li>
            <li> I got them before expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> Be careful you don&#x27;t get them tangled.  </li>
            <li> I could not wrap my hair around these rollers and have them stay closed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5&amp;#34;, have long hair, going down to the waist</li>
            <li> Cute product, but the horrible synthetic plastic smell coming off the products when I opened the bag means I won&#x27;t put them anywhere near my hair until they stop smelling...</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it came in a small package, which made the rollers a little imperfect, but that won&#x27;t affect how curls will turn out.</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH it.  </li>
            <li> these broke apart, were not worth our time.</li>
            <li> Took less then 10mins.</li>
            <li> Thank god i paid less than $3.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use them as actual curlers but they fall short unfortunately.</li>
            <li> if I was going to a dress up party and wanted to give everyone a laugh at my weird looking &#x27;strawberry&#x27; curlers (as another review said they really do look like a weird toadstool/tomato hybrid with ugly white splotches instead of actual strawberries).</li>
            <li> Had to use very little hair when wrapping them around the center, so the foam would embrace the hair and hold it on my head.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of thick long hair</li>
            <li> but I should have known since my hair is long and thick.</li>
            <li> This does not work well with thick and long hair.</li>
            <li> It smells super chemically, just bad.</li>
            <li> It was a little squish up when it was shipped</li>
            <li> Waste money.</li>
            <li> Waste time.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a pillow on hand and wanted something fluffy under my head or b.)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t twist your hair in them unless you want uneven winglets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that I waited such a long time for such a low-quality product.</li>
            <li> but i had to be very careful because two of them fell apart as i was washing them to get the smell out !!</li>
            <li> I think little  girls would like these! .Easy</li>
            <li> Not cute.  </li>
            <li> When I received my package it was all squished into a small bag</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money this is cheap and torn and not to mention they have a terrible smell, like it&#x27;s been bathing in chemicals, Ew, I will not put  this in my hair!</li>
            <li> Was so excited to use these when they came in, but I did have to wait a few days because they smelled horrible !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I did wrong.</li>
            <li> but I mean u get what&#x27;s you pay for!</li>
            <li> When I took all the strawberries out of the poorly packaged envelope, and</li>
            <li> Did not do what I expected. :-(</li>
            <li> Just I could have used them sooner without dousing them in fabric refresher, since it was weird.</li>
            <li> There is no way I&#x27;m putting something that smells that bad into my hair.</li>
            <li> however I don&#x27;t feel too bad.</li>
            <li> They also had a bad odor, but that came out overnight.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t disappointed when they didn&#x27;t curl my hair.</li>
            <li> We had to rip it apart! :(</li>
            <li> these are stupid.</li>
            <li> I understand that they are a sponge material, however they have a terrible chemical smell that I had to soak out.</li>
            <li> Also they smell horrible like someone dumped gas on them before sending them to me !!</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE this ITEM CAME</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My hair was tangled in these easily. slept in them but it did not hold the curl. great as a cat toy though :)</li>
            <li> They have a very strong chemical smell, but I rinsed them and left them out to air for 2 weeks and the scent is completely gone.</li>
            <li> Proper use will result in cute ringlet curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) You have to put your hair product on slightly damp hair (you may be able to go without, but I never have, so can&#x27;t vouch for results)&lt;br /&gt;2.) I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5&amp;#34;, have long hair, going down to the waist and if I put hair no more than the width of a thumb, and roll up until it is 8 inches from my scalp - being sure that the hair is secure in the top and bottom of each strawberry as I go.&lt;br /&gt;3.) The longer the hair, the less hair you want to start your strawberry with; the shorter the hair, the more hair you can roll in your strawberry.&lt;br /&gt;4.) You MUST make sure that the hair is rolled in there evenly, or it will fall out - defeating the purpose of these lovely little things.&lt;br /&gt;5.) I put them all in, after showering and before going to bed, the ones I had a feeling I didn&#x27;t roll in well ALWAYS fall out.&lt;br /&gt;6.) Having thick, long hair, and struggling to squeeze all my hair in 12 little strawberries - I had better luck and better looking curls when I upgraded to 24 strawberries.&lt;br /&gt;7.) They are &amp;#34;cheapy&amp;#34; looking upon arrival.  The first set I got all 12 were squeezed and jam-packed into a little padded envelope, no bigger than an index card. I don&#x27;t know how they did it. Just about all were damaged upon arrival.&lt;br /&gt;8.) When I took all the strawberries out of the poorly packaged envelope, and they &amp;#34;poofed&amp;#34; out from its tiny prison, they didn&#x27;t look like strawberries, they looked what would result if a toadstool mushroom and tomato were to have babies.  Not cute.  The strawberries that my friend got from S. Korea were WAY cuter than these from Hong Kong.&lt;br /&gt;9.) I recommend rinsing them out right when you get them, and giving it a good squeeze to let them air out.  They will look more &amp;#34;strawberry-esque&amp;#34; and probably a good idea anyway, since the Hong Kong environment is toxic.</li>
            <li> very cute- hard to get out of hair sometimes,soft to sleep on.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of thick long hair and so I ordered 2 packs. I had problems with my package getting lost and so I got a new one which wasn&#x27;t a problem at all. The seller is very understanding and easy to talk to. When I received my package it was all squished into a small bag so the curlers aren&#x27;t true to picture. But after leaving them out for a bit they expanded to there actual size, but we&#x27;re still not exactly true to picture. They look cheap and not well made... BUT they work amazing. I loved the results!! Took less then 10mins. Don&#x27;t leave them in for too long if you want long loose curls. Bottom line, don&#x27;t judge a book my its cover. I swear these are miracles!</li>
            <li> This works well for the first few times but then the &amp;#34;strawberries&amp;#34; will start to tear on the edges. Best usage is for the people who have shorter hair to maybe a little past shoulder length but any more than that will result in overstuffed &amp;#34;strawberries&amp;#34; that won&#x27;t be as effective.</li>
            <li> The concept is awesome. I have waist length hair as well and it looks like they would be perfect for conditioning the ends by saturating them with either argon oil or coconut oil and roll up to my shouders, and leaving in overnight. Shes got a point, I would soak em in hot water and some antibacterial soap as soon as I got em too. Gonna get!</li>
            <li> I thought I would be wise and get something less expensive than the Etude brand.  NOT WORTH it.  Very cheap foam and tearing apart.  I don&#x27;t even think it would be worth returning it since it would cost more money to send it back.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> Made of very cheap material. Sponges already break. Did not worked as expected. Wanted to return them but would have to pay more for the shipping than what these cost me. Save your money!!</li>
            <li> by the time i got it they were pretty smushed. they work though but some of them got tangled in my hair and ripped. but the ones that didnt get tangled really curled my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> Cute idea. If you order plan way ahead, as the seller states it takes awhile. I understand that they are a sponge material, however they have a terrible chemical smell that I had to soak out. Also a bit of instruction would have been lovely. I probably would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> These were easy to use (I watched a video tutorial by makeupdiaries on YouTube) and comfortable to sleep in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foam did not tear a considerable amount or anything, but I did notice that the non-essential green bits on top were a bit fragile and teared a little, but not enough to matter.</li>
            <li> the shipping took a really long time. They came squished, but i figure since they are sponges it wont make that big of a difference. The thing that bothered me was the smell. It smells super chemically, just bad. There is no way I&#x27;m putting something that smells that bad into my hair.</li>
            <li> they do stink but the smell goes fast</li>
            <li> I set my hair with these last night. The results were good! Lots of curl to my shoulder length hair! Had to use very little hair when wrapping them around the center, so the foam would embrace the hair and hold it on my head. I think little  girls would like these! .Easy to use, light weight, packs in your suitcase and very nice to sleep in!&lt;br /&gt;* Make sure you get the ends of your hair tight into the foam center for better curl results.&lt;br /&gt;* Use a setting mouse before wrapping hair around center.&lt;br /&gt;*Use a scarf over your head to hold the curlers in place while sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;;-(I just wish it was a better  quality foam. Great concept!</li>
            <li> Very nice I&#x27;m try it and see how it orks</li>
            <li> I got these and was so excited to use them for my girls hair the next morning I had to cut them out of their hair in order to get them out without ripping their hair out. Very cute but a big waste of money</li>
            <li> They came with absolutely no instructions.  The quality is very inferior.</li>
            <li> Did not do what I expected. :-(</li>
            <li> very cute for little girls to learn to do their first hair rolls ,</li>
            <li> These are cute I saw them in a kdrama. And wanted them .When I found them on amazon.. I was thrilled.. I ordered them and they were shipped right away.. I got them before expected delivery date. They Are Soft foam..Cute And Work well. Even if you can not read Korean. . Or Chinese the drawings are simple to follow. You can sleep in them and wake up with cute little curls.my daughters love them.</li>
            <li> It gives you ok curls, but i recommend the curling iron. Also it tangles my hair.</li>
            <li> Arrived smelling like those old markers that&#x27;d get you high, but that was easily fixed with some fresh air and Frebeeze. They work well and are very cute, so I like them a lot. Just I could have used them sooner without dousing them in fabric refresher, since it was weird. If these wear out I may upgrade to the original Etude House ones, even if they&#x27;re more expensive. For the price, pretty good.</li>
            <li> They are junky.  I bought them for one of my granddaughters who will be seven.  She loves girly things and I saw similar rollers on television so I ordered these because they are cheap.  And they are that cheap in everyway.</li>
            <li> its good but only for one time use, loses the structure with repeated use</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money this is cheap and torn and not to mention they have a terrible smell, like it&#x27;s been bathing in chemicals, Ew, I will not put  this in my hair!</li>
            <li> I got these for my grand daughter for a &#x27;just because&#x27; gift. She loves them. So easy to use and the curl is amazing. The curls last and last - it even is easy to sleep with the curlers in overnight. I would buy again. Fast delivery...perfect condition. All in all excellent &#x27;small gift&#x27; to say I remember you&#x27;...she loves them!</li>
            <li> Very cute sponge curlers. Some of them did get tangled in my hair but I should have known since my hair is long and thick. So product may be better for someone with my sisters hair type. Still is very cute and looks adorable as a bathroom d√©cor in a basket. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for $2. The curls after night are perfect and they look gorgeous but one thing is that it took out a lot of my hair. With only one use the white little dots started erasing but I mean u get what&#x27;s you pay for! Still they are cute and look great. And I&#x27;m starting to think that I would&lt;br /&gt;Buy them again + The shipping took like not even a week</li>
            <li> Cute product, but the horrible synthetic plastic smell coming off the products when I opened the bag means I won&#x27;t put them anywhere near my hair until they stop smelling... We will see how long that takes; they have been exposed for about a week and still smelling strong!</li>
            <li> I just received this today (2 weeks before the expected delivery date) and I&#x27;m excited to use this. The only thing is that it came in a small package, which made the rollers a little imperfect, but that won&#x27;t affect how curls will turn out.</li>
            <li> These came in squished and smelly.  I tried one on my hair and it didn&#x27;t work out so well.</li>
            <li> It was a little squish up when it was shipped but then i set them out for a while and they are perfectly fine. You can reuse this too, it gives amazing loose pretty curl :)&lt;br /&gt;shipping takes very long thou but i would recommend this</li>
            <li> these broke apart, were not worth our time. I thought they looked cute, and that my daughter would like them, but just not worth it at all... go to the Dollar Tree and you will get better curlers.</li>
            <li> these are stupid. Thank god i paid less than $3. worth a try, i guess.</li>
            <li> There are twelve strawberry shaped haircurlers they are good size great gift delivery price</li>
            <li> These are absolutely precious! They made my hair nice and bouncy. I am very pleased with how my hair looks when i use them, as well as the quality and the price!!</li>
            <li> They work great, just make sure not to leave them in too long or you&#x27;ll look like a poodle. Shipping took a while but there so cute so it was worth it.</li>
            <li> I only bought these as hair accessories so I wasn&#x27;t disappointed when they didn&#x27;t curl my hair. They are cute but they have the strongest smell ever.</li>
            <li> These were so cheap, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. But I actually love these a lot! They only get tangled in my hair if I&#x27;m not careful with how I wrap them. I can sleep on them pretty well. I have thick hair that is just past my shoulders, and I probably need more, but  using these I can get those beautiful loose Hollywood waves. Plus, these are adorable. C&#x27;mon.</li>
            <li> Waste money. Waste time.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work, and my hair got stuck in one. We had to rip it apart! :(</li>
            <li> the texture of these are not soft and they smell like gasoline.  No way I will put them in my hair.</li>
            <li> these are really cute, but not really practical by any means for curling hair. The first one i took out of the package proceeded to tear as I was trying to roll my hair up in it (which was not at all easy)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i gave these to a friend who will probably just use them for selfie props because i can&#x27;t see them possibly actually curling hair.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;d use these if a.) I didn&#x27;t have a pillow on hand and wanted something fluffy under my head or b.) if I was going to a dress up party and wanted to give everyone a laugh at my weird looking &#x27;strawberry&#x27; curlers (as another review said they really do look like a weird toadstool/tomato hybrid with ugly white splotches instead of actual strawberries). I wanted to use them as actual curlers but they fall short unfortunately. I put these in the other night and left it in all night long (more than 8 hours) and my hair STILL wasn&#x27;t dry in the morning, not sure how others are using these without help of a hair dryer. Also I&#x27;m glad I bought two packs because a few of these little buggers have gotten caught in my hair to the point I had to rip the berries apparent to free it, at the price of them however I don&#x27;t feel too bad. I will say however that these are the most comfortable curlers I&#x27;ve ever had in my hair, its like a portable pillow when you sleep with them in and when I do wear them I get a chuckle every time I catch myself in the mirror.</li>
            <li> Strong plastic smell out of the bag.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to work as described and doesn&#x27;t curl my hair as much as I want it to!  However, the design is cute.</li>
            <li> I got these in the mail very fast about a week and a half !! They are cute but not as cute as the picture on here !! Also they smell horrible like someone dumped gas on them before sending them to me !! the smell came out after i washed them but i had to be very careful because two of them fell apart as i was washing them to get the smell out !!</li>
            <li> These are exactly like the product description. They arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> They are small for my hair... but the real problem is that they have a strange, strong chemical odor. I threw them out... I felt like I was sniffing one of those markers from the 80&#x27;s that came in a metal tube...</li>
            <li> Be careful you don&#x27;t get them tangled.  But there so cute. I love them.</li>
            <li> We have waited since April, and it is now August.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work on long hair, took a long time to ship, but it is very cute.</li>
            <li> These are really cute. I am able to roll all my hair (slightly longer than shoulder) with some strawberries leftover. When I got them they were pretty crushed but they expanded back into shape within minutes. They also had a bad odor, but that came out overnight. When they curl my hair they stay in nicely even while I sleep and I could get them out without any problems. The strawberries are holding up quite well and I am pleased with the purchase. As a bonus, they arrived early!</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE this ITEM CAME DAMAGE took 1 month</li>
            <li> Was so excited to use these when they came in, but I did have to wait a few days because they smelled horrible ! I ended up spraying them down pretty good with fabrez. After I felt they wouldn&#x27;t stink up my hair I pop them or rather rolled them right in. They did well for sleeping in I did have to tie a scarfe around my head so they wouldn&#x27;t fall out as I moved around. When I took them out in the morning my hair was curly but not quite the soft pretty curls I wanted. I probly could have achieved the same look by sleeping in braids. I&#x27;ll be trying some different ways of the way I roll them to see if it changes up the look, but over all I&#x27;m happy with them. The price was worth the experiment .</li>
            <li> This does not work well with thick and long hair.</li>
            <li> Adorable little rollers.. Don&#x27;t twist your hair in them unless you want uneven winglets. Might work for very curly hair to make cute ringlets.. Definitely great for little girls! Soft and easy to sleep on.</li>
            <li> I could not wrap my hair around these rollers and have them stay closed. They looked so cute, but didn&#x27;t work at all!</li>
            <li> Yes, they came flat &amp; distorted, but after a day, they puffed right to the way the showed.  With shoulder length hair - they work ok - just don&#x27;t stay in well.</li>
            <li> I ordered these brand new, and they came in 2 separate Zip-lock bags with holes in them. Most of the curlers were damaged and faded of color. I&#x27;m disappointed that I waited such a long time for such a low-quality product. I don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone and I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> They are very cheap and cute, but do not look 100% like the product&#x27;s photo. They are pale pink in real life and don&#x27;t have the green stems. If you don&#x27;t mind looks, then they are okay and are really comfy to sleep in. You are better off saving your money.</li>
            <li> these were OK but smaller than I thought they would be. They are better for medium length hair not long long hair.</li>
            <li> They came all mushed up and didn&#x27;t pop back to their original form. Unimpressed and not buying from here again.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, cute, works well. Pretty happy since it was definitely a great price for it.</li>
            <li> These are so cute! They smell funny at first but that goes away. I&#x27;ve used them twice. The first time the curls were amazing and the second time they were pretty funky. I&#x27;m not sure what I did wrong. They are the most comfortable versions of curlers to sleep in I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
