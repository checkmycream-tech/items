            <li>Leaves a nice feeling and taste in your mouth.</li>
            <li>The Oasis mouth spray seems to be the most pleasant tasting moisturizing spray available.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m glad I was able to find it thru Amazon.</li>
            <li>None is better than Oasis.  </li>
            <li>and so glad to have found this.</li>
            <li>However I have not been able to find it any where ...</li>
            <li>okay,</li>
            <li>It works much better than the biotene product for me anyway.</li>
            <li>so I use Biotene Mouthwash and then use this spray for its mouth refreshing qualities.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be able to talk or eat.  </li>
            <li>Tastes great and works very well</li>
            <li>so glad you had this stuff</li>
            <li>I bought both brands to see if one was better</li>
            <li>and I like this one better</li>
            <li>I needed more than 1 or 2 squirts.  </li>
            <li>I also wish it would spritz to cover more area instead of the stream that it squirts.&lt;br /&gt;Mint</li>
            <li>more if I&#x27;m working out.</li>
            <li>I tried it and have been very happy with it for a long time.</li>
            <li>This is the best mouth spray for dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>This is probably the best spray for dry mouth on the market, and I have tried them all.</li>
            <li>Excellent on the go mouisturizer for dry mouth conditions.</li>
            <li>Best stuff for dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>The Oasis brand mouth spray and mouthwash are both the best dry mouth products I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li>I have tried most every spray available; &amp;#34;Biotene&amp;#34;, CVS&#x27; mouth spray, &amp;#34;Rain&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Vocal Ease&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>So he claims it has helped him be more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Oasis is a good alternative and fairly reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>The taste is very mild and it solves the problem.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and give immediate relief.  </li>
            <li>The spray is convenient and easy to use discretely.</li>
            <li>Very quick delivery</li>
            <li>The taste is so strong it felt like it was burning, which was followed by a numbing sensation.  </li>
            <li>but Biotene is a superior product since it contains synthetic saliva,and it works far better.</li>
            <li>It tastes like a strong caraway flavor.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just a streight shot and isn&#x27;t as effective but good enough</li>
            <li>Works just fine.  </li>
            <li>I wish it were available in stores.</li>
            <li>IT HAS A LIGHT MINT TASTE AND HELP KEEP YOUR MOUTH MOIST -</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that after using the first bottle, I bought 6 more thru Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>maybe my mouth is unique because it DID NOT WORK at all.</li>
            <li>Walgreens used to carry this wonderful product - but no more.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for dry mouth problems.</li>
            <li>Just a couple of sprays and your mouth is coated with a pleasant tasty film that instantly lubricates your mouth.</li>
            <li>everyone&#x27;s tastes are different).I much prefer Biotene Oral Balance Gel which lasts longer and tastes much better.</li>
            <li>I really like Oasis Mouth Moisturizing Spray better than Biotene.  </li>
            <li>I love oasis, it doesn&#x27;t have as much of a medicine taste as biotene.</li>
            <li>Not bad, but not 5 star.</li>
            <li>Oasis is the best product that I have found so far for nocturnal dry mouth.</li>
            <li>This was delivered so quickly and saved a lot of gasoline.  </li>
            <li>; says it is mild mint flavor, my Wife tested it and confirms that it is, but to me, it is not.</li>
            <li>flavor is mild.</li>
            <li>Note to manufacturers of oral hygiene products- terms like \\&quot;mild mint\\&quot;, \\&quot;cool mint\\&quot; or \\&quot;fresh mint\\&quot; need clarification on the bottle.</li>
            <li>THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT FOR ANYONE WHO HAS A DRY MOUTH FOR WHAT EVER REASON, C-PAP USER, SOME MEDICATIONS,OR</li>
            <li>excellent for dry throat, especially if salivary glands have been affected by chemo and/or radiation therapy.</li>
            <li>It works fine and really provided a lot of relief.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey but worth it</li>
            <li>In my experience, it provides pretty quick relief.</li>
            <li>This spray is just right.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with the Thayer&#x27;s Dry Mouth Spray, which doesn&#x27;t moisturize for long, but is very pleasant tasting and doesn&#x27;t feel numbing.</li>
            <li>It has literally made me feel comfortable about being in a group of people again, because I don&#x27;t have to worry about not being able to talk because of my dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>Just a couple of sprays of Oasis not only solves my dry mouth, but it eliminates my embarrassment from not being able to be coherent!  </li>
            <li>Oasis dry mouth spray has a better taste and its formula has real staying power, keeps my mouth &amp; throat moist and comfortable.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>My doctor originally recommended it over all other brands and I&#x27;m glad I took his advice.  </li>
            <li>for a time I was able to purchase Oasis at my local drug store ...</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is way better than a similar product that is advertised on TV.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe it at first either.</li>
            <li>I like this better than the competitor&#x27;s type and order several at a time.  </li>
            <li>Was a gift for my mother-she said it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t really like the mouthwash very much, and use a different brand that works better for the needs I have</li>
            <li>I seriously dont get all the great reviews on here.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but I like the Thayers better for short term relief of dry mouth.</li>
            <li>Pleasant taste and long lasting.</li>
            <li>It provides a pleasant, long lasting spray for the mouth.</li>
            <li>The mouthspray tastes good and offers relief for about a minute and then the sensitive tongue feeling is back.</li>
            <li>Not bad, I carry it &amp; use it, but it is not as effective nor as long lasting as Biotene.  </li>
            <li>Have tried many things for dry mouth</li>
            <li>However, better than dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>the spray is ok but mouth is still dry.</li>
            <li>Works better than anything I have found to date for dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>refreshing flavor as well.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone should try this change for dry mouth.</li>
            <li>thankfully my husband is able to eat some foods now but stillas terribly dry mouth.</li>
            <li>I have dry mouth from all the meds I take for Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy.  </li>
            <li>The gel does work, but you have to have a certain amount of saliva to get it to spread around.  </li>
            <li>Great for use in airplanes or other dry environments.  </li>
            <li>The dentist gave me a sample of something that cost 3 times as much and didn&#x27;t do the job either.   </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really moisturize my mouth at all</li>
            <li>FWIW, combined with a non- fluoride toothpaste and feel the combo has really turned the corner for me.</li>
            <li>very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really keeps my mouth moisturized.  </li>
            <li>It can be carried in your pocket or purse and really works.</li>
            <li>Much easier to order this way.</li>
            <li>Since it works as advertised and has a reasonable taste, I really have benefitted from its use.</li>
            <li>The product works very well and is convenient to use anytime, anywhere</li>
            <li>I use both and both products work very well.</li>
            <li>That stuff at least tastes good.</li>
            <li>This product gives instant relief to a dry mouth condition and has a taste that I find far more pleasant than other products on the market.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried too many other sprays to compare</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ts better than any other product on the market!  </li>
            <li>This product tastes good but only lasts for a little while.</li>
            <li>I couln&#x27;t live without it!  </li>
            <li>It was much better then the previous spray I used.&lt;br /&gt;More</li>
            <li>Not perfect, but better than most.  </li>
            <li>so this is high praise.</li>
            <li>This spray is so much better than the other one you usually see displayed so prominently in drug stores.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting something a little more like a mist to seach my vocal folds.</li>
            <li>They work much better and last for a long time.</li>
            <li>It really does work well, tastes good and lasts much longer than the expensive doctor recommended brand.  </li>
            <li>IT DOES NOT BURN - ALCOHOL FREE - AND COMES IN A VARIETY OF OTHER ORAL CARE PRODUCTS</li>
            <li>I would never miss it, and 10 being that I couldn&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the fact that this product contains saccharine(also has hydrogenated castor oil-am not sure how safe this is either).Also</li>
            <li>First got it as a sample from doctor, but couldn&#x27;t find it in local pharmacies.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So, be aware that radiation patients may not get the same favorable results as have been reported by others.</li>
            <li>I will stick with hard sugar free candy and sugar free cough drops to help with dry mouth.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I can no longer find it locally, so Amazon&#x27;s carrying of this product was a great boon to me.</li>
            <li>While briefly it helped, but it really did not do the trick.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>The mouthwash is difficult to get at what I consider a fair price</li>
            <li>, if I wake in the middle of the night, I can take a spray and go right back to sleep.  </li>
            <li>I need to carry a mouth spray for dry mouth caused by medications I must take, and I was looking for something comparable to the Biotene product, which does not seem to be available in drug stores any longer, alongside other Biotene products.</li>
            <li>I have a problem with dry mouth and Oasis Mouth Spray has worked really well for me</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very helpful and soothing to us who suffer with auto-immune diseases which cause dry mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This mouth wash and mouth spray keep me moisturized throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for giving me the relief that I was looking for in dry mouth products.</li>
            <li>This tiny little bottle will be used up fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>I had been using sour ball candy for awhile, but found that I&#x27;d have to chew as fast as I could if it was not gone by the time I had to make my entrance on stage.</li>
            <li>The taste of this stuff was so strong it made me nauseated.</li>
            <li>It burned my mouth and throat a bit, and the moisture it provided was not long lasting.</li>
            <li>It is a temporary relief but not long lasting.</li>
            <li>Hard to find, but worth having.  </li>

            <li> maybe my mouth is unique because it DID NOT WORK at all.</li>
            <li> Walgreens used to carry this wonderful product - but no more.  </li>
            <li> This product is great for dry mouth problems.</li>
            <li> Just a couple of sprays and your mouth is coated with a pleasant tasty film that instantly lubricates your mouth.</li>
            <li> everyone&#x27;s tastes are different).I much prefer Biotene Oral Balance Gel which lasts longer and tastes much better.</li>
            <li> I really like Oasis Mouth Moisturizing Spray better than Biotene.  </li>
            <li> I love oasis, it doesn&#x27;t have as much of a medicine taste as biotene.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but not 5 star.</li>
            <li> Oasis is the best product that I have found so far for nocturnal dry mouth.</li>
            <li> This was delivered so quickly and saved a lot of gasoline.  </li>
            <li> ; says it is mild mint flavor, my Wife tested it and confirms that it is, but to me, it is not.</li>
            <li> flavor is mild.</li>
            <li> Note to manufacturers of oral hygiene products- terms like \\&quot;mild mint\\&quot;, \\&quot;cool mint\\&quot; or \\&quot;fresh mint\\&quot; need clarification on the bottle.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT FOR ANYONE WHO HAS A DRY MOUTH FOR WHAT EVER REASON, C-PAP USER, SOME MEDICATIONS,OR</li>
            <li> excellent for dry throat, especially if salivary glands have been affected by chemo and/or radiation therapy.</li>
            <li> It works fine and really provided a lot of relief.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey but worth it</li>
            <li> In my experience, it provides pretty quick relief.</li>
            <li> This spray is just right.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with the Thayer&#x27;s Dry Mouth Spray, which doesn&#x27;t moisturize for long, but is very pleasant tasting and doesn&#x27;t feel numbing.</li>
            <li> It has literally made me feel comfortable about being in a group of people again, because I don&#x27;t have to worry about not being able to talk because of my dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> Just a couple of sprays of Oasis not only solves my dry mouth, but it eliminates my embarrassment from not being able to be coherent!  </li>
            <li> Oasis dry mouth spray has a better taste and its formula has real staying power, keeps my mouth &amp; throat moist and comfortable.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> My doctor originally recommended it over all other brands and I&#x27;m glad I took his advice.  </li>
            <li> for a time I was able to purchase Oasis at my local drug store ...</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is way better than a similar product that is advertised on TV.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it at first either.</li>
            <li> I like this better than the competitor&#x27;s type and order several at a time.  </li>
            <li> Was a gift for my mother-she said it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t really like the mouthwash very much, and use a different brand that works better for the needs I have</li>
            <li> I seriously dont get all the great reviews on here.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but I like the Thayers better for short term relief of dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Pleasant taste and long lasting.</li>
            <li> It provides a pleasant, long lasting spray for the mouth.</li>
            <li> The mouthspray tastes good and offers relief for about a minute and then the sensitive tongue feeling is back.</li>
            <li> Not bad, I carry it &amp; use it, but it is not as effective nor as long lasting as Biotene.  </li>
            <li> Have tried many things for dry mouth</li>
            <li> However, better than dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> the spray is ok but mouth is still dry.</li>
            <li> Works better than anything I have found to date for dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> refreshing flavor as well.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone should try this change for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> thankfully my husband is able to eat some foods now but stillas terribly dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth from all the meds I take for Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy.  </li>
            <li> The gel does work, but you have to have a certain amount of saliva to get it to spread around.  </li>
            <li> Great for use in airplanes or other dry environments.  </li>
            <li> The dentist gave me a sample of something that cost 3 times as much and didn&#x27;t do the job either.   </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really moisturize my mouth at all</li>
            <li> FWIW, combined with a non- fluoride toothpaste and feel the combo has really turned the corner for me.</li>
            <li> very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really keeps my mouth moisturized.  </li>
            <li> It can be carried in your pocket or purse and really works.</li>
            <li> Much easier to order this way.</li>
            <li> Since it works as advertised and has a reasonable taste, I really have benefitted from its use.</li>
            <li> The product works very well and is convenient to use anytime, anywhere</li>
            <li> I use both and both products work very well.</li>
            <li> That stuff at least tastes good.</li>
            <li> This product gives instant relief to a dry mouth condition and has a taste that I find far more pleasant than other products on the market.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried too many other sprays to compare</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ts better than any other product on the market!  </li>
            <li> This product tastes good but only lasts for a little while.</li>
            <li> I couln&#x27;t live without it!  </li>
            <li> It was much better then the previous spray I used.&lt;br /&gt;More</li>
            <li> Not perfect, but better than most.  </li>
            <li> so this is high praise.</li>
            <li> This spray is so much better than the other one you usually see displayed so prominently in drug stores.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting something a little more like a mist to seach my vocal folds.</li>
            <li> They work much better and last for a long time.</li>
            <li> It really does work well, tastes good and lasts much longer than the expensive doctor recommended brand.  </li>
            <li> IT DOES NOT BURN - ALCOHOL FREE - AND COMES IN A VARIETY OF OTHER ORAL CARE PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> I would never miss it, and 10 being that I couldn&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the fact that this product contains saccharine(also has hydrogenated castor oil-am not sure how safe this is either).Also</li>
            <li> First got it as a sample from doctor, but couldn&#x27;t find it in local pharmacies.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, be aware that radiation patients may not get the same favorable results as have been reported by others.</li>
            <li> I will stick with hard sugar free candy and sugar free cough drops to help with dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can no longer find it locally, so Amazon&#x27;s carrying of this product was a great boon to me.</li>
            <li> While briefly it helped, but it really did not do the trick.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> The mouthwash is difficult to get at what I consider a fair price</li>
            <li> , if I wake in the middle of the night, I can take a spray and go right back to sleep.  </li>
            <li> I need to carry a mouth spray for dry mouth caused by medications I must take, and I was looking for something comparable to the Biotene product, which does not seem to be available in drug stores any longer, alongside other Biotene products.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with dry mouth and Oasis Mouth Spray has worked really well for me</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very helpful and soothing to us who suffer with auto-immune diseases which cause dry mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This mouth wash and mouth spray keep me moisturized throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for giving me the relief that I was looking for in dry mouth products.</li>
            <li> This tiny little bottle will be used up fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I had been using sour ball candy for awhile, but found that I&#x27;d have to chew as fast as I could if it was not gone by the time I had to make my entrance on stage.</li>
            <li> The taste of this stuff was so strong it made me nauseated.</li>
            <li> It burned my mouth and throat a bit, and the moisture it provided was not long lasting.</li>
            <li> It is a temporary relief but not long lasting.</li>
            <li> Hard to find, but worth having.  </li>
            <li> if I forgot to use it and was awakened with super dry mouth, I found the gel too thick to use at that time.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it works a long time and sometimes only a short time.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a weird, sticky coating but is much, much, better than dry mouth and lasts through the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to last long.</li>
            <li> I have tried countless products for dry mouth caused by medication.  </li>
            <li> I am an actress who has dry mouth and when about to launch in to a song on stage, this can be a big problem!</li>
            <li> This product has been imensely helpful with the dry mouth, and contains the oils and mint essence that provide lasting relief.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from dry mouth, especially at night.  </li>
            <li> I bought the oasis for dry mouth in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> I used it in the dry conditions of Arizona as well as in the deep South.</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth from radiation treatments and I use this spray constantly.  </li>
            <li> It does not provide any lasting relief for dry mouth for me.</li>
            <li> I awaken in the middle of the night with dry mouth</li>
            <li> With all the medications, his mouth will become very dry especially during the night.  </li>
            <li> I have a very dry mouth from medical problems and the meds I use to treat them.  </li>
            <li> In pharmacies this little bottle is way more expensive than a big bottle of biotene.</li>
            <li> The delivery was when I expected, packed properly,</li>
            <li> However, don&#x27;t expect the dryness to disappear for long.</li>
            <li> it works a little but has that slimy feel and only works very short time.</li>
            <li> Only wish the moisturizing would last a little longer.  </li>
            <li> Maybe could make the bottle a little bigger to last longer.</li>
            <li> I suffer from Sjorgen&#x27;s Disease (basically dry mouth &amp; eyes) and this product gets me thru the day.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my elderly parents who suffer from dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Even my husband uses it at night when his mouth becomes dry from his c-pap.  </li>
            <li> My medication causes my mouth to be extremely dry during the night and brushing before bed</li>
            <li> I tried the dentist recommended Biotene toothpaste and mouthwash, but eventually concluded they were for dry mouth health, not for moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> For situations where your mouth is dry to begin with, this spray is the answer</li>
            <li> I have Sjogren&#x27;s syndrome and am always looking for products to help with my dry mouth.</li>

            <li> Never really liked Biotene; it works OK, but tastes stale.</li>
            <li> not really any bester than the others.</li>
            <li> total waste of money.</li>

            <li> The mint flavor is anything but \\&quot;great\\&quot; and it is certainly NOT \\&quot;mild\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for a cruise wearing &amp;#34;THE PATCH&amp;#34; behind my ear, horrible dry mouth, now the OASIS!</li>
            <li> Biotene also has sprays and other products I have found beneficial.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a cure, but it masks the burning sensation longer than any other product I have tried</li>
            <li> When I found this product I was hesitant, but after reading the other reviews just took a leap of faith and tried it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Oasis moisturizing  spray since 2006 when I had my salivary gland removed due to cancer.   </li>
            <li> Also, price cheaper than other brand in store.</li>
            <li> and I have tried other sprays that did not work as well.</li>
            <li> I did not find the mint taste objectionable as I have with other brands.  </li>
            <li> It seems to work primarily due to the ingredient glycerine, (glycerine has been used as a lemony mouth swab by hospitals for this purpose for years)</li>
            <li> compared to other mouth sprays.</li>
            <li> I keep it by my night stand and when dry mouth wakes me up, just a little squirt</li>
            <li> I am on heavy pain meds and thus suffer from severe dry mouth.</li>
            <li> To me, spearmint is a \\&quot;sour mint\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I previously used Biotene spray but could not find it in the stores.  </li>
            <li> It has a slight licorice taste after a minute or two.  </li>
            <li> : I did some on-line research and, apparently, mint and caraway are commonly confused with taste</li>
            <li> It might be a little pricey, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Gives me a little indigeston</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different products for dry mouth and Oasis was, by far, the worst I&#x27;ve tried yet.  </li>
            <li> He used it before bedtime,but had to wake up every few hours to use it again.</li>
            <li> Well, Oasis is one of the few products in the world, that I can&#x27;t imagine living without.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thick &amp; has a horrible flavor that in no-way resembles &amp;#34;mild mint.&amp;#34;  On the few times I was able to tolerate the taste, it did nothing for my nighttime dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> As a result she suffers from dry mouth as well as dry itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> but it is unable at local drug store and on line.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy</li>
            <li> The spray bottle is small and just shoots a stream of liquid into your mouth and not a spray.  </li>
            <li> I got this item for my husband who had radiation for oprphagneal cancer this past feb and March.</li>
            <li> , I am not sure why.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several different mouth moisturizers before, but they have all been very unpleasant to use.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion this product is a bit expensive for the amount provided, but it relieves my night time dry mouth condition for at least 2 hours after applying one squirt.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, it is hard to find in my area.</li>
            <li> It stimulates saliva and works for at least a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li> I was forced to go to Amazon to find it when my source (Kroger and Walgreen) stopped carrying it.   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing all right, but tastes awful.</li>
            <li> They are tough customers too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the Gallup Panel, and one of the questions they ask, which normally drives me crazy, because it seems so stupid</li>
            <li> Also, the taste takes a little getting used to, but not too bad.</li>
            <li> When I saw how expensive the Biotene product had become, I tried Oasis.  </li>
            <li> And the spray is very thin.</li>
            <li> Dry mouth is SOOOOO annoying!  </li>
            <li> It was very difficult to find anywhere to purchase.  </li>
            <li> That kinda sucks, I hate dishonesty!</li>
            <li> the taste was bad to awful(granted</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;The biotene is horrible tasting.</li>
            <li> Their pricei  was outrageous.  </li>
            <li> This mouth spray is disgusting ..</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Oasis is the best moisturizer that I have found. I suffer from Sjorgen&#x27;s Disease (basically dry mouth &amp; eyes) and this product gets me thru the day. I would recommend for anyone suffering from this condition.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my elderly parents who suffer from dry mouth. They say it is wonderful and really works well. They are tough customers too so this is high praise.</li>
            <li> This is the best mouth spray for dry mouth.  I have tried others and nothing gave me relief like Oasis Mouth Spray.  I keep it by my night stand and when dry mouth wakes me up, just a little squirt and I can go back to sleep.  It was very difficult to find anywhere to purchase.  I was so so happy to find it on Amazon. Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the fact that this product contains saccharine(also has hydrogenated castor oil-am not sure how safe this is either).Also the taste was bad to awful(granted everyone&#x27;s tastes are different).I much prefer Biotene Oral Balance Gel which lasts longer and tastes much better.There is also an oral balance liquid product.Biotene also has sprays and other products I have found beneficial.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my father who went through radiation for mouth cancer. This procedure destroyed his salivary glands. He used it before bedtime,but had to wake up every few hours to use it again. While briefly it helped, but it really did not do the trick.If anyone has any suggestions on a product that would last longer that would be helpful.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve found to give relief for burning mouth syndrome.  It&#x27;s not a cure, but it masks the burning sensation longer than any other product I have tried</li>
            <li> This is probably the best spray for dry mouth on the market, and I have tried them all.</li>
            <li> I have tried countless products for dry mouth caused by medication.  Then I discovered Oasis Mouth Moisturing Spray.  It works!!! Two or three sprays coat the inside of the mouth and I can talk and/or sleep.  Makes me very comfortable.  I give it FIVE STARS!!!</li>
            <li> I am an actress who has dry mouth and when about to launch in to a song on stage, this can be a big problem! I had been using sour ball candy for awhile, but found that I&#x27;d have to chew as fast as I could if it was not gone by the time I had to make my entrance on stage. When I found this product I was hesitant, but after reading the other reviews just took a leap of faith and tried it.  It is wonderful, and totally helps me. One spray gets me through Act 1 no problem!  At intermission, another spray and I&#x27;m set until the end of the show.  I haven&#x27;t tried too many other sprays to compare but now I don&#x27;t need to. This tastes good, and works well. What more do I need?  Well... a better agent would be nice! ;)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to last long. And the spray is very thin. I am on heavy pain meds and thus suffer from severe dry mouth. I think I need t o try something else.</li>
            <li> My wife is on peritoneal dyalisis and ,like hemo dyalisis, the process pulls fluid from her system.  As a result she suffers from dry mouth as well as dry itchy skin.  This product has been imensely helpful with the dry mouth, and contains the oils and mint essence that provide lasting relief.  Buy it in bulk whenever we run low.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Oasis moisturizing  spray since 2006 when I had my salivary gland removed due to cancer.   I was forced to go to Amazon to find it when my source (Kroger and Walgreen) stopped carrying it.   They recommended Biotech instead.  Believe me, it tastes wierd and did not do the job.  The dentist gave me a sample of something that cost 3 times as much and didn&#x27;t do the job either.   My doctor originally recommended it over all other brands and I&#x27;m glad I took his advice.  Even my husband uses it at night when his mouth becomes dry from his c-pap.  I&#x27;m glad I was able to find it thru Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product is great for dry mouth problems. Just a couple of sprays and your mouth is coated with a pleasant tasty film that instantly lubricates your mouth.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on the recommendation of a speech pathologist for vocal cord disfunction. I bough 3 bottles and have only used  part of one. I was thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> not really any bester than the others. it works a little but has that slimy feel and only works very short time. I am just drinking more water and using really good lip gloss.</li>
            <li> On the recommendation of my dentist, I got this to help with oral dryness during radiation therapy for neck cancer.  It works fine and really provided a lot of relief. I liked it so much that after using the first bottle, I bought 6 more thru Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> My medication causes my mouth to be extremely dry during the night and brushing before bed makes it even worse--to the point that it wakes me up.  I tried the dentist recommended Biotene toothpaste and mouthwash, but eventually concluded they were for dry mouth health, not for moisturizing.  I bought and used their moisturizing gel and it did help a lot, but if I forgot to use it and was awakened with super dry mouth, I found the gel too thick to use at that time.  This spray is just right.  The taste is very mild and it solves the problem.  I&#x27;ve started using it now before going to bed because it&#x27;s sometimes just easier than the gel. The gel does work, but you have to have a certain amount of saliva to get it to spread around.  For situations where your mouth is dry to begin with, this spray is the answer and I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really moisturize my mouth at all</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry mouth, especially at night.  Oasis gives me relief for a couple of hours as I wake up that often.  I am upset with the fact that the company doesn&#x27;t offer it without buying the mouthwash at the same time.  It is easier to spray my mouth when I need to without having to get up and use the wash.</li>
            <li> a good substitute when traveling instead of hauling the mouthwash bottle</li>
            <li> My husband has asthma and takes several asthma medications.  With all the medications, his mouth will become very dry especially during the night.  He keeps a bottle on his nightstand to soothe his throat.  I used to purchase Biotene spray but it is unable at local drug store and on line.  Oasis is a good alternative and fairly reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Happy to have to keep in my purse or around the house.</li>
            <li> I have Sjogren&#x27;s syndrome and am always looking for products to help with my dry mouth. The taste of this stuff was so strong it made me nauseated. I threw it away!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every oral moisturizer I&#x27;ve found in every store.  None is better than Oasis.  I have a very dry mouth from medical problems and the meds I use to treat them.  Sometimes my mouth is so dry people can&#x27;t understand me when I talk.  Just a couple of sprays of Oasis not only solves my dry mouth, but it eliminates my embarrassment from not being able to be coherent!  I don&#x27;t know what I would do without Oasis spray.  (I don&#x27;t really like the mouthwash very much, and use a different brand that works better for the needs I have -- it has peroxide in it, which helps treat the mouth sores I get.)  I&#x27;m on the Gallup Panel, and one of the questions they ask, which normally drives me crazy, because it seems so stupid: On a scale of one to ten, \\&quot;I can&#x27;t imagine a world without this product\\&quot; with an answer of one being I would never miss it, and 10 being that I couldn&#x27;t live without it.  Well, Oasis is one of the few products in the world, that I can&#x27;t imagine living without.  It has literally made me feel comfortable about being in a group of people again, because I don&#x27;t have to worry about not being able to talk because of my dry mouth.  Oasis is a ten.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this helpful. It burned my mouth and throat a bit, and the moisture it provided was not long lasting. I will stick with hard sugar free candy and sugar free cough drops to help with dry mouth.</li>
            <li> What a relief!  Have tried many things for dry mouth and so glad to have found this. FWIW, combined with a non- fluoride toothpaste and feel the combo has really turned the corner for me.</li>
            <li> This product tastes good but only lasts for a little while. I recommend XyliMelts Xylitol Time-Release Adhering Domes if you have a dry mouth. They work much better and last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Dry mouth is SOOOOO annoying!  This has been the best temporary fix yet.  It&#x27;s easy to use and give immediate relief.  Sometimes it works a long time and sometimes only a short time.  BUT I would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> 30% glycerine at this price?</li>
            <li> have used it before and I was happy with the product. I would recomend to anyone with dry mouth problem... for a time I was able to purchase Oasis at my local drug store ... However I have not been able to find it any where ... so the only way I can get it is ordering online  that sometimes can present a problem</li>
            <li> Was delivered within a couple of days.  Have problem with dry mouth due to sinus problems.  I keep this at the bedside so, if I wake in the middle of the night, I can take a spray and go right back to sleep.  I previously used Biotene spray but could not find it in the stores.  This was delivered so quickly and saved a lot of gasoline.  Also, price cheaper than other brand in store.</li>
            <li> Oasis is superior to the many products I&#x27;ve tried, and that includes Biotene. I wish it were available in stores. Thank goodness for Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth as a result of reflux and/or the medicine I am taking for it. The mouthspray tastes good and offers relief for about a minute and then the sensitive tongue feeling is back.</li>
            <li> This tiny little bottle will be used up fairly quickly. It is a temporary relief but not long lasting. I was disappointed in this product. I used it for my dry mouth which keeps me awake at night because  I am a mouth breather. I had to go back to my eucalyptus drops instead.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, it is hard to find in my area. This helps me sleep, as my mouth drys out at night. The delivery was when I expected, packed properly,</li>
            <li> I bought the oasis for dry mouth in the middle of the night. It does help but the taste is not so good and it&#x60;s effect is not very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then again ....nothing is perfect</li>
            <li> very pleasant tasting - easy to use.  One bottle lasts for several months.  Really keeps my mouth moisturized.  Will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered Biotine, but was sent Oasis instead.  Works okay, but not the all night protection to the same degree.  When you sleep with oxygen as my wife and I do, the need something a bit stronger.  Not bad, but not 5 star.</li>
            <li> Works just fine.  Only wish the moisturizing would last a little longer.  But, that&#x27;s the result I get from any of these moisturizers for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Excellent on the go mouisturizer for dry mouth conditions. I used it in the dry conditions of Arizona as well as in the deep South. It ALWAYS does the job with just a couple of squirts. Unfortunately, I can no longer find it locally, so Amazon&#x27;s carrying of this product was a great boon to me. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different products for dry mouth and Oasis was, by far, the worst I&#x27;ve tried yet.  The mint flavor is anything but \\&quot;great\\&quot; and it is certainly NOT \\&quot;mild\\&quot;.  The taste is so strong it felt like it was burning, which was followed by a numbing sensation.  It reminded me of Chloroseptic spray.  Totally gross and I had to keep rinsing my mouth with water to try to get rid of it.  I will definitely be retuning this product.  I&#x27;ll stick with the Thayer&#x27;s Dry Mouth Spray, which doesn&#x27;t moisturize for long, but is very pleasant tasting and doesn&#x27;t feel numbing.</li>
            <li> This works weel, but me in a while it causes some additional mucous in the throat.  However, better than dry mouth.  Used to be able to buy in the store, but impossible to find now.&lt;br /&gt;The biotene is horrible tasting.</li>
            <li> The Oasis mouth spray seems to be the most pleasant tasting moisturizing spray available.  I have dry mouth from radiation treatments and I use this spray constantly.  It works much better than the biotene product for me anyway.</li>
            <li> This product is excellant for the relief of dry mouth. I have Sjogren&#x27;s syndrome and must fight constantly to keep my mouth moisturized. The spray is convenient and easy to use discretely. I found it difficult to find in my drug store so being able to use the net is a big plus!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work changed up meds no longer have</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT FOR ANYONE WHO HAS A DRY MOUTH FOR WHAT EVER REASON, C-PAP USER, SOME MEDICATIONS,OR WHAT EVER THE CAUSE.</li>
            <li> Hard to find, but worth having.  Good taste, and refreshing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing all right, but tastes awful. I prefer Xlear Spry Rain Oral Mist. That stuff at least tastes good.</li>
            <li> the spray is ok but mouth is still dry.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with dry mouth and Oasis Mouth Spray has worked really well for me and I have tried other sprays that did not work as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but I like the Thayers better for short term relief of dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I have very dry mouth due to medications.  This is the best product I have used.  But I will NOT buy from Ideal Pharmacy.  Their pricei  was outrageous.  I misunderstood their ad and thought I was getting 3 bottles.  Instead I only got one.  My mistake;  but still a scam.</li>
            <li> It really does work well, tastes good and lasts much longer than the expensive doctor recommended brand.  And it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> This product gives instant relief to a dry mouth condition and has a taste that I find far more pleasant than other products on the market.</li>
            <li> excellent for dry throat, especially if salivary glands have been affected by chemo and/or radiation therapy.</li>
            <li> Works better than anything I have found to date for dry mouth.  Not perfect, but better than most.  First got it as a sample from doctor, but couldn&#x27;t find it in local pharmacies.  Found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been cursed with a dry mouth.  I was using another brand and it didn&#x27;t always work.  A friend recommended Oasis.  I tried it and have been very happy with it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I take a lot of meds that can dry out your mouth, so the dentist recommended something to keep things moist in there.  This stuff really does a great job &amp; tastes great, too.  Never really liked Biotene; it works OK, but tastes stale.</li>
            <li> This is way better than a similar product that is advertised on TV.</li>
            <li> Saw virtually no difference.  My mouth was dry after tonsilectomy</li>
            <li> I really like Oasis Mouth Moisturizing Spray better than Biotene.  The Biotene feels chalky, and I don&#x27;t like the taste.</li>
            <li> No complaints about its moisturizing effects but it is spearmint flavored. I prefer wintergreen or peppermint. I&#x27;ll stick with Thayers. Note to manufacturers of oral hygiene products- terms like \\&quot;mild mint\\&quot;, \\&quot;cool mint\\&quot; or \\&quot;fresh mint\\&quot; need clarification on the bottle. To me, spearmint is a \\&quot;sour mint\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Works ok, not the greatest though</li>
            <li> Perfect for a cruise wearing &amp;#34;THE PATCH&amp;#34; behind my ear, horrible dry mouth, now the OASIS!</li>
            <li> This mouth spray is disgusting .. it&#x27;s thick &amp; has a horrible flavor that in no-way resembles &amp;#34;mild mint.&amp;#34;  On the few times I was able to tolerate the taste, it did nothing for my nighttime dry mouth.  Avoid this product like the plague...total waste of money.</li>
            <li> This spray is so much better than the other one you usually see displayed so prominently in drug stores.  It stimulates saliva and works for at least a couple of hours.  It can be carried in your pocket or purse and really works.</li>
            <li> The best mouth moisturizer I have used. Pleasant taste and long lasting. It might be a little pricey, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> I love oasis, it doesn&#x27;t have as much of a medicine taste as biotene. In pharmacies this little bottle is way more expensive than a big bottle of biotene. No joke. I couldn&#x27;t believe it at first either. This stuff deserves the attention biotene gets!</li>
            <li> Best thing for throats I have found. No store carries it in this area.&lt;br /&gt;They will order it but then i have to pay in advance, wait then go back&lt;br /&gt;to the store and pick it up. Much easier to order this way. I usually buy&lt;br /&gt;about six at a time, and that will last a couple of months. Very quick delivery&lt;br /&gt;time as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Oasis before, but could never find it in the stores I shop.  One day I saw it on Amazon.com and was so happy to find it.&lt;br /&gt;It is very helpful and soothing to us who suffer with auto-immune diseases which cause dry mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended it to friends,  and even talked to my dentist about it recently.&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy I found this on Amazon and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> very happy with seller and product</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT - IF YOU SUFFER WITH CHROIC DRY MOUTH - THIS IS A PRODUCT YOU WILL WANT - IT HAS A LIGHT MINT TASTE AND HELP KEEP YOUR MOUTH MOIST - IT DOES NOT BURN - ALCOHOL FREE - AND COMES IN A VARIETY OF OTHER ORAL CARE PRODUCTS -LOU CARUSO</li>
            <li> Three years ago, I lost two saliva ducts in my mouth to radiation from lip cancer. I have had a time trying to find the products that works for me. i found it in Oasis! The taste alone is reason enough. This mouth wash and mouth spray keep me moisturized throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for giving me the relief that I was looking for in dry mouth products.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this product is a bit expensive for the amount provided, but it relieves my night time dry mouth condition for at least 2 hours after applying one squirt.  I did not find the mint taste objectionable as I have with other brands.  Since it works as advertised and has a reasonable taste, I really have benefitted from its use.</li>
            <li> It was much better then the previous spray I used.&lt;br /&gt;More refreshing flavor as well.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone should try this change for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I take a medication that causes dry mouth.  I have tried several different mouth moisturizers before, but they have all been very unpleasant to use.  Oasis is not.  It works well, without the ick factor.  I just bought a second bottle.</li>
            <li> This does not work well at all.  The spray bottle is small and just shoots a stream of liquid into your mouth and not a spray.  It did nothing at all for my dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I need to carry a mouth spray for dry mouth caused by medications I must take, and I was looking for something comparable to the Biotene product, which does not seem to be available in drug stores any longer, alongside other Biotene products. When I saw how expensive the Biotene product had become, I tried Oasis.  Not bad, I carry it &amp; use it, but it is not as effective nor as long lasting as Biotene.  It seems to work primarily due to the ingredient glycerine, (glycerine has been used as a lemony mouth swab by hospitals for this purpose for years) but Biotene is a superior product since it contains synthetic saliva,and it works far better.</li>
            <li> The product works very well and is convenient to use anytime, anywhere</li>
            <li> Best stuff for dry mouth.  Don&#x27;t leave home without it.  Recommend to anyone with dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Great for use in airplanes or other dry environments.  A bit pricey but worth it compared to other mouth sprays.</li>
            <li> I have used this before and find it quite helpful in the middle of the night when my mouth feels like a desert.  Maybe could make the bottle a little bigger to last longer.</li>
            <li> It tastes good, but doesn&#x27;t work for me. It does not provide any lasting relief for dry mouth for me.</li>
            <li> I seriously dont get all the great reviews on here. maybe my mouth is unique because it DID NOT WORK at all. the spray made my mouth even dryer.</li>
            <li> Works well. I just wish everyone wasn&#x27;t price gouging now that Biotene Spray is unavailable. That kinda sucks, I hate dishonesty!</li>
            <li> I like this better than the competitor&#x27;s type and order several at a time.  Does the job!!!  I awaken in the middle of the night with dry mouth and this is a great product for allowing me to return to sleep.  It stays on my nightstand.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Oasis&amp;#34; says it is mild mint flavor, my Wife tested it and confirms that it is, but to me, it is not. It tastes like a strong caraway flavor. I like caraway in Rye Bread but not in a mouth spray, especially when it has a burning sensation as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry mouth from radiation treatment and my taste also has been affected. I have tried most every spray available; &amp;#34;Biotene&amp;#34;, CVS&#x27; mouth spray, &amp;#34;Rain&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Vocal Ease&amp;#34;. This, and &amp;#34;Vocal Ease&amp;#34; have the strangest tastes and they burn. The others don&#x27;t. They all have varying degrees of effectiveness but I find myself going back to &amp;#34;Biotene&amp;#34;. None give all night relief. For that I use two &amp;#34;OraMoist dry mouth patches&amp;#34;, one on each side of my mouth between gums and inside of mouth. It leaves a weird, sticky coating but is much, much, better than dry mouth and lasts through the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/26/15: I did some on-line research and, apparently, mint and caraway are commonly confused with taste issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, be aware that radiation patients may not get the same favorable results as have been reported by others.</li>
            <li> Gives me a little indigeston</li>
            <li> I was expecting something a little more like a mist to seach my vocal folds. My Doctor reccomended it to help after I lost my singing voice</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife as we could not find it in local stores will purchase again when my wife runs low.</li>
            <li> I tried Oasis dry mouth spray when the other brand I used was unavailable no matter where I tried to find it. Oasis dry mouth spray has a better taste and its formula has real staying power, keeps my mouth &amp; throat moist and comfortable. I&#x27;m staying with Oasis from now on!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t spray like a mist it&#x27;s just a streight shot and isn&#x27;t as effective but good enough</li>
            <li> I got this item for my husband who had radiation for oprphagneal cancer this past feb and March. The six week ordeal of Mon. to Friday radiation with very dry mouth and the inability to swallow. He calims the spary helps him so that he doesnot have to carry water with him constantly to wet his mouth. So he claims it has helped him be more comfortable. So I can recommend it. thankfully my husband is able to eat some foods now but stillas terribly dry mouth.</li>
            <li> The Oasis brand mouth spray and mouthwash are both the best dry mouth products I&#x27;ve come across. The mouthwash is difficult to get at what I consider a fair price so I use Biotene Mouthwash and then use this spray for its mouth refreshing qualities. This is one of the best products to help with moisture in the mouth. I use a couple sprays of this before bedtime to help keep my mouth moist. It doesn&#x27;t last till morning but it does help get me to sleep without dealing with a dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth from all the meds I take for Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy.  If it weren&#x27;t for OASIS MOUTH SPRAY I wouldn&#x27;t be able to talk or eat.  Walgreens used to carry this wonderful product - but no more.  I don&#x27;t know why.  Maybe you could look into the matter.  I have been buying it from the OASIS COMPANY through Amazon.  I couln&#x27;t live without it!  I&#x27;ts better than any other product on the market!  Judy Vollbrecht</li>
            <li> this works great....wonderful product</li>
            <li> Better than Biotene!  Leaves a nice feeling and taste in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Was a gift for my mother-she said it worked pretty well. Shipped promptly.</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered. Tastes great and works very well</li>
            <li> so glad you had this stuff</li>
            <li> One of the best moisturizer available on the market</li>
            <li> I bought both brands to see if one was better and I like this one better, I am not sure why.  It has a slight licorice taste after a minute or two.  I use both and both products work very well.</li>
            <li> Oasis is the best product that I have found so far for nocturnal dry mouth. It provides a pleasant, long lasting spray for the mouth.</li>
            <li> I tried this at night (dry mouth from allergy meds) and also before an interview (nerves!). I found that to last any length of time at all I needed more than 1 or 2 squirts.  (Maybe 5-6.)  I also wish it would spritz to cover more area instead of the stream that it squirts.&lt;br /&gt;Mint flavor is mild.</li>
            <li> All-in-all, I would recommend this product to anyone that has dry mouth. In my experience, it provides pretty quick relief. However, don&#x27;t expect the dryness to disappear for long. I&#x27;d say I respray every 30 minutes or so; more if I&#x27;m working out. Also, the taste takes a little getting used to, but not too bad.</li>
