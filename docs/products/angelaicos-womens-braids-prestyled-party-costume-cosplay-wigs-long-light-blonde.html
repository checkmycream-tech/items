            <li>PERFECT for my 10 year old daughter to wear for Halloween!</li>
            <li>Best Queen Elsa wig I have seen so far!</li>
            <li>Very good quality, fast delivery</li>
            <li>it is perfect for a 4 year old girl.</li>
            <li>this wig is cheaply made, if your looking for a good Elsa wig</li>
            <li>It was pretty and got it for a great price but would not purchase again</li>
            <li>Very cheap looking.</li>
            <li>I rebraided it while it was on my daughter&#x27;s head and honestly, it looked pretty good when I was done.  </li>
            <li>It is very nice quality for the price, and looks exactly like Elsa&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Fit fine with some adjustments, but more importantly looked great for my daughter.</li>
            <li>No damages.&lt;br /&gt;Looks mostly like photo</li>
            <li>It was really nice, but it didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>Delivery arrived 3 weeks earlier than stated which was AWESOME!!!!!!</li>
            <li>The wig was barely able to stay on and the hair came out of place.</li>
            <li>maybe as the picture shows, it is more for a doll?</li>
            <li>I keep the wig on my top shelf in my closet.  </li>
            <li>The color of the hair is lovely.</li>
            <li>Alot better than the Disney brand</li>
            <li>dealing with this would be more of a hassle than the $12 I paid for it.  </li>
            <li>Fit perfect on my 3 yr old.</li>
            <li>but it was able to be tightened.</li>
            <li>The wig is nice but it doesn&#x27;t fit too well.  </li>
            <li>It is much better than the Disney wig.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with the customer service provided by Amazon.</li>
            <li>I read through the reviews on this wig and went against my better judgment and ordered it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks more like a colonial wig.</li>
            <li>My daughter was well pleased with this wig to top off her Elsa costume for Halloween.</li>
            <li>Purchases this wig as part of my grand daughter&#x27;s Princess Elsa (Frozen) costume.</li>
            <li>ok so this is meant for a person with a shrunken head.</li>
            <li>I am not at all pleased with this wig.</li>
            <li>and I guess they are ok,</li>
            <li>great quality and fast shipping</li>
            <li>Grand daughter loves the Disney Frozen wig to go with her Elsa outfit for dress up</li>
            <li>and I love the color and even the braid</li>
            <li>but if it would fit!</li>
            <li>Fit well, was shipped nicely but do not like the top part of the wig.  </li>
            <li>and she doesn&#x27;t seem to mind that it is a bit bushy on top.</li>
            <li>The color is more blonde than platinum, but the style and quality was just perfect.</li>
            <li>But it was a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>Loved that it came MUCH quicker than the estimate!</li>
            <li>Still, fit me much better :)</li>
            <li>Bought it for my 4 year old, fits her great.</li>
            <li>I loved this Item, Fast Shipping..</li>
            <li>time - good quality - look almost real</li>
            <li>wigÂ´s color is not like the picture, but is similar so it works for my purpose which is dress my daughter up for Halloween, now if you are looking for a great great quality and a real ElsaÂ´s wig, I suggest to spend a little more and buy another wig, however as I said, for me is perfect!.</li>
            <li>I placed an order for three wigs, and this is the one I was most excited about, as I planned on dressing as Elsa for Halloween.</li>
            <li>The product came very quickly and was just like the picture.  </li>
            <li>and I can tell that it would knot up easily.</li>
            <li>but I think is just fine for my daughter.</li>
            <li>I was pretty impressed with the quality of the wig especially since it was really cheap.</li>
            <li>Very pretty and great price, but didn&#x27;t fit my 6 year old.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit great...bad quality.  </li>
            <li>It is a great wig, but by the time you go to wear it, all the short pieces come out of the wig.</li>
            <li>People say it dosent fit.</li>
            <li>the wig barely fit around her head</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li>It was not at all flimsy or cheap looking in any way.  </li>
            <li>It would maybe fit a premature baby.</li>
            <li>Even with the wig cap it barely fit</li>
            <li>Thanks it is nice</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>This wig fits my 4 year old daughter perfect, but as for an adult there is no way to make it fit.</li>
            <li>I had no problems with fit, as it is adjustable.  </li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t fit her head.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for my daughter for Halloween (since none of the child size wigs fit her head).</li>
            <li>It says it&#x27;s adult, though it fits my 6 year old perfectly.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly as pictured and is pretty good quality.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty pleased</li>
            <li>It was nothing like the picture, but was fun!</li>
            <li>It was soft and not snarly, it was the right color and was braided nicely and looked just like the picture to me with alittle styling for the top part of the hair.</li>
            <li>Pretty &amp; well-made wig that looks very much like Elsa&#x27;s from the popular Disney movie, Frozen.</li>
            <li>Not only would it fit my granddaughter&#x27;s head nicely, it also fit mine as well.  </li>
            <li>Gorgeous and theatrical style quality.  </li>
            <li>so I was able to pull it off very well.</li>
            <li>so satisfied, the quality for the price I paid is very acceptable, the issue is that I have to style it</li>
            <li>when you wear it in real life it looks more like George Washington or some member of parliament.</li>
            <li>ok, didn&#x27;t really cover all my wife&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li>My little Elsa just loved it!</li>
            <li>I just couldn&#x27;t manage to make it fit right.</li>
            <li>Also we received it very quickly which we really appreciated!</li>
            <li>I have a very small head so the adjustable strap worked perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Luckily  child just went with it</li>
            <li>Great for smaller kids, not so much adults.  </li>
            <li>It fit better on my 6 year old&#x27;s head</li>
            <li>Looks pretty at first, but gets messed up real quick when the kids get a hold of it.</li>
            <li>Item arrived fairly quickly considering it came from China.</li>
            <li>The fitting is a bit strange, but it&#x27;s such a good quality hairpiece I had to give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li>own three other Elsa wigs, and many other wigs as I own a production company, so I have an idea of top quality wigs</li>
            <li>Pretty good quality and nicely crafted wig but the size is on the small side.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought other kind of wig and they all fit fine</li>
            <li>I got a women&#x27;s assuming it would be just the right size since she does have a head full of hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy because I got it in just 2 weeks and half.</li>
            <li>Looks absolutely NOTHING like the picture!!</li>
            <li>however, luckily it was for my 6 year old niece because I don&#x27;t think this thing would have fit my head!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s was a nice wig the only thing is it does not come styled like this.</li>
            <li>The amount of hair on this should be appropriate for an adult, but the cap and size of the wig is about newborn sized.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I cannot imagine this fitting on anyone over 2 years old.  </li>
            <li>Gorgeous wig for the price - and the thinning people mention is not really an issue - its just a wig without a skull cap</li>
            <li>Braid is nice though if it just would have been bigger.</li>
            <li>It is DEFINITELY worth the money</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast too, very pleased overall!</li>
            <li>Though this is a beautiful head piece, it is very heavy</li>
            <li>When we put them on it just did not feel right.</li>
            <li>it shows her hair line and slides right off.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re used to the &amp;#34;throw-away&amp;#34; kind that normally come with costumes, so it&#x27;s tough for me to rate what a real wig should be like, but this one was just beautiful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that I have a large head, as most other wigs fit fine.</li>
            <li>Luckily for us (and after reading all the others reviews), I was looking for something to fit my 4 year old.</li>
            <li>The wig itself is very full and soft and I haven&#x27;t noticed any bald</li>
            <li>It barely fits, you can still see the hairline in the forehead, but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I HAVE ONE EXCITED, HAPPY LITTLE GIRL!!!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t exactly stay on your head quite right.</li>
            <li>I purchased for my 4 yr old grand-daughter and it&#x27;s better then the real Frozen wigs they sell at the Disney Store because it is adjustable.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for just a quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 5 yr old, it looked great out of package but kept slipping off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bonus of the hair net was great also, we&#x27;ll keep it for future wig-wearing occasions.</li>
            <li>IT WONT FIT ON AN ADULT!</li>
            <li>Very fast</li>
            <li>This wig is very thick and looks beautiful on...not a cheap looking wig at all...very much a high quality item.</li>
            <li>very high quality well worth the money</li>
            <li>Barely fit my 3yr old.</li>
            <li>Hair is like coarse horse hair, Looked ok but braid was coming out</li>
            <li>Too big, top of hair looks nothing like pic.</li>
            <li>The picture looks much better than the actual wig</li>
            <li>The wig came in a clear plastic bag with no brand ( that&#x27;s not important to me if the quality and and fit are good).</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like the picture but wig barely fit my 4 year old correctly</li>
            <li>It barely fit my 6yr old daughter.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>and then my Sister-In-Law put the wig on my 3 year old nephew and it fit him</li>
            <li>and it only covered the top of her head.  </li>
            <li>The braid is extra long, so it looks great coming around the shoulder.  </li>
            <li>Need more of a snug fitting cap since the wig is small.</li>
            <li>This is the back-up Elsa wig I ordered because I wasn&#x27;t sure the first 1 that I ordered would get to me in time for my convention next week.  </li>
            <li>They look so real t like Elisa yea!</li>
            <li>And the front was not very well styled, so we kind of had to work with it a bit.</li>
            <li>In fact, it didn&#x27;t even fit on my 6 month old baby&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>so it definitely took more that 10-14 business days...</li>
            <li>Everyone knew exactly who I was at my Halloween party.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was happy that the bangs were at least styled, though when I put it on the style was not correct.</li>
            <li>The description says women&#x27;s wig but this barely fit my 9 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>It also cost more to return than the actual wig</li>
            <li>First of all, it came protectef with netting and plastic</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll know better</li>
            <li>Heavy and good quality for the price.  </li>
            <li>thick and full - good quality</li>
            <li>It came pretty decently and when I took it out of the package and hair net it was in great brushed condition.</li>
            <li>I have ordered many wigs in the past and have never seen one with so many large bald areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You need to be a stylist to get it to look like the picture because the bangs and top of wig just lay flat.</li>
            <li>With the pull tabs inside, was able to easily adjust to fit her small three-year old head.</li>
            <li>It arrived fast the top of the hair is just short</li>
            <li>The braid in the back of the wig was nice but the top of the wig was a mess.  </li>
            <li>Sizing was made for a small child which in my case was good for granddaughter.</li>
            <li>I got this dress for my daughter she loved it so much she started crying!</li>
            <li>It did not fall off the wig but it certainly did not look like the picture.</li>
            <li>It certainly didn&#x27;t look like on the mannequin.</li>
            <li>It will certainly work for what I need.  </li>
            <li>This hair had a great resemblance to Elsa; however it was very hard for my 6 year&lt;br /&gt;Old to keep it on her head.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>Seems a little snug ,but with hair pins it should fit my 4 year old just fine!</li>
            <li>It might fit a normal sized 12 year old, but not anyone older than that.</li>
            <li>The wig was much more than I expected, it has given my daughter much pleasure.</li>
            <li>Fast arrival, very well constructed.</li>
            <li>So my daughter didn&#x27;t get much use out of it given it</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves this wig.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>Quality is better than expected.</li>
            <li>yr olds that Elsa is real.</li>
            <li>The shortest top  layer is not curled or styled as pictured and since it is synthetic there is not much you can do with it.  </li>
            <li>but I think that makes it very durable.</li>
            <li>not a white wig and doesn&#x27;t fit well doesn&#x27;t look like the Elsa hair in the movie.</li>
            <li>This is the wig to buy if your toddler wants to be Elsa and needs a wig - otherwise go to a costume shop.  </li>
            <li>After taking it to a salon to get some help it turns out that to get the wig to fit properly, you HAVE to attach the elastic bands together</li>
            <li>I do suggest buying a real wig cap as the one that comes with</li>
            <li>The adjustment piece on the back of the wig also did not help to secure the wig to the head.  </li>
            <li>in terms of weight - may be too much for a child under 6</li>
            <li>It looks just like in the picture which I was happy about, was not happy with the shipping since I bought it on 9/25/14 to use for Halloween and it did not arrive until 11/4/14</li>
            <li>this is a quality wig, can not believe how real it is...highly recommend it</li>
            <li>It is kind of heavy</li>
            <li>Not bad for a costume for a young girl or an adult.</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s probably fine if you&#x27;re not too particular, but my daughter is, so this was pretty much money down the drain.</li>
            <li>Also it is more a yellow blonde</li>
            <li>Wig is made decently, however, the seller ships from China and don&#x27;t plan on getting your wig for 1-2 months or not at all...</li>
            <li>didnt fit my five year old who has a bigger than avg head.</li>
            <li>On the plus side: it arrived quickly, had an extra bracelet in it, and the return was no-hassle.</li>
            <li>Another classic case of you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>nice wig but too heavy for 9 year old</li>
            <li>LIKE REAL HAIR, VERY SOFT...</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like Elsa&#x27;s hair, but in live action setting.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>It is highly adjustable and looks like the hair in the movie.  </li>
            <li>Being considered a cosplay wig, we had high expectations.  </li>
            <li>With a little playing around with and hairspray it came out ok but not like the picture.....</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re not going to get a better wig for so little money.  </li>
            <li>The Disney one was just too small for her head - which is interesting because it&#x27;s meant for kids and my daughter&#x27;s head isn&#x27;t abnormally large or anything.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very high quality and looks natural.</li>
            <li>The hair on the wig felt too much like plastic and wasn&#x27;t soft at all.</li>
            <li>and I have a normal sized head.  </li>
            <li>Ok, when I first got this wig I rated it 2 stars, thinking it was way to small for my 4 year old granddaughter&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li>Ot seems to not fit the top of my daughter&#x27;s head</li>
            <li>This is a lovely wig, but it is much too small even for a first-grader.</li>
            <li>Now, it is true this wig does not fit for an adultÂ´s head or at least for an adult with a big head, my daughter is 4 years old and the wig is perfect for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>When I received the wig, the first thing I noticed is that the color was slightly off, it was more yellow than the platinum shown in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only reason gave it an extra star is because it was cheap.</li>
            <li>Pretty but barely fit her small head</li>
            <li>Great quality but a little heavy for our 5 year old&#x27;s head when she went as Elsa for Halloween.</li>
            <li>Glad we ordered a second as back up from a different seller.</li>
            <li>Itchy, small and I&#x27;ll fitting.</li>
            <li>BY FAR!</li>
            <li>Too small for my 7 year old Daughter, also very weighted to the back pulling it back exposing a good 2 inches of hairline.</li>
            <li>This was much too small to fit on my 6 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>Also there were no instructions on how to fit the wig tightly on the head just two flimsy hooks attached to the inside of the wig.  </li>
            <li>The wig might have been functional - if it was large enough to cover my daughter&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>Wig was a little chlaaenfing because rhe front pieces of hair fall free and in face of child..</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t fit me, not even a little bit.</li>
            <li>ok, abit hard to put on</li>
            <li>it was cheap, but not very cute.</li>
            <li>but my six year old loves it</li>
            <li>Looks like an adult size.</li>
            <li>It still shows front part of hair on my 12 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as part of a Halloween costume for my 3-year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>It fits perfectly to an adult head &amp; has hooks to adjust for children.</li>
            <li>I did not realize item ships directly from China</li>
            <li>However, I had a 6-year old wearing it, so it still wasn&#x27;t quite snug.</li>
            <li>This is not for adult heads.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS NOT AN ADULT&#x27;S WIG.  </li>
            <li>I got this for Halloween for my 6yr old daughter.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter who is petite and 14 years old.  </li>
            <li>The wigs did not stay on the child&#x27;s head nor would it stay on an adult head.  </li>
            <li>i even took this wig to a professional cosmologist to see if i could adjust it somewhat</li>
            <li>Not for a 4 year old.</li>
            <li>My four year old uses it during play</li>
            <li>Thought I could use it on my four year old as Elsa, but Im just gonna try and resale it</li>
            <li>Not for an adult head.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 5 year old to wear with her Frozen Elsa costume.  </li>
            <li>This wig was way too small-I ordered it for my 7 year old as part of her Halloween costume</li>
            <li>Fun for Halloween, but it was barely big enough for my five-year-old.</li>
            <li>Product looked great and fast shippingvibtook off a star due to sizing its a women&#x27;s wig but it was too small for my 6 year old daughter in which is your average size for her age</li>
            <li>I made it work really well, by cutting slits in the mesh to make it stretch larger for an adult head, by cutting more short on the top and using hairspray to make the top full, and</li>
            <li>Have no complaints - had to shape it a little bit with some bobby pins but you usually have to do this with every wig - good product</li>
            <li>I was really disappointed because the wig is really nicely made, but I could not make the thing fit</li>
            <li>it is much to small, my daughter who is 7 cannot fit it.  </li>
            <li>It barely fits my 3 year old.</li>
            <li>This was purchased for my daughter and it was extremely small and didn&#x27;t fit a child&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit like the picture :/</li>
            <li>Really funny, but not very functional.</li>
            <li>great was a little thin</li>
            <li>Very hard to keep on head- definitely better in the pictures-</li>
            <li>Hard to fit.</li>
            <li>I was actually quite surprised when I had received the wig.</li>
            <li>Straight out of the package, it looked like the hair had had a rough night of partying.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my 7 year old (who also has a tiny head) and you could see about an inch of her hairline all the way around her head.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my 5 year old and it was slightly big, but had an adjustable band inside, so it worked!</li>
            <li>Very very small won&#x27;t really fit anyone</li>
            <li>I would not wear it daily nor would I purchase an $11 wig that I expected to have that much quality.  </li>
            <li>First the color was wrong, it is more yellow than white, second, it didn&#x27;t come braided and third, the wisps in the front aren&#x27;t enough to try and attempt a copy.</li>
            <li>However it does fit alittle weirdly and alittle small but with a hair net I was able to make it work.</li>
            <li>Kids are notoriously picky, but my daughter didn&#x27;t complain about it being hot, itchy or heavy... actually, not a single peep about it.</li>
            <li>has some crazy long bangs that kind of fall down in the face, just doesn&#x27;t look right.  </li>
            <li>My hair is not long enough to dye so this worked well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really hold the hair in tight to the head.</li>
            <li>It was well made but extremely small, I&#x27;m not sure how it&#x27;s supposed to fit an adult.</li>

            <li> PERFECT for my 10 year old daughter to wear for Halloween!</li>
            <li> Best Queen Elsa wig I have seen so far!</li>
            <li> Very good quality, fast delivery</li>
            <li> it is perfect for a 4 year old girl.</li>
            <li> this wig is cheaply made, if your looking for a good Elsa wig</li>
            <li> It was pretty and got it for a great price but would not purchase again</li>
            <li> Very cheap looking.</li>
            <li> I rebraided it while it was on my daughter&#x27;s head and honestly, it looked pretty good when I was done.  </li>
            <li> It is very nice quality for the price, and looks exactly like Elsa&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Fit fine with some adjustments, but more importantly looked great for my daughter.</li>
            <li> No damages.&lt;br /&gt;Looks mostly like photo</li>
            <li> It was really nice, but it didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> Delivery arrived 3 weeks earlier than stated which was AWESOME!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The wig was barely able to stay on and the hair came out of place.</li>
            <li> maybe as the picture shows, it is more for a doll?</li>
            <li> I keep the wig on my top shelf in my closet.  </li>
            <li> The color of the hair is lovely.</li>
            <li> Alot better than the Disney brand</li>
            <li> dealing with this would be more of a hassle than the $12 I paid for it.  </li>
            <li> Fit perfect on my 3 yr old.</li>
            <li> but it was able to be tightened.</li>
            <li> The wig is nice but it doesn&#x27;t fit too well.  </li>
            <li> It is much better than the Disney wig.</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with the customer service provided by Amazon.</li>
            <li> I read through the reviews on this wig and went against my better judgment and ordered it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks more like a colonial wig.</li>
            <li> My daughter was well pleased with this wig to top off her Elsa costume for Halloween.</li>
            <li> Purchases this wig as part of my grand daughter&#x27;s Princess Elsa (Frozen) costume.</li>
            <li> ok so this is meant for a person with a shrunken head.</li>
            <li> I am not at all pleased with this wig.</li>
            <li> and I guess they are ok,</li>
            <li> great quality and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Grand daughter loves the Disney Frozen wig to go with her Elsa outfit for dress up</li>
            <li> and I love the color and even the braid</li>
            <li> but if it would fit!</li>
            <li> Fit well, was shipped nicely but do not like the top part of the wig.  </li>
            <li> and she doesn&#x27;t seem to mind that it is a bit bushy on top.</li>
            <li> The color is more blonde than platinum, but the style and quality was just perfect.</li>
            <li> But it was a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> Loved that it came MUCH quicker than the estimate!</li>
            <li> Still, fit me much better :)</li>
            <li> Bought it for my 4 year old, fits her great.</li>
            <li> I loved this Item, Fast Shipping..</li>
            <li> time - good quality - look almost real</li>
            <li> wigÂ´s color is not like the picture, but is similar so it works for my purpose which is dress my daughter up for Halloween, now if you are looking for a great great quality and a real ElsaÂ´s wig, I suggest to spend a little more and buy another wig, however as I said, for me is perfect!.</li>
            <li> I placed an order for three wigs, and this is the one I was most excited about, as I planned on dressing as Elsa for Halloween.</li>
            <li> The product came very quickly and was just like the picture.  </li>
            <li> and I can tell that it would knot up easily.</li>
            <li> but I think is just fine for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I was pretty impressed with the quality of the wig especially since it was really cheap.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and great price, but didn&#x27;t fit my 6 year old.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit great...bad quality.  </li>
            <li> It is a great wig, but by the time you go to wear it, all the short pieces come out of the wig.</li>
            <li> People say it dosent fit.</li>
            <li> the wig barely fit around her head</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li> It was not at all flimsy or cheap looking in any way.  </li>
            <li> It would maybe fit a premature baby.</li>
            <li> Even with the wig cap it barely fit</li>
            <li> Thanks it is nice</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> This wig fits my 4 year old daughter perfect, but as for an adult there is no way to make it fit.</li>
            <li> I had no problems with fit, as it is adjustable.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t fit her head.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughter for Halloween (since none of the child size wigs fit her head).</li>
            <li> It says it&#x27;s adult, though it fits my 6 year old perfectly.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly as pictured and is pretty good quality.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty pleased</li>
            <li> It was nothing like the picture, but was fun!</li>
            <li> It was soft and not snarly, it was the right color and was braided nicely and looked just like the picture to me with alittle styling for the top part of the hair.</li>
            <li> Pretty &amp; well-made wig that looks very much like Elsa&#x27;s from the popular Disney movie, Frozen.</li>
            <li> Not only would it fit my granddaughter&#x27;s head nicely, it also fit mine as well.  </li>
            <li> Gorgeous and theatrical style quality.  </li>
            <li> so I was able to pull it off very well.</li>
            <li> so satisfied, the quality for the price I paid is very acceptable, the issue is that I have to style it</li>
            <li> when you wear it in real life it looks more like George Washington or some member of parliament.</li>
            <li> ok, didn&#x27;t really cover all my wife&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> My little Elsa just loved it!</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t manage to make it fit right.</li>
            <li> Also we received it very quickly which we really appreciated!</li>
            <li> I have a very small head so the adjustable strap worked perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Luckily  child just went with it</li>
            <li> Great for smaller kids, not so much adults.  </li>
            <li> It fit better on my 6 year old&#x27;s head</li>
            <li> Looks pretty at first, but gets messed up real quick when the kids get a hold of it.</li>
            <li> Item arrived fairly quickly considering it came from China.</li>
            <li> The fitting is a bit strange, but it&#x27;s such a good quality hairpiece I had to give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> own three other Elsa wigs, and many other wigs as I own a production company, so I have an idea of top quality wigs</li>
            <li> Pretty good quality and nicely crafted wig but the size is on the small side.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other kind of wig and they all fit fine</li>
            <li> I got a women&#x27;s assuming it would be just the right size since she does have a head full of hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy because I got it in just 2 weeks and half.</li>
            <li> Looks absolutely NOTHING like the picture!!</li>
            <li> however, luckily it was for my 6 year old niece because I don&#x27;t think this thing would have fit my head!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was a nice wig the only thing is it does not come styled like this.</li>
            <li> The amount of hair on this should be appropriate for an adult, but the cap and size of the wig is about newborn sized.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I cannot imagine this fitting on anyone over 2 years old.  </li>
            <li> Gorgeous wig for the price - and the thinning people mention is not really an issue - its just a wig without a skull cap</li>
            <li> Braid is nice though if it just would have been bigger.</li>
            <li> It is DEFINITELY worth the money</li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast too, very pleased overall!</li>
            <li> Though this is a beautiful head piece, it is very heavy</li>
            <li> When we put them on it just did not feel right.</li>
            <li> it shows her hair line and slides right off.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re used to the &amp;#34;throw-away&amp;#34; kind that normally come with costumes, so it&#x27;s tough for me to rate what a real wig should be like, but this one was just beautiful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that I have a large head, as most other wigs fit fine.</li>
            <li> Luckily for us (and after reading all the others reviews), I was looking for something to fit my 4 year old.</li>
            <li> The wig itself is very full and soft and I haven&#x27;t noticed any bald</li>
            <li> It barely fits, you can still see the hairline in the forehead, but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I HAVE ONE EXCITED, HAPPY LITTLE GIRL!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t exactly stay on your head quite right.</li>
            <li> I purchased for my 4 yr old grand-daughter and it&#x27;s better then the real Frozen wigs they sell at the Disney Store because it is adjustable.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for just a quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 5 yr old, it looked great out of package but kept slipping off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bonus of the hair net was great also, we&#x27;ll keep it for future wig-wearing occasions.</li>
            <li> IT WONT FIT ON AN ADULT!</li>
            <li> Very fast</li>
            <li> This wig is very thick and looks beautiful on...not a cheap looking wig at all...very much a high quality item.</li>
            <li> very high quality well worth the money</li>
            <li> Barely fit my 3yr old.</li>
            <li> Hair is like coarse horse hair, Looked ok but braid was coming out</li>
            <li> Too big, top of hair looks nothing like pic.</li>
            <li> The picture looks much better than the actual wig</li>
            <li> The wig came in a clear plastic bag with no brand ( that&#x27;s not important to me if the quality and and fit are good).</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like the picture but wig barely fit my 4 year old correctly</li>
            <li> It barely fit my 6yr old daughter.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> and then my Sister-In-Law put the wig on my 3 year old nephew and it fit him</li>
            <li> and it only covered the top of her head.  </li>
            <li> The braid is extra long, so it looks great coming around the shoulder.  </li>
            <li> Need more of a snug fitting cap since the wig is small.</li>
            <li> This is the back-up Elsa wig I ordered because I wasn&#x27;t sure the first 1 that I ordered would get to me in time for my convention next week.  </li>
            <li> They look so real t like Elisa yea!</li>
            <li> And the front was not very well styled, so we kind of had to work with it a bit.</li>
            <li> In fact, it didn&#x27;t even fit on my 6 month old baby&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> so it definitely took more that 10-14 business days...</li>
            <li> Everyone knew exactly who I was at my Halloween party.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was happy that the bangs were at least styled, though when I put it on the style was not correct.</li>
            <li> The description says women&#x27;s wig but this barely fit my 9 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> It also cost more to return than the actual wig</li>
            <li> First of all, it came protectef with netting and plastic</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll know better</li>
            <li> Heavy and good quality for the price.  </li>
            <li> thick and full - good quality</li>
            <li> It came pretty decently and when I took it out of the package and hair net it was in great brushed condition.</li>
            <li> I have ordered many wigs in the past and have never seen one with so many large bald areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You need to be a stylist to get it to look like the picture because the bangs and top of wig just lay flat.</li>
            <li> With the pull tabs inside, was able to easily adjust to fit her small three-year old head.</li>
            <li> It arrived fast the top of the hair is just short</li>
            <li> The braid in the back of the wig was nice but the top of the wig was a mess.  </li>
            <li> Sizing was made for a small child which in my case was good for granddaughter.</li>
            <li> I got this dress for my daughter she loved it so much she started crying!</li>
            <li> It did not fall off the wig but it certainly did not look like the picture.</li>
            <li> It certainly didn&#x27;t look like on the mannequin.</li>
            <li> It will certainly work for what I need.  </li>
            <li> This hair had a great resemblance to Elsa; however it was very hard for my 6 year&lt;br /&gt;Old to keep it on her head.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Seems a little snug ,but with hair pins it should fit my 4 year old just fine!</li>
            <li> It might fit a normal sized 12 year old, but not anyone older than that.</li>
            <li> The wig was much more than I expected, it has given my daughter much pleasure.</li>
            <li> Fast arrival, very well constructed.</li>
            <li> So my daughter didn&#x27;t get much use out of it given it</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves this wig.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Quality is better than expected.</li>
            <li> yr olds that Elsa is real.</li>
            <li> The shortest top  layer is not curled or styled as pictured and since it is synthetic there is not much you can do with it.  </li>
            <li> but I think that makes it very durable.</li>
            <li> not a white wig and doesn&#x27;t fit well doesn&#x27;t look like the Elsa hair in the movie.</li>
            <li> This is the wig to buy if your toddler wants to be Elsa and needs a wig - otherwise go to a costume shop.  </li>
            <li> After taking it to a salon to get some help it turns out that to get the wig to fit properly, you HAVE to attach the elastic bands together</li>
            <li> I do suggest buying a real wig cap as the one that comes with</li>
            <li> The adjustment piece on the back of the wig also did not help to secure the wig to the head.  </li>
            <li> in terms of weight - may be too much for a child under 6</li>
            <li> It looks just like in the picture which I was happy about, was not happy with the shipping since I bought it on 9/25/14 to use for Halloween and it did not arrive until 11/4/14</li>
            <li> this is a quality wig, can not believe how real it is...highly recommend it</li>
            <li> It is kind of heavy</li>
            <li> Not bad for a costume for a young girl or an adult.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s probably fine if you&#x27;re not too particular, but my daughter is, so this was pretty much money down the drain.</li>
            <li> Also it is more a yellow blonde</li>
            <li> Wig is made decently, however, the seller ships from China and don&#x27;t plan on getting your wig for 1-2 months or not at all...</li>
            <li> didnt fit my five year old who has a bigger than avg head.</li>
            <li> On the plus side: it arrived quickly, had an extra bracelet in it, and the return was no-hassle.</li>
            <li> Another classic case of you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> nice wig but too heavy for 9 year old</li>
            <li> LIKE REAL HAIR, VERY SOFT...</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like Elsa&#x27;s hair, but in live action setting.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> It is highly adjustable and looks like the hair in the movie.  </li>
            <li> Being considered a cosplay wig, we had high expectations.  </li>
            <li> With a little playing around with and hairspray it came out ok but not like the picture.....</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not going to get a better wig for so little money.  </li>
            <li> The Disney one was just too small for her head - which is interesting because it&#x27;s meant for kids and my daughter&#x27;s head isn&#x27;t abnormally large or anything.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very high quality and looks natural.</li>
            <li> The hair on the wig felt too much like plastic and wasn&#x27;t soft at all.</li>
            <li> and I have a normal sized head.  </li>
            <li> Ok, when I first got this wig I rated it 2 stars, thinking it was way to small for my 4 year old granddaughter&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li> Ot seems to not fit the top of my daughter&#x27;s head</li>
            <li> This is a lovely wig, but it is much too small even for a first-grader.</li>
            <li> Now, it is true this wig does not fit for an adultÂ´s head or at least for an adult with a big head, my daughter is 4 years old and the wig is perfect for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> When I received the wig, the first thing I noticed is that the color was slightly off, it was more yellow than the platinum shown in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only reason gave it an extra star is because it was cheap.</li>
            <li> Pretty but barely fit her small head</li>
            <li> Great quality but a little heavy for our 5 year old&#x27;s head when she went as Elsa for Halloween.</li>
            <li> Glad we ordered a second as back up from a different seller.</li>
            <li> Itchy, small and I&#x27;ll fitting.</li>
            <li> BY FAR!</li>
            <li> Too small for my 7 year old Daughter, also very weighted to the back pulling it back exposing a good 2 inches of hairline.</li>
            <li> This was much too small to fit on my 6 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> Also there were no instructions on how to fit the wig tightly on the head just two flimsy hooks attached to the inside of the wig.  </li>
            <li> The wig might have been functional - if it was large enough to cover my daughter&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> Wig was a little chlaaenfing because rhe front pieces of hair fall free and in face of child..</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t fit me, not even a little bit.</li>
            <li> ok, abit hard to put on</li>
            <li> it was cheap, but not very cute.</li>
            <li> but my six year old loves it</li>
            <li> Looks like an adult size.</li>
            <li> It still shows front part of hair on my 12 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as part of a Halloween costume for my 3-year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> It fits perfectly to an adult head &amp; has hooks to adjust for children.</li>
            <li> I did not realize item ships directly from China</li>
            <li> However, I had a 6-year old wearing it, so it still wasn&#x27;t quite snug.</li>
            <li> This is not for adult heads.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT AN ADULT&#x27;S WIG.  </li>
            <li> I got this for Halloween for my 6yr old daughter.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who is petite and 14 years old.  </li>
            <li> The wigs did not stay on the child&#x27;s head nor would it stay on an adult head.  </li>
            <li> i even took this wig to a professional cosmologist to see if i could adjust it somewhat</li>
            <li> Not for a 4 year old.</li>
            <li> My four year old uses it during play</li>
            <li> Thought I could use it on my four year old as Elsa, but Im just gonna try and resale it</li>
            <li> Not for an adult head.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 5 year old to wear with her Frozen Elsa costume.  </li>
            <li> This wig was way too small-I ordered it for my 7 year old as part of her Halloween costume</li>
            <li> Fun for Halloween, but it was barely big enough for my five-year-old.</li>
            <li> Product looked great and fast shippingvibtook off a star due to sizing its a women&#x27;s wig but it was too small for my 6 year old daughter in which is your average size for her age</li>
            <li> I made it work really well, by cutting slits in the mesh to make it stretch larger for an adult head, by cutting more short on the top and using hairspray to make the top full, and</li>
            <li> Have no complaints - had to shape it a little bit with some bobby pins but you usually have to do this with every wig - good product</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed because the wig is really nicely made, but I could not make the thing fit</li>
            <li> it is much to small, my daughter who is 7 cannot fit it.  </li>
            <li> It barely fits my 3 year old.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my daughter and it was extremely small and didn&#x27;t fit a child&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit like the picture :/</li>
            <li> Really funny, but not very functional.</li>
            <li> great was a little thin</li>
            <li> Very hard to keep on head- definitely better in the pictures-</li>
            <li> Hard to fit.</li>
            <li> I was actually quite surprised when I had received the wig.</li>
            <li> Straight out of the package, it looked like the hair had had a rough night of partying.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my 7 year old (who also has a tiny head) and you could see about an inch of her hairline all the way around her head.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 5 year old and it was slightly big, but had an adjustable band inside, so it worked!</li>
            <li> Very very small won&#x27;t really fit anyone</li>
            <li> I would not wear it daily nor would I purchase an $11 wig that I expected to have that much quality.  </li>
            <li> First the color was wrong, it is more yellow than white, second, it didn&#x27;t come braided and third, the wisps in the front aren&#x27;t enough to try and attempt a copy.</li>
            <li> However it does fit alittle weirdly and alittle small but with a hair net I was able to make it work.</li>
            <li> Kids are notoriously picky, but my daughter didn&#x27;t complain about it being hot, itchy or heavy... actually, not a single peep about it.</li>
            <li> has some crazy long bangs that kind of fall down in the face, just doesn&#x27;t look right.  </li>
            <li> My hair is not long enough to dye so this worked well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really hold the hair in tight to the head.</li>
            <li> It was well made but extremely small, I&#x27;m not sure how it&#x27;s supposed to fit an adult.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter is only 5 years old and even when I pin it down to her hair, it pops up in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> Adult size was too SMALL for 8 yr old daughter&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> She has dark brown hair, hence needing the wig, but the wig did not cover her natural hair line at all.  </li>
            <li> but I made it work by flat ironing on its lowest level.</li>
            <li> After some bobby pins got it to stay on long enough to trick or treat around block.</li>
            <li> DID NOT FIT on my 6 year old head!</li>
            <li> This does not fit an adult head!</li>
            <li> I did take it out of package and it was flat!!</li>
            <li> Very very cheap and disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I completely recommend it for any little Elsa lover.</li>
            <li> It is too small for an adult and there are short pieces in the front that stick out.  </li>
            <li> It is adult size and does adjust for smaller heads, but will tend to fall off of small children.</li>
            <li> so there is a long wait for it to arrive.</li>
            <li> NOT ADULT</li>
            <li> but it does not fit an adult head by any means.  </li>
            <li> The wig we received did not fit my 10 year old.</li>
            <li> There was nothing to help keep the front of the wig from slipping back.  </li>
            <li> Wig will not fit an adult.</li>
            <li> but it is a little much for a little girl</li>
            <li> too small for an adult head!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  to small for an adult!</li>
            <li> She has a larger head than other children.</li>
            <li> it was to small for my 4 year old daughters head and looked nothing like the picture.....</li>
            <li> Too small for an eight year old head.</li>
            <li> To small,  not even for my 8 year old daughter</li>
            <li> Way too small for a 7 yr old.  </li>
            <li> and now I am going to have to deal with eating the $14 because it&#x27;s just not worth my energy to send it back.</li>
            <li> To small for my 9 year old</li>
            <li> I was reluctant because some reviews said it was too small for an adult</li>
            <li> It was to small for an adult</li>
            <li> This just barely fits, and the only issue is that the braid is heavy and does pull it down, but we just adjust it and keep on going.  </li>
            <li> This did not nearly fit my 4 year old daughter&#x27;s head who is average size.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I had was that it was a mess after being used on Halloween.</li>
            <li> She wore it trick or treating, being careful with it and by the time we got home, the braid was frizzy and coming loose.  </li>
            <li> and I cannot find an Elsa wig anywhere because it seems like only little girls are going as Elsa.  </li>
            <li> It was a little big</li>
            <li> It looked like the picture, just a little smaller than I had hoped</li>
            <li> Not enough hair to fluff and cover the wig netting in the front and little hairs in front looked fried/heat burnt.</li>
            <li> My daughter (13 years old, average size head) said that this wig was too small for her.</li>
            <li> Faster shipping then expected as well.</li>
            <li> This wig is so back heavy that we couldn&#x27;t get it to stay in place.</li>
            <li> Braid is very loosely woven and is beginning to come apart.  </li>
            <li> That was expected.</li>
            <li> The wig does require some styling, but that should be expected after being shipped.  </li>
            <li> Wig was nicer than I expected.</li>
            <li> Bad fit for 6 year old, too small.</li>
            <li> Very small for adult head</li>
            <li> Very small for 7 year old.</li>
            <li> I also ordered one for my 6 year old that of course looked ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> So small it did not fit my six year old for her Halloween costume.</li>
            <li> The heavy braid weighed down the back and we had to keep adjusting the front of the wig, even with it pinned.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend and will probably search for other wigs to replace this one.</li>
            <li> she wears it all the time due to</li>
            <li> The style was not exact, The hair also did not stay in place well.</li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed. :)</li>
            <li> not nearly as pretty as some of the elsa wigs I have seen.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy and my 6 year old had a hard time wearing it for Halloween but other than that she still plays with it in her dress up bin.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t really that bad for the price and a six year old&#x27;s Elsa Halloween costume.  </li>
            <li> The hair were so messy with short pieces sticking up, the fit were terrible, it doesn&#x27;t cover all the hair of my 6 yrs old.</li>
            <li> Not as described color not right</li>
            <li> No way this fits an average size child&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter&#x27;s head is average in size, though I&#x27;m no phrenologist.</li>
            <li> She keeps tucking it up into the &amp;#34;coronation hair&amp;#34;, then flinging her crown and letting her hair down while singing &amp;#34;Let</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t even lay down on my face and you can see the mesh on the sides when I try to style it.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried based on some other reviews, but it does indeed look like the picture.</li>
            <li> This wig is very small and only fits children.  </li>
            <li> this is a terrible fit for a toddler or adult head.</li>
            <li> Taking in consideration that the delivery day was expecting almost for a month and half.</li>
            <li> The wig itself does not look like the image, and there is not really a true sort of widows peek in the wig.</li>
            <li> and she even styled it a little for me.</li>
            <li> Requires some combing and a little time to make it look correct.</li>
            <li> It is a little heavy for a child</li>
            <li> a little, 6 year old daughter found it too uncomfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> Had a lot of trouble with it.</li>
            <li> Kids were crying that they wanted to get a picture with our &amp;#34;Elsa&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li> not comfortable and looks awfull</li>
            <li> The braid is messy and fuzzy.  </li>
            <li> Does not fit the head well.  </li>
            <li> With a few hair pins, the problem was solved.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time any money on this.</li>
            <li> Did not fit head.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see why people said it does not fit well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Just in time for her birthday party a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to take quite a few bobby pins to create the style from Frozen.</li>
            <li> so I totally wasted my money</li>
            <li> It might be too heavy</li>
            <li> I expected heavy, but this was ridiculous.</li>
            <li> It did not come with a wig cap, but a REALLY BAD (and slightly more expensive) wig that I had ordered previously came with one</li>
            <li> The wig seems a little small.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; for a little girl!</li>
            <li> It is small, so it is obviously for a child, but we had a very hard time getting it stay on my niece&#x27;s head!</li>
            <li> We had to style it very little to get the look we wanted.</li>
            <li> She tried it on but it was too heavy on the head and hard to keep from falling off.  </li>
            <li> I was worried about reading all the bad reviews but the wig look just like the one in picture can&#x27;t wait to wear it, fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> This item was too small for my child.  </li>
            <li> Runs really small.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for my daughter&#x27;s ELSA costume for our trip to Disney World this past September.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what that says about the size of her head, but she loves it.</li>
            <li> too small</li>
            <li> Too small, the wig barley fits.</li>
            <li> My daughters have been begging me for a Frozen Elsa wig to wear with their costume but when these arrived, they were both way too small.  </li>
            <li> The wig is too small and looks nothing like in the picture.  </li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> it was way to small for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, let me say that this wig is INCREDIBLY SMALL.</li>
            <li> The wig itself is too small for my head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The picture is misleading, and I am not pleased with the quality of this wig.</li>
            <li> Kinda small.</li>
            <li> On my 4 year old it is still awkward.</li>
            <li> WAY too small and doesn&#x27;t look anything like the picture.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I got mine because I&#x27;m a young adult woman who is going as Elsa for Halloween this year</li>
            <li> Also note, the company uses a translator to respond to emails and it&#x27;s not a very good one...</li>
            <li> but the material is a little weak.</li>
            <li> It did not fit my 7 year old :(</li>
            <li> and it was hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t stay on, hard to work, just a wast of my money.</li>
            <li> but we still had a hard time with it falling off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to put it on.</li>
            <li> The bangs are a bit funky and hard to style</li>
            <li> This fit horribly on both of my daughters&#x27; heads (age5 and 7).</li>
            <li> It is a cheap, horrible kidsplay wig, and not what is being shown in this picture at all.</li>
            <li> But delivery is too late.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as nice as advertised in the picture...</li>
            <li> but I got it to late</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such an awkward wig</li>
            <li> but cutting some short in front of each ear to hide where the hairlines on the side.  </li>
            <li> It is just like the picture, I was worried due to some comments after ordering but they were wrong</li>
            <li> WHEN IT COMES FROM CHINA THESE PEOPLE HAVE VERY SMALL HEADS</li>
            <li> It is very small.</li>
            <li> and it is very small.  </li>
            <li> but this one is not a good one.</li>
            <li> The hair looks fake and is stiff to the touch.</li>
            <li> Horrible wig too small looks like a childs size when I choose adult looks nothing like the picture!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too small for a 10 year-old girl!!  </li>
            <li> SMH not happy</li>
            <li> This wig is terrible quality, but in all fairness, it doesn&#x27;t cost much either.  </li>
            <li> It says it is a women&#x27;s wig-which is completely false.</li>
            <li> it arrived flat and smushed in the bag, and is thin as crap, not at all styled in the way of the photo.</li>
            <li> the hair in the front is coming out and it just looks crazy my on daughter :/</li>
            <li> Got this for my 7 year old and when we both looked at the wig after we opened the package, we were both very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Looks fake.</li>
            <li> Wig is made weird.</li>
            <li> Really sad this didnt work.</li>
            <li> This was difficult to put on.</li>
            <li> However, it was difficult to keep it on her six-year-old head</li>
            <li> this fits really weird and hurts the head</li>
            <li> Very poorly made and practically unusable.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> She is absolutely obsessed with Elsa!</li>

            <li> My daughter cried when she looked in the mirror it was so bad.</li>
            <li> it looked that bad.  </li>
            <li> IÂ´ve been worried about the bad reviews of this wig, but now I have it and IÂ´m</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Looks great. Braid is perfect for Elsa</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at all. Looks different than the pic</li>
            <li> The color is not like the pic. It&#x27;s sent from China so you could imagine the quality. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> This item was too small for my child.  She couldn&#x27;t wear it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter&#x27;s Elsa costume looks just as pictured and also just like Elsa&#x27;s hair.  Faster shipping then expected as well.</li>
            <li> Runs really small. Barely fit my 3yr old.</li>
            <li> Hard to fit. Looks fake. Had a lot of trouble with it.</li>
            <li> Hair is like coarse horse hair, Looked ok but braid was coming out a little, 6 year old daughter found it too uncomfortable to wear. For the price it&#x27;s probably fine if you&#x27;re not too particular, but my daughter is, so this was pretty much money down the drain.</li>
            <li> Looks absolutely NOTHING like the picture!! VERY low quality, and it&#x27;s not white like the picture shows. It wouldn&#x27;t let me give this zero stars!</li>
            <li> I was actually quite surprised when I had received the wig. It came pretty decently and when I took it out of the package and hair net it was in great brushed condition. It was soft and not snarly, it was the right color and was braided nicely and looked just like the picture to me with alittle styling for the top part of the hair. However it does fit alittle weirdly and alittle small but with a hair net I was able to make it work. I&#x27;m pretty pleased</li>
            <li> Too big, top of hair looks nothing like pic. Wouldn&#x27;t stay on. Don&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> this is a terrible fit for a toddler or adult head. My daughter cried when she looked in the mirror it was so bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was a nice wig the only thing is it does not come styled like this. I did take it out of package and it was flat!! With a little playing around with and hairspray it came out ok but not like the picture..... Also it is more a yellow blonde not platinum  but my six year old loves it so I can&#x27;t complain for the price I was happy with it</li>
            <li> I have an issue with a gap of baldness on the front of this wig between the bangs and where the rest of the hair that is pulled into a back starts. However, I hairsprayed hair and eased it over it and it was hardly noticeable. I bought this wig for my daughter&#x27;s ELSA costume for our trip to Disney World this past September. There were hundreds of Elsa&#x27;s and Anna&#x27;s....but MINE turned heads everywhere because of this wig! Kids were crying that they wanted to get a picture with our &amp;#34;Elsa&amp;#34;....LOL&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a great frozen elsa wig, this one is it!!!!</li>
            <li> Wig is made decently, however, the seller ships from China and don&#x27;t plan on getting your wig for 1-2 months or not at all... Also note, the company uses a translator to respond to emails and it&#x27;s not a very good one... If you&#x27;ve got the 2 months to spare, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> didnt fit my five year old who has a bigger than avg head.</li>
            <li> Not bad for a costume for a young girl or an adult. I purchased for my 4 yr old grand-daughter and it&#x27;s better then the real Frozen wigs they sell at the Disney Store because it is adjustable. I would probably buy a costume wig from this dealer again.</li>
            <li> too small for an adult head!</li>
            <li> Fast arrival, very well constructed.</li>
            <li> Product looked great and fast shippingvibtook off a star due to sizing its a women&#x27;s wig but it was too small for my 6 year old daughter in which is your average size for her age I got a women&#x27;s assuming it would be just the right size since she does have a head full of hair but this wasn&#x27;t the case so 4 stars it is</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this wig. It says it&#x27;s adult, though it fits my 6 year old perfectly. I&#x27;m not sure what that says about the size of her head, but she loves it. She keeps tucking it up into the &amp;#34;coronation hair&amp;#34;, then flinging her crown and letting her hair down while singing &amp;#34;Let It Go&amp;#34;. If you thought your daughter couldn&#x27;t possibly sing any more Frozen songs, get her this wig, and you&#x27;ll see how wrong you were. Of course, if you buy this, she&#x27;s going to want the dress. You&#x27;ll then be in an &amp;#34;If You Give a Mouse a Cookie&amp;#34; sort of situation.  If she has the dress,  she&#x27;ll want the shoes, etc. So, good luck!</li>
            <li> HILARIOUS!  The amount of hair on this should be appropriate for an adult, but the cap and size of the wig is about newborn sized.  Really funny, but not very functional.</li>
            <li> PERFECT for my 10 year old daughter to wear for Halloween!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit great...bad quality.  not comfortable and looks awfull</li>
            <li> I am a satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like Elsa&#x27;s hair, but in live action setting. It&#x27;s too big for my 4-year-old, but the inner cap is somewhat adjustable in size. Still, fit me much better :)</li>
            <li> Wig was a little chlaaenfing because rhe front pieces of hair fall free and in face of child.. Luckily  child just went with it n so did we... Would not buy again</li>
            <li> Great for smaller kids, not so much adults.  Hair was melted at bottom tip of braid, not so good.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped on time, takes weeks to get it. No damages.&lt;br /&gt;Looks mostly like photo</li>
            <li> Have no complaints - had to shape it a little bit with some bobby pins but you usually have to do this with every wig - good product</li>
            <li> This wig is so back heavy that we couldn&#x27;t get it to stay in place. Bought it for my daughter to dress up as Elsa (daughter is 5) and she only wore it once. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Worked well with Elsa Costume.</li>
            <li> I was pretty impressed with the quality of the wig especially since it was really cheap.</li>
            <li> It was NOT big enough for my daughter&#x27;s head, but we made do.  She was only 8 when we used it too...</li>
            <li> I liked it. It was really nice, but it didn&#x27;t fit. too small</li>
            <li> Worked well with the tiara I also bought.</li>
            <li> I could not get this wig on my head! It was a mullet, so ugly!! Nothing like the picture.</li>
            <li> There is no shine to this hair at all.  The braid is messy and fuzzy.  Does not fit the head well.  Would not recommend and will probably search for other wigs to replace this one.</li>
            <li> This is a nice wig for the money. It is a little heavy for a child but my granddaughter likes it.</li>
            <li> My grandbaby looked adorable in this!  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> While the color was nice, the item was not. The wig itself does not look like the image, and there is not really a true sort of widows peek in the wig. The hair on the wig felt too much like plastic and wasn&#x27;t soft at all. Just don&#x27;t buy this wig.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a big head but this just kept sliding off and did not cover the front of head...</li>
            <li> This wig is part of a gift for my step daughter. She is absolutely obsessed with Elsa! It will go perfectly with the dress I am making her. It is very nice quality for the price, and looks exactly like Elsa&#x27;s hair. I can&#x27;t wait to see her face when she opens it on Easter. The shipping was super fast too, very pleased overall!</li>
            <li> We ordered this wig to go with an Elsa costume and it is perfect! Also we received it very quickly which we really appreciated! I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Wig does not stay in place. So my daughter didn&#x27;t get much use out of it given it moves a lot.</li>
            <li> Bad fit for 6 year old, too small.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and great price, but didn&#x27;t fit my 6 year old. Looks like an adult size.</li>
            <li> The wig seems a little small. It still shows front part of hair on my 12 year old daughter.  It says it&#x27;s adjustable, but doesn&#x27;t extend further then what I already did. Probably will be sending it back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing like the pictures! I am so upset. Got this for my 7 year old and when we both looked at the wig after we opened the package, we were both very disappointed. First the color was wrong, it is more yellow than white, second, it didn&#x27;t come braided and third, the wisps in the front aren&#x27;t enough to try and attempt a copy. Ugh.</li>
            <li> Was good for the money. It&#x27;s heavy and my 6 year old had a hard time wearing it for Halloween but other than that she still plays with it in her dress up bin.</li>
            <li> It is beautifully made, love the quality. It is just like the picture, I was worried due to some comments after ordering but they were wrong it is perfect for a 4 year old girl. My niece loves it she wears it all the time due to she is going thru chemo and has no hair at the time. The price is PERFECT!!!!  Delivery arrived 3 weeks earlier than stated which was AWESOME!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great shipping, nice quality.  No complaints</li>
            <li> This fit horribly on both of my daughters&#x27; heads (age5 and 7).</li>
            <li> The picture looks much better than the actual wig but I guess I got what I paid for. The way the widows peak was attached to the front causes it to stick up so it doesn&#x27;t even lay down on my face and you can see the mesh on the sides when I try to style it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as part of a Halloween costume for my 3-year old daughter.  The Disney one was just too small for her head - which is interesting because it&#x27;s meant for kids and my daughter&#x27;s head isn&#x27;t abnormally large or anything.  The quality and cleanliness were great.  The only problem I had was my daughter kept playing with the pony tail so the wig would ride back on her head.  With a few hair pins, the problem was solved.  She absolutely loves this wig.</li>
            <li> The item I received today looks NOTHING like the picture. It is a cheap, horrible kidsplay wig, and not what is being shown in this picture at all. it arrived flat and smushed in the bag, and is thin as crap, not at all styled in the way of the photo. I&#x27;d like my money back.</li>
            <li> The wig might have been functional - if it was large enough to cover my daughter&#x27;s head. It might fit a normal sized 12 year old, but not anyone older than that.</li>
            <li> Awesome wig!! Fast shipping</li>
            <li> This wig is the best I have ever tried. I have a very small head so the adjustable strap worked perfect for me. The hair is easy to manipulate and looks great.</li>
            <li> Not so great in terms of quality and fit but can get the job done.</li>
            <li> Totally disappointed. It took a while to come since it came from China. The wig came in a clear plastic bag with no brand ( that&#x27;s not important to me if the quality and and fit are good). The hair were so messy with short pieces sticking up, the fit were terrible, it doesn&#x27;t cover all the hair of my 6 yrs old. I&#x27;ve bought other kind of wig and they all fit fine but this one is not a good one. Don&#x27;t waste your time any money on this.</li>
            <li> Good quality for price! Very fast</li>
            <li> Quality is better than expected. But delivery is too late.</li>
            <li> I was worried about reading all the bad reviews but the wig look just like the one in picture can&#x27;t wait to wear it, fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> We purchased 2 of these by accident. Both arrived eventually and before promised but it did take some time (about 3 weeks). When we put them on it just did not feel right. The wig was barely able to stay on and the hair came out of place. It did not fall off the wig but it certainly did not look like the picture. The pony tail stayed in place but that was about all.</li>
            <li> Too small, the wig barley fits.</li>
            <li> Did not fit head. But made it work</li>
            <li> The product came very quickly and was just like the picture.  It is small, so it is obviously for a child, but we had a very hard time getting it stay on my niece&#x27;s head!</li>
            <li> it is much to small, my daughter who is 7 cannot fit it.  maybe as the picture shows, it is more for a doll?</li>
            <li> it was to small for my 4 year old daughters head and looked nothing like the picture.....she wore it for 10 min and it started coming unraveled.</li>
            <li> Good quality! It fits perfectly to an adult head &amp; has hooks to adjust for children. Really good quality! It match perfectly with orihinal character hairstyle!!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s great! Fits perfectly!</li>
            <li> Needs a bit of styling once it comes, but it convinced a bunch of 4-5 yr olds that Elsa is real.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, fast delivery</li>
            <li> It was nice for the price.  I keep the wig on my top shelf in my closet.  My daughter would want to wear it all the time and I can tell that it would knot up easily. But it was a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like the picture but wig barely fit my 4 year old correctly</li>
            <li> Too small for an eight year old head.</li>
            <li> My daughter (13 years old, average size head) said that this wig was too small for her.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit messy and doesn&#x27;t look like the real Elsa.  The bangs are a bit big and funny-looking.  It&#x27;s too small for a 10 year-old girl!!  Trust me!!!  On the plus side: it arrived quickly, had an extra bracelet in it, and the return was no-hassle.</li>
            <li> Wig does not look like picture which shows all pieces neatly tucked into braid.  The shortest top  layer is not curled or styled as pictured and since it is synthetic there is not much you can do with it.  Braid is very loosely woven and is beginning to come apart.  I did not realize item ships directly from China so there is a long wait for it to arrive.</li>
            <li> WHEN IT COMES FROM CHINA THESE PEOPLE HAVE VERY SMALL HEADS IT WAS FOR A CHILD SIZE HEAD NOT ADULT LIKE I ORDERED.</li>
            <li> The wig it&#x27;s not the one on the picture. It&#x27;s  to small for an adult! It barely fit my 6yr old daughter. It&#x27;s &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; for a little girl!</li>
            <li> It is a great wig, but by the time you go to wear it, all the short pieces come out of the wig.</li>
            <li> I picked out this wig to accompany  my daughter&#x27;s Elsa (Frozen) costume. It&#x27;s very high quality and looks natural. We&#x27;re used to the &amp;#34;throw-away&amp;#34; kind that normally come with costumes, so it&#x27;s tough for me to rate what a real wig should be like, but this one was just beautiful. It arrived in ready-to-wear condition and the straps to adjust size worked well. However, I had a 6-year old wearing it, so it still wasn&#x27;t quite snug. Despite that, it stayed on throughout a Halloween dance and for a night of trick-or-treating without any additional bobby pins or help.Kids are notoriously picky, but my daughter didn&#x27;t complain about it being hot, itchy or heavy... actually, not a single peep about it. She was thrilled and I&#x27;ve taken care to tuck the wig away for later use.</li>
            <li> looks great although I didn&#x27;t unwrap it because I am sending it to grandchild</li>
            <li> This works excellent for a Queen Elsa costume. I like it. My hair is not long enough to dye so this worked well.</li>
            <li> This wig is very small and only fits children.  This is not for adult heads.  The color of the hair is lovely.</li>
            <li> great was a little thin but i can work with it</li>
            <li> As described  Perfect transaction A++++++++++</li>
            <li> Alot better than the Disney brand</li>
            <li> Very very small won&#x27;t really fit anyone</li>
            <li> My daughters have been begging me for a Frozen Elsa wig to wear with their costume but when these arrived, they were both way too small.  I cannot imagine this fitting on anyone over 2 years old.  This did not nearly fit my 4 year old daughter&#x27;s head who is average size.  I also ordered one for my 6 year old that of course looked ridiculous.  I tried everything - stocking cap - pinning hair back - pony tai...everything.  No way this fits an average size child&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> This is perfect! Bought it for my 4 year old, fits her great. There are adjustable straps inside the wig to make it bigger if needed. It is kind of heavy but I think that makes it very durable.</li>
            <li> Horrible product!!!  Doesn&#x27;t look anything like the one on this page...hair is all over the place and squished from packaging- doesn&#x27;t look anything like Elsa if that&#x27;s what you are going for.  Very very cheap and disappointing.  Came from China and took over 3 weeks to get- dealing with this would be more of a hassle than the $12 I paid for it.  Don&#x27;t make same mistake!!!</li>
            <li> The wig is perfect. I&#x27;m so happy because I got it in just 2 weeks and half. Taking in consideration that the delivery day was expecting almost for a month and half. I don&#x27;t see why people said it does not fit well. My daughter is 5 years and the wig fits nicely. She was so happy as my self. Thank you so much for just a quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Fit my daughter great for her 7th birthday Frozen Party!!</li>
            <li> not a white wig and doesn&#x27;t fit well doesn&#x27;t look like the Elsa hair in the movie.</li>
            <li> Wig is made weird. Doesn&#x27;t exactly stay on your head quite right. I would return it if my daughter hadn&#x27;t opened it all the way</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!! LOOKS GREAT... FEELS LIKE REAL HAIR, VERY SOFT... IT IS JUST LIKE THE PICTURE. THANK YOU!!! I HAVE ONE EXCITED, HAPPY LITTLE GIRL!!!</li>
            <li> Not as described color not right</li>
            <li> It is too small for an adult and there are short pieces in the front that stick out.  Very poorly made and practically unusable.</li>
            <li> works perfect for Elsa!</li>
            <li> Terrible purchase!  The wig is too small and looks nothing like in the picture.  I was very disappointed when I got mine because I&#x27;m a young adult woman who is going as Elsa for Halloween this year and I cannot find an Elsa wig anywhere because it seems like only little girls are going as Elsa.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Well CRAYOLA. I searched and searched - read all the reviews and took a chance, since it could be here in 2 days. THIS IS NOT AN ADULT&#x27;S WIG.  Gorgeous wig for the price - and the thinning people mention is not really an issue - its just a wig without a skull cap but it does not fit an adult head by any means.  Fit perfect on my 3 yr old. This is the wig to buy if your toddler wants to be Elsa and needs a wig - otherwise go to a costume shop.  Really sad this didnt work. Giving it 3 stars because it is well made and quality hair used.</li>
            <li> perfect for my daughters bday party and gonna use it again for halloween</li>
            <li> Perfect for the price!</li>
            <li> To small,  not even for my 8 year old daughter</li>
            <li> It did not fit my 7 year old :(..  I&#x27;m not one to return, but it&#x27;s of no use to us.</li>
            <li> ok, abit hard to put on</li>
            <li> The wig we received did not fit my 10 year old. She has dark brown hair, hence needing the wig, but the wig did not cover her natural hair line at all.  We tried it on with a wig cap hoping that would help but it didn&#x27;t. Glad we ordered a second as back up from a different seller.</li>
            <li> It was prefect! Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> DID NOT FIT on my 6 year old head!</li>
            <li> The braid in the back of the wig was nice but the top of the wig was a mess.  No style at all.  No comparison to this picture at all.  She tried it on but it was too heavy on the head and hard to keep from falling off.  Also there were no instructions on how to fit the wig tightly on the head just two flimsy hooks attached to the inside of the wig.  Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> It was amazing! The hair quality was a bit low but I made it work by flat ironing on its lowest level. People say it dosent fit. I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s wrong with it! I&#x27;m 14 and it fits perfectly. I wear it with the wig an hat look and just with out it. I think it&#x27;s perfect. If it dosent for someone younger than me. They must have a big head..:/ besides the hair quality. It&#x27;s perfect</li>
            <li> The style was not exact, The hair also did not stay in place well. Otherwise it worked great with heating tools and stayed on well. However, for the most part it looked cheesy.</li>
            <li> I got this for Halloween for my 6yr old daughter. She has a larger head than other children. It was a little big but it was able to be tightened. The only problem I had was that it was a mess after being used on Halloween. That was expected.</li>
            <li> Ordered for 6 year olds birthday party. Fit fine with some adjustments, but more importantly looked great for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Very small for adult head</li>
            <li> Awesome! Great design and love the pulls inside to tighten it to the head</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t stay on, hard to work, just a wast of my money. I was highly disappointed. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who is petite and 14 years old.  the wig barely fit around her head and you could see her hair on the front.  I would recommend this wig for a child pre-teen and below.</li>
            <li> i ordered this wig so i can&#x27;t wear it for Halloween and it didn&#x27;t fit and then my Sister-In-Law put the wig on my 3 year old nephew and it fit him</li>
            <li> Itchy, small and I&#x27;ll fitting. It fit better on my 6 year old&#x27;s head and I have a normal sized head.  The seams of the wig also show in the front.  Horrible</li>
            <li> Best Elsa wig around!!!</li>
            <li> not nearly as pretty as some of the elsa wigs I have seen.  has some crazy long bangs that kind of fall down in the face, just doesn&#x27;t look right.  it was cheap, but not very cute.</li>
            <li> I love the wig it is full and the perfect color! Received 2 days with Prime. Seems a little snug ,but with hair pins it should fit my 4 year old just fine! Best Queen Elsa wig I have seen so far!</li>
            <li> IT WONT FIT ON AN ADULT! Luckily for us (and after reading all the others reviews), I was looking for something to fit my 4 year old. It barely fits, you can still see the hairline in the forehead, but it&#x27;s okay. She loves it. The color is nice, the braid is just as pictured, you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> Ok, when I first got this wig I rated it 2 stars, thinking it was way to small for my 4 year old granddaughter&#x27;s head.  I was really disappointed because the wig is really nicely made, but I could not make the thing fit and it only covered the top of her head.  Well, as it turned out...I had no idea what I was doing!  After taking it to a salon to get some help it turns out that to get the wig to fit properly, you HAVE to attach the elastic bands together that are at the back of the wig.  This is what makes the wig stay on the head.  Not only would it fit my granddaughter&#x27;s head nicely, it also fit mine as well.  The wig does require some styling, but that should be expected after being shipped.  The braid is extra long, so it looks great coming around the shoulder.  She is so excited for Halloween now that she will truly look like Elsa with her beautiful hair!  I do suggest buying a real wig cap as the one that comes with it is nothing but a hair net.  It doesn&#x27;t really hold the hair in tight to the head.</li>
            <li> received today. This was for Halloween. SMH not happy</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loves it but it is a little much for a little girl</li>
            <li> It looked like the picture, just a little smaller than I had hoped</li>
            <li> I got this dress for my daughter she loved it so much she started crying! The quality is great and it&#x27;s better then pictured. I completely recommend it for any little Elsa lover.</li>
            <li> The wig is nice but it doesn&#x27;t fit too well.  My granddaughter is only 5 years old and even when I pin it down to her hair, it pops up in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> Horrible wig too small looks like a childs size when I choose adult looks nothing like the picture!! Very cheap looking.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous and theatrical style quality.  This wig is very thick and looks beautiful on...not a cheap looking wig at all...very much a high quality item.</li>
            <li> For the money it was a great wig for Halloween!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t really that bad for the price and a six year old&#x27;s Elsa Halloween costume.  I would not wear it daily nor would I purchase an $11 wig that I expected to have that much quality.  It is much better than the Disney wig.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT LOOKS JUST LIKE QUEEN ELSA&#x27;S BEST HAIR IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD BY FAR!</li>
            <li> Too small for my 7 year old Daughter, also very weighted to the back pulling it back exposing a good 2 inches of hairline.</li>
            <li> This was difficult to put on. I had to use hair spray to keep the hair in place. It was pretty and got it for a great price but would not purchase again</li>
            <li> very high quality well worth the money</li>
            <li> #1 Elsa Wig to buy.  It is highly adjustable and looks like the hair in the movie.  It is a must have for any Frozen fans.</li>
            <li> The fitting is a bit strange, but it&#x27;s such a good quality hairpiece I had to give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I bought multiple wigs for my granddaughters. The wigs did not stay on the child&#x27;s head nor would it stay on an adult head.  There was nothing to help keep the front of the wig from slipping back.  The adjustment piece on the back of the wig also did not help to secure the wig to the head.  I was satisfied with the customer service provided by Amazon.</li>
            <li> This wig was very nice.  Heavy and good quality for the price.  It was not at all flimsy or cheap looking in any way.  Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> it was way to small for me. i even took this wig to a professional cosmologist to see if i could adjust it somewhat and she could not fix it</li>
            <li> Exceeded expectations.</li>
            <li> Being considered a cosplay wig, we had high expectations.  Adult size was too SMALL for 8 yr old daughter&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> this wig looked beautiful when I took it out! however, luckily it was for my 6 year old niece because I don&#x27;t think this thing would have fit my head! She&#x27;ll be wearing for halloween since she&#x27;s going to be Elsa. Loved that it came MUCH quicker than the estimate! Just in time for her birthday party a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> Way too small for a 7 yr old.  Disappointing. Braid is nice though if it just would have been bigger.</li>
            <li> This hair had a great resemblance to Elsa; however it was very hard for my 6 year&lt;br /&gt;Old to keep it on her head.&lt;br /&gt;It had this great tightening feature in the interior of it but we still had a hard time with it falling off.</li>
            <li> Great quality but a little heavy for our 5 year old&#x27;s head when she went as Elsa for Halloween. The heavy braid weighed down the back and we had to keep adjusting the front of the wig, even with it pinned. Still worked though and the daughter loved it.</li>
            <li> Wig will not fit an adult. It barely fits my 3 year old. The wig capit comes with is worthless, just buy another one. Need more of a snug fitting cap since the wig is small. The wig will serve its purpose for Halloween.</li>
            <li> Beautiful looks just like Elsa&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my daughter and it was extremely small and didn&#x27;t fit a child&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> The wig was in great shape I just couldn&#x27;t manage to make it fit right. It certainly didn&#x27;t look like on the mannequin.</li>
            <li> This is the back-up Elsa wig I ordered because I wasn&#x27;t sure the first 1 that I ordered would get to me in time for my convention next week.  My beautician helped me put it on and then put the hair ornaments that belonged to my grandmother in the wig and she even styled it a little for me.</li>
            <li> This does not fit an adult head!</li>
            <li> I loved this Item, Fast Shipping..</li>
            <li> I expected heavy, but this was ridiculous. And none of the hair stays in place. Straight out of the package, it looked like the hair had had a rough night of partying. I didn&#x27;t even bother wearing it, as there was no saving the style.</li>
            <li> thick and full - good quality&lt;br /&gt;heavy in terms of weight - may be too much for a child under 6</li>
            <li> I read through the reviews on this wig and went against my better judgment and ordered it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, let me say that this wig is INCREDIBLY SMALL. I have a rather tiny head and it didn&#x27;t fit me, not even a little bit. I tried it on my 7 year old (who also has a tiny head) and you could see about an inch of her hairline all the way around her head. It would maybe fit a premature baby. It&#x27;s that small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, people are not lying about the BALD SPOTS! I have ordered many wigs in the past and have never seen one with so many large bald areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T IGNORE THE REVIEWS! I did and now I am going to have to deal with eating the $14 because it&#x27;s just not worth my energy to send it back.</li>
            <li> did not stay on head, even with the wig cap</li>
            <li> Returned.  Very small for 7 year old.</li>
            <li> They look so real t like Elisa yea!</li>
            <li> It arrived fast the top of the hair is just short it&#x27;s not styled like the picture.  Looks nothing like the picture.  It&#x27;s hard to put it on. Ot seems to not fit the top of my daughter&#x27;s head it shows her hair line and slides right off.</li>
            <li> great wig for the price</li>
            <li> Another classic case of you get what you pay for. Not nearly as nice as advertised in the picture...even IF you could manage to style it. Not enough hair to fluff and cover the wig netting in the front and little hairs in front looked fried/heat burnt. It looks more like a colonial wig.</li>
            <li> My niece absolutely loved this!  She didn&#x27;t take it off all weekend!  Great price for a great piece!</li>
            <li> To small for my 9 year old but she still feels like Elsa wearing it.</li>
            <li> It is very small. It did not come with cap. Does not look like the picture.</li>
            <li> This is PERFECT for Elsa costume for Halloween. The quality is great, the color is perfect and I like that it has a longer braid unlike the child&#x27;s wig you see in stores.</li>
            <li> quick ship great product</li>
            <li> This is a lovely wig, but it is much too small even for a first-grader.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 5 yr old, it looked great out of package but kept slipping off. After some bobby pins got it to stay on long enough to trick or treat around block.</li>
            <li> It worked and my granddaughter loved it.</li>
            <li> This is a great wig. Wore it for Hallloween as Elsa. The bangs are a bit funky and hard to style</li>
            <li> Though this is a beautiful head piece, it is very heavy and my daughter could not keep it on.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 6 year olds Elsa costume and it is very small.  Even with the wig cap it barely fit and even then the wig cap showed in the front.  It was well made but extremely small, I&#x27;m not sure how it&#x27;s supposed to fit an adult.</li>
            <li> My daughter was well pleased with this wig to top off her Elsa costume for Halloween. However, it was difficult to keep it on her six-year-old head (I was finally able to to do a fairly good job with the help of some bobby pins. And the front was not very well styled, so we kind of had to work with it a bit.</li>
            <li> Excellent  quality!  Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I was reluctant because some reviews said it was too small for an adult but it fit perfect.</li>
            <li> Purchases this wig as part of my grand daughter&#x27;s Princess Elsa (Frozen) costume. With the pull tabs inside, was able to easily adjust to fit her small three-year old head. We had to style it very little to get the look we wanted.</li>
            <li> Pretty &amp; well-made wig that looks very much like Elsa&#x27;s from the popular Disney movie, Frozen. It is adult size and does adjust for smaller heads, but will tend to fall off of small children.</li>
            <li> This was much too small to fit on my 6 year old daughter. In fact, it didn&#x27;t even fit on my 6 month old baby&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> This wig fell apart as soon as i put it on and looks nothing like the picture.  A piece of junk that i wish i could return. Totally ruined my halloween costume, i didnt even wear it out it looked that bad.  My bf said i looked like george washington! Dont buy this product!</li>
            <li> Thanks it is nice but I got it to late will have to try to wear it next Halloween.</li>
            <li> It looks just like in the picture which I was happy about, was not happy with the shipping since I bought it on 9/25/14 to use for Halloween and it did not arrive until 11/4/14 so it definitely took more that 10-14 business days... Did not even use it..</li>
            <li> Amazing quality!! Matched my own hair color so I was able to pull it off very well. Everyone knew exactly who I was at my Halloween party.</li>
            <li> My little Elsa just loved it!</li>
            <li> ok so this is meant for a person with a shrunken head. that&#x27;s all i can say. that said, it did the trick for one night of laughs and silliness. but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> It was to small for an adult</li>
            <li> Requires some combing and a little time to make it look correct. However for the price it is an excellent value. Just do not expect it to be perfect out of the box.</li>
            <li> I am not at all pleased with this wig. I placed an order for three wigs, and this is the one I was most excited about, as I planned on dressing as Elsa for Halloween. When I received the wig, the first thing I noticed is that the color was slightly off, it was more yellow than the platinum shown in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy that the bangs were at least styled, though when I put it on the style was not correct. It&#x27;s going to take quite a few bobby pins to create the style from Frozen. The hair looks fake and is stiff to the touch. The wig itself is too small for my head. It&#x27;s not that I have a large head, as most other wigs fit fine. If I try to cover my hairline then the back of my hair pokes out, and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture is misleading, and I am not pleased with the quality of this wig.</li>
            <li> when I bought them they looked really nice and I guess they are ok, but when we went to use them they  did not stay in place even with the bobby pins.</li>
            <li> Kinda small. Doesn&#x27;t stay on well.</li>
            <li> great quality and fast shipping</li>
            <li> It keeps falling off on the smallest setting.</li>
            <li> GREAT WIG! TOTTALLY RECCOMEND IT!</li>
            <li> Pretty good quality and nicely crafted wig but the size is on the small side.  The description says women&#x27;s wig but this barely fit my 9 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> So small it did not fit my six year old for her Halloween costume. It also came in the day after Halloween even though I ordered it on October 3rd.  Does not look like the picture at all.  It also cost more to return than the actual wig so I totally wasted my money</li>
            <li> Not for a 4 year old. Too big</li>
            <li> Grand daughter loves the Disney Frozen wig to go with her Elsa outfit for dress up time - good quality - look almost real - she was so happy when she saw it - recommend</li>
            <li> Nice quality Elsa wig! I bought it for my 5 year old and it was slightly big, but had an adjustable band inside, so it worked!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 8 year-old granddaughter. So disappointed. It doesn&#x27;t fit. Not nearly enough cap to cover head- no matter how we arranged the hair. My granddaughter&#x27;s head is average in size, though I&#x27;m no phrenologist.</li>
            <li> Does not look like the picture. Hair is kind of crazy with short cut pieces sticking out. I did like the clasp to keep wig on though</li>
            <li> this fits really weird and hurts the head</li>
            <li> This wig fits my 4 year old daughter perfect, but as for an adult there is no way to make it fit.</li>
            <li> nice wig but too heavy for 9 year old playing Elsa from Frozen</li>
            <li> IÂ´ve been worried about the bad reviews of this wig, but now I have it and IÂ´m so satisfied, the quality for the price I paid is very acceptable, the issue is that I have to style it but I think is just fine for my daughter. Now, it is true this wig does not fit for an adultÂ´s head or at least for an adult with a big head, my daughter is 4 years old and the wig is perfect for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wigÂ´s color is not like the picture, but is similar so it works for my purpose which is dress my daughter up for Halloween, now if you are looking for a great great quality and a real ElsaÂ´s wig, I suggest to spend a little more and buy another wig, however as I said, for me is perfect!.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter LOVES it! Adjusts nicely and was in excellent condition upon arrival.</li>
            <li> Looks pretty at first, but gets messed up real quick when the kids get a hold of it.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings on this item. First of all, it came protectef with netting and plastic so it was in good shape being that it came from overseas. It had lots of &#x27;hair&#x27; so it wasn&#x27;t skimpy.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the deets: 1. Sizing was made for a small child which in my case was good for granddaughter. 2. You need to be a stylist to get it to look like the picture because the bangs and top of wig just lay flat. 3. Price for this toy/costume wig is good.</li>
            <li> The hair quality is really nice and I love the color and even the braid but if it would fit! It&#x27;s such an awkward wig and I can&#x27;t seem to get it to stay on properly.  I think it&#x27;s too small for a normal sized adult women&#x27;s head. On my 4 year old it is still awkward. It might be too heavy which is why it&#x27;s falling back. It&#x27;ll do for halloween.</li>
            <li> Fit well, was shipped nicely but do not like the top part of the wig.  My four year old uses it during play and she doesn&#x27;t seem to mind that it is a bit bushy on top.</li>
            <li> Nice but the material is a little weak.</li>
            <li> Very hard to keep on head- definitely better in the pictures- when you wear it in real life it looks more like George Washington or some member of parliament. Only reason gave it an extra star is because it was cheap. You get what you pay for. Next time I&#x27;ll know better</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t stay as nice as picture shows.  Thought I could use it on my four year old as Elsa, but Im just gonna try and resale it</li>
            <li> Fun for Halloween, but it was barely big enough for my five-year-old. Not for an adult head.</li>
            <li> WAY too small and doesn&#x27;t look anything like the picture.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 5 year old to wear with her Frozen Elsa costume.  Pretty but barely fit her small head and this is &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34;sized.  She wore it trick or treating, being careful with it and by the time we got home, the braid was frizzy and coming loose.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> this wig is cheaply made, if your looking for a good Elsa wig pay the extra money go with something else. you can see the wig cap through the wig also it looks like Elsa has bald spots all over the wig if quality is what your looking for then this wig is not it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own three other Elsa wigs, and many other wigs as I own a production company, so I have an idea of top quality wigs</li>
            <li> My kids loved the wig. They can&#x27;t wait until Halloween now.  It looks exactly as pictured and is pretty good quality.  Item arrived fairly quickly considering it came from China.</li>
            <li> For the price, a very good wig.  You&#x27;re not going to get a better wig for so little money.  It will certainly work for what I need.  I had no problems with fit, as it is adjustable.  I was a little worried based on some other reviews, but it does indeed look like the picture.</li>
            <li> Great deal. I am very pleased with the product and the service.</li>
            <li> ok, didn&#x27;t really cover all my wife&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> this is a quality wig, can not believe how real it is...highly recommend it</li>
            <li> The wig was much more than I expected, it has given my daughter much pleasure.</li>
            <li> Fits well and my daughter loved it !</li>
            <li> This wig was way too small-I ordered it for my 7 year old as part of her Halloween costume and it didn&#x27;t fit her head.  It says it is a women&#x27;s wig-which is completely false.</li>
            <li> is no like description</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit like the picture :/ the hair in the front is coming out and it just looks crazy my on daughter :/</li>
            <li> Wig was nicer than I expected. I bought it for my daughter for Halloween (since none of the child size wigs fit her head). This just barely fits, and the only issue is that the braid is heavy and does pull it down, but we just adjust it and keep on going.  The wig itself is very full and soft and I haven&#x27;t noticed any bald spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus of the hair net was great also, we&#x27;ll keep it for future wig-wearing occasions.</li>
            <li> This wig is terrible quality, but in all fairness, it doesn&#x27;t cost much either.  I made it work really well, by cutting slits in the mesh to make it stretch larger for an adult head, by cutting more short on the top and using hairspray to make the top full, and but cutting some short in front of each ear to hide where the hairlines on the side.  I rebraided it while it was on my daughter&#x27;s head and honestly, it looked pretty good when I was done.  Don&#x27;t expect to take it out of the package and put it on and like it.  And it is definitely gold, not white platinum as the picture shows.</li>
            <li> This wig was very surprisingly Spot on! The color is more blonde than platinum, but the style and quality was just perfect. I bought this for my 4yo daughter to wear for Halloween. It did not come with a wig cap, but a REALLY BAD (and slightly more expensive) wig that I had ordered previously came with one so it was no big deal. My daughter has been playing with the wig ever since her school party on 10/29, it was still in perfect shape for trick-or-treating, and she&#x27;s still wearing it when she puts her Elsa dress on. I can&#x27;t believe how this has held up. It is DEFINITELY worth the money and then some.</li>
            <li> It was nothing like the picture, but was fun!</li>
