            <li>Smells amazing and makes my hands so smooth.</li>
            <li>and I love their products.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed the smell and</li>
            <li>I wash my hands longer than most, and switch soaps whenever I find one on sale and had never had this happen to me before.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>The same website gives 2 out of 10 (lower the better) rating in terms of health and environmental concerns which makes it among the best in the category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We love this soap.  </li>
            <li>It has SAFE ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus it feels good to be doing right by the environment.</li>
            <li>Smells great, foams great, rinses off well and does not leave hands dried out.  </li>
            <li>I love that they make more environmentally friendly products.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry your hands out, leaves you smelling very nice!  </li>
            <li>I tried the lavendar wash and it has a nice fresh scent.</li>
            <li>they clean well, and I love this hand wash.  </li>
            <li>Great and calming smell - smells like real lavender freshly picked from the garden.</li>
            <li>Tried this out once, and the lavender smell is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>Natural, plant-derived, dermatologist-tested, hypoallergenic hand wash provide good lather with a pleasant natural fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I really like the smell, which is nice but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>This is a good size container, love all seventh gen products especially this soap.</li>
            <li>definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find this scent in stores, so I was excited to see it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Worth buying again!</li>
            <li>Totally worth just buying a 3 pack with the deal that you get!</li>
            <li>, you do not need to do a full pump of this soap to wash your hands.</li>
            <li>I loved this product until I used it 5-10 times per day for several weeks.  </li>
            <li>This smells amazing, works and is gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>They are cheaper and more natural if you choose the right ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this hand soap it is not to strong but is just enough to leave your hands smelling nice and also leaves them soft great for use in the winter months when your hands need that little bit of extra moister.</li>
            <li>But for most people, if you just use lotion occasionally, then it should not be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>it is a big bottle as most you get at the grocery store</li>
            <li>I found myself buying the cheap soaps at the grocery store but all natural soaps for everything else.  </li>
            <li>Price without a discount or coupon is a lot more than regular soaps</li>
            <li>one has a mild natural fragrance, and can be considered gentle to hands.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Gentle on hands.</li>
            <li>It lathers up really well&lt;</li>
            <li>I always used anti bacterial soaps before but as of late we are switching things up and for the better!</li>
            <li>However, I agree with many of the other reviewers that say that the only downside is that it is a bit drying.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a little on the strong side for me.</li>
            <li>If the price goes down to a more reasonable range, I will re-order it, if not I will look for other brands and/or vendors</li>
            <li>If you have really sensitive skin then it may be a tad too drying for you.</li>
            <li>I am used to 100 percent natural oils.  </li>
            <li>My hands feel clean and not at all dried out.</li>
            <li>deduct 1 star because it made my hands dry (which is usually the case with most hand washes I have used except dove or anything).</li>
            <li>The ingredients are mostly harmless with a few question marks like potassium sorbate, glceryl caprylate and sodium benzoate which were rated as slightly concerning at EWG (Environmental Working Group) website.</li>
            <li>Does not dry out your hands.</li>
            <li>only complaint is that it had been removed from the subscribe/save available products list and price has increased moderately.</li>
            <li>However, I went from having the hands of a 30 year old beforehand, to the hands of a 90 year old while using the product, back to the hands of a 30 year old a few weeks after throwing the soap out.  </li>

            <li> The bottle isn&#x27;t super ugly so if you plan on just leaving it in there it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> My hands became dry, shrivled, wrinkley, cracked, and finally bled.  </li>
            <li> but it does dry out hands</li>
            <li> I prefer low-odor products, and while the fragrance for this one is at least totally natural (5 stars!!)</li>
            <li> I also like the clear colored, not too thick consistency of the wash.</li>
            <li> I find that only half a pump gives me plenty of soap to wash my hands and cuts down on the drying factor on my hands because I am using less of it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t bother using any other soaps now.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed my hands drying out; maybe that&#x27;s because there&#x27;s only a small amount of the hand wash in the foaming soap dispenser we put it</li>
            <li> I bought these 3 pack soaps so that my son can use it in the daycare instead of the full of chemical ,plus artificial fragrance option</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way (half a pump is all I need to lather up my hands)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I like the lavender smell, and it&#x27;s not very strong or overpowering.  </li>
            <li> but I have found if u dilute it with a half water the dryness stops hope thats helpful</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is thick and moisturizing but at least has not caused any skin problems for me and my son so far.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, with three little boys....</li>
            <li> I have found that my hands are very dry lately</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a nice soap without all of the nasty stuff.  </li>
            <li> waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>
            <li> Just put a little in the bottom of the bottle and then fill the rest of the bottle up with water and voila!</li>
            <li> Not sure what else to say.</li>
            <li> Received it in just a few days even though it was during the holidays!</li>
            <li> I had purchased this 3 pack item for about $11 after the subscription and amazon prime discounts but now as of august 2014, I see it is no more discounted through subscribe and save</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a real heavy lavender smell on your hands.</li>
            <li> use it slowly and thus still have some reserves.</li>
            <li> thin</li>
            <li> I was not happy with it at all.  </li>
            <li> How silly!  </li>
            <li> but because it smells like a bunch of rotting crap or chemicals.</li>
            <li> Absolutely hated the scent.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is great! My wife keeps asking me to buy more...</li>
            <li> Great stuff - love the smell &amp; of course it does it&#x27;s job: cleaning your hands!  Plus it feels good to be doing right by the environment.</li>
            <li> Tried both kinds- Not so great (smell) for the price you would think it would smell better. Will not get again.</li>
            <li> Love the way this smells and cleanses the skin. Pricey but definitely worth it! I love how I can subscribe and save --a lot more cost effective than buying at the store.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is lovely.  The bottle is attractive.  Cleans hands well.  I like it. Thanks. Not sure what else to say.</li>
            <li> It cleans the hands well, but I was expecting the smell of it would be better. I also use the Lavender floral &amp; Mint dish soap, and I love the smell of that...but not the lavender hand soap.</li>
            <li> Add me to the list of people who are big fans of Seventh Generation products. I love that they make more environmentally friendly products. I tried the lavendar wash and it has a nice fresh scent. I also like the clear colored, not too thick consistency of the wash. It is not greasy and I find that it does a great job of washing our hands, including all sorts of messes on my toddler&#x27;s hands. However, I agree with many of the other reviewers that say that the only downside is that it is a bit drying. If you have really sensitive skin then it may be a tad too drying for you. But for most people, if you just use lotion occasionally, then it should not be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you do not need to do a full pump of this soap to wash your hands. I find that only half a pump gives me plenty of soap to wash my hands and cuts down on the drying factor on my hands because I am using less of it. Overall, I like the product and will continue to purchase this hand wash.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the smell at all, not because it smells like Lavender but because it smells like a bunch of rotting crap or chemicals. I&#x27;ll be giving this away to people I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Smells great and it&#x27;s a nice soap without all of the nasty stuff.  Love these products. I feel good about letting my kids use this soap too</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this hand soap it is not to strong but is just enough to leave your hands smelling nice and also leaves them soft great for use in the winter months when your hands need that little bit of extra moister.</li>
            <li> I prefer low-odor products, and while the fragrance for this one is at least totally natural (5 stars!!), it&#x27;s a little on the strong side for me. I adore that I can trust all the ingredients in here, though. Just wish they would get their unscented hand soap available for Subscribe &amp; Save here!</li>
            <li> You cant even smell the lavender.&lt;br /&gt;Very thin and it does not even suds up.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;Buy Bath and Body instead</li>
            <li> I always used anti bacterial soaps before but as of late we are switching things up and for the better! This is a great company and this hand wash is another fine item made by them. It doesn&#x27;t leave a real heavy lavender smell on your hands. Does not dry out your hands. The bottle isn&#x27;t super ugly so if you plan on just leaving it in there it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> Works and smells great. Tried this out once, and the lavender smell is pretty nice. I assume it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job when I use it...haven&#x27;t had any complaints from others using it so I like it.</li>
            <li> I like it - good smell, good rinsing, good foam and most importantly natural (environmental friendly).&lt;br /&gt;I deduct 1 star because it made my hands dry (which is usually the case with most hand washes I have used except dove or anything).</li>
            <li> The soap has great ewg ratings and works well but I don&#x27;t prefer the lavender smell. We use the citrus one.</li>
            <li> All my children and guests have commented on how great this smells.  And it is a great company and safe product.  Will buy again.  Lathers and washes hands great</li>
            <li> I am used to 100 percent natural oils.  This soap does not smell like the lavender I use every day.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell, which is nice but not overpowering. My hands feel clean and not at all dried out. Yep, I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this scent in stores, so I was excited to see it on Amazon. Smells amazing and makes my hands so smooth. Worth buying again!</li>
            <li> just got introduced to seventh generation and I love their products.  they clean well, and I love this hand wash.  it is a big bottle as most you get at the grocery store are 6-8 oz. and so it last longer.</li>
            <li> The best safest hand soap its wonderful cleans very well but it does dry out hands but I have found if u dilute it with a half water the dryness stops hope thats helpful</li>
            <li> This is a good size container, love all seventh gen products especially this soap. No chemicals is always a plus for our family</li>
            <li> I loved this product until I used it 5-10 times per day for several weeks.  I enjoyed the smell and the soap worked well.  However, I went from having the hands of a 30 year old beforehand, to the hands of a 90 year old while using the product, back to the hands of a 30 year old a few weeks after throwing the soap out.  My hands became dry, shrivled, wrinkley, cracked, and finally bled.  Using a moisturizer after each wash may have helped, but I have never used any except during the middle of winter. I wash my hands longer than most, and switch soaps whenever I find one on sale and had never had this happen to me before.</li>
            <li> I definitely like the soap and have a subscription for it. The smell is great. I have found that my hands are very dry lately and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s from the soap or because it&#x27;s the middle of winter.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and then decided to purchase my own as well as give them as gifts to others. I love this product. It is moisturizing and feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing, works and is gentle on my sensitive skin. I don&#x27;t bother using any other soaps now. Totally worth just buying a 3 pack with the deal that you get!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this hand wash in our foaming hand soap dispenser.  Just put a little in the bottom of the bottle and then fill the rest of the bottle up with water and voila! you have foaming hand wash.  I like the lavender smell, and it&#x27;s not very strong or overpowering.  I haven&#x27;t noticed my hands drying out; maybe that&#x27;s because there&#x27;s only a small amount of the hand wash in the foaming soap dispenser we put it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this on a coupon and subscribe and save so the 3 pack was a great deal.</li>
            <li> Natural, plant-derived, dermatologist-tested, hypoallergenic hand wash provide good lather with a pleasant natural fragrance.  Easy to use in tube and good value.</li>
            <li> The lavender scent is awesome.  It doesn&#x27;t dry your hands out, leaves you smelling very nice!  Received it in just a few days even though it was during the holidays!</li>
            <li> Absolutely hated the scent.</li>
            <li> Gentle on hands. Great and calming smell - smells like real lavender freshly picked from the garden. Produces some nice bubbles so I let my toddler use it for water play.</li>
            <li> I got my money back from Amazon for this product.  I was not happy with it at all.  It was the sam for the lotion.</li>
            <li> Smells great, foams great, rinses off well and does not leave hands dried out.  would buy again.  Good deal for you.</li>
            <li> I am generally not a big fan of hand wash type things and almost exclusively I use soap bars at home. They are cheaper and more natural if you choose the right ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there are times you don&#x27;t want to use soap bars, for example when you are traveling or like in my case at my son&#x27;s daycare. I bought these 3 pack soaps so that my son can use it in the daycare instead of the full of chemical ,plus artificial fragrance option the daycare offers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one has a mild natural fragrance, and can be considered gentle to hands. I don&#x27;t think it is thick and moisturizing but at least has not caused any skin problems for me and my son so far. The ingredients are mostly harmless with a few question marks like potassium sorbate, glceryl caprylate and sodium benzoate which were rated as slightly concerning at EWG (Environmental Working Group) website. The same website gives 2 out of 10 (lower the better) rating in terms of health and environmental concerns which makes it among the best in the category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it had been removed from the subscribe/save available products list and price has increased moderately. I had purchased this 3 pack item for about $11 after the subscription and amazon prime discounts but now as of august 2014, I see it is no more discounted through subscribe and save plus the regular price has increased to $19.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it slowly and thus still have some reserves. If the price goes down to a more reasonable range, I will re-order it, if not I will look for other brands and/or vendors</li>
            <li> We love this soap.  I found myself buying the cheap soaps at the grocery store but all natural soaps for everything else.  How silly!  Kids and adults wash their hands all the time.  Why have all those chemicals on their skin?  We have the hand wash on subscription so we never have to worry about running out of soap.  Let me tell you, with three little boys....that is a wonderful thing NOT to run out of.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Lavender scent is really nice&lt;br /&gt;- A little goes a long way (half a pump is all I need to lather up my hands)&lt;br /&gt;- It lathers up really well&lt;br /&gt;- It has SAFE ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Price without a discount or coupon is a lot more than regular soaps</li>
            <li> Has a nice lavender scent, but is not overpowering.  It lathers well and works in my Simplehuman dispenser, so it fits the bill for us.</li>
