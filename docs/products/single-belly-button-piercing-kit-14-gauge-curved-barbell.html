            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Everything in this picture came in the actual kit which I was very happy about.</li>

            <li>Shipped quickly and got here as estimated!</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>but I suggest buying another ring off bodycandy.com or another jewelry shop because the included ring is cheap.</li>
            <li>I imagine the use of this product is great, everything came as is, sterile and in proper packaging.</li>

            <li>Worked like it was supposed to, everything is good the needle is sharp and it is done.</li>
            <li>pads.i loved that it was sterilized and the needle was sharp.</li>
            <li>although I would have to say,  the piercing it came with was very cheap the ball kept coming off, had put in a different one.</li>
            <li>Id suggest buying a higher quality clamp than use the one in this</li>
            <li>Thanks to this kit!</li>
            <li>Everything was completely sterilized and clean.</li>
            <li>Worked great, pierced someone&#x27;s belly button yesterday, everything works, needles sharp, however the clamps were a bit of a pain to get enough skin in, we made it work though</li>
            <li>The needle is sharp so it was quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Came on time though haha</li>

            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping‚ò∫</li>
            <li>Got here before expected delivery, I used it top</li>

            <li>Totally recommend for anyone thinking of getting their belly button pierced but cannot go and get it professionally done :)</li>
            <li>Also be sure not to use the clamps too tightly</li>
            <li>Pierced anyway with no pain, but came to realize that the jewelry could not even fit in the hollow needle, so</li>
            <li>Missing so many items.</li>
            <li>Definitely buy this product comes with everything that is on the picture except the pen but is definitely worth it for the price</li>
            <li>worked really well, make sure to use the liberating gel on needle or else it will be hard to remove needle to be replaced by jewelry</li>
            <li>The barbell is really small and looks more like a barbell for your eyebrows, so I have to order a bell ring</li>
            <li>Everything was there and completely sterilized went write through too!</li>
            <li>Pierced my belly with no problem, needle was sharp so it was really quick.</li>

            <li>It was missing the blue paper layout,the pen, cleaner and book of piercing I was very excited to use it</li>
            <li>kit was overall decent for the price.</li>
            <li>Jewelry needs to be bigger size,  its very small other then that its good</li>
            <li>it was missing all the things but other than that i am satisfied.</li>
            <li>Needle is very sharp therefore no pain, and it came out straight!</li>

            <li> Needle was sharp so no pain, and clamps held very well.</li>
            <li> the ring was slightly smaller than expected considering the bar should be bigger for the possibility of swelling.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the negatives were not a huge deal and for the price its completely worth it.</li>
            <li> i didnt get the blue pad, marker, booklet, and the other cleaning stuff besides the alcohol</li>
            <li> Missing the belly ring, prep pads, and the blue Sheet!!</li>
            <li> mine came missing the gel, blue sheet, and the clamps.</li>
            <li> Came the day before expected.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the piercing pad, but the needle is sharp.</li>
            <li> Not worth your money or time ..</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying extra balls though the balls on the barbell come really small!</li>
            <li> The needle was so sharp I didn&#x27;t feel a thing!</li>
            <li> Reading the previous reviews had me nervous</li>
            <li> it was missing alot.</li>
            <li> it making it hard to push through.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> It came with everything i needed but the clamps were hard to get to stay in place</li>
            <li> but when I went to put the jwelery in it did not fit do to the small needle!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing to open the package and see that the clamps were broken and were not usable.  </li>
            <li> Everything was in the package, and nothing was broken.  </li>
            <li> so the jewelry had to PAINFULLY be wiggle through the area pierced.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s painful &amp; will leave a temporary scar.</li>
            <li> Came with everything but the earring so slightly disappointed,</li>
            <li> and when I did it disappointed me</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!!</li>

            <li> Highly recommend great product.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and got here as estimated! Everything worked great! Needle was sharp so no pain, and clamps held very well. I would highly recommend this! Love it. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Ive been wanting to pierce my belly button for a while now.&lt;br /&gt;This kit was overall decent for the price. The only things i had problems with were:&lt;br /&gt;1) the needle was slightly smaller than the ring so it didnt go inside it making it hard to push through.&lt;br /&gt;2) the clamps are pretty crummy and cheap. Id suggest buying a higher quality clamp than use the one in this set.&lt;br /&gt;3) not everything in the picture is included. Theres no marker, no piercing booklet and only 2 alcohol packets.&lt;br /&gt;4) the ring was slightly smaller than expected considering the bar should be bigger for the possibility of swelling.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the negatives were not a huge deal and for the price its completely worth it. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Missing so many items.</li>
            <li> Came with everything but the earring so slightly disappointed,</li>
            <li> Missing the belly ring, prep pads, and the blue Sheet!! Very disappointed!! Never buying from them again and I recommend every one does the same!! All I received were the gloves, needle, and  scissor type thing to hold the skin!!</li>

I had to take it out! Not worth your money or time ..</li>

            <li> It comes with a naval ring but I suggest buying another ring off bodycandy.com or another jewelry shop because the included ring is cheap. I bought one off bodycandy.com and used that instead of the one included in this. Overall; very good. I pierced it easily and the photo I attached is 2 minutes after I pierced it and put it in. It looks great and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>

            <li> Came with everything in the package and wasn&#x27;t damaged. Pierced my belly with no problem, needle was sharp so it was really quick.</li>
            <li> üòçFast Shipping‚ò∫ And Worked Great, Everything&#x27;s Here, Do It yourself Instead of paying $40-50 ,with This Kit, You Will Feel Confident About your Purchase!</li>
            <li> came before expected,also came with everything it says. although I would have to say,  the piercing it came with was very cheap the ball kept coming off, had put in a different one.</li>
            <li> was a really great buy üíòüíò love my new piercing</li>
            <li> Came before the delivery date! Worked perfect for piercing my own belly button! I would defiantly recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> I imagine the use of this product is great, everything came as is, sterile and in proper packaging. I got this for a friend who wanted her belly button pierced, but I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;s done it yet.</li>
            <li> Definitely buy this product comes with everything that is on the picture except the pen but is definitely worth it for the price</li>
            <li> The kit just arrived at my house and the kit doesn&#x27;t include the marker or the iodine. The barbell is really small and looks more like a barbell for your eyebrows, so I have to order a bell ring</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t a needle in my package?</li>
            <li> All stuff was not in the package</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all sterile, but the belly ring is a horseshoe ring. That&#x27;s fine though, because that ring can be used for your belly button piercing, so don&#x27;t be alarmed if you get one. It also didn&#x27;t come with the blue pad, but I don&#x27;t know what purpose it serves.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the piercing pad, but the needle is sharp.</li>
            <li> It came with everything i needed but the clamps were hard to get to stay in place</li>
            <li> Ordered this on Nov. 6 it came in Nov.9 such a good buy! All the parts are here. I&#x27;m very pleased with this buy üòä‚ò∫</li>
            <li> I like the fact tht it got here before my estimated date! It comes with everything you need including a marker to choose where you want it to go.</li>
            <li> Overall a very good buy!! Needle was not as sharp as i would have liked, but it got the job done!</li>
            <li> Love my new belly piercing!!! Thanks to this kit!</li>
            <li> Reading the previous reviews had me nervous but once the package got here and the worries and fears I had disappeared everything was included in the package and everything was sterile and I easily pierced my belly button and it looks great. Very happy</li>
            <li> It comes with everything it says it comes with and the thing i like most about it is its all sterile. Im 15 and have been wanting to pierce my belly button and now i finally can.</li>
            <li> Everything was there and completely sterilized went write through too!</li>
            <li> Got here before expected delivery, I used it top help my friend pierce his belly button. All items come sterile so I am confident it wont get infected unless he doesnt properly clean it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve fallen in love üòçüëå , Delivery was AMAZING also , it came alot earlier then the actual date.</li>
            <li> Really nice everything in bags and sterile :) only thing in the picture the barbell balls looks even same size but one end is actually bigger not a problem just thought i would say :)</li>
            <li> Have had my belly button done for 5 months know and never had any problemsüòä used this kit</li>
            <li> Ordered on the 28th, just came in today. Haven&#x27;t gotten the chance to use it yet, but it comes just like the picture. Tried out the clamps, they aren&#x27;t the best, but will work fine. Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time , everything was completely sterile so I&#x27;m not worried about my piercing getting infected . Also everything in the picture was in the package . Totally recommend for anyone thinking of getting their belly button pierced but cannot go and get it professionally done :)</li>
            <li> Loved it have my belly pierced. My bf did it. I thought it was gonna hurt but it was quick and easy!!</li>
            <li> Definitely buy this kit!! It came within five days of my order.  Everything was in the package, and nothing was broken.  The needle was so sharp I didn&#x27;t feel a thing! It also came in a sterile package so there is no way to get an infection or virus from it.  The navel stud is the same size as the needle, so instead of putting the barbel inside of the needle like it is traditionally done, I held them together and it worked perfectly.  The pain factor for this piercing can be compared to a bee sting. If you are nervous or unsure on how this might turn out because it is so cheap, DONT BE!!!! THIS KIT IS SOOOO AMAZING and should be valued at twenty dollars instead of three. The stud looks amazing and you will not regret it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great buy! I love how everhthing is sterile, and it delivered really fast! Needle is very sharp therefore no pain, and it came out straight! Great buy!</li>
            <li> mine came missing the gel, blue sheet, and the clamps. But I still managed to do my belly piercing. Came the day before expected.</li>
